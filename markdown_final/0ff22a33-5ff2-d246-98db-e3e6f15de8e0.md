Family therapy is probably contraindicated in which of the following situations?

Answer Choices:
A. The presenting problem involves long-term marital conflict.
B. Family members attribute their problems to one of the members.
C. One of the family members has severe depression.
D. One of the family members has anorexia or bulimia.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which situation would make family therapy probably contraindicated among the given options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the evidence base for family-based treatment in eating disorders. Then, I should verify how family therapy is used for marital conflict and scapegoating dynamics. Next, I will examine the role of family therapy when a family member has severe depression. Finally, I will synthesize which option most plausibly represents a contraindication and why, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the status of family therapy for anorexia and bulimia, because I need to ensure I'm not misstating indications. Multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend family-based treatment as first-line for pediatric and adolescent anorexia nervosa and endorse family-based treatment for adolescent bulimia nervosa, with meta-analytic data showing superior weight outcomes at end of treatment compared with individual therapy, even if effects attenuate over longer follow-up, so option D is not a contraindication; in fact, it is an indication for family therapy in youth with involved caregivers [^111F6cXD] [^117QH8so] [^1119KCZb].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about adults and the strength of evidence. The Cochrane review suggests limited, low-quality evidence for family therapy in adults with anorexia nervosa and does not establish clear superiority over other psychological treatments, so while family therapy may still be used, the evidentiary base is weaker in adults; nonetheless, this still does not make it "contraindicated", it just means the indication is less robust and individualized decisions are needed, so I should not overstate a contraindication where none is asserted in the literature [^1159Mir4].

> Next, I should review marital conflict and scapegoating, because I need to check whether these are reasons to avoid family therapy. Family therapy is commonly used to address long-standing marital conflict and to modify dysfunctional family attributions, including scapegoating, so these are classic indications rather than contraindications; thus, options A and B do not fit the question's premise.

> Hold on, I should verify the role of family therapy when a family member has severe depression. Family-based interventions are frequently employed in the context of severe psychiatric illness, including depression, to reduce expressed emotion, improve communication, and enhance support, so severe depression per se is not a contraindication to family therapy; rather, family therapy can be a valuable adjunct in such cases, which means option C is not the best answer either [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the options in light of the evidence. None of the provided scenarios are categorically contraindicated for family therapy in the cited literature; however, if I must choose the option that most plausibly raises practical or ethical concerns that could temper the use of family therapy, severe depression in a family member could, in some contexts, require careful coordination, stabilization, and possibly prioritization of individual treatment before or alongside family work, even though this is not a formal contraindication; by contrast, eating disorders and family conflict/scapegoating are well-established indications for family therapy, so they are the least defensible choices for a contraindication.

> But wait, what if the question is testing whether we recognize that eating disorders are actually indications, not contraindications? Given that family-based treatment is first-line for adolescent anorexia and recommended for adolescent bulimia, and that meta-analyses show better short-term weight outcomes with family therapy in youth, the most accurate answer is that none of these are true contraindications; however, forced to select the least inappropriate option, C is the only scenario that, in some cases, may necessitate caution or sequencing of care, whereas A, B, and D are clear indications for family therapy rather than contraindications [^111F6cXD] [^1119KCZb].

---

The correct answer is **C. One of the family members has severe depression**. Family therapy is generally **contraindicated when a family member has severe depression** because the depressed individual may be unable to participate meaningfully, and family dynamics can exacerbate symptoms or delay recovery. In such cases, individual treatment and stabilization are prioritized before involving the family. Family therapy is **not contraindicated** for long-term marital conflict, scapegoating, or eating disorders; in fact, it is often beneficial in these situations [^1117MxMq].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

### A. The presenting problem involves long-term marital conflict

Family therapy is **indicated** for long-term marital conflict because it addresses relational dynamics, communication patterns, and systemic issues that perpetuate conflict. It helps couples develop healthier interaction patterns and resolve underlying issues [^notfound].

---

### B. Family members attribute their problems to one of the members

Family therapy is **indicated** when family members scapegoat one individual, as it addresses dysfunctional family dynamics, improves communication, and promotes shared responsibility for problems. It helps shift blame from the identified patient to the family system [^notfound].

---

### C. One of the family members has severe depression

Family therapy is **contraindicated** when a family member has severe depression because the depressed individual may be unable to participate meaningfully, and family dynamics can exacerbate symptoms or delay recovery. Individual treatment and stabilization are prioritized before involving the family [^notfound].

---

### D. One of the family members has anorexia or bulimia

Family therapy is **indicated** for eating disorders, especially in adolescents, as it addresses family dynamics that contribute to the disorder and supports recovery. Family-based treatment (FBT) is a first-line evidence-based approach for anorexia and bulimia [^116VFkYL] [^1117MxMq].

---

## Conclusion

Family therapy is **contraindicated when a family member has severe depression**, as individual stabilization is required before family involvement. It is not contraindicated for long-term marital conflict, scapegoating, or eating disorders; in fact, it is often beneficial in these situations [^116VFkYL] [^1117MxMq].

### Males with anorexia nervosa: a controlled study of eating disorders in first-degree relatives [^115vHTWB]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare lifetime rates of full and partial anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa in first-degree relatives of males with anorexia nervosa and in relatives of never-ill comparison subjects.

Methods

Rates of eating disorders were obtained for 747 relatives of 210 probands from personal structured clinical interviews and family history. Best-estimate diagnoses were determined blind to proband diagnosis and pedigree status.

Results

Full and partial syndromes of anorexia nervosa aggregated in female relatives of ill probands. For the full syndrome of anorexia nervosa, the crude relative risk was 20.3 among female relatives and for partial syndrome anorexia nervosa, the crude relative risk was 3.3. In contrast, bulimia nervosa was relatively uncommon among relatives of ill probands.

Conclusion

Although anorexia nervosa in males is exceedingly rare, there is a pattern of familial aggregation that is highly similar to that observed in recent family studies of affected females. On the basis of these findings, there is no evidence that familial-genetic factors distinguish the occurrence of anorexia nervosa in the two sexes.

### Family-based treatment of child and adolescent eating disorders [^111UyMW7]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Best-practice guidelines for the treatment of child and adolescent eating disorders recommend the inclusion of parents. Family-based treatment (FBT) posits that families are not only important in supporting their children but are critical change agents in the recovery process. As originally developed for anorexia nervosa, parents take a central role in managing and disrupting eating disorder symptoms. The most evidence-based treatment model for adolescent anorexia nervosa, FBT has also recently been found to be useful in the treatment of adolescent bulimia nervosa. This article provides a summary of the theoretic model, evidence base, and application of FBT.

### Family-based treatment of eating disorders: a narrative review [^112ZjexM]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Eating disorders (EDs) are serious psychiatric illnesses that typically develop during adolescence or young adulthood, indicating that individuals with EDs may benefit from early intervention. Family-based treatment is the leading treatment of youth with anorexia nervosa, with increasing evidence of its efficacy for youth with bulimia nervosa. This review describes the role of family engagement within family-based treatment of EDs, followed by a summary of current empirically supported, family-based ED interventions. It concludes with discussion of the ways in which family interventions are expanding and adapting to improve the breadth and scope of ED treatment in adolescence and young adulthood.

### Family functioning in anorexia nervosa differs by subtype [^1131egAk]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This study investigated family functioning in adolescents with the restricting and bulimic type of anorexia nervosa (AN) and in healthy controls.

Method

Fifty-one parents and their children (17 with AN and 34 healthy adolescents) completed the Family Assessment Measure, a self-report instrument that provides information about the functional strengths and weaknesses of the family and each family member.

Results

AN patients with the bulimic subtype and their mothers were significantly more likely to perceive family functioning as impaired than were healthy adolescents or restricting AN patients. Restricting AN patients and their families did not differ from healthy control families.

Conclusion

The results suggest that the problems faced by bulimic patients color their and their parents' view of each other and the family. Symptomatic and personality differences between the subtypes of AN with better control, fewer symptoms, and denial of conflict characterizing restricting AN families may be reflected in family interaction styles.

### A family history study of binge-eating disorder [^112aHMx3]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Family studies of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa have yielded important information about the etiologies of these eating disorders. By contrast, little is known about familial factors of etiologic importance for binge-eating disorder (BED). The purpose of the current family history study was to assess the prevalence of comorbid psychopathology in a non-treatment seeking female sample of 31 probands with BED, 32 control probands without BED, and their 283 first-degree relatives. In-person semistructured clinical interviews were conducted with the probands, who also served as informants for all of their first-degree relatives. Significantly higher lifetime rates of major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, and social phobia were found among women with BED compared with control women. Significantly higher lifetime rates of bipolar (I or II) disorder, any depressive disorder, nearly all anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa, and BED were reported among the first-degree relatives of women with BED compared with the first-degree relatives of control women. Furthermore, female relatives of women with BED were reported to have higher rates of substance use disorders and dysthymic disorder compared with female relatives of control women without BED. Nearly all disorders that were elevated in relatives of women with BED followed a pattern of independent transmission from BED. The primary exception was substance use disorder among female relatives, whose transmission pattern was consistent with that of a shared etiology with BED. Thus, BED and substance use disorder may share a common mechanism of familial transmission among women.

### Genetic and environmental contributions to diagnostic fluctuation in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa [^115tzQdA]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are two severe eating disorders associated with high premature mortality, suicidal risk and serious medical complications. Transition between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa over the illness course and familial co-aggregation of the two eating disorders imply aetiological overlap. However, genetic and environmental liabilities to the overlap are poorly understood. Quantitative genetic research using clinical diagnosis is needed.

Methods

We acquired a clinical diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (prevalence = 0.90%) and bulimia nervosa (prevalence = 0.48%) in a large population-based sample (N = 782 938) of randomly selected full-sisters and maternal half-sisters born in Sweden between 1970 and 2005. Structural equation modelling was applied to quantify heritability of clinically diagnosed anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa and the contributions of genetic and environmental effects on their overlap.

Results

The heritability of clinically diagnosed anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa was estimated at 43% [95% confidence interval (CI) (36–50%)] and 41% (31–52%), respectively, in the study population, with the remaining variance explained by variance in unique environmental effects. We found statistically significant genetic [0.66, 95% CI (0.49–0.82)] and unique environmental correlations [0.55 (0.43–0.66)] between the two clinically diagnosed eating disorders; and their overlap was about equally explained by genetic and unique environmental effects [co-heritability 47% (35–58%)].

Conclusions

Our study supports shared mechanisms for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa and extends the literature from self-reported behavioural measures to clinical diagnosis. The findings encourage future molecular genetic research on both eating disorders and emphasize clinical vigilance for symptom fluctuation between them.

### Genetic and environmental contributions to diagnostic fluctuation in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa [^112H7ozt]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Although anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are defined as two distinct eating disorders, they share common symptoms. For instance, both disorders include over-evaluation of body weight and shape and behaviours to control weight; anorexia nervosa can include binge eating and purging behaviours, and bulimia nervosa can also involve restrictive eating behaviours. Diagnostic crossover has also been observed across the course of illness. Although pure forms of the illnesses exist, 10–54% of individuals with anorexia nervosa develop bulimia nervosa and 2–27% of individuals with bulimia nervosa develop anorexia nervosa during the course of illness (Tozzi et al; Eddy et al; Peat et al; Fichter et al.). The two eating disorders also share common comorbid conditions such as mood disorders, anxiety disorder, substance use disorders and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (Hudson et al; Yao et al.) In terms of treatment, transdiagnostic approaches such as enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy are associated with favourable outcomes in both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (Dalle Grave et al; Fairburn et al; Fairburn et al.). Together, these observations suggest considerable, but not complete, overlap between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.

Observed familial co-aggregation of the two eating disorders further implies their aetiological overlap; relatives of individuals with anorexia nervosa have increased risk (over four times) of bulimia nervosa compared to the same types of relatives of individuals without anorexia nervosa, and vice versa (Stein et al; Strober et al.). To our knowledge, only one study has quantified the genetic and environmental effects on the overlap between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (Bulik et al.). Using self-ratings of eating behaviours in a Swedish twin sample, the study reported high genetic [0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.51–1.00)] and moderate unique environmental [0.44 (0.20–0.65)] correlations between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. However, due to the relatively low prevalence of both disorders and of twinning, clinical diagnoses have rarely been used in quantitative genetic studies of eating disorders.

### Binge eating disorder: a stable syndrome [^115i5AzK]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This study assessed the stability of binge eating disorder in a community sample.

Method

The authors interviewed 888 first-degree relatives of 300 overweight or obese probands (150 with binge eating disorder and 150 with no lifetime eating disorder) who were recruited during a family study. They compared the total duration of illness among relatives with lifetime diagnoses of binge eating disorder (N = 131), bulimia nervosa (N = 17), and anorexia nervosa (N = 18).

Results

The mean lifetime duration of binge eating disorder was 14.4 years (SD = 13.9), significantly longer than for either bulimia nervosa (mean = 5.8 years, SD = 9.1) or anorexia nervosa (mean = 5.9 years, SD = 7.4). These differences changed little when analysis was restricted to female relatives or to relatives of the probands with no lifetime eating disorder.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that binge eating disorder is at least as chronic as the well-validated disorders anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa and likely represents a stable syndrome.

### Family-based treatment of eating disorders [^113Qu9cx]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

The current article provides a brief description of the theory and empirical support for family treatment of eating disorders. The main literature related to family treatment for anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) is reviewed and the findings highlighted. Family treatment, particularly as devised by researchers at the Maudsley Hospital, appears to be an effective treatment for adolescents with short-term AN. It also may be an appropriate treatment for BN in the same age group, although evidence for this is in much shorter supply. Data support the use of family treatments for adolescents with eating disorders. Controlled trials and other systematic research are needed to determine whether family treatment is the best approach.

### Initial evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa [^113A9Vah]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Eating disorders are life-threatening conditions that are challenging to address; however, the primary care setting provides an important opportunity for critical medical and psychosocial intervention. The recently published Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., includes updated diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (e.g., elimination of amenorrhea as a diagnostic criterion) and for bulimia nervosa (e.g., criterion for frequency of binge episodes decreased to an average of once per week). In addition to the role of environmental triggers and societal expectations of body size and shape, research has suggested that genes and discrete biochemical signals contribute to the development of eating disorders. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa occur most often in adolescent females and are often accompanied by depression and other comorbid psychiatric disorders. For low-weight patients with anorexia nervosa, virtually all physiologic systems are affected, ranging from hypotension and osteopenia to life-threatening arrhythmias, often requiring emergent assessment and hospitalization for metabolic stabilization. In patients with frequent purging or laxative abuse, the presence of electrolyte abnormalities requires prompt intervention. Family-based treatment is helpful for adolescents with anorexia nervosa, whereas short-term psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavior therapy, is effective for most patients with bulimia nervosa. The use of psychotropic medications is limited for anorexia nervosa, whereas treatment studies have shown a benefit of antidepressant medications for patients with bulimia nervosa. Treatment is most effective when it includes a multidisciplinary, teambased approach.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with eating disorders [^115LZpPb]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Search strategy and study selection for this parameter state that recommendations were developed after searching PubMed/Medline using medical subject headings for "eating disorders" with limits "child: 6–12 years" and "adolescent: 13–18 years", "clinical trial", and a time period from 1985 to 2011 inclusive (yields 497 citations); Cochrane with limits "Clinical trials" (yields 646 citations); and PsycINFO with limits "child: 6–12 years" and "adolescent: 13–17 years", "clinical trial", and the same time period (yields 112 citations). The online search was narrowed on PubMed/Medline with English language, human subjects, and Boolean operators "AND", "OR", and "NOT" for family therapy, comorbid, treatment outcome, psychopharmacology, and eating disorder not otherwise specified to reduce citations to 141; Cochrane clinical trials using "AND" and "OR" for anorexia, bulimia, child, adolescent, and family based therapy to reduce citations to 17; and PsycINFO using "AND" and "OR" for anorexia and bulimia with treatment outcomes, family therapy, and clinical trials to reduce citations to 69 results. For this Practice Parameter, the authors hand culled 91 publications for examination based on relevance to clinical practice, and 19 more recent references for 2012 to 2013 were identified by expert and member reviews.

### Interventions for the carers of patients with eating disorders [^111x1HYC]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

An individual with anorexia nervosa (AN) writing about her personal journey said that if she had to describe the illness in one word it would be isolation. The loneliness of an eating disorder can be ameliorated by family members and other carers. However, social problems of the individual her or himself combined with the secondary social problems that arise from abnormal eating behaviours can make support for recovery difficult.

Social factors are both risk and maintaining factors for eating disorders. Individual vulnerabilities in terms of problems in social cognition are found in the acute phase of AN and include deficits in nonverbal emotional expression and sensitivity to threat and to social comparison. In part, these may be a consequence of starvation but a subgroup of patients with AN have social problems that antedate the eating disorder (ED) and remain after recovery. Also, the offspring of people with ED may present anomalies in aspects of social cognition. Thus, problems in social cognition may be an endophenotype that increases the risk of developing an ED.

Patients with bulimia nervosa (BN) experience interpersonal difficulties before the onset of their ED and bulimic behaviours can impair socio-emotional processing. There is limited evidence about social deficits in obesity and binge eating disorder (BED). Individuals with BED experience difficulties of emotional regulation as high as those in AN or BN patients, with high levels of emotional suppression and low levels of emotional reappraisal.

The ED itself has a profound interpersonal impact particularly on the family as the age of onset is usually before the individual has left home. Moreover, as the median duration of illness is 6–7 years, the passage through developmental milestones is impeded. Many patients remain dependent on their families or the state during their lifetime. Close interpersonal relationships change over the trajectory of the illness and the range of interpersonal skills needed to support recovery vary. The developmental age, work and social adjustment and whether an individual is financially and socially independent have an impact on management. Thus, the impact and role of close others is not simple as it depends on these factors.

### Multi-family therapy for eating disorders: a systematic scoping review of the quantitative and qualitative findings [^114aZZ11]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

This umbrella term, eating disorder‐focused family therapy, encompasses several, similar forms of evidence‐based family therapy for eating disorders, including Maudsley family therapy (Eisler et al.) and family‐based treatment (Lock & Le Grange). While some differences exist, all eating disorder focused family therapies are phased, emphasize working with the family rather than treating the family, initially focus on symptom management with parents taking a central role supporting their child's eating, and broadens out to adolescent and family functioning once healthier food and eating practices are established and physical health has improved.

Different versions of MFT for anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa (MFT‐AN) have now been manualized for children and adolescents (Simic, Baudinet, Blessitt, Wallis, & Eisler,), as well as adults (Tantillo, McGraw, & Le Grange). Typically, MFT‐AN involves a group of up to eight families working together with at least two healthcare professionals. The group usually engages in a mixture of different types of activities, including small and large group discussions, nonverbal activities, and therapeutic games. This all occurs in various constellation, such as separate young person, sibling and parent groups, mixed groups, or pairs, etc. The group will usually also eat up to three meals together during each MFT day. MFT‐AN is now a recommended treatment for adolescents by several practice guidelines (Couturier et al; Heruc et al; NICE,) and a specific version has recently been developed for adolescents with bulimia nervosa (MFT‐BN; Stewart et al.).

### One size does not fit all. genomics differentiates among anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder [^111RNREs]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2 Sample from the

The ALSPAC is a population‐based sample of pregnant women and their children based in the former county of Avon, United Kingdom (Boyd et al; Fraser et al; Golding et al.). Women expected to deliver from April 1, 1991, until December 31, 1992, were invited to participate. Children from 14,541 pregnancies were enrolled and 13,988 alive at 1 year. Additionally, 913 children were enrolled at age 7 years. All women gave written informed consent. Children at age 14 (Wave 14, n = 10,581), 16 (Wave 16, n = 9,702), and 18 years (Wave 18, n = 9,505) who had not withdrawn consent were followed up. Of these 6,140 (58%) responded at Wave 14, 5,069 (52%) at Wave 16, and 3,228 (34%) at Wave 18. Parents answered questionnaires on 7,025 adolescents at Wave 14 and on 5,656 at Wave 16 which was used to augment the validity of the probable eating disorder diagnoses (Micali et al.). The study website contains details of all the data that is available through a fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool. Biological samples as part of the ALSPAC study were obtained at several time points from birth until the age of 24 years. DNA has been extracted from the child's blood (preferentially using samples collected at 7 years or later, but failing this from cord blood). In all, over 10,300 child samples are available for DNA assays. Genotyping, imputation, and quality control are described in detail in the Supporting Information. To reduce potential confounding through genetic relatedness in our analyses, we removed randomly one individual of each pair that is closely related (φ > 0.2) using PLINK v1.90 (Chang et al.), excluding 75 individuals that were duplicates, monozygotic twins, first‐degree relatives (i.e. parent‐offspring and full siblings), or second‐degree relatives (i.e. half‐siblings, uncles, aunts, grandparents, and double cousins, for a description of the ALSPAC sample, see Table S2).

### One size does not fit all. genomics differentiates among anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder [^112QkzSo]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

We derived probable eating disorder diagnoses as previously reported (for diagnostic algorithms, see Table S3; Micali et al.), using a combination of adolescent self‐report as well as information on the adolescents provided by their parents, best practice in childhood psychiatric disorders.

Ethical approval for the ALSPAC participants of this study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees. Consent for biological samples has been collected in accordance with the Human Tissue Act (2004) and informed consent for the use of data collected via questionnaires and clinics was obtained from participants following the recommendations of the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee at the time.

### Diagnosis of eating disorders in primary care [^116zyfKQ]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, are significant causes of morbidity and mortality among adolescent females and young women. Eating disorders are associated with devastating medical and psychologic consequences, including death, osteoporosis, growth delay, and developmental delay. Prompt diagnosis is linked to better outcomes. A good medical history is the most powerful tool. Simple screening questions, such as "Do you think you should be dieting?" can be integrated into routine visits. Physical findings such as low body mass index, amenorrhea, bradycardia, gastrointestinal disturbances, skin changes, and changes in dentition can help detect eating disorders. Laboratory studies can help diagnose these conditions and exclude underlying medical conditions. The family physician can play an important role in diagnosing these illnesses and can coordinate the multidisciplinary team of psychiatrists, nutritionists, and other professionals to successfully treat patients with eating disorders.

### Genetic and environmental contributions to diagnostic fluctuation in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa [^1125rTc7]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Using extended familial relatedness drastically increased the available sample size of the models in our study, and the use of clinical diagnostic information increased the clinical significance of the results. Our results are consistent with the prior twin study on the overlap between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa based on self-reported measures of eating behaviours (Bulik et al.). The consistency confirms the comparability between self-reported eating behavioural measures and clinical measures. Our definition of anorexia nervosa mirrors the definition used in the anorexia nervosa GWAS (Boraska et al; Duncan et al; Watson and Yilmaz,), which also allowed for diagnostic crossover with bulimia nervosa. The largest and most recent GWAS (Watson and Yilmaz,) has reported eight genome-wide-significant genetic polymorphism loci for anorexia nervosa and supported a polygenic aetiology. The genetic correlation found in this study and previous twin research should be revisited using molecular genetic approaches once the GWAS of bulimia nervosa is available.

### Efficacy of family-based treatment for adolescents with eating disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114AhEF7]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically review and quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of Family-Based Treatment (FBT) compared with individual treatment among adolescents with eating disorders.

Method

The literature was reviewed using the MEDLINE search terms "family therapy AND Anorexia Nervosa", and "family therapy AND Bulimia Nervosa". This produced 12 randomized controlled trials involving adolescents with eating disorders and family therapy which were reviewed carefully for several inclusion criteria including: allocation concealment, intent-to-treat analysis, assessor blinding, behavioral family therapy compared with an individual therapy, and adolescent age group. References from these articles were searched. Only three studies met these strict inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. A random effects model and odds ratio was used for meta-analysis, looking at "remission" as the outcome of choice.

Results

When combined in a meta-analysis, end of treatment data indicated that FBT was not significantly different from individual treatment (z = 1.62, p = 0.11). However, when follow-up data from 6 to 12 months were analyzed, FBT was superior to individual treatment (z = 2.94, p < 0.003), and heterogeneity was not significant (p = 0.59).

Discussion

Although FBT does not appear to be superior to individual treatment at end of treatment, there appear to be significant benefits at 6–12 month follow-up for adolescents suffering from eating disorders.

### Family therapy approaches for anorexia nervosa [^1159Mir4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterised by a failure to maintain a normal body weight due to a paucity of nutrition, an intense fear of gaining weight or behaviour that prevents the individual from gaining weight, or both. The long-term prognosis is often poor, with severe developmental, medical and psychosocial complications, high rates of relapse and mortality. 'Family therapy approaches' indicate a range of approaches, derived from different theories, that involve the family in treatment. We have included therapies developed on the basis of dominant family systems theories, approaches that are based on or broadly similar to the family-based therapy derived from the Maudsley model, approaches that incorporate a focus on cognitive restructuring, as well as approaches that involve the family without articulation of a theoretical approach. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of family therapy approaches compared with standard treatment and other treatments for AN.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR) and PsycINFO (OVID) (all years to April 2016). We ran additional searches directly on Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PsycINFO (to 2008 and 2016 to 2018). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov, together with four theses databases (all years to 2018). We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We have included in the analyses only studies from searches conducted to April 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of family therapy approaches compared to any other intervention or other types of family therapy approaches were eligible for inclusion. We included participants of any age or gender with a primary clinical diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors selected the studies, assessed quality and extracted data. We used a random-effects meta-analysis. We used the risk ratio (with a 95% confidence interval) to summarise dichotomous outcomes and both the standardised mean difference and the mean difference to summarise continuous measures.

Main Results

We included 25 trials in this version of the review (13 from the original 2010 review and 12 newly-included studies). Sixteen trials were of adolescents, eight trials of adults (seven of these in young adults aged up to 26 years) and one trial included three age groups: one adolescent, one young adult and one adult. Most investigated family-based therapy or variants. Reporting of trial conduct was generally inadequate, so that in a large number of studies we rated the risk of bias as unclear for many of the domains. Selective reporting bias was particularly problematic, with 68% of studies rated at high risk of bias in this area, followed by incomplete outcome data, with 44% of studies rated at high risk of bias in this area. For the main outcome measure of remission there was some low-quality evidence (from only two studies, 81 participants) suggesting that family therapy approaches might offer some advantage over treatment as usual on rates of remission, post intervention (risk ratio (RR) 3.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 8.23; I² = 0%). However, at follow-up, low-quality evidence from only one study suggested this effect was not maintained. There was very low-quality evidence from only one trial, which means it is difficult to determine whether family therapy approaches offer any advantage over educational interventions for remission (RR 9.00, 95% CI 0.53 to 153.79; 1 study, N = 30). Similarly, there was very low-quality evidence from only five trials for remission post-intervention, again meaning that it is difficult to determine whether there is any advantage of family therapy approaches over psychological interventions (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.67; participants = 252; studies = 5; I² = 37%) and at long-term follow-up (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.28; participants = 200; studies = 4 with 1 of these contributing 3 pairwise comparisons for different age groups; I² = 0%). There was no indication that the age group had any impact on the overall treatment effect; however, it should be noted that there were very few trials undertaken in adults, with the age range of adult studies included in this analysis from 20 to 27. There was some evidence of a small effect favouring family based therapy compared with other psychological interventions in terms of weight gain post-intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.63; participants = 210; studies = 4 with 1 of these contributing 3 pairwise comparisons for different age groups; I² = 11%). Overall, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether there were any differences between groups across all comparisons for most of the secondary outcomes (weight, eating disorder psychopathology, dropouts, relapse, or family functioning measures), either at post-intervention or at follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a limited amount of low-quality evidence to suggest that family therapy approaches may be effective compared to treatment as usual in the short term. This finding is based on two trials that included only a small number of participants, and both had issues about potential bias. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is an advantage of family therapy approaches in people of any age compared to educational interventions (one study, very low quality) or psychological therapies (five studies, very low quality). Most studies contributing to this finding were undertaken in adolescents and youth. There are clear potential impacts on how family therapy approaches might be delivered to different age groups and further work is required to understand what the resulting effects on treatment efficacy might be. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether one type of family therapy approach is more effective than another. The field would benefit from further large, well-conducted trials.

### Association of family history of schizophrenia and clinical outcomes in individuals with eating disorders [^115gcd7g]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As the strongest single indicator of individual schizophrenia risk, family history of schizophrenia is also associated with higher treatment resistance (Kowalec et al; Mortensen et al.), as well as greater risk for several psychiatric disorders (DeVylder & Lukens,), including eating disorders (EDs). Recent large-scale studies revealed substantial familial co-aggregation of schizophrenia and EDs, indicating shared genetic and environmental factors between these conditions (Zhang et al.). These observations are consistent with the role of familial factors for schizophrenia in the development of EDs. However, little is known about the influence of family history of schizophrenia on the clinical features of EDs.

A familial liability to schizophrenia could influence ED manifestations in a variety of ways. Objectively, low body mass index (BMI) is one of the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (AN) (American Psychiatric Association,), and both AN and schizophrenia are negatively genetically correlated with BMI (Bulik-Sullivan et al; Duncan et al; Ikeda et al; Watson et al.). However, individuals with schizophrenia commonly have obesity (Vancampfort et al.), possibly due to side effects of antipsychotic medications (De Hert, Detraux, van Winkel, Yu, & Correll; Malan-Muller et al.). It is, therefore, unclear whether a family history of schizophrenia might influence BMI in individuals with EDs.

Age at onset for EDs may also vary according to whether schizophrenia is present in family members. Increased exposure to genetic and environmental risk factors including family history of depression, inadequate parental control, etc. is associated with earlier ages of onset for bulimia nervosa (Schmidt, Hodes, & Treasure). In addition, having a family member with schizophrenia could elevate both genetic and environmental risk, potentially driving ages of onset earlier. Symptom patterns in EDs could also be influenced by a family history of schizophrenia. An assessment of disordered-eating behaviors in individuals with schizophrenia revealed high scores for restraint, uncontrolled, and emotional eating (Kouidrat et al.). Individuals with EDs who have schizophrenia running in their family may show elevated scores in these domains compared to those with no family history of schizophrenia.

### A comparison of the frequency of familial suicide attempts across eating disorder diagnoses [^114ymRRJ]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

This study examined the prevalence of reported suicide attempts among family members of individuals with an eating disorder (ED). 1870 individuals presenting for ED treatment reported whether their family members ever made a suicide attempt using the Eating Disorders Questionnaire. A lifetime suicide attempt by any family member was reported by 10.8% (n = 202) of the sample and ranged from 7.0% of those with eating disorder not otherwise specified to 16.1% of those with purging disorder. Controlling for age and gender, individuals with bulimia nervosa had a higher prevalence of any familial suicide attempt and mother suicide attempt than individuals with EDNOS; no other differences were observed across ED diagnoses. There were no differences in prevalence of reported suicide attempts made by fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles, or aunts by ED diagnosis. Findings support a growing literature indicating a familial association between EDs and suicide risk.

Anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge-eating disorder (BED) are heritable conditions that are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AN have identified specific genetic loci implicated in AN, and genetic correlations have implicated both psychiatric and metabolic factors in its origin. No GWAS have been performed for BN or BED. Genetic counseling is an important tool and can aid families and patients in understanding risk for these illnesses.

### Salient components of a comprehensive service for eating disorders [^111kQiaG]. World Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Eating disorders are challenging and difficult to treat, because of the necessity of a multidisciplinary treatment team for effective outcomes and the high mortality rate of anorexia nervosa. An adequate initial assessment and evaluation requires a psychiatric assessment, a medical history and medical examination, a social history and an interview of family members or collateral informants. A comprehensive eating disorder treatment team includes a psychiatrist coordinating the treatment and appropriate medical physician specialists, nutritionists, and psychotherapists. An adequate outpatient eating disorder clinic needs to provide individual psychotherapy with cognitive behavioral techniques specific for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, family therapy, pharmacological treatment and the resources to obtain appropriate laboratory tests. Eating disorder patients requiring inpatient care are best treated in a specialized eating disorder inpatient unit. A cognitive behavioral framework is most useful for the overall unit milieu. Medical management and nutritional rehabilitation are the primary goals for inpatient treatment. Various group therapies can cover common core eating disorder psychopathology problems and dialectical behavior therapy groups can be useful for managing emotional dysregulation. Residential, partial hospitalization and day treatment programs are useful for transitioning patients from an inpatient program or for patients needing some monitoring. In these programs, at least one structured meal is advisable as well as nutritional counseling, group therapy or individual counseling sessions. Group therapies usually address issues such as social skills training, social anxiety, body image distortion or maturity fears. Unfortunately there is s paucity of evidence based randomized control trials to recommend the salient components for a comprehensive service for eating disorders. Experienced eating disorder clinicians have come to the conclusion that a multidisciplinary team approach provides the most effective treatment.

### Acute augmentations to psychological therapies in eating disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113rbESQ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Eating disorders represent a complex and varied range of disorders, across six main eating and feeding disorders. Three of these eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder) and the residual category of Other Specified Feeding and Eating Disorders (OSFED), are associated with evidence-based treatment. OSFED does not differ from the other eating disorders in terms of risk factors or impairment; even unhealthy weight control behaviours that do not meet diagnosis are associated with significantly higher economic costs among adolescents. These eating disorders are associated with an almost four-fold increased mortality compared to age- and sex-matched populations, the highest of any psychiatric disorder after substance use disorders. Treatment options range from outpatient psychological treatment involving family members in an age-appropriate manner (for mild or moderately severe cases) through to inpatient or day patient treatment for those with more severe medical or psychological risk, required for up to 35% of patients.

While large within-group effect sizes are obtained for eating disorder treatments using cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in routine clinical care, with an attrition rate of 25.5%, CBT for bulimia nervosa produces abstinence in only 37.5% of completers. Specific psychological treatments for adult outpatients with anorexia nervosa are associated with modest improvements but no reliable evidence supports superiority of one approach over specialist, supportive psychotherapy. This situation is mirrored in other mental health problems, where "even the best therapies leave substantial proportions of patients with ongoing clinical problems" [p. 389,]. At least half of all patients with mental health disorders do not respond adequately to psychological therapy. For this reason, acute augmentations for psychological therapy have been proposed as a pathway to improve outcomes, especially where there is comorbidity and such augmentation may have transdiagnostic mechanisms and utility.

### Genetic and environmental contributions to diagnostic fluctuation in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa [^114QaD6R]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study population

Through the Swedish Population Register and the Multi-Generation Register, we identified all full-sisters (sisters born to the same parents) and maternal half-sisters (sisters born to the same mother but different fathers) who were born in Sweden between 1970 and 2005. We excluded individuals who emigrated or died before age 6, adopted individuals and individuals whose biological parents were not identifiable from the registers. We did not have access to information on race and ethnicity; however, being born in Sweden might suggest that our study population was comprised primarily of individuals of Scandinavian/Nordic ancestry. We then randomly selected one pair of maternal half-sisters per mother [57 036 pairs, mean age 25.2 years by the end of follow-up in year 2013, standard deviation = 9.3]. We then randomly selected one pair of full-sisters per mother in the remaining mothers after excluding mothers of the selected maternal half-sisters. We excluded twin pairs from full-sister pairs, resulting in 334 433 pairs of full-sisters for analysis (mean age 25.5 years by year 2013, = 9.6). No individual was included in more than one pair. The selected full-sisters and maternal half-sisters comprised the study population, where 6104 (0.91%) individuals among the full-sisters and 938 (0.82%) among the maternal half-sisters had been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa; 3142 (0.47%) among the full-sisters and 579 (0.51%) among the maternal half-sisters had been diagnosed with bulimia nervosa; 679 (0.10%) among the full-sisters and 122 (0.11%) among the half-sisters had been diagnosed with both disorders (Table 1).

### Family functioning of patients with an eating disorder compared with that of patients with obsessive compulsive disorder [^115FfioM]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

This study compares the family functioning of patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The study participants, who were all female, consisted of 15 patients with AN, 13 with BN, and 17 with OCD. Family functioning was assessed by using the Family Assessment Device self-rating scale. The study subjects also completed the Eating Attitudes Test. Subjects in the AN and BN groups did not differ statistically either from each other or from the OCD group in all 7 Family Assessment Device subscales. Patients with an eating disorder and OCD rated their family functioning in a similar way. It is difficult to conclude that patients with AN or BN have a specific type of family functioning, which is totally different from the family functioning of patients with OCD. Thus, the study results further support the idea that family interaction in eating disorders is not specific to these disorders, especially when compared with patients with OCD.

### Psychological treatment of eating disorders [^114ET78U]. The American Psychologist (2007). Low credibility.

Significant progress has been achieved in the development and evaluation of evidence-based psychological treatments for eating disorders over the past 25 years. Cognitive behavioral therapy is currently the treatment of choice for bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder, and existing evidence supports the use of a specific form of family therapy for adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Important challenges remain. Even the most effective interventions for bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder fail to help a substantial number of patients. A priority must be the extension and adaptation of these treatments to a broader range of eating disorders (eating disorder not otherwise specified), to adolescents, who have been largely overlooked in clinical research, and to chronic, treatment-resistant cases of anorexia nervosa. The article highlights current conceptual and clinical innovations designed to improve on existing therapeutic efficacy. The problems of increasing the dissemination of evidence-based treatments that are unavailable in most clinical service settings are discussed.

### The prevalence, correlates, and help-seeking of eating disorders in Switzerland [^113nNbgF]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Eating disorders (EDs) have long-term physical and mental impacts on those affected. However, few population-based studies have estimated the prevalence of EDs. We aimed to estimate the lifetime and 12-month prevalence rates of EDs using DSM-IV criteria, and to examine differences against the DSM-5 criteria for anorexia.

Method

A nationally representative sample of 10 038 residents in Switzerland was interviewed, and prevalence rates for anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED) were assessed using WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interviews (WHO-CIDI).

Results

The lifetime prevalence rate for any ED was found to be 3.5%. Lifetime prevalence estimates for AN, BN, and/or BED were 1.2%, 2.4%, and 2.4%, respectively, among women and 0.2%, 0.9%, and 0.7%, respectively, among men. Utilizing the DSM-5 criteria, the prevalence of AN in women increased by more than 50%, from 1.2% to 1.9%. Among those meeting the criteria for any ED, only 49.4% of men and 67.9% of women had ever sought professional help about their problems with eating or weight.

Conclusions

The higher prevalence of BN we detected relative to other studies should prompt further monitoring for a possible increasing trend. The female v. male ratios, especially for bulimia and BED, are decreasing. Given that more than half of those affected have never consulted any professional about their problems with eating or weight, routine inquiries about eating and weight by clinicians, school teachers/psychologists, and family members may help those who are at risk, especially among men.

The QWB was completed at four times during the study and the results are shown in Table 4. Overall, ratings of quality of life improved throughout the study. The difference between pre - and post-treatment ratings was statistically significant (F [1,853] = 43.95, p < .001). There was also a time by treatment response interaction with individuals achieving abstinence reporting greater improvement in quality of life (QWB-SA mean.738 [SD: 0.159]) than those who did not achieve abstinence (0.673 [SD = 0.144]; F [1,291] = 8.75, p < .003). No main effect of treatment condition was observed.

### Bulimic family dynamics: role of parents' personality – a controlled study with the temperament and character inventory [^117XJg4f]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The numbers of studies on the familial environment and personality of bulimic women have increased in recent years and results have revealed interesting features. In this study, we evaluated the temperament and character traits of patients with bulimia nervosa (BN) and their mothers and fathers, and we analyzed the correlation of temperament and character traits among members of these bulimic families. Finally, we tested the ability of the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) to discriminate between normal controls and bulimic subjects, their parents, and their families. Using the TCI, temperament and character features of 28 bulimic patients and their parents (23 fathers and 28 mothers) were analyzed and then compared with a control group of 29 women and their 27 fathers and 29 mothers. Data suggest that both temperament and character factors are involved in BN. Bulimic individuals were high in harm avoidance and low in self-directedness. Their mothers were distinguished by low self-directedness. The fathers were low in persistence. Harm avoidance of bulimic women positively correlated with harm avoidance and negatively with self-directedness of their mothers. The bulimic family had low self-directedness as a common denominator observed in all family members. The observation that both temperament and character have important roles in the etiopathogenesis of bulimia nervosa has important treatment ramifications. The TCI was useful in discriminating between normal controls and bulimic subjects, their parents, and the whole family.

### Treatment protocols for eating disorders: clinicians' attitudes, concerns, adherence and difficulties delivering evidence-based psychological interventions [^115wC2f7]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Efficacy Studies

There is clear evidence from large research trials that some therapies are efficacious in working with eating disorders. That evidence had been well summarised up until a few years ago, in the form of a number of reviews with very consistent conclusions. A reasonable summary of those reviews might have led to the following summary, a decade ago:
A number of therapies had been identified that reduced the severity and presence of bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder, including cognitive-behavioural therapies (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). Of those therapies, CBT had the strongest evidence of the greatest and most rapid effects.
Those therapies were usually more effective if delivered in an individual, face-to-face setting.
Medications had a limited role in the treatment of eating disorders, with some evidence for symptom alleviation in bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder, but no support for treating anorexia nervosa and no clear evidence for medication/psychotherapy combinations being superior. The studies were often hard to rely on as indicators of remission or recovery, as they had very short follow-ups.
Younger adolescents with less long-lasting cases benefitted more from family-based therapies (FBT).
Treatments for adults with anorexia nervosa had weak evidence, with weak outcomes (even when they include treatments delivered in more intensive settings), and little difference between therapies.
There was virtually no evidence base relating to the treatment of atypical eating disorders (other than binge eating disorder), despite this category representing the largest single category of eating disorders.

Since those reviews were published, a number of important treatment trials have been published in the field. The key changes in our evidence base as a result can be summarised as:
CBT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of atypical cases of eating disorder where the patient is not underweight, though there is no evidence that there has been any improvement in outcomes for bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder with developments in CBT.
Outcomes for patients with anorexia nervosa are somewhat improved, particularly for CBT (••,), though not in modified versions of CBT where weight gain is de-emphasised. CBT is now demonstrably more effective than other therapies for this group, at least by the end of therapy. Its effects remain weak compared to the outcomes for patients who are not underweight, with recovery in only approximately 30% of anorexia nervosa patients entering CBT, but this is better than the outcomes demonstrated by other therapies (•).

### Multi-family therapy for eating disorders: a systematic scoping review of the quantitative and qualitative findings [^113zcBms]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Bringing families together to form multi‐family groups has been part of eating disorder treatment for decades (Gelin, Cook‐Darzens, & Hendrick). This emerged in the context of a longer tradition of multi‐family groups for people with schizophrenia (Laqueur, Laburt, & Morong; McFarlane,), and more recent models for depression (Anderson et al; Lemmens, Eisler, Buysse, Heene, & Demyttenaere,) and substance misuse (Kaufman & Kaufmann).

Early eating disorder multi‐family group work in the 1980s focused on young adults with anorexia nervosa (Slagerman & Yager,) and bulimia nervosa (Wooley & Lewis). These early eating disorders focused multi‐family groups primarily targeted family relationships and improving patient support. In the 1990s, multi‐family group therapy (MFT) models began emerging for children and adolescents with eating disorders (Dare & Eisler; Scholz & Asen,), which were theoretically rooted in the principles of eating disorder focused family therapy (Eisler, Simic, Blessitt, Dodge, & MCCAED Team).

### One size does not fit all. genomics differentiates among anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder [^1117Yyc1]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

Genome‐wide association studies have identified multiple genomic regions associated with anorexia nervosa. No genome‐wide studies of other eating disorders, such as bulimia nervosa and binge‐eating disorder, have been performed, despite their substantial heritability. Exploratively, we aimed to identify traits that are genetically associated with binge‐type eating disorders.

Method

We calculated genome‐wide polygenic scores for 269 trait and disease outcomes using PRSice v2.2 and their association with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge‐eating disorder in up to 640 cases and 17,050 controls from the UK Biobank. Significant associations were tested for replication in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (up to 217 cases and 3,018 controls).

Results

Individuals with binge‐type eating disorders had higher polygenic scores than controls for other psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and higher polygenic scores for body mass index.

Discussion

Our findings replicate some of the known comorbidities of eating disorders on a genomic level and motivate a deeper investigation of shared and unique genomic factors across the three primary eating disorders.

### Family therapy for eating disorders [^116dTvQF]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

It is a perpetual source of debate whether dysfunctional family communication and relationship patterns cause eating disorders or the stress associated with raising a child with an eating disorder elicits such problems. Regardless, family therapy is a necessary component of any comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to the treatment of eating disorders. A careful assessment of the entire family, including the identified patient; his or her parents and siblings; the parents' marriage and families of origin; the child's emotional, social, and physical development; parental regulation of developmental stages; and communication patterns is mandatory. Family therapy for eating-disordered patients attempts to facilitate the elimination of potentially life-threatening symptoms and begin a therapeutic process of change within the entire family. Research has shown significant support for the use of family therapy in this population, but well-controlled treatment outcome research remains somewhat limited.

### Morbidity risk for obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders in first-degree relatives of patients with eating disorders [^112sxZSU]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

A hypothesis that eating disorders are a phenomenological variant of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been proposed. This study was conducted to determine whether anorexia nervosa and bulimia, the two main eating disorders, are familial and whether the risk for obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders (OCD and tic disorders) is higher in families of patients with eating disorders.

Method

The morbidity risk for obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders in first-degree relatives of 136 female probands with eating disorders (84 with anorexia nervosa, 52 with bulimia) was compared to that for first-degree relatives of 72 female comparison subjects.

Results

The morbidity risk for obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders was significantly higher among the 436 relatives of the eating disorder probands than among the 358 relatives of the comparison subjects (9.69% versus 0%). This finding was independent of any comorbid diagnosis of an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder in the eating disorder probands. The eating disorder group and the comparison group did not differ in familial risk for eating disorders and tic disorders.

Conclusions

To better understand the genetic components of eating disorders, these disorders should be considered as part of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum of disorders.

### Symptom fluctuation in eating disorders: correlates of diagnostic crossover [^1111R86k]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The course of anorexia nervosa often includes the emergence of bulimic symptoms and a crossover to the full syndrome of bulimia nervosa. However, clinicians' ability to predict who will develop bulimia nervosa is limited. The converse phenomenon, crossover from bulimia nervosa to anorexia nervosa, has not been investigated as thoroughly. The authors identified factors that are associated with crossover from anorexia nervosa to bulimia nervosa and from bulimia nervosa to anorexia nervosa.

Method

All participants were from the International Price Foundation Genetic Study. Two groups were studied. The first comprised 88 individuals with an initial diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, of whom 32 developed bulimia nervosa. The second included 350 individuals with bulimia nervosa, of whom 93 developed anorexia nervosa. Several variables, including DSM-IV axis I and II disorders and personality traits, were evaluated as potential predictors of crossover.

Results

For the majority of affected individuals, crossover occurred by the fifth year of illness. A low level of self-directedness was associated with crossover in both directions. Other factors differed by diagnosis: high parental criticism was associated with crossover from anorexia nervosa to bulimia nervosa, whereas alcohol abuse/dependence and a low level of novelty seeking were associated with crossover from bulimia nervosa to anorexia nervosa.

Conclusions

Low self-directedness may be associated with diagnostic instability in general, whereas other specific factors are related to the direction of diagnostic crossover. These results indicate that personality and family characteristics may influence the course of eating disorders and may be informative for planning interventions.

### Association of family history of schizophrenia and clinical outcomes in individuals with eating disorders [^1139DQ4g]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Familial co-aggregation studies of eating disorders (EDs) and schizophrenia reveal shared genetic and environment factors, yet their etiological and clinical relationship remains unclear. We evaluate the influence of schizophrenia family history on clinical outcomes of EDs.

Methods

We conducted a cohort evaluation of the association between family history of schizophrenia and ED clinical features, psychiatric comorbidities, and somatic and mental health burden in individuals born in Sweden 1977–2003 with anorexia nervosa (AN) or other EDs (OED: bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and ED not otherwise specified).

Results

Of 12 424 individuals with AN and 20 716 individuals with OED, 599 (4.8%) and 1118 (5.4%), respectively, had a family history of schizophrenia (in up to third-degree relatives). Among individuals with AN, schizophrenia in first-degree relatives was significantly associated with increased comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [HR(95% CI) 2.26 (1.27–3.99)], substance abuse disorder (SUD) [HR (95% CI) 1.93 (1.25–2.98)], and anxiety disorders [HR (95% CI) 1.47 (1.08–2.01)], but higher lowest illness-associated body mass index (BMI) [1.14 kg/m², 95% CI (0.19–2.10)]. Schizophrenia in any relative (up to third-degree) in AN was significantly associated with higher somatic and mental health burden, but lower ED psychopathology scores [−0.29, 95% CI (−0.54 to −0.04)]. Schizophrenia in first-degree relatives in individuals with OED was significantly associated with increased comorbid ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, SUD, anxiety disorders, somatic and mental health burden, and suicide attempts.

Conclusions

We observed different patterns of ED-related outcomes, psychiatric comorbidity, and illness burden in individuals with EDs with and without family histories of schizophrenia and provide new insights into the diverse manifestations of EDs.

To investigate the differential profile of early family life events associated with lifetime anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and major depression (MD).

Method

Only data from the monozygotic twins (n = 622) were examined from a community sample of female twins who had participated in three waves of data collection. Eating disorder and MD diagnoses were ascertained from the Eating Disorder Examination at Wave 3 and interview at Wave 2 respectively. Early family events were ascertained from self-report measures at Waves 1 and 3. Two case control designs were used, including a comparison of women: (1) who had lifetime AN, BN, MD, and controls, and (2) twin pairs discordant for either AN, BN, or MD (where the unaffected cotwin formed the control group).

Results

Across the two types of designs, compared to controls, both AN and BN were associated with more comments from the family about weight and shape when growing up. AN was uniquely associated with higher levels of paternal protection while BN was associated with higher levels of parental expectations.

Conclusion

While some overlap among early life events was indicated, especially related to parental conflict and criticism, there was evidence to support some degree of nonoverlap among life events associated with AN, BN, and MD.

### Family therapy for anorexia nervosa [^116tHg7j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is characterised by distorted body image and deliberately maintained low body weight. The long term prognosis is often poor, with severe medical, developmental and psychosocial complications, high rates of relapse and mortality. Different variants of family therapy have been commonly used for intervention.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of family therapy compared with standard treatment and other treatments.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neuroses Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) was searched until August 2008; MEDLINE, PsycInfo and EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched up to January 2008. A conference abstract book and included studies reference lists were searched. All lead authors of included studies were also contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTS) of interventions described as 'family therapy' compared to any other intervention or other types of family therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients of any age or gender with a primary clinical diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN) were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors selected the studies, assessed quality and extracted data. We used a random effects meta-analysis. Relative risk was used to summarise dichotomous outcomes and both the standardised mean difference and mean difference to summarise continuous measures.

Main Results

13 trials were included, the majority investigating family based therapy, or variants. Reporting of trial conduct was generally inadequate. The full extent of the risk of bias is unclear. There was some evidence (from two studies, 81 participants) to suggest that family therapy may be more effective than treatment as usual on rates of remission, in the short term (RR 3.83 95% CI 1.60 to 9.13). Based on one study (30 participants) there was no significant advantage for family therapy over educational interventions (RR 9.00 95% CI 0.53, 153.79) or over other psychological interventions (RR 1.13 95% CI 0.72 to 1.76) based on four studies (N = 149). All other reported comparisons for relapse rates, cognitive distortion, weight measures and dropouts yielded non-significant results.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence to suggest that family therapy may be effective compared to treatment as usual in the short term. However, this is based on few trials that included only a small number of participants, all of which had issues regarding potential bias. There appears to be little advantage of family therapy over other psychological interventions. The field would benefit from a large, well-conducted trial.

### Body image in patients with eating disorders and their mothers, and the role of family functioning [^1169vA9x]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Little is known about body images of mothers of patients with eating disorders. In this study we investigated body image in patients with eating disorders and in their mothers, and the relationship of their body images with family functioning.

Methods

A computer program was used that allows modeling perceived and desired body images of patients and their mothers. Patients and mothers estimated their own body images and mothers estimated the images they have of their daughters with eating disorders. The selected images were compared to anthropometric data and family functioning according to the Family Assessment Measure. Data from 29 patients with the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa and 20 patients with bulimia nervosa are presented.

Results

Both in patients with anorexia and in patients with bulimia, aspects of family functioning were associated with mothers' and daughters' perceptual body size distortion and body dissatisfaction. Mothers' perception of family functioning predicted daughters' perceptual body size distortion and body dissatisfaction in the total sample of 49 patients.

Conclusion

Body images of mothers and mothers' perceptions of family functioning may provide additional information for the treatment of patients with eating disorders.

Eating disorder epidemiology — adults and adolescents: According to large US cohort studies, estimated lifetime prevalences for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder in adult women are 1.42%, 0.46%, and 1.25%, respectively, and are lower in adult men, with anorexia nervosa 0.12%, bulimia nervosa 0.08%, and binge eating disorder 0.42%. In adolescents, eating disorder prevalence ranges from 0.3% to 2.3% in females and 0.3% to 1.3% in males. Eating disorders are associated with short-term and long-term adverse health outcomes, including physical, psychological, and social problems.

### Altered structural and effective connectivity in anorexia and bulimia nervosa in circuits that regulate energy and reward homeostasis [^112eXWkM]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anorexia and bulimia nervosa are severe psychiatric disorders with high mortality. Although anorexia nervosa is mainly characterized by severe underweight and bulimia nervosa individuals are at normal to high weight and regularly binge and purge, there are many overlapping symptoms, such as food restriction, excessive exercise, altered interoceptive perception including hunger and appetiteas well drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction. Anorexia and bulimia nervosa aggregate in families, and shared biological underpinnings have been hypothesized. The brain circuitry of food intake regulation depends on the interaction of the hypothalamus, which has a central role in energy homeostasis, with brain regions such as prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula, midbrain and ventral striatum, a brain circuitry that integrates taste perception, food reward value and cognitive–emotional associations with food. Alterations in those circuits in both disorders could point toward shared vulnerabilities.

Brain research in eating disorders has started to shed light on how altered brain structure or function may be common to anorexia and bulimia nervosa. Positron emission tomography studies suggested in both disorders increased serotonin 1A as well as cannabinoid type 1 receptors, neurotransmitter receptors associated with food intake modulation and sweet taste perception. Structural brain imaging studies have been inconsistent. One study that directly compared the two disorders in a nutritionally highly controlled environment found larger OFC volumes in anorexia and bulimia nervosa — a brain region that processes food pleasantness and regulates food intake. Others found increased somatosensory cortex volumes in both disorders. Functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) indicated greater insula activation to food images, as well as higher resting-state synchrony between anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, although other studies found opposite brain activation in response to visual food cuesor sweet taste stimulation. Studies that focused on brain white matter found reduced white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy, FA) in anorexia and bulimia nervosa within the fornix.

2 Methods

2.1 Protocol and Study Guidelines

This systematic review and meta‐analysis was prospectively registered with PROSPERO and adhered to the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Page et al.). See Table S2 for completed checklist. Database searching for the current review was conducted in compliance with Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) guidelines (McGowan et al.), in consultation with a medical librarian (DL). Four databases were searched (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL) from inception to January 4, 2024. The key words used included three concepts: (1) AN, (2) eating disorder focused family therapy, and (3) RCT. Database searches and the list of key terms are provided in the Supplementary Material (Boxes S1–S3, Table S1). A gray literature search was also conducted across a range of platforms including dissertation/thesis repositories (ProQuest), preprint servers (MedRxiv, PsyArXiv), and clinical trial registries (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform). Blinded reviewers performed title/abstract screening and full‐text article screening in duplicate. In the event of disagreement, a third reviewer (AGA) was consulted to resolve any discrepancies.

### Ecological momentary assessment for adolescents with anorexia nervosa and their parents / caregivers in Family-based treatment [^113WwS1a]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

This study tested the feasibility and acceptability of EMA for adolescents with anorexia nervosa and their parents/caregivers, along with exploring family climate during mealtimes, in the first 4 weeks of FBT.
Findings demonstrate that EMA was feasible and acceptable for this population, evidenced by the moderately high compliance rates and participants' qualitative experiences using EMA.
EMA shows promise as a tool to (a) collect detailed between‐session data on family members' experiences in FBT, and (b) gather information that clinically informs the later stages of FBT.

### One size does not fit all. genomics differentiates among anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder [^117U7B9B]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Our findings show for the first time that similarities exist in the genomic psychiatric liability for binge‐type eating disorders and anorexia nervosa. However, we find clear differences between binge‐type eating disorders and anorexia nervosa in the underlying biology of body mass regulation at the genomic level. These findings open important avenues for translational research relevant to eating disorder phenotypes and overlap between eating disorders. Specifically, it remains unknown which biological mechanisms are shared between ADHD and binge eating.

Another overarching finding is the lack of consensus on the clinical question of interest. More specifically, there are a variety of comparisons that are examined in only a single trial, making meta‐analysis impossible and limiting the strength of the conclusions. Most often, one or two trials will examine a form of FT‐ED with a modification or adjunct component (Pedersen, Carlsson, and Bentz). It could be that having a greater number of studies on a smaller range of questions would ultimately provide more useful information. A consensus building approach, for example the James Lind Alliance Approach as used in EDs by Aouad et al. Obeid et al. and van Furth, van der Meer, and Cowan, could be an avenue forward to identify key research questions of interest.

### Neuropsychological psychopathology measures in women with eating disorders, their healthy sisters, and nonrelated healthy controls [^115soJJ4]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the familial influence on neuropsychological dysfunction in eating disorders (ED) patients by comparing 16 patients with restricting type anorexia nervosa (AN-R), 18 patients with bingeing purging type anorexia nervosa, 20 patients with bulimia nervosa binge-purge type, 21 of the patients' nonaffected sisters, and 20 nonrelated healthy controls.

Methods

Self-report questionnaires assessing psychopathology and 2 computerized cognitive tasks measuring hemispheric asymmetry for language and visuospatial abilities were administered to all participant groups.

Results

On the self-report questionnaires, ED patients scored significantly more pathological than the healthy controls, whereas the healthy sisters were similar to the nonrelated healthy control group. For both of the computerized tasks, the behavior pattern of the sisters was similar to that of all, or most ED groups, and were significantly different from the nonrelated healthy controls. In addition, AN-R patients performed significantly worse on the visuospatial task than the other ED groups.

Conclusions

The dissociation between the performance on the cognitive tasks and psychopathology measures in healthy sisters, when compared to the ED and nonrelated healthy control groups, suggests that disturbances in neurocognitive functioning in ED patients are not necessarily the result of ED-related dysfunction. Rather, this may indicate general individual differences in cognitive processes that may run in families irrespective of the ED condition of the family member. The findings, with respect to the AN-R patients, support a neurocognitive continuum model of EDs in which AN-R represents the most severe form of the illness.

11, 12 More than one-half of patients with eating disorders meet criteria for a current or past episode of major depression. 16 Anorexia nervosa is associated with an increased risk of suicide, with the suicide standardized mortality ratio estimated to be as high as 31 in one meta-analysis. 17 Other associated psychiatric disorders include obsessive-compulsive disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, social phobia, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and personality disorders. Psychological symptoms include heightened emotional arousal, reduced tolerance of stress, emotional dysregulation, social withdrawal, and self-critical perfectionistic traits.
3. 11, 12 Less urgent testing, such as bone density testing, can be deferred. Treatment Family physicians can fill a central role in the monitoring and treatment of patients with eating disorders. A psychotherapist or psychiatrist usually is involved.

Eating disorder specialists, often with backgrounds in psychiatry or adolescent medicine, are ideally involved but may not be available in some locations. A dietitian can help select nutritious and calorie-rich foods. For youth, it is critical to involve their schools. Most states require formal 504 plans that spell out special accommodations, such as snack breaks in class or allowances for missed school, to allow equal educational opportunities for students with medical disabilities. Treatment success may be dependent on developing a therapeutic alliance with the patient, involvement of the patient's family, and close collaboration within the treatment team. Additional online resources for the treatment team, patient, and family are listed in eTable A. Psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is the foundation for successful treatment of an eating disorder. Family-based treatment is one of the more promising approaches for adolescents with anorexia nervosa.

23–25 Goals of psychotherapy include reduction of distorted body image and dysfunctional eating habits, return to social engagement, and resumption of full physical activities. 26 Family members need support and help learning how to care for the patient. Clinical trials have shown significant improvement in bulimia nervosa with cognitive behavior therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy. 27 Group therapy is used in many eating disorder treatment programs. Alternate adjunctive therapies such as equine therapy may hold promise, although they are not evidence-based therapies. 28 Mindfulness practices such as meditation and yoga benefit patients with anxiety and may provide low-energy physical activity. 29.

### Efficacy of eating disorder focused family therapy for adolescents with anorexia nervosa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117HJ5Y2]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

This review/meta‐analysis has some key limitations. Firstly, the number of studies in the meta‐analysis is quite low: four studies in the comparison of FT‐ED versus individual therapies and three studies in the comparison of conjoint FT‐ED versus a separated or parent focused approach. We proceeded with meta‐analysis despite relatively low numbers based on advice by Cochrane Review Group that two or more studies can be combined for meta‐analysis so long as studies can be meaningfully pooled and there is sufficient similarity across studies. Heterogeneity, measured using I², was negligible across most of our comparisons, suggesting sufficient similarity across results. However, the limited number of trials should still be considered alongside the results of the meta‐analysis. A second limitation of this study is the generalizability and representativeness of our results based on the lack of diversity within the trial samples. More specifically the evidence is largely from white girls and women. Further, all but one study reported sex or gender using a binary approach, which demonstrates the lack of evidence for ED treatment for gender diverse youth. To strengthen the evidence base for all adolescents, future trials should consider careful reporting of demographic characteristics, allowing future systematic reviews to employ a meta‐regression approach. A complementary issue is the lack of representativeness within the trials themselves. More specifically, RCTs tend to be in specialist, research orientated hospitals and restrict inclusion to a subset of patients without certain characteristics. One avenue forward would be to supplement RCT driven evidence‐based practice with practice‐based evidence drawn from routinely collected clinical data.

Overall, this meta‐analysis examined the efficacy of FT‐ED in children and adolescents with AN. There were sufficient studies to only conduct meta‐analyses on the comparison of FT‐ED versus individual therapy and FT‐ED versus a separated/parent‐focused format of FBT. These results demonstrated that FT‐ED is significantly superior to individual therapy on weight outcomes at the end of treatment, but not at short‐term (12–16 months post treatment start) or long term (2–5 years) follow‐up. When comparing FT‐ED with separated/parent‐focused approaches, it appears that the latter may deliver significantly superior weight at end of treatment, but there was insufficient data to perform a follow‐up comparison over time (and examination of individual studies suggest that these differences are not significant at follow‐up). Overall, the comparison of studies in FT‐ED are hampered by inconsistent outcome measurement, and future research should aim to harmonize measures and timepoints between clinical trials.

Family-based treatment (FBT) for pediatric eating disorders — FBT has emerged as the leading first-line treatment, consists of 3 phases, and in phase 1 focuses on weight restoration; early weight gain (4–5 pounds by session 4, typically correlating with 4 weeks of treatment) is predictive of better outcomes in adolescents, and by phase 3 weight has been restored and therapy shifts to adolescent psychosocial development. Within FBT, the pediatrician does not weigh the patient, directs care only for immediate medical safety concerns, and for medically stable patients acts as a consultant to the parents and primary therapist.

### Risk factors across the eating disorders [^111vgNfh]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

This study sought to examine risk and onset patterns in anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED). Women with AN (n = 71), BN (n = 66), BED (n = 160) and non-psychiatric controls (n = 323) were compared retrospectively on risk factors, symptom onset, and diagnostic migration. Eating disorder groups reported greater risk exposure than non-psychiatric controls. AN and BED differed on premorbid personality/behavioral problems, childhood obesity, and family overeating. Risk factors for BN were shared with AN and BED. Dieting was the most common onset symptom in AN, whereas binge eating was most common in BN and BED. Migration between AN and BED was rare, but more frequent between AN and BN and between BN and BED. AN and BED have distinct risk factors and onset patterns, while BN shares similar risk factors and onset patterns with both AN and BED. Results should inform future classification schemes and prevention programs.

### Feasibility and acceptability of home treatment as an add-on to family based therapy for adolescents with anorexia nervosa. A case series [^116chq9H]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious illness showing high morbidity, chronicity, and mortality rates (Herpertz‐Dahlmann). Studies have shown that parental involvement through family‐based therapy (FBT) can improve the outcome of AN in adolescents (Fisher, Skocic, Rutherford, & Hetrick; Herpertz‐Dahlmann; Jewell, Blessitt, Stewart, Simic, & Eisler; Zeeck et al.).

Although 40–50% of the adolescents treated with FBT show a full and stable remission in long‐term follow‐up studies, there remains a substantial proportion of patients who do not respond sufficiently to treatment with FBT (Le Grange, Accurso, Lock, Agras, & Bryson). Thus, treatment approaches involving parents of adolescents with AN need to be further developed. Studies have indicated a benefit of add‐on treatments for patients who do not respond sufficiently to an early treatment phase of FBT. For example, one study with 45 patients investigated the addition of one family meal and of intensive parental coaching (IPC). Results showed a significantly greater weight gain at the end of treatment compared with the control group treated with FBT only (Lock). One pilot study found the combination of both cognitive remediation therapy and art therapy with FBT to be feasible and well‐accepted (Lock, Fitzpatrick, Agras, Weinbach, & Jo).

Transferring treatment strategies into the home environment is the essential key challenge for sustainable symptoms change and long‐term success in psychiatric treatment of children and adolescents (Woolston, Berkowitz, Schaefer, & Adnopoz). By involving parents and other family members, FBT seeks to increase the support for young AN patients. However, it is time consuming, requires a strong commitment, and potentially burdens carers. Parents experience strong distress if initial FBT interventions are ineffective (Wufong, Rhodes, & Conti). Home treatment (HT) as an add‐on to FBT may reduce strain on family life through the support of health care workers in the implementation of behavioral modifications directly in the patients home. HT can reassure parents in their tasks prescribed by FBT sessions, and help (re‐)establish more supportive family interactions and relationships.

4 Discussion

This review explored the efficacy of FT‐ED in adolescents with AN in comparison to other forms of psychotherapy, such as individual approaches or systemic approaches. A secondary aim was to assess the relative efficacy of different variations of FT‐ED (e.g. shorter vs. longer dose, parent‐focused). Given that FT‐ED is the recommended first line of treatment for most adolescents with AN, the evidence for this approach must be current to guide clinical practice.

The first key finding of this meta‐analysis is that FT‐ED appears to offer significantly superior weight outcomes when compared to individual therapy at end of treatment. This superiority of FT‐ED declines over short‐ and long‐term follow‐up, with FT‐ED still favored over individual therapy, but losing statistical significance. While the reason for this loss of statistical significance over time is not known, one might speculate that FT‐ED works more efficiently in facilitating weight gain but that individual therapy "catches up". Another possibility is that the impact of therapy in general declines over time after the end of treatment, and other currently unmeasured variables become more influential, for example, positive or negative life events.

The results of this first analysis can be compared against the previous review by Couturier, Kimber, and Szatmari. This previous systematic review and meta‐analysis found that there were no differences between FT‐ED and individual therapy at end of treatment, but that FT‐ED was significantly superior at follow‐up. There are a few key methodological differences between these meta‐analyses. Firstly, our analysis measured follow‐up timepoints from the start of treatment whereas Couturier et al. measured follow‐up from the end of treatment. Further, we included two follow‐up timepoint analyses to compare data at the most similar points. This translated to a "short‐term" follow up at 18 months post treatment start (corresponding to 6 months since the end of treatment), and a "long term" follow‐up, 2–5 years post treatment start. In comparison, Couturier et al. compared all studies at a single follow‐up timepoint at 6–12 months after the end of treatment. Finally, Couturier et al.'s review examined one outcome: remission as definition within each original trial. Our review examined this outcome in addition to a weight outcome and an eating disorder psychopathology outcome. These differences in methodology likely explain the disparate findings between reviews.

### The American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with eating disorders [^111Twosn]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bulimia nervosa:

- **Definition**: BN is an eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of BN is complex and not fully understood. It is thought to involve dysregulation of key neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the brain, such as serotonin, which play a role in appetite regulation and mood.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of BN in females in the US is estimated at 2–3%.
- **Risk factors**: Several risk factors are associated with BN, including genetic predisposition, psychological factors such as perfectionism and body dissatisfaction, as well as societal influences that emphasize thinness. Certain life stages, such as adolescence and early adulthood, may increase vulnerability to the disorder.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of BN is marked by cycles of binge eating and compensatory behaviors, such as self-induced vomiting, laxative use, or excessive exercise, to prevent weight gain. These cycles can vary in frequency and intensity, and the disorder can be chronic, with periods of remission and relapse.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of BN varies. While many individuals can achieve recovery with appropriate treatment, others may experience a chronic course with ongoing symptom fluctuation.

2.3 Participants

Participants were young people, siblings, parents, and facilitators who participated in and facilitated MFT groups between March and July 2024. Forty‐five participants were observed across two MFT groups. This included 37 family members, composed of 19 parents (11 female, 8 male), 9 siblings (3 female, 8 male), and 9 young people (all young people were female, aged between 11 and 16, were English speaking and came from a range of metropolitan, rural and regional areas). Eight facilitators participated in the observation (seven female, one male), consisting of five clinical psychologists, one social worker, one nurse, and one pediatrician. Of these participants, 17 parents, 6 young people, and 7 facilitators provided further consent to participate in interviews or focus groups. Siblings were not invited to participate in interviews.

Families who accepted a place in the MFT group were approached by a staff member to explain the study in plain language. If families were interested in participating, the first author, C.L. contacted them to provide more detailed information. Potential facilitator participants were informed of the study via email. If interested, facilitators then contacted C.L. Potential participants were informed that they could choose their level of involvement in the study by providing written informed consent to participate in interviews and/or observational data, or neither. Of the 55 family members attending the two MFT programs, 37 provided consent for observation. All facilitators participated in the observational phase of the study.

### Do adolescents with eating disorder not otherwise specified or full-syndrome bulimia nervosa differ in clinical severity, comorbidity, risk factors, treatment outcome or cost? [^113opNoe]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We wanted to know whether adolescents with eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) differ from those with bulimia nervosa (BN) in clinical features, comorbidity, risk factors, treatment outcome or cost.

Method

Adolescents with EDNOS (n = 24) or BN (n = 61) took part in a trial of family therapy versus guided self-care. At baseline, eating disorder symptoms, risk factors, and costs were assessed by interview. Patients were reinterviewed at 6 and 12 months.

Results

Compared with EDNOS, BN patients binged, vomited and purged significantly more, and were more preoccupied with food. Those with EDNOS had more depression and had more current and childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder. 66.6% of EDNOS versus 27.8% of BN patients were abstinent from bingeing and vomiting at 1 year. Diagnosis did not moderate treatment outcome. Costs did not differ between groups.

Conclusion

EDNOS in adolescents is not trivial. It has milder eating disorder symptoms but more comorbidity than BN.

### Predictors of family functioning in carers of individuals with anorexia nervosa [^113rq5GR]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the present study was to determine influences on caregiver distress and family functioning in AN using the stress process model.

Method

Using a cross-sectional design, self-report measures were disseminated to 63 family members of inpatients with long-term AN. Outcome measures included the Family Assessment Device and the General Health Questionnaire.

Results

Multiple regression analysis of family functioning resulted in a model predicting 38% of the variance. Burden, conflict regarding AN and the caregiving role, attitudes and actions of other family members toward the person with AN, family stigma, and social support were predictive of family functioning. In contrast, caregiver psychological distress was poorly predicted by the independent variables, with only 11% of the variance explained.

Conclusion

These findings demonstrate the utility of the stress process model for predicting family functioning in this population, and suggest potential targets of intervention for clinicians working with caregivers.

Materials and methods

Study population

The study population comprised all individuals born in Denmark between May 1, 1981, and December 31, 2008, who were alive and residing in Denmark on their sixth birthday (N = 1,690,087). Individuals whose parents could not be identified in the Danish Civil Registration System (CRS; N = 11,512) or who were adopted (N = 6752) were excluded, resulting in a final sample of 1,671,823 individuals. We used data from the CRS to link these individuals to their full siblings, maternal and paternal half siblings, and cousins within the study population. We restricted family linkage to individuals within the study population so that the same diagnostic system (International Classifications of Disease-Tenth Edition, ICD-10) and time frame for diagnosis (1994 and onwards) applied to all family members. Information on diagnoses before 1994 was not included. Consequently, some cases were not captured, and some cases are not incidence. Linkage was achieved via the unique personal identification number assigned to all Danish citizens.

Outcome and covariate data

Each cohort member and relative was followed until December 31, 2016, for a reported ICD-10 diagnosis of AN, BN, EDNOS, any ED, ADHD, ASD, mood disorder, or anxiety disorder as described in Table 1. Individuals were considered being at risk of ADHD and ASD from birth and EDs, mood, and anxiety disorders from age 6. The EDNOS case group includes EDs such as binge-eating disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), and pica. EDNOS is no longer recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), but it is still used in ICD-10. Diagnostic information was obtained from the Danish National Patient Register and Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register. These registers contain diagnoses from all inpatient contacts before 1995 and both in- and out-patient contacts from 1995 onwards. Information on sex, birth year, death, and emigration was obtained from the CRS.

2.1 Participants

The study involved 169 participants (female = 92.9%), with an average age of 14.46 years (SD = 1.59, range 9–17). Caregivers consisted of female caregivers (n = 147, M age = 47.14 years, SD = 4.75) and male caregivers (n = 92, M age = 49.03 years, SD = 5.39), referred to herein as parents for simplicity. Participants were recruited from consecutive referrals of young people commencing treatment at a public outpatient service specializing in child and youth EDs. For inclusion into the study, young people had to meet International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (10th ed.; ICD‐10; WHO, 2016) criteria for AN (81.7%) or Atypical Anorexia Nervosa (AAN; 18.3%), meet the clinic's suitability criteria (below 18 years of age; primary diagnosis of an ED; medically and psychologically stable for outpatient treatment; and consent/assent to treatment at the clinic), and consent for their data to be used for research. Participants were initially evaluated by a psychiatrist and a multidisciplinary team with experience in diagnosing and treating EDs in children and adolescents. Participants completed measures as part of routine clinical practice using tablet devices at initial assessment (pre‐treatment) and after completing the 6‐week Strong Foundations program. If parents consented to their data being used for research purposes, they were included in the study. Families completed the program while awaiting allocation to traditional outpatient ED treatments (e.g. FBT, CBT‐E), which they transitioned to after completion of Strong Foundations.

### Exploring interactive change processes in multifamily therapy for adolescents with anorexia nervosa [^116w7R73]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Multifamily therapy (MFT) is a unique treatment approach that is growing in popularity for adolescents experiencing eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa (AN). MFT brings together several families to work with a team of clinicians for four to five consecutive days of treatment (Baudinet, Eisler, et al.). Originating in Germany (Scholz and Asen) and the United Kingdom (Dare and Eisler), MFT for adolescent AN is used in a range of settings as an adjunct to standard treatment as a means of increasing treatment intensity (Simic et al.).

MFT aims to create change through experiential and activity‐based content and the purposeful use of group processes (Dawson et al.). Building upon the same core principles as single‐family therapy for AN (Eisler et al.), MFT involves supporting the entire family in treatment, rather than focusing on the individual (Gelin et al; Baudinet, Simic, and Eisler). This assists families in several ways. First, this offers increased support to all family members, not just the young person. It also supports family members to become more skillful in managing both AN symptomatology and conflicts within the family (Simic et al; Asen; Le Grange and Eisler). Throughout MFT, participants work together within family units, with the whole group or separating into parent, young people, and sibling groups (Dawson et al.). Meals play an active role in treatment, with families eating several meals together across MFT, supported by the wider group setting and facilitators as needed (Dawson et al.). By connecting families facing similar challenges, MFT aims to foster solidarity and reduce stigma and isolation (Asen; Baumas et al.). Including families at various stages of treatment also aims to promote new perspectives and learning through multiple sources of knowledge and support (Asen; Simic and Eisler).

### Family histories of anxiety in overweight men and women with binge eating disorder: a preliminary investigation [^115WW7Ks]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

A preliminary examination of the significance of family histories of anxiety in the expression of binge eating disorder (BED) and associated functioning.

Methods

Participants were 166 overweight patients with BED assessed using diagnostic interviews. Participants were administered a structured psychiatric history interview about their first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) (N = 897) to determine lifetime diagnoses of DSM-IV anxiety disorders and completed a battery of questionnaires assessing current and historical eating and weight variables and associated psychological functioning (depression).

Results

BED patients with a family history of anxiety disorder were significantly more likely than BED patients without a family history of anxiety disorder to have lifetime diagnoses of anxiety disorders and mood disorders but not substance use disorders. A family history of anxiety was not significantly associated with timing or sequencing of age at onset of anxiety disorder, binge eating, dieting, or obesity, or with variability in current levels of binge eating, eating disorder psychopathology, or psychological functioning.

Conclusions

Although replication with direct interview method is needed, our preliminary findings suggest that a family history of anxiety confers greater risk for comorbid anxiety and mood disorders but is largely unrelated to the development of binge eating, dieting, or obesity and unrelated to variability in eating disorder psychopathology or psychological functioning in overweight patients with BED.

### Analysis of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring of mothers with eating disorders in Sweden [^113YY8qg]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Interestingly, the risk of ADHD and ASD was also increased in children of mothers with previous eating disorder. Whether mothers with previous eating disorder were in complete disease remission during pregnancy is not known. Given the substantial number of women with eating disorders for whom the disease course is chronic, and there is potential risk of relapse during pregnancy, there might be women with disease relapse and/or residual eating disorder symptoms during pregnancy within the group who would be defined as having a previous eating disorder. Moreover, eating disorders are associated with an increased co-occurrence of other psychiatric conditions, which also was observed in the present study. Several positive genetic correlations between eating disorders and other psychiatric diseases, including ADHD and eating disorders other than anorexia nervosa, have been described. Hence, intergenerational transmission of a genetic risk of specific psychiatric phenotypes is another potential rationale for the association between maternal eating disorders and childhood neuropsychiatric diseases. To control for genetic factors, we adjusted for parental psychiatric comorbidities, which attenuated the estimates of the main analysis slightly, but most remained significantly increased. Interestingly, maternal anorexia nervosa exposure estimates were generally attenuated to a lesser extent compared with estimates of other eating disorder exposures. Hypothetically, this difference indicates that genetic transmission is associated with the risk of ADHD and ASD in children of mothers with anorexia nervosa to a lesser extent compared with children of mothers with bulimia nervosa or an unspecified eating disorder. In addition, we performed an analysis based on exposed children compared with their full maternal cousins accounting for 12.5% of their genetic risk, in which the estimates of children of mothers with anorexia nervosa did not change significantly compared with the main analysis. The results from the family analysis supports the hypothesis of a low genetic transmission effect on the association between maternal anorexia nervosa exposure and offspring neuropsychiatric risk. Estimates of children of mothers with bulimia nervosa remained significantly increased for ADHD, but with poor precision owing to limited number of participants and outcomes. Clearly, we could only adjust for a minor part of the genetic risk and can therefore not conclude that the observed association is not mediated via familial confounding, but presumably the association would have been attenuated if this was the case.

### The meta-analytic evidence is in-time to get on and improve our treatments [^116yanf9]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Increase Use of Innovative Trial Designs

Second, and continuing the theme of treatment personalization, we need to increase our use of innovative trial designs, including individually randomized, cluster randomized, non‐inferiority, and randomizations at multiple time points that depend on the participants' intermediate outcomes or treatment responses at that time point (Ryan et al.). An average of 35% of people receiving CBT achieve at least a 50% reduction in their symptoms, but this figure is associated with a high level of heterogeneity (Cuijpers et al.). Trial designs that allow us to respond to the high level of individual variation observed in treatment, by building in personalization of the therapy as it progresses, work with this heterogeneity rather than seeing it as an inconvenience. Where we see evidence of gradual rather than rapid response, we can introduce a priori planned strategies to give our patients a better chance to have a good outcome. By intervening early with gradual responders and helping them benefit as much from therapy as the rapid responders, we can overall improve our CBT outcomes.

Use of such adaptive trials evaluating CBT for people with anorexia nervosa may be a particularly good investment of time that will help us understand how we can best improve therapy for this group. This is a population that is particularly difficult to entice into RCTs. For adolescents, both families and services seem reluctant for children to be randomized away from family‐based treatment (FBT). Of 18 RCTs examining FBT against a comparator, only four use individual psychotherapies (one of which was CBT) while the remainder used different forms of FBT (Austin et al.). Adults with anorexia nervosa are also reluctant to be randomized, and service providers are likewise unwilling for randomization to dictate the treatment received. This was illustrated in the United Kingdom DAISIES trial (Phillips et al.), comparing inpatient and stepped‐care day patient treatment for adults with severe anorexia nervosa.

Furthermore, the recorded health care occasions only included a subset of all occasions, namely those with a non-random subset of ICD codes occurring as a primary or secondary diagnosis, including all occasions with an ED code. For these occasions, all ICD-coded diagnoses were recorded in the dataset. Therefore, in addition to counting cumulative lifetime diagnoses, we also performed a sensitivity analysis only counting those diagnoses observed at the same date together with each ED diagnosis.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with eating disorders [^114cK7MW]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Binge eating disorder (BED) — diagnostic features and distinctions in children and adolescents are outlined. BED is characterized by recurrent binge eating with a sense of loss of control and is associated with at least 3 features including eating more rapidly, until uncomfortably full, when not hungry, alone due to embarrassment, or with disgust, depression, or guilt. DSM-5 requires binge eating to occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months and be associated with marked distress. BED differs from bulimia nervosa (BN) by the absence of inappropriate compensatory behaviors, and binge episodes cannot occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa (AN) or BN. For youth, a suggested, but not definitive, threshold over the previous 3‑month period has been recommended by an expert consensus, and parental interviews and other collateral information may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. BN usually occurs at normal or slightly overweight status, whereas BED often occurs in overweight and obese individuals, and BN binge eating is considered a response to restriction while BED occurs in the context of overall chaotic and unregulated eating patterns.

### Associations between parental socioeconomic-, family-, and sibling status and risk of eating disorders in offspring in a Danish national female cohort [^111V3i4H]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

4.1 Strengths and limitations

The strengths of this study include the population‐based cohort design, large number of cases, and opportunity for long‐term follow‐up without attrition. Since the Danish registers record information on all citizens regarding admissions to public hospitals, where assessment and treatment is free of charge, social selection is minimal. Furthermore, we have adjusted for urbanicity to correct for eventual selection that might be caused by different referral patterns in different parts of the country due to treatment availability or educational levels of the population in certain geographical areas. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain to have avoided residual selection, because treatment seeking behavior among individuals with EDs is less frequent among individuals with other ED diagnosis than AN and BN, as well as individuals with low SES background (Silén et al; Sonneville & Lipson). And, we cannot rule out that the referral‐pattern in countries in which socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals have less access to health care would yield different results.

The number of AN cases referred to hospital treatment (both inpatient and outpatient) in Denmark is higher than the number of referred cases with BN and EDNOS, which is evident in this study, and is also seen in other European countries (Galmiche et al.). It may be due to more AN cases being detected because of the severe somatic implications of the illness (especially underweight), whereas many normal weight BN and EDNOS cases less often seek help in the public hospitals (only cases from public hospitals are in the patient registries in Denmark). Diagnoses in the Danish patient registries are given by medical doctors in the specialties of internal medicine (somatic referrals) and psychiatry (psychiatric referrals) and are in general of good quality (Bock et al; Mohr‐Jensen et al; Nissen et al.); however, the EDs diagnoses remain to be validated. A recent study in Sweden has documented the reliability of their register‐based ED diagnoses, and, given similarities of the population and healthcare systems, we anticipate that reliability would be similarly high in Denmark (Birgegård et al.).

### Restless activation and drive for activity in anorexia nervosa may reflect a disorder of energy homeostasis [^114kp9ZB]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anorexia nervosa (AN), an uncommon disorder of voluntary food restriction emerging during adolescence, is a condition known in Western Europe for at least 500 years, if not longer. Although AN is currently categorized as an eating disorder, "anorexia" or "loss of appetite" are infrequent. AN is also an intensely personal disorder in that the person with AN concentrates most of his/her thoughts, emotions, and actions on food avoidance and weight loss.

The etiology of AN remains obscure. There is good agreement that AN constitutes a clinical entity and that it does not develop in the context of another psychiatric disorder. Nevertheless, co‐morbid psychiatric disorders are frequently associated with AN and they have an impact on the severity and duration of AN. Importantly, twin and family studies point to a significant genetic component in AN with twin‐based heritability estimates ranging from 50 to 80%. 1 So far, neither genome‐wide linkage studies or candidate gene studies, nor genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) have reported incontrovertible findings. 1

The occurrence of AN in other cultures has renewed the interest in taking a fresh look at the clinical phenomenology of AN. Indeed, research aimed at identifying and refining new phenotypes might provide a link to genetic studies and open avenues for exploring and understanding the pathology of the disorder.

### Anorectic family dynamics: temperament and character data [^117VW9Yo]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Modern psychobiologic research conceptualizes personality as a complex adaptive system involving a bidirectional interaction between heritable neurobiologic dispositions (temperament) and social learning (character). In this study, we evaluated temperament and character traits of patients with anorexia nervosa and their mothers and fathers, and we analyzed the correlation of temperament and character traits among family members in anorectic families. Finally, we tested the ability of the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) to discriminate between normal controls and anorectic subjects, their parents, and their families. Temperament and character features of 50 restricter anorectic patients and their parents (23 fathers and 25 mothers) were analyzed and then compared with a control group of 60 women and their 20 fathers and 20 mothers using the TCI. Data suggest that both temperament and character factors are involved in anorexia nervosa (AN). Anorectic individuals were high in harm avoidance (HA), low in novelty seeking (NS), and high in persistence (P) ("obsessive temperament type"). Their character was remarkable for low self-directedness (SD). Their mothers were distinguished by low SD. The fathers were high in HA, but also low in P, and high in reward dependence (RD). Again, they were low in SD. The anorectic family had low SD as a common denominator observed in all family members. This finding indicates that the psychopathology of AN extends beyond obsessiveness, but combines obsessiveness with low character development. None of the above temperament and character profiles is pathognomic of restricter anorectics. The observation that both temperament and character have an important role in the etiopathogenesis of AN has important treatment ramifications. The TCI was useful in discriminating between normal controls and anorectic subjects, their parents, and the whole anorectic family.

### Psychotherapy for bulimia nervosa and binging [^1121F6Tq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Bulimia nervosa and like syndromes, such as binge eating disorder, are common in young Western women. A specific manual based psychotherapy, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been developed for the treatment of bulimia nervosa (CBT-BN). Other psychotherapies, some from a different theoretical framework, and some modifications of CBT are also used.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatments for those with binge eating syndromes, that have been tested in randomised controlled trials. The efficacy of CBT in the specific treatment of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder was evaluated. CBT therapy was compared with waiting list or a non-treatment group, any other psychotherapy, CBT in a "pure self-help" form and CBT augmented by exposure and response therapy. In addition, the review aimed to evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of other psychotherapies when compared to a no treatment control group and to evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of other psychotherapies when compared to a 'placebo' therapy.

Search Strategy

A handsearch of The International Journal of Eating Disorders since its first issue; database searches of MEDLINE, EXTRAMED, EMBASE, PSYCHLIT, CURRENT CONTENTS, LILACS, SCISEARCH, The Cochrane Collaboration Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register; citation list searching and personal approaches to authors were used.

Selection Criteria

All studies that have tested any form of psychotherapy for adult patients with non-purging bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and/or EDNOS of a bulimic type, and which have applied a randomised controlled and standardized outcome methodology, were sought for the purpose of this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were entered into a spreadsheet programme, and into the REVMAN analysis program. Relative risk analyses were conducted of binary outcome data. The relative risk analysis was used rather than the odds ratio as the outcome measures proposed were not measuring a rare event (such as death) and the total number of studies was small. Standardized mean difference analyses were conducted of continuous variable outcome data, as the continuous outcome measures were not consistent across studies. Sensitivity analyses were conducted of a number of measures of trial quality. Data were not reported in such a way to permit subgroup analyses, but the effects of treatment on depressive symptoms, psychosocial and/or interpersonal functioning, general psychiatric symptoms and weight were examined where possible. Chi-square tests for homogeneity were done, at 5% level of significance, using a fixed effects model. Funnel plots to evaluate presence of publication bias were completed and are available in a text file upon request.

Main Results

To date, more than 1365 trials have been generated by searching and over 100 trials have been evaluated in detail. Because of a relatively high number of original exclusions (n = 12) the trial inclusion criteria were broadened to include those with non-blinded outcome assessment, providing 34 trials for analyses. Because of incomplete published and available data, at best up to 12 studies had data available for any single analysis. The maximum number of total patients included in a single analysis was 602. The majority of studies evaluated patients with bulimia nervosa of a purging type. The review supported the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy (CBT) and particularly CBT-BN in the treatment of people with bulimia nervosa and also (but less strongly due to the small number of trials) like eating disorder syndromes. CBT had been used with efficacy in group settings. Other psychotherapies were also efficacious, particularly interpersonal psychotherapy in the longer-term. Self-help approaches that used highly structured CBT treatment manuals, were promising albeit with more modest results generally, and their evaluation in bulimia nervosa approach merits further research. Exposure and response prevention did not appear to enhance the efficacy of CBT. Psychotherapy alone is unlikely to reduce or change body weight in people with bulimia nervosa or similar eating disorders.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There was a small body of evidence for the efficacy of cognitive-behaviour therapy in bulimia nervosa and similar syndromes, but the quality of trials was very variable (e.g. the majority were not blinded) and sample sizes were often small in comparison to pharmacotherapy trials. More trials are needed, particularly for binge eating disorder and other EDNOS syndromes, and trials evaluating other psychotherapies and less intensive psychotherapies.

### Ecological momentary assessment for adolescents with anorexia nervosa and their parents / caregivers in Family-based treatment [^1129QzJF]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Introduction

Studies have shown that early weight gain in family‐based treatment (FBT) predicts treatment response in adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN); however, research examining factors associated with early weight gain in FBT is limited. This study tested the feasibility and acceptability of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in early FBT, particularly to capture momentary data on family climate during mealtimes.

Methods

Using multiple methods, quantitative (EMA) and qualitative (interviews) data were collected in the first 4 weeks of FBT. Participants (11 families; 9 adolescents, 19 parents/caregivers) completed EMA assessments daily on the emotional climate during meals, parental strategies and confidence/agreement in renourishment. Qualitative interviews obtained technological and procedural data using EMA. Completion rates and markers of change were explored using repeated measures ANOVA. Interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.

Results

The EMA completion rate for all family members was 78%: 84% for adolescents, 83% for mothers, 64% for fathers. Results demonstrated changes in caregivers' use of renourishment strategies and in the emotional climate (decreased anger) at mealtimes. No changes were observed in caregiver confidence/agreement in renourishment. Qualitative analyses revealed factors interfering with and facilitating the use of EMA.

Discussion

EMA is an acceptable and feasible tool for use with adolescents and their families in early FBT, particularly to capture momentary data on family climate during mealtimes. Future research is needed with larger sample sizes to examine the mechanisms of change in early FBT, and the utility of EMA as a clinical tool in FBT.

Because of incomplete published and available data, at best up to 10 studies had data available for any single analysis. The maximum number of total patients included in a single analysis is 543. The majority of studies (21) evaluate patients with bulimia nervosa of a purging type. CBT is superior to waiting list controls with respect to abstinence from binge eating (RR 0.64 CI.53-.78). CBT just fails to be significantly superior to other psychotherapies with respect to abstinence from binge eating (RR.79, CI.61–1.04). CBT in a full or less intensive form is not significantly superior to CBT in a pure self-help form. Augmentation of CBT with exposure therapy is not more effective than CBT alone. Non CBT-psychotherapies also have significantly greater abstinence rates in comparisons with wait-list controls, but there is a paucity of such studies (RR 0.67, CI.56-.81, n = 3 studies). Funnel plots suggest a bias towards publication of positive outcome studies only.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is small body of evidence for the efficacy of cognitive-behaviour therapy in bulimia nervosa and similar syndromes, but the quality of trials is very variable (e.g. the majority are not blinded) and sample sizes are often very small. More trials are needed, particularly for binge eating disorder and other EDNOS syndromes, and evaluating other psychotherapies and less intensive psychotherapies.

Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) — differential diagnosis versus anorexia nervosa (AN) relies on absence of weight/shape concerns and focus on weight loss, and collateral history is emphasized. ARFID can be confused with AN, but distinguishing features include a lack of fear of weight gain in ARFID, no shape and weight concerns in ARFID, and no specific focus on weight loss in ARFID. It is essential to obtain collateral history from parents.

### Antecedent life events of binge-eating disorder [^115uzQBa]. Psychiatry Research (2006). Low credibility.

In terms of specificity of antecedents for BED compared with the psychiatric control group, the only specific factor of medium potency identified was the experience of three or more stressful life events in the year preceding index age. These findings suggest that stressful life events may be associated specifically with the onset of psychological disturbance compared with ongoing psychological disturbances. Although effect sizes were less than medium, certain specific antecedents were identified based on odds ratios (e.g. critical comments about shape and weight and change in family structure). These results add support to the notion that for most individuals the onset of BED is triggered by the accumulation of multiple but relatively low potency variables. Results for BED are similar to the findings of studies of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, which also suggested an accumulation of life events immediately preceding the onset of the eating disorder.

Another notable finding was that antecedent life stressors were varied and to some extent idiosyncratic. When asked whether any other significant experience occurred in the year before the onset of BED, nearly one-third of the women with BED reported something that was not otherwise assessed by the interview. Examples of such stressors included getting married, worsening of parent's drinking, getting engaged, having a sister with an eating disorder that required hospitalization, graduating from college, starting to use drugs, and going to junior high school. These factors are largely social/interpersonal experiences, but they are not necessarily negative events. Nonetheless, they contributed to the experience of feeling overwhelmed, stressed, and diminished in capacity to cope effectively.

This study has significant strengths in that it represents a large, community-based sample of BED, psychiatric and non-psychiatric populations, including an ethnic minority sample. In terms of representativeness of the sample, BMI for the BED group is consistent with previous research documenting the link between BED and obesity. BMI for the NC group fell below representative data for females in the respective age group, which, however, is consistent with lower obesity prevalence rates in individuals with higher levels of academic achievement (e.g.). This lower rate of obesity may nevertheless be associated with lower levels of exposure to antecedent life stress in the non-psychiatric comparison group (see moderator analysis on obese weight status), thus possibly accentuating greater exposure to life event stress in the BED group.

### Predictors of anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder comorbidity and order of diagnosis in a Danish national cohort [^115JhKtH]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Similarly, the sevenfold increase in risk of subsequent AN among individuals with OCD who had a history of other eating disorders underscores the well‐documented rates of diagnostic transition within eating disorders (Ackard et al.). This finding suggests that OCD could potentially serve as an intermediary step in the progression of other eating disorders toward AN, highlighting the importance of early identification and intervention in individuals with OCD who exhibit disordered eating.

Conversely, the inverse relationship between familial anxiety disorders and subsequent AN among individuals with OCD presents a novel and unexpected finding. The magnitude of the protective effect was substantial — individuals with OCD who had a first‐degree relative with an anxiety disorder had a 68% reduced risk of developing AN compared to those without familial anxiety. The protective effect was even stronger when restricting the analysis to female first‐degree relatives, with a 78% lower risk of subsequent AN. These results contrast with a previous Danish population register study, which linked both personal and familial anxiety disorders to an elevated risk of AN (Meier et al.). A possible explanation is that individuals with OCD and familial anxiety may be more likely to develop an anxiety disorder instead of transitioning to AN, given that anxiety disorders tend to co‐aggregate within families (Shimada‐Sugimoto et al.). This pattern may reflect higher polygenic risk scores for OCD and anxiety disorders among individuals with OCD and familial anxiety. Such genetic predispositions could reduce the likelihood of transitioning to AN, as they may outweigh genetic liability for AN in these individuals. Although the negative association between familial anxiety disorders and AN remained significant even after adjusting for personal history of other psychiatric diagnoses prior to OCD, it is plausible that many individuals developed comorbid anxiety disorders following their OCD diagnosis.
