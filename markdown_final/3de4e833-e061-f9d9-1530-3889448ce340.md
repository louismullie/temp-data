## Question

WHAT ARE THE FOOD AND DRUGS THAT AFFECT INR TO LOWER SIDE ON WARFARIN

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which foods and drugs lower INR in patients taking warfarin, and how confident we can be about these effects. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of warfarin and what "lowering INR" means clinically. Then, I should verify the main mechanisms that reduce warfarin's anticoagulant effect. Next, I will categorize foods and drugs by mechanism and extract specific examples with supporting evidence. After that, I need to appraise the strength of evidence and note exceptions or conflicting data. Finally, I will synthesize practical, guideline-aligned counseling and monitoring recommendations, including special populations and a concise summary table.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: warfarin inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase, reducing the synthesis of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, thereby elevating INR when effective. Conversely, "lowering INR" means restoring clotting factor synthesis and moving INR toward or below the therapeutic range, which increases thrombotic risk if uncorrected, so I need to ensure I distinguish predictable, dose-related effects from idiosyncratic or poorly substantiated claims [^0d1d52a5] [^777020fd].

> I will now examine the primary mechanism: increased vitamin K intake competes pharmacodynamically with warfarin and can lower INR. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and thresholds. In stable patients, each additional 100 micrograms/day of vitamin K is associated with an average INR reduction of about 0.2, and in unstable patients, even 25–150 micrograms/day of supplemental vitamin K can materially shift INR, with randomized data showing improved stability when low-dose vitamin K is used in selected patients with labile control [^645dff90] [^9080e4bf] [^aba77422] [^7a3e9039].

> Next, I should review foods with clinically meaningful vitamin K content. Green leafy vegetables such as kale, spinach, collards, and turnip greens are high in vitamin K. Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and certain lettuces are moderate. Oils like soybean and canola also contain vitamin K. I initially thought avocados were high in vitamin K, but wait, I should double-check — most sources list avocado as low to moderate in vitamin K, so I should correct that and not overstate its effect. The key message is consistency: abrupt increases in these foods can lower INR, whereas consistent intake allows stable dosing; dietary vitamin K guidance improves time in therapeutic range in trials and is endorsed by guidelines [^3760635d] [^62ba8b05] [^e8fb5a64].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all "healthy" foods. I need to check for non–vitamin K mechanisms that could still lower INR. Soy products, particularly soy milk, have been associated with subtherapeutic INR in case reports, possibly via effects on absorption or transport, though the evidence is limited and heterogeneous. Similarly, high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets may increase albumin and reduce free warfarin, necessitating higher doses; these are hypothesis-generating rather than definitive, so I should flag them as possible contributors when INR unexpectedly drops and other causes are excluded [^18e03cee] [^0d66f0cf].

> Now, I will categorize drugs that lower INR by mechanism. First, CYP450 inducers increase warfarin metabolism and reduce exposure. Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort are prototypical inducers. I should confirm that the effect size can be large — yes, rifampin and St. John's wort can markedly reduce warfarin effect and require close INR monitoring and dose escalation when started, with dose reduction when stopped to avoid rebound supratherapeutic INRs [^777020fd] [^3170ded5] [^3760635d].

> Second, I should consider drugs that enhance clotting factor synthesis or counter warfarin's effect. Phytonadione (vitamin K1) is the clearest example; low oral doses can rapidly lower INR, and oral vitamin K works faster than subcutaneous for reversal of supratherapeutic INRs, though the effect is gradual over 18–24 hours as factors regenerate. This is why vitamin K is used therapeutically to reverse warfarin when indicated, and why inadvertent vitamin K intake from supplements or foods can blunt warfarin's effect [^6d63e169] [^219b48e7] [^f19b2487].

> Third, I need to check for drugs that reduce absorption or bioavailability. Cholestyramine and sucralfate can bind warfarin in the gut and reduce its absorption, thereby lowering INR. Orlistat can reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins including vitamin K, which may indirectly lower INR or destabilize control; these effects are plausible and supported by case and mechanistic data, so I should keep them in mind when patients report new gastrointestinal drugs or weight-loss agents [^3170ded5] [^9cd7abc0].

> But wait, what if a patient reports a supplement that "helps with clotting"? I should review herbal and nonprescription agents with credible signals of INR reduction. American ginseng reduced warfarin exposure and peak INR in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of healthy volunteers. Coenzyme Q10 has been associated with reduced warfarin effect in labeling and observational reports. And multivitamins containing even modest vitamin K can destabilize control in susceptible patients, particularly those with low baseline vitamin K status, so I need to ask explicitly about these products [^f6966d30] [^3760635d] [^9080e4bf].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence and avoid overgeneralization. The vitamin K mechanism is robust, with dose-response data and randomized trials supporting both the effect and the clinical strategy of consistent intake or low-dose supplementation to stabilize labile patients. CYP inducers are well established in pharmacokinetic studies and labeling. In contrast, soy milk and high-protein diets rely on case reports and physiologic plausibility, so I will present them as possible contributors rather than proven causes, and I will prioritize the higher-certainty items in counseling [^645dff90] [^aba77422] [^777020fd] [^18e03cee] [^0d66f0cf].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In pediatrics, formula is fortified with vitamin K and can increase warfarin requirements, whereas breast milk is low in vitamin K and infants may be more sensitive; thus, diet changes with weaning or formula switches can shift INR. In adults, enteral nutrition products often contain vitamin K and can lower INR, so I need to check nutrition labels when patients transition to tube feeding. In liver disease, warfarin sensitivity is increased, so even modest vitamin K intake may normalize INR and mask under-anticoagulation, requiring careful interpretation and sometimes lower targets or alternative strategies [^af559880] [^11fb756d] [^7fb47708].

> I will now translate this into practical counseling and monitoring. Let me first confirm guideline direction: maintain a consistent vitamin K intake rather than avoiding it, avoid drastic dietary changes, and increase INR monitoring frequency when starting or stopping interacting drugs or supplements. Educate patients to report new prescription, OTC, herbal, or nutritional products, and coordinate with dietitians when major diet shifts are planned. For patients with repeated subtherapeutic INRs without clear cause, consider a structured vitamin K strategy or switching to a DOAC if interaction burden is high or TTR remains poor despite optimization [^3760635d] [^e8fb5a64] [^95ca5040].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence. FDA labeling advises daily INR checks initially until stable, then every 1–4 weeks, with more frequent testing when interacting drugs or supplements are added or discontinued. This aligns with best practices and should be emphasized when CYP inducers or vitamin K–containing products are introduced [^f3ec6e24] [^a518afa4].

> Finally, let me synthesize a concise, reference-aware summary. Foods that lower INR are those that increase vitamin K intake, particularly green leafy vegetables and certain oils, with the magnitude dependent on baseline intake and consistency. Drugs that lower INR include CYP450 inducers such as rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort; vitamin K1 itself; and agents that reduce absorption or bind warfarin such as cholestyramine, sucralfate, and orlistat. Possible contributors include soy products and high-protein diets via non–vitamin K mechanisms, and select herbals like American ginseng and coenzyme Q10. The clinical priority is to anticipate these changes, monitor INR more frequently when exposures change, and either adjust warfarin dose or consider switching therapy if instability persists [^645dff90] [^777020fd] [^3170ded5] [^f6966d30] [^18e03cee] [^0d66f0cf] [^e8fb5a64].

Foods and drugs that **lower INR** in warfarin patients include:

- **Vitamin K-rich foods**: Green leafy vegetables (spinach, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts), liver, and green tea can reduce warfarin's effect and lower INR [^3760635d] [^ae8b8e3c].

- **Herbal supplements**: St. John's wort, ginseng, and coenzyme Q10 can decrease warfarin efficacy and lower INR [^3760635d] [^f6966d30].

- **Enzyme inducers**: Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates increase warfarin metabolism, reducing its effect and lowering INR [^777020fd] [^3170ded5].

- **Other drugs**: Cholestyramine, sucralfate, and orlistat can reduce warfarin absorption or vitamin K absorption, lowering INR [^3170ded5] [^9cd7abc0].

Patients should **maintain a consistent diet** and inform clinicians of any new foods or drugs; INR should be monitored more frequently when changes occur [^3760635d] [^e8fb5a64].

## Foods that lower INR

Several foods can **significantly lower INR** by increasing vitamin K intake or interfering with warfarin metabolism:

| **Food category** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** |
|-|-|-|
| Vitamin K-rich foods | - Spinach <br/> - Kale <br/> - Broccoli <br/> - Brussels sprouts <br/> - Liver <br/> - Green tea | Increased vitamin K intake antagonizes warfarin's effect, lowering INR [^3760635d] [^645dff90] |
| Herbal supplements | - St. John's wort <br/> - Ginseng <br/> - Coenzyme Q10 | These supplements can induce warfarin metabolism or reduce its efficacy, lowering INR [^3760635d] [^f6966d30] |
| Soy products | - Soy milk <br/> - Tofu | May interfere with warfarin absorption or metabolism, lowering INR [^18e03cee] |

---

## Drugs that lower INR

Several medications can **lower INR** by inducing warfarin metabolism, reducing its absorption, or antagonizing its effect:

| **Drug category** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** |
|-|-|-|
| Enzyme inducers | - Rifampin <br/> - Carbamazepine <br/> - Phenytoin <br/> - Barbiturates | Induce hepatic enzymes, increasing warfarin metabolism and reducing its effect [^777020fd] [^3170ded5] |
| Absorption inhibitors | - Cholestyramine <br/> - Sucralfate <br/> - Orlistat | Reduce warfarin or vitamin K absorption, lowering INR [^3170ded5] [^9cd7abc0] |
| Vitamin K supplements | - Phytonadione (vitamin K1) | Directly antagonizes warfarin's effect, rapidly lowering INR [^6d63e169] [^219b48e7] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the narrow therapeutic range of warfarin, **even minor changes in diet or medication can significantly affect INR**. Clinicians should:

- **Educate patients**: Maintain a consistent diet and avoid sudden changes in vitamin K intake [^3760635d] [^d1038cda].

- **Monitor INR**: Increase frequency of INR monitoring when dietary or medication changes occur [^3760635d] [^a518afa4].

- **Adjust warfarin dose**: Modify the dose based on INR readings and clinical context [^f3ec6e24] [^a518afa4].

- **Consider alternatives**: If INR control remains unstable despite interventions, consider switching to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) [^95ca5040] [^8831ca7e].

---

Foods and drugs that lower INR in warfarin patients include vitamin K-rich foods, certain herbal supplements, enzyme inducers, and absorption inhibitors. Maintaining dietary consistency and close INR monitoring are essential to ensure **safe and effective anticoagulation therapy** [^3760635d] [^e8fb5a64].

### Apixaban monitoring: the jury is still Out [^81109f31]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend using a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) in preference to warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 2 or higher. This recommendation is based on consistent findings from a series of large randomized trials demonstrating equivalent or superior efficacy of DOACs relative to warfarin in preventing stroke coupled with a lower risk for major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage. Clinically, DOACs are more convenient than warfarin for both clinicians and patients because they do not require routine monitoring and they have far fewer interactions with other medications and foods.

Yet, despite the favorable risk-benefit profile of DOACs, patients taking these medications remain at risk for stroke and bleeding complications. In the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction In Stroke and Other ThromboemboLic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, for example, patients randomized to apixaban experienced an annual stroke rate of 1.19% and an annual rate of major bleeding of 2.13%. In patients taking warfarin, it is well established that a subtherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) is associated with an increased risk for stroke, while the risk for major bleeding rises progressively as the INR exceeds the therapeutic range. This suggests that some stroke events in patients taking DOACs may be linked to inadequate anticoagulation and that some bleeding events may be associated with excess anticoagulation. This in turn invites the question of whether monitoring DOAC levels, at least in selected patients at high risk for stroke or bleeding, would translate to improved outcomes for patients with NVAF.

### NOACs versus warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with AF: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e5b67217]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

It is, however, unclear whether cessation of long-term therapy for surgical and invasive procedures may show a similar trend and highlights the need for timely cessation of NOACs prior to procedures and vigilant reporting of any thromboembolic or bleeding events.

While warfarin remains an effective drug, the NOACs do confer the additional advantages of fewer interactions with drugs and foods as well as no requirement for routine monitoring, indeed the notion of taking a drug manufactured solely for therapeutic use could also be preferable to taking 'a rat poison'.

Of course warfarin does still retain some advantages, it has been in use for routine clinical practice for many years and is well understood. Testing INR allows for specific tailoring of doses for the individual and perhaps crucially, the administration of vitamin K effectively reverses warfarin's anticoagulant effect. Conversely the action of NOACs cannot be quickly and effectively reversed, which with their increasing use in clinical practice may leave clinicians almost helpless to intervene when their patients experience incidental trauma.

### Optimizing use of current anticoagulants [^59f458bf]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Although warfarin has been the mainstay of oral anticoagulation therapy for decades, evidence-based methods for improving the quality of warfarin therapy remain underused. The arrival of new anticoagulants that do not require routine laboratory monitoring and lack the significant dietary and drug interaction potential that are seen with warfarin is an important evolutionary step in the management of thromboembolic disease. However, it will be years before the efficacy and long-term safety of these new agents are defined. Newer oral anticoagulants will be more expensive than generic warfarin. This article examines various approaches to optimize the clinical use of warfarin. For patients able to achieve stable anticoagulation control, warfarin remains an important therapeutic option, delivering similar clinical outcomes at a fraction of the cost to the health care system.

### New oral anticoagulants vs. warfarin treatment: no need for pharmacogenomics? [^004ce726]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

For patients requiring long-term anticoagulation, oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin have overwhelming efficacy data and present significant challenges. In addition to the potential exposure to numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions, patients receiving warfarin require frequent monitoring. It had been hoped that the integration of pharmacogenomic with clinical information would improve anticoagulation control with warfarin, but trials have not supported this aim. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer both advantages and disadvantages and deserve consideration in appropriate patients.

Warfarin dietary supplements and vitamin K intake — subjects receiving long-term warfarin therapy are sensitive to fluctuating vitamin K, and selected supplements and foods alter warfarin effect; ginkgo and ginger "were shown not to have an effect" on warfarin PK/PD, coenzyme Q10 also "was shown not to have an effect" on warfarin dosage, while ginseng "was shown to reduce the effect of warfarin" and green tea "were shown to reduce the anticoagulant effect of warfarin." In general, "a consistent intake of vitamin K–containing foods is advisable," and "Patients should be informed of possible changes in INR," with "More frequent monitoring of the INR" that "should be considered if dietary habits have substantially changed." Increased vitamin K intake "is sufficient to reduce the anticoagulant response to warfarin," whereas reduced intake "potentiates the effect of warfarin" in specified clinical contexts; in a United States survey, "one-third of the patients used dietary supplements and one-third of all patients surveyed" reported no provider discussion of interactions.

### Improved oral anticoagulation after a dietary vitamin k-guided strategy: a randomized controlled trial [^62ba8b05]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary vitamin K is thought to be an important factor that interferes with anticoagulation stability, but the clinical applicability of this interaction has not been evaluated adequately in prospective studies.

Methods and Results

In a randomized controlled trial that enrolled outpatients with a recent international normalized ratio (INR) outside the therapeutic target, we compared 2 strategies to optimize long-term oral anticoagulation: (1) a conventional approach based on changes in anticoagulant prescription and (2) a dietary vitamin K-guided strategy based on simple modifications of the amount of vitamin K-rich foods ingested per week. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage of patients who achieved a prespecified INR target at 90 days after randomization. Study population (n = 132) predominantly included men with mechanical heart prostheses (58%) or atrial fibrillation (35%). Over time, patients allocated to the vitamin K-guided strategy reached the prespecified INR more frequently so that after 90 days of follow-up, 74% were on target compared with 58% of patients managed conventionally (P = 0.04). Patients allocated to the dietary vitamin K-guided strategy had the same magnitude and direction of INR variation as those observed with the conventional approach in the short term (15 days) for both underanticaogulated and overanticoagulated patients. Minor bleeding or use of parenteral vitamin K were also marginally less frequent in patients managed according to the dietary intervention (1 [1.5%] versus 7 [11%]; P = 0.06).

Conclusions

A vitamin K-guided management strategy to adjust long-term oral anticoagulation is feasible and safe and may result in an increased chance of reaching target levels of INR.

### Influence of dietary vitamin K intake on subtherapeutic oral anticoagulant therapy [^2d42f515]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

It is unclear what advice should be given to patients using vitamin K antagonists with respect to dietary vitamin K intake. We performed a nested case-control study in patients attending a Dutch anticoagulation clinic, to determine the association between vitamin K intake and subtherapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) values and the interaction between usual and recent vitamin K intake. Compared to patients with a normal usual vitamin K intake, those with a high vitamin K intake had a decreased risk of a subtherapeutic INR [Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56–1.16] and patients with a low vitamin K intake an increased risk (HR 1.33, 95% CI: 0.79–2.25). In patients with a low usual vitamin K intake, recent vitamin K intake was twice as high in cases as in controls (164 vs. 85 microg/d). Such a difference was not observed in patients with a normal or high usual vitamin K intake. Our results suggest that a high vitamin K intake reduces the risk of a low INR by lessening the influence of incidental consumption of vitamin K rich food on the INR. These findings support the recommendation for patients on vitamin K antagonists to eat a sufficient amount of vitamin-K containing foods.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^f19b2487]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Reversal of OACs

The effects of warfarin on coagulation extend over the drug's half-life of several days; hence, simply stopping warfarin will not rapidly reverse the anticoagulated state. Emergency management of patients treated with warfarin is discussed in depth in many clinical guidelines that advise on interventions according to INR status, the need for invasive procedures and bleeding risk or severity; these are reviewed in table 3. Vitamin K 1 (phytonadione), administered orally or intravenously, can be used to accelerate warfarin reversal to some extent by counteracting its effects on vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor synthesis. The effect of vitamin K 1 on reversal of VKA-based anticoagulation is not immediate but will progress over 18–24 h or more as the liver synthesises sufficient quantities of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins (factors II, VII, IX and X) to re-establish effective clotting, a process that takes even longer in the presence of liver disease or other metabolic or nutritional problems.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^19498ea0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.5 Botanical (Herbal) Products and Foods

More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals.

Few adequate, well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation.

Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g., garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of warfarin sodium (e.g., co-enzyme Q10, St. John's wort, ginseng). Some botanicals and foods can interact with warfarin sodium through CYP450 interactions (e.g., echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John's wort).

The amount of vitamin K in food may affect therapy with warfarin sodium. Advise patients taking warfarin sodium to eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Patients taking warfarin sodium should avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables.

There have been reports of changes in INR in patients taking warfarin and antibiotics or antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin.

Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin.

### Effect of soy milk on warfarin efficacy [^18e03cee]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the effect of soy milk on the international normalized ratio (INR) in a patient treated with warfarin.

Case Summary

A 70-year-old white man who was stable on warfarin therapy developed subtherapeutic INR values after ingesting soy protein in the form of soy milk. The subtherapeutic INR values could not be explained by factors known to reduce the INR such as noncompliance, new medications, other alternative therapies, increased physical activity, changes in medication storage, or increased consumption of vitamin K. INR values returned to therapeutic concentrations within 2 weeks after discontinuation of the soy milk. Repeated coagulation test results during the next 2 months remained within the normal range.

Discussion

Impaired warfarin metabolism may be ascribed to various pharmacodynamic and pathologic factors. Subtherapeutic INR values may also be the result of concomitant administration of metabolic inducers resulting in drug-drug, drug-herb, or drug-food interactions. An objective causality assessment in this case revealed that INR decline in a warfarin-treated patient as a result of soy milk ingestion was in the range of possible to probable. Speculative mechanisms of soy milk-induced INR decline such as changes in warfarin absorption or metabolism resulting from alterations in the P-glycoprotein efflux system or organic anion-transporting polypeptides are discussed.

Conclusions

The temporal relationship between the start of soy milk and subtherapeutic INR values in 1 patient suggests that soy milk may have possibly or probably caused a decline in INR. Soy protein food-drug interactions with warfarin may be more common than the literature suggests, and further studies are needed to determine the exact mechanism. Healthcare professionals should be alerted to the potential implications of this food-drug interaction.

### An updated review of target-specific oral anticoagulants used in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolic disease, and acute coronary syndromes [^b48b72ff]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Warfarin and Time in Therapeutic Range

Time in the therapeutic range (TTR) is a significant risk factor for stroke, major bleeding, and mortality. Data from the warfarin arms of the Stroke Prophylaxis using an ORal Thrombin Inhibitor in atrial Fibrillation (SPORTIF) III and V trials concluded significantly higher rates of major hemorrhage in the poor INR control group (TTR < 60%) compared with the moderate INR control group (TTR 60% to 75%) and good INR control group (TTR > 75%) (major bleeding rates 3.85% versus 1.96% versus 1.58%, respectively; P < 0.01). It has therefore been difficult to translate safety outcomes from clinical trials into general practice, when outcomes vary by TTR, and TTR varies by population. In a meta‐analysis investigating a study setting's influence on TTR, trial study populations had a significantly higher mean TTR compared with community‐based cohort study populations (66.4% versus 56.7%; P < 0.001). Because there is conflicting evidence on the safety of warfarin, clinicians have been shown to underuse anticoagulant therapy, especially in the elderly — a population typically with greater risk for stroke in AF.

The challenges to optimal warfarin use and achieving adequate INR control are complex and multifactorial. Genetic mutations have been described that alter the pharmacodynamics of warfarin, and environmental factors such as various drugs (through the cytochrome P450 [CYP] system), herbal supplements, dietary changes in vitamin K, and certain disease states (ie, liver dysfunction) can affect warfarin's pharmacokinetics. Due to the variable dose response of warfarin, frequent monitoring is required, which creates a significant barrier to its use. There has subsequently been a demand for oral anticoagulant drugs with a wider therapeutic window, that do not require frequent monitoring, that are easier to administer for the patient, and that exhibit fewer drug–drug and diet–drug interactions.

### NOACs versus warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with AF: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6a15f2fc]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Description of the condition

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia with a less efficient passage of blood through the atria with the potential for stasis and increased risk of thrombus formation particularly in the atrial appendage. This thrombus formation gives rise to the potential for embolism, which can manifest as ischaemic stroke.

Description of control/comparison

Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist, which exerts its anticoagulant effect by inhibiting the clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. Regrettably, it is, however, prone to numerous drug and food interactions, which necessitates regular blood testing to maintain the international normalisation ratio (INR) within the therapeutic range. Significant patient time and medical resources are required and the effective vigilance of medical practitioners in the bespoke tailoring of warfarin dose to the individual is far from straight forward.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have a more specific mode of action directly targeting just one clotting factor. The factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitors produce a more predictable and less labile anticoagulant effect, which is less susceptible to drug and food interactions and do not require regular monitoring.

Why it is important to do this review

There have been several reviews addressing similar interventions and outcomes, however, this review is an independent review, which aimed to identify all NOACs with high-quality phase II and III trials. In addition this review evaluated data from the end of the clinical trials when NOACs are stopped and participants are switched to warfarin. This has mostly gone unreported and is a key element of understanding the place of NOACs and particularly relevant considering the extent of discontinuation of around 20–24% in the clinical trial setting.

This review also applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria for assessing the strength of evidence in a summary of findings table.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the NOACs with warfarin as a comparator as well as the end of trial 'switch' to warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and an additional risk factor for stroke.
To formulate a GRADE summary of findings table.

Vitamin K supplementation and INR control — evidence overview: A low time in therapeutic range (TTR) as well as highly variable INR results are independent predictors of bleeding and thromboembolic complications during VKA therapy, and an observational study found that higher dietary vitamin K intake was associated with more stable INR control, suggesting the possibility that daily vitamin K supplementation might improve anticoagulation control. Across three randomized, placebo-controlled trials using pharmaceutically prepared vitamin K, the absolute difference in TTR was 3.54% (95% CI, 1.13%-5.96%) with no difference in major bleeding or thromboembolic complications, and control arms had relatively stable INRs (TTR range, 78.0%-85.5%).

7.5 Botanical (Herbal) Products and Foods

More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals.

Few adequate, well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation.

Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g., garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of warfarin sodium (e.g., co-enzyme Q10, St. John's wort, ginseng). Some botanicals and foods can interact with warfarin sodium through CYP450 interactions (e.g., echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John's wort).

The amount of vitamin K in food may affect therapy with warfarin sodium. Advise patients taking warfarin sodium to eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Patients taking warfarin sodium should avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables.

### Prevalence of use and the risk of adverse effects associated with complementary and alternative medicine in a cohort of patients receiving warfarin [^3eb8f3e8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), including orally administered herbals, botanicals, vitamins, and supplements, may pose a risk to patients on warfarin therapy.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of CAM use among patients taking warfarin and evaluate the impact of CAM exposure on the risk of warfarin-related adverse effects.

Methods

A survey was administered to hospital inpatients and clinic outpatients on drug exposure (including CAM) over the previous month, self-reported bleeding events, use of alcohol and vitamin K-rich foods, and medical conditions. Prescription medication use was verified, and laboratory records were checked for out-of-range international normalized ratios (INRs) (defined as INR > 4 or < 2). The use of CAM, including products with reported or theoretical interactions with warfarin, was compared between patients with and without self-reported bleeding or out-of-range INR.

Results

Among the 314 patients who completed the survey, 44.3% reported using CAM at least weekly. Potentially interacting CAM was used by 34.1% of all patients, or 18.2% if vitamin E was excluded as an interacting CAM. Vitamin E was used by 24.2% of all patients and 71.0% of those who used potentially interacting CAM. There was no significant difference in CAM use or consumption of vitamin K-rich foods between patients with and without INRs greater than 4 or for patients with and without INRs less than 2.

Conclusions

The use of potentially interacting CAM in this cohort was higher than the use previously reported among patients on warfarin therapy. However, exposure to CAM was not associated with an increase in the risk of self-reported bleeding or out-of-range INR.

### Early versus delayed anticoagulation treatment for people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation-related acute ischaemic stroke [^6d870aca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Oral anticoagulants, such as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), are recommended for stroke prevention in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke. Anticoagulants exert their action on the clotting cascade to reduce fibrin polymerisation and prevent the formation of blood clots, thereby reducing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism. VKAs, such as warfarin, inhibit the synthesis of vitamin K‐dependent clotting factors, including factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, as well as the natural anticoagulants protein C and protein S, to inhibit blood clot formation. Warfarin is administered orally, and doses are adjusted based on the International Normalised Ratio (INR) to maintain the optimal therapeutic range. Achieving an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 with adjusted‐dose warfarin treatment can significantly reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in people with atrial fibrillation‐related stroke. The advantages of warfarin include its effectiveness, affordability, and widespread availability. In cases of bleeding or overdose, warfarin's adverse effects can be reversed through the administration of vitamin K or an infusion of fresh frozen plasma. However, warfarin has drawbacks such as being prone to interactions with multiple foods and drugs, having a narrow therapeutic window, having a high risk of bleeding, and requiring complex management.

### Being precise with anticoagulation to reduce adverse drug reactions: are we there yet? [^f53dca48]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants

Over the past decade, DOACs have emerged as oral anticoagulant alternatives to warfarin. DOACs reversibly target the active sites of circulating and clot-bound thrombin (dabigatran) or clotting factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) (Fig. 2). Compared to warfarin, DOACs have a rapid onset of action, a wider therapeutic window, and fewer food and drug interactions. Currently, DOACs are prescribed at fixed doses without laboratory monitoring. However, clinical and genetic factors have been shown to affect DOAC efficacy and safety and dose adjustments may be required in high-risk patients. An overview of DOAC pharmacokinetics is provided in Table 2.

### Dietary vitamin K influences intra-individual variability in anticoagulant response to warfarin [^645dff90]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

The relationship between dietary intake of vitamin K, fat, plasma vitamin K concentrations and anticoagulation response to warfarin within individuals, as well as the contribution of dietary vitamin K to differences in warfarin dose requirements between individuals were investigated in 53 patients on warfarin therapy who had stably controlled anticoagulation. Each patient completed a dietary record of all foods consumed on a daily basis for 4 weeks. Each week a blood sample was taken for measurement of the international normalized ratio (INR), plasma vitamin K, triglycerides and warfarin enantiomer concentrations. The patients' genotype for CYP2C9 was also determined. Regression analysis of the data showed that, for each increase of 100 microg in the daily dietary intake of vitamin K averaged over 4 d, the INR was reduced by 0.2. There was no correlation between warfarin daily dose and average daily dietary vitamin K intake when calculated over 28 d. The regression model for warfarin dose showed that, while dietary vitamin K had no effect, CYP2C9 genotype (P = 2%) and age (P < 1%) significantly contributed to inter-patient variability in warfarin dose requirements. A consistent intake of vitamin K could reduce intrapatient variability in anticoagulation response and thus improve the safety of warfarin therapy.

Clinical and environmental factors affecting warfarin response

Numerous clinical and environmental factors influence warfarin dose requirements and response, including age, ethnicity, weight, height, medications, diet, illness, smoking and crucially adherence.

Increasing patient age has consistently been associated with higher warfarin sensitivity, which may be caused by the significant negative correlation between age and warfarin clearance, and by the fall in total hepatic VKORC1content due to age-related decreases in hepatic mass requirements.

Concomitant medications can affect warfarin pharmacokinetics by reducing its intestinal absorption, altering its clearance, or by competing for protein binding. Drugs can also influence the pharmacodynamics of warfarin by mechanisms such as inhibition of the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors or increasing the clearance of these factors. A list of major medications that interact with warfarin has been reviewed. Importantly, patients on amiodarone require 20–30% lower doses of warfarin for stable anticoagulation.

Dietary factors can affect warfarin dose requirements, such as alcohol consumption or vitamin K intake. Alcohol may perturb warfarin metabolism and high dietary intake of vitamin K (found in green vegetables) may conceivably offset warfarin activity. However, there is conflicting evidence on the association between warfarin maintenance doses and vitamin K intake.

Several illnesses such as liver disease, malnutrition, decompensated heart failure, hypermetabolic states (e.g. febrile illnesses, hyperthyroidism) are recognised to affect warfarin dose requirements.

Cigarette smoking can induce CYP1A2 activity, the major enzyme responsible for R -warfarin metabolism. With increased smoking, R -warfarin metabolism increases, increasing dose requirements. Therefore, a change in smoking habit may affect warfarin coagulation response and consequently patients should be carefully monitored and warfarin doses reduced accordingly following cessation.

Genetic factors affecting warfarin dose requirements

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^48a0d755]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The relevance of the INR for VKA-treated patients

The INR is a standardised method for reporting results of the PT assay, which is sensitive to the coagulation factors prothrombin, tissue factor and factors V, VII and X. As these coagulation factors depend on vitamin K for synthesis, the INR reflects anticoagulation owing to warfarin. For a warfarin-anticoagulated patient, the INR can aid decision-making around the measures that may be needed to normalise coagulation activity and stop or stabilise bleeding.

Elevated INRs can arise from direct overdosing, as well as interactions between warfarin and numerous other drugs or herbal remedies, as the result of fluctuations in dietary vitamin K owing to dietary changes or intake of nutritional supplements, or as a consequence of alcohol abuse. Concurrent conditions, such as hepatic or biliary disease, gastrointestinal illness or sepsis also can increase the INR. In such situations, the cause of the elevation needs to be identified so that repeated incidents and the resultant increased bleeding risk can be avoided. In the event of a self-reported and/or unexplained elevation in INR, retesting in the ED can confirm the elevation and exclude erroneous results. However, in the ED itself, testing artefacts such as under filling tubes when drawing blood for INR testing can yield falsely elevated INR results owing to excess levels of citrate in the test sample. Errors can be avoided by use of the correct sample tubes and ensuring that they are adequately filled.

Finally, patients are treated with warfarin to manage thrombosis or reduce the risk of stroke or other thromboembolic events. Therefore, when a VKA-treated patient presents at the ED, the INR should be confirmed to be in the therapeutic range, and intervention may be required when it is not. If necessary, the patient should be referred for appropriate warfarin management on discharge.

Oral anticoagulants — vitamin K antagonists — note that "Since the 1950s, warfarin was used as a first-line therapy until DOACs came into practice," but its "narrow therapeutic window" with INRs, monitoring, drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and "low clinical safety profile affected the routine use of warfarin in practice." Due to affordability barriers to DOACs, "warfarin is still an appropriate OAC due to its lower cost for patients who cannot afford DOACs," and utilization data show "About 21% of patients with nonvalvular AF were still receiving warfarin, while the rest received DOACs in the first quarter of 2017."

### Direct-acting oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in relation to risk of gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^7d641b83]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of vitamin K antagonists (mainly warfarin) is characterized by frequent visits to the clinic for monitoring the international normalized ratio (INR) to assess therapeutic efficacy, in addition to concurrent heparin use for bridging, and the disadvantage of drug-drug and drug-food interactions requiring dose adjustments. Given these drawbacks, the use of warfarin is cumbersome and can lead to low adherence. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have the distinct advantage of fixed dosing and do not require continuous laboratory monitoring. These features, combined with the availability of FDA-approved reversal agents, have made them desirable anticoagulants.

Several studies have shown equivalent therapeutic efficacy of DOACs compared with warfarin in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, there are few specific guidelines available to guide physicians about the individualized use of a particular DOAC for patients. Most choices rely on healthcare providers' preference, the patient's risk status, and the cost of the drugs, through a shared decision-making process.

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the overall safety profile of DOACs, emphasizing overall risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and, more specifically, risk of fatal GIB. In addition, we compared individual DOACs to warfarin regarding the risk of GIB and safety in light of the variability of INR controls, i.e. the time in therapeutic range (TTR).

Exercise caution when botanical (herbal) products are taken concomitantly with COUMADIN. Few adequate, well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and COUMADIN exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation.

Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g., garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of COUMADIN. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of COUMADIN (e.g., co-enzyme Q10, St. John's wort, ginseng). Some botanicals and foods can interact with COUMADIN through CYP450 interactions (e.g., echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John's wort).

Monitor the patient's response with additional INR determinations when initiating or discontinuing any botanicals.

Monitoring

VKAs have a very narrow therapeutic index, and patients require frequent blood monitoring to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation and to minimize the risk of bleeding. The blood monitoring test for warfarin therapy is the INR. Decisions around frequency of INR monitoring are informed by the child's age, length of time on treatment, changes in medication and food, and the presence of infections or comorbidities. The age group found to be most susceptible to fluctuations in INR are children aged < 1 year. This susceptibility has been attributed to low concentrations of vitamin K in breast milk and high concentrations of vitamin K in most formula., Infants and small children require very regular INR tests (on average, 2 tests per week) compared with once-a-month testing in most adult patients.

### Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation: where are we now? [^4eb643bd]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) confers increased risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events, and oral anticoagulation therefore is the essential part of AF management to reduce the risk of these complications. Until recently, the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs, e.g., warfarin) were the only oral anticoagulants available, acting by decreased synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VI, IX, and X). The VKAs had many limitations: delayed onset and prolonged offset of action, variability of anticoagulant effect among patients, multiple food and drug interactions affecting pharmacological properties of warfarin, narrow therapeutic window, and obligatory regular laboratory control, which all made warfarin "inconvenient" both for patients and clinicians. The limitations of VKAs led to development of a new class of drugs collectively defined as non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs), which included direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). The NOACs avoid many of the VKA drawbacks. In this review, we will focus on the current evidence justifying the use of NOACs in non-valvular AF.

### Orlistat enhances warfarin effect [^9cd7abc0]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of increased international normalized ratio (INR) associated with the addition of orlistat to the drug regimen of a patient receiving warfarin therapy.

Case Summary

A 66-year-old white man with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation (treated with a stable dose of warfarin), hypertension, and diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus was started on orlistat for weight reduction. An increased INR was reported after the introduction of orlistat; there had been no other recent changes to medication or medical conditions. Warfarin was withheld and the dose reduced to allow INR control to be reestablished. According to the Naranjo probability scale, this reaction was probable.

Discussion

Control of the INR within therapeutic limits is always a challenge. Dietary intake of vitamin K, intercurrent illness, concomitant medication, herbal remedies, and other factors can interfere with warfarin dosing. Orlistat use may be associated with patient alteration of diet to compensate for adverse effects or other mechanisms by which orlistat alters warfarin control, including direct effect on absorption of vitamin K.

Conclusions

The introduction of chronic dosing of orlistat may reduce the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin K, with the result that a lower dose of warfarin may be required. This may be due in part to change to a lower fat diet with decreased amounts of vitamin K. It may also be due to an effect on vitamin K absorption. Caution should be exercised when these 2 drugs are used concurrently.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^e8fb5a64]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — warfarin selection, INR targets, and interaction-related bleeding risk: Warfarin remains the preferred agent in patients with AF receiving CYP3A4/glycoprotein– inducing agents, or moderate-severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve, and the optimal INR control, with a therapeutic INR goal of 2 to 3, needs to be achieved through drug–drug interaction management, vitamin K dietary education, and routine INR monitoring. Time in therapeutic INR range showed negative correlation with risks of thromboembolism (R, −0.59; P = 0.01) and major bleeding (R, −0.59; P = 0.002); a weekly vitamin K dietary modification achieved a therapeutic INR more frequently than a conventional group (74 versus 58%; P = 0.04) at 90 days; and concomitant use of APT (OR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.56–1.94]), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.29–2.59]), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (OR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.42–1.85]), or antimicrobial agents (OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.45–1.83]) was significantly associated with higher risks of clinically relevant bleeding.

### Brief communication: American ginseng reduces warfarin's effect in healthy patients: a randomized, controlled trial [^f6966d30]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

People using prescription medication often concurrently take herbal supplements. In a case report, the anticoagulant effect of warfarin decreased after patients consumed ginseng.

Objective

To evaluate the interactions between American ginseng and warfarin.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

General Clinical Research Center, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.

Participants

20 healthy patients.

Intervention

In this 4-week study, 20 patients received warfarin for 3 days during weeks 1 and 4. Beginning in week 2, patients were assigned to receive either American ginseng or placebo.

Measurements

International normalized ratio (INR) and plasma warfarin level.

Results

The peak INR statistically significantly decreased after 2 weeks of ginseng administration compared with placebo (difference between ginseng and placebo, -0.19 [95% CI, -0.36 to -0.07]; P = 0.0012). The INR area under the curve (AUC), peak plasma warfarin level, and warfarin AUC were also statistically significantly reduced in the ginseng group as compared with the placebo group. Peak INR and peak plasma warfarin level were positively correlated.

Limitations

The study sample consisted of young, healthy volunteers in a research setting rather than patients taking therapeutic doses of warfarin.

Conclusions

American ginseng reduces warfarin's anticoagulant effect. When prescribing warfarin, physicians should ask patients about ginseng use.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Adequate and well-controlled studies with COUMADIN have not been conducted in any pediatric population, and the optimum dosing, safety, and efficacy in pediatric patients is unknown. Pediatric use of COUMADIN is based on adult data and recommendations, and available limited pediatric data from observational studies and patient registries. Pediatric patients administered COUMADIN should avoid any activity or sport that may result in traumatic injury.

The developing hemostatic system in infants and children results in a changing physiology of thrombosis and response to anticoagulants. Dosing of warfarin in the pediatric population varies by patient age, with infants generally having the highest, and adolescents having the lowest milligram per kilogram dose requirements to maintain target INRs. Because of changing warfarin requirements due to age, concomitant medications, diet, and existing medical condition, target INR ranges may be difficult to achieve and maintain in pediatric patients, and more frequent INR determinations are recommended. Bleeding rates varied by patient population and clinical care center in pediatric observational studies and patient registries.

Infants and children receiving vitamin K-supplemented nutrition, including infant formulas, may be resistant to warfarin therapy, while human milk-fed infants may be sensitive to warfarin therapy.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of patients receiving warfarin sodium in controlled clinical trials for which data were available for analysis, 1885 patients (24.4%) were 65 years and older, while 185 patients (2.4%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. COUMADIN is contraindicated in any unsupervised patient with senility. Observe caution with administration of COUMADIN to elderly patients in any situation or with any physical condition where added risk of hemorrhage is present. Consider lower initiation and maintenance doses of COUMADIN in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Renal clearance is considered to be a minor determinant of anticoagulant response to warfarin. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Hepatic impairment can potentiate the response to warfarin through impaired synthesis of clotting factors and decreased metabolism of warfarin. Use caution when using COUMADIN in these patients.

### Vitamin K supplementation can improve stability of anticoagulation for patients with unexplained variability in response to warfarin [^aba77422]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Patients receiving warfarin who have unstable control of anticoagulation have a significantly lower intake of dietary vitamin K compared with their stable counterparts. We hypothesized that supplementation with oral vitamin K would improve stability in patients with previously unstable control of anticoagulation. Seventy warfarin-treated patients with unstable anticoagulation control were randomly assigned in a double-blinded fashion to receive a daily amount of 150 mug oral vitamin K or placebo orally for 6 months. Measures of stability of anticoagulation control in the 6-month study period were compared with those in the 6 months immediately prior to it. Vitamin K supplementation resulted in a significantly greater decrease in standard deviation of international normalized ratio (INR) compared with placebo (-0.24 ± 0.14 vs -0.11 ± 0.18; P < .001) and a significantly greater increase in percentage time within target INR range (28% ± 20% vs 15% ± 20%; P < .01). Anticoagulation control improved in 33 of 35 patients receiving vitamin K supplementation; of these, 19 fulfilled our criteria for having stable control of anticoagulation. However, only 24 of 33 patients receiving placebo demonstrated some degree of improvement, with only 7 patients fulfilling the criteria for having stable control. Concomitant supplementation of vitamin K, perhaps through reducing the relative day-to-day variability in dietary vitamin K intake, can significantly improve anticoagulation control in patients with unexplained instability of response to warfarin.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^ba6e82bb]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Long-term INR stability during vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — patient factors, monitoring implications, physical activity, and vitamin K intake: Two recent studies assessed very stable INR control, comparing 2,504 patients with all INR values in range for 6 months vs 3,569 with at least one value outside range, and 533 patients in range for 12 months vs 2,555 controls. Independent predictors of stability were age > 70 years and absence of chronic diseases (male gender in one study), while congestive heart failure, diabetes, and a target range for INR ≥ 3.0 were associated with instability. Patients with very stable INR levels required fewer visits and had fewer events; investigators suggested many such warfarin-treated patients could be safely managed with INR recall intervals ≥ 4 weeks, and advanced age predicted stable anticoagulation. Physical activity influences control, with reductions in anticoagulant effect correlated with sudden increases in activity and increased warfarin requirements described with daily exercise such as walking. Dietary vitamin K affects stability: controlling intake can achieve a more stable response; unstable patients had poorer intake than stable controls; vitamin K‑depleted patients show greater INR influence from small vitamin K amounts; in healthy volunteers, a daily dose of at least 150 μg was needed to alter the INR response; and in nine unstable patients, 100 μg daily increased INRs in range from 32% to 57%.

### Potential clinical and economic outcomes of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype-guided dosing in patients starting warfarin therapy [^b77803a8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration has updated the label information for warfarin to encourage the use of genetic information before initiating treatment with the drug. We used decision-tree modeling to simulate the outcomes of CYP2C9 and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1) genotype-guided dosing in patients in whom warfarin therapy is to be initiated. The inputs for the model were derived from the literature. The incremental costs per unit outcome improved (ICERs) were US$347,059 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, $170,192 per adverse event averted, and $1,106,250 per life saved. The outcomes of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the ICER per QALY gained was > $50,000 62.1% of the time. ICER was sensitive to baseline international normalized ratio (INR) control, reduction in out-of-range INRs by genotype-guided dosing, and genotyping cost. In conclusion, genotype-guided dosing for warfarin therapy does not appear to be cost-effective, with the potential ICER per QALY being > $50,000. Lowering the genotyping cost, improving effectiveness of INR control of the genotype-guided dosing algorithm, and applying the algorithm in practice sites with high out-of-range INRs would improve the cost-effectiveness of the dosing algorithm.

### Vitamin K antagonists – current concepts and challenges [^53db119a]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagtonists (VKAs) have, for decades, been the corner-stone of anticoagulation in the outpatient setting. While the long half life makes once daily administration practical, close monitoring of VKA effect is necessary because these medicines have a narrow therapeutic index. Despite inter-individual variations in response to VKA doses, the increasing availability of specialized anticoagulation monitoring systems, along with a better understanding of potential drug and dietary interactions, has made the use of VKAs safer and less burdensome. In the future, newer classes of oral anticoagulants and genomic-based dosing strategies may further expand or improve the management options for many patients at risk for thromboembolism.

Dosing

At VKA commencement, children will experience a prothrombotic state. The peak anticoagulation effect is not reached until 5 to 7 days after initiation and for this reason, bridging with other anticoagulants (UFH or LMWH) for patients with acute VTE is necessary until the target INR range is achieved.

Many factors, such as a patient age, weight, height, concurrent drug therapy, genetics, and vitamin K intake can affect the appropriate dose for VKAs in children to achieve the target INR value. Younger children require higher dosing per kilogram of body weight to achieve similar INR values compared with older children. Warfarin is the most well-established VKA used in children. The initial loading dose is 0.2 mg/kg per day, with a maximum dose of 10 mg per dose in those whose INR goal is between 2.0 and 3.0, (Table 9). For children who require warfarin after undergoing a Fontan procedure or who have liver dysfunction, the initial loading dose should be 0.1 mg/kg per dose.

The starting dose for acenocoumarol ranges from 0.20 mg/kg to 0.06 mg/kg, dependent on age (Table 9). Dosing guidelines for phenprocoumon for children are limited, with most based on adult studies. One multicenter study was able to provide guidance for initial and maintenance phenprocoumon dosing for children (Table 9).

Table 9.
Starting dose for VKAs by age

After initial per-kilogram dosing, the VKA dose should then be increased, held, or decreased dependent on INR values. VKA dose adjustment guidelines for children with a target INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 following a published nomogram are presented in Table 9.

Food interactions

The anticoagulant effects of VKA may be decreased if taken with food rich in vitamin K. All infant formulas are fortified with vitamin K, whereas breast milk has low concentration of vitamin K, making breast-fed infants more susceptible to warfarin. Vitamin E and cranberry juice may increase warfarin effect. Maintaining a consistent diet and taking warfarin at the same time every day will enhance INR stability; however, developmentally, children's diet will change with age.

### Comparative analysis and meta-analysis of major clinical trials with oral factor Xa inhibitors versus warfarin in atrial fibrillation [^3aecf0b3]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a condition associated with important complications, including stroke. Anticoagulation with warfarin leads to a decreased incidence of thromboembolic events in patients with AF. Warfarin therapy in AF is associated with significant side effects, namely haemorrhagic phenomena. Warfarin use implies INR (international normalised ratio) monitoring, since genetic aspectsand interactions with food and other drugs are not uncommon. These aspects have resulted in an interest in developing new therapeutic approaches.

New anticoagulant drugs have been presented, with mechanisms of action different from warfarin: dabigatran, a thrombin inhibitor, and apixaban, rivaroxabanand edoxaban, as factor Xa inhibitor oral anticoagulant (XOAC) drugs. In what concerns factor Xa inhibitors, the three aforementioned drugs have shown interesting effects in patients with AF, in large clinical trials carried out with warfarin as the comparator drug.

The purpose of the present report was to compare the major results obtained with each of the three XOAC drugs, not only by analysing the clinical trial data, but also by carrying out a meta-analysis, aiming at the possible identification of patterns common to the different XOAC therapies. Since edoxaban was used in two different dosages in the Engage-AF Timi 48 trial, four different sets of data are in fact available. Data obtained with dabigatran were not used, since the drug has a different mechanism of action, and the inclusion of dabigatran data would lack biological meaning.

### Fish oil interaction with warfarin [^00bac74c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of elevated international normalized ratio (INR) in a patient taking fish oil and warfarin.

Case Summary

A 67-year-old white woman had been taking warfarin for 1(1/2) years due to recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Her medical history included hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, osteopenia, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. She also experienced an inferior myocardial infarction in 1995 requiring angioplasty, surgical repair of her femoral artery in 1995, and hernia repair in 1996. This patient has her INR checked in the anticoagulation clinic and is followed monthly by the clinical pharmacist. Prior to the interaction, her INR was therapeutic for 5 months while she was taking warfarin 1.5 mg/d. The patient admitted to doubling her fish oil dose from 1000 to 2000 mg/d. Without dietary, lifestyle, or medication changes, the INR increased from 2.8 to 4.3 within 1 month. The INR decreased to 1.6 one week after subsequent fish oil reduction, necessitating a return to the original warfarin dosing regimen.

Discussion

Fish oil supplementation could have provided additional anticoagulation with warfarin therapy. Fish oil, an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, consists of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. This fatty acid may affect platelet aggregation and/or vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Omega-3 fatty acids may lower thromboxane A(2) supplies within the platelet as well as decrease factor VII levels. Although controversial, this case report illustrates that fish oil can provide additive anticoagulant effects when given with warfarin.

Conclusions

This case reveals a significant rise in INR after the dose of concomitant fish oil was doubled. Patients undergoing anticoagulation therapy with warfarin should be educated about and monitored for possible drug-herb interactions. Pharmacists can play a crucial role in identifying possible drug interactions by asking patients taking warfarin about herbal and other alternative medicine product use.

### Efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin according to age for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: observations from the ARISTOTLE trial [^b5832543]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age, from ∼0.5% at 40–50 years, to ∼10% or more at 80 years. Patients with AF are at increased risk of stroke, and the annual stroke risk in AF patients is increasing with age. Warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists are effective treatments, reducing the risk of stroke by about two-thirds, but their use is limited by a narrow therapeutic range, drug and food interactions, the need for coagulation monitoring, and the risk of bleeding. The risk of bleeding including intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) increases with age, and as such is a variable in the HASBLED bleeding risk score (assigning one point each for hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio (INR), elderly > 65 years, drugs/alcohol concomitantly). These limitations contribute to the underuse of warfarin in AF patients, observed particularly in the older age group. Recently, compared with warfarin, novel oral anticoagulants have been shown to be at least as good at reducing stroke and result in lower rate of ICH, with less drug and food interactions and no need for coagulation monitoring.

The Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial compared apixaban (a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor) with warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The study demonstrated that apixaban 5 mg twice daily compared with warfarin was associated with a lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism, caused less bleeding including ICH, and resulted in lower mortality. In this pre-specified subgroup analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin according to age.

### Decreased warfarin effect after initiation of high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets [^0d66f0cf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report 2 cases of decreased international normalized ratio (INR) after initiation of a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet.

Case Summaries

Case 1. A 67-year-old white woman had been receiving warfarin for 3 years for venous thromboembolism. After initiation of a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, the patient required a 22.2% increase (from 45 to 57.5 mg/wk) in warfarin dose. Her INR remained in the therapeutic range on this dose for 8 weeks. When the patient stopped the high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, a decrease back to the original warfarin dose was required to return to a therapeutic INR. Case 2. A 58-year-old white man had been receiving warfarin for 8 years for a cerebrovascular accident. Initiation of a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet resulted in a 30% increase (from 26.25 to 37.5 mg/wk) in warfarin dose. His warfarin dose was reduced to the original dose after he stopped the high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet.

Discussion

The Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible adverse effect between warfarin and high-protein diets. High-protein diets have been shown to increase serum albumin levels. This may result in more warfarin binding to serum albumin, thereby decreasing the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. The increase of albumin occurs rapidly after initiation of a high-protein diet and appears to promptly affect anticoagulation therapy with warfarin.

Conclusions

These cases indicate a significant interaction between high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets and warfarin therapy. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be educated on and monitored for the potential interaction that occurs with warfarin therapy and high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^af559880]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs: warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon) — pediatric VTE therapeutic range, monitoring, and initial dosing are outlined as follows. The most common target international normalized ratio (INR) for children is 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0), and high‑risk conditions may require 2.5 to 3.5. Infants and small children require very regular INR tests (on average, 2 tests per week) compared with once‑a‑month testing in most adults, and the peak anticoagulation effect is not reached until 5 to 7 days after initiation. Younger children require higher dosing per kilogram than older children. For warfarin, the initial loading dose is 0.2 mg/kg per day, with a maximum of 10 mg per dose when the INR goal is between 2.0 and 3.0; after a Fontan procedure or with liver dysfunction, the initial loading dose should be 0.1 mg/kg per dose. For acenocoumarol, the starting dose ranges from 0.20 mg/kg to 0.06 mg/kg, dependent on age, and the gold‑standard test for monitoring warfarin therapy is the INR. The anticoagulant effects of VKA may be decreased if taken with food rich in vitamin K, and vitamin E and cranberry juice may increase warfarin effect.

### Capecitabine (capecitabine 500mg) [^947e06a6]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions

Anticoagulants

Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking capecitabine concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin and phenprocoumon [see Boxed Warning]. These events occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating capecitabine therapy and, in a few cases, within 1 month after stopping capecitabine. These events occurred in patients with and without liver metastases. In a drug interaction study with single dose warfarin administration, there was a significant increase in the mean AUC of S-warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The maximum observed INR value increased by 91%. This interaction is probably due to an inhibition of cytochrome P450 2C9 by capecitabine and/or its metabolites.

Phenytoin

The level of phenytoin should be carefully monitored in patients taking capecitabine and phenytoin dose may need to be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Postmarketing reports indicate that some patients receiving capecitabine and phenytoin had toxicity associated with elevated phenytoin levels. Formal drug-drug interaction studies with phenytoin have not been conducted, but the mechanism of interaction is presumed to be inhibition of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme by capecitabine and/or its metabolites.

Leucovorin

The concentration of 5-fluorouracil is increased and its toxicity may be enhanced by leucovorin. Deaths from severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration have been reported in elderly patients receiving weekly leucovorin and fluorouracil.

CYP2C9 substrates

Other than warfarin, no formal drug-drug interaction studies between capecitabine and other CYP2C9 substrates have been conducted. Care should be exercised when capecitabine is coadministered with CYP2C9 substrates.

Allopurinol

Concomitant use with allopurinol may decrease concentration of capecitabine's active metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may decrease capecitabine tablets efficacy. Avoid the use of allopurinol during treatment with capecitabine tablets.

7.2 Drug-Food Interaction

Food was shown to reduce both the rate and extent of absorption of capecitabine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In all clinical trials, patients were instructed to administer capecitabine within 30 minutes after a meal. It is recommended that capecitabine be administered with food [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

### Novel anticoagulants and the future of anticoagulation [^99d53050]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Since its discovery during the first half of the 20th century by biochemists at the University of Wisconsin, warfarin (along with other vitamin K antagonists) has remained the only oral anticoagulant available to patients at risk for thromboembolism. After nearly 6 decades in clinical practice, we have learned much about warfarin. Although it is highly effective for most patients, warfarin has a number of undesirable attributes: significant inter- and intra-patient variability in dose-response, a narrow therapeutic index, a slow pharmacodynamic response, and numerous interactions with both diet as well as other medications. The negative characteristics associated with warfarin have inspired many clinicians, patients, and researchers to wonder if a better alternative can be discovered. To that end, at least three novel anticoagulant compounds are in the late stages of development and several others are progressing through earlier phases of investigation. This review will summarize the latest clinical trial data pertinent to several newer antithrombotic agents and discuss recent developments that impact the safety and challenges associated with warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists (VKA).

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitor AZD0837 for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a randomized dose-guiding, safety, and tolerability study of four doses of AZD0837 vs. vitamin K antagonists [^c52196b3]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality from stroke and thromboembolism. Current guidelines recommend dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) (e.g. warfarin) titrated to an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0–3.0 for thromboprophylaxis in AF patients with moderate to high risk of stroke. While VKAs can be given orally, they are associated with a number of limitations, – including slow onset and offset of action, a narrow therapeutic index requiring frequent coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment, and interactions with many drugs and with food. The consequence is a variable therapeutic response, leading either to increased risk of bleeding complications or a suboptimal antithrombotic effect, resulting in undertreatment of many patients. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is recommended in low- to moderate-risk patients or as second-line therapy in patients with contraindications for VKA treatment, although stroke prevention with antiplatelet agents is suboptimal in AF patients compared with VKA. Hence, there is a need for a novel oral anticoagulant that is effective and well tolerated, with a more predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile than VKAs, without the inconvenience of regular INR monitoring, while maintaining, or improving, the therapeutic effect.

### Pharmacoeconomics of anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: a review [^235f42cd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of ischemic stroke 5-fold and may not only be responsible for as many as 15% of all strokes that occur but also for larger and more disabling strokes than those attributable to other causes which increase the associated costs of care. Anticoagulation with warfarin in the target INR of 2.5 is a major clinical challenge in real-life practice, given that the complex relationship between warfarin dosage and response is readily altered by a variety of factors such as concurrent medications, illnesses, genetic influences, and dietary/lifestyle changes. Consequently, INR values are out of the target range approximately half of the time in real-life studies compared to clinical trial setting. Current anticoagulation therapies are less likely to be cost-effective in routine clinical practice and need improvement. The aim of this review is to discuss the pharmacoeconomic consequences of this management strategy by analysing the optimal treatment option within specific age and risk groups, confirming current guidelines for a health economic perspective and considering the economic impact on health care policy.

Methods

An electronic search of the Medline/PubMed database from 1966 to 2005 was performed to identify articles dealing with all pharmacoeconomic aspects of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. The following search terms were used: 'atrial fibrillation', 'stroke', 'cost', 'warfarin'.

Results

Treatment with warfarin is cost-effective (versus aspirin or no therapy) in patients with AF at moderate-to-high risk of stroke. The cost-effectiveness of anticoagulation therapy is driven by the achieved risk reduction rather than the potential benefits estimated from clinical trials. Failure to maintain optimal anticoagulation places patients at risk of complications, the management of which is a significant cost driver.

Conclusion

Improvement could be achieved by optimising physicians and patient's knowledge driven through prevention campaigns by health care policy.

### Warfarin sodium (Coumadin) [^c9abe0be]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2.4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation

COUMADIN is a narrow therapeutic range (index) drug, and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during COUMADIN therapy. Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with COUMADIN, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of COUMADIN therapy.

2.5 Missed Dose

The anticoagulant effect of COUMADIN persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose of COUMADIN at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose.

2.6 Intravenous Route of Administration

The intravenous dose of COUMADIN is the same as the oral dose. After reconstitution, COUMADIN for injection should be administered as a slow bolus injection into a peripheral vein over 1 to 2 minutes. COUMADIN for injection is not recommended for intramuscular administration.

Reconstitute the vial with 2.7 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. The resulting yield is 2.5 mL of a 2 mg per mL solution (5 mg total). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is noted.

After reconstitution, COUMADIN for injection is stable for 4 hours at room temperature. It does not contain any antimicrobial preservative and, thus, care must be taken to assure the sterility of the prepared solution. The vial is for single use only, and any unused solution should be discarded.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^fee65c28]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Warfarin — mechanism, kinetics, monitoring, patient factors, diet/herb cautions, and reversal: Factor VII has a half-life of 6–8 hours while Factor II has a half-life of 50–80 hours, with maximal effects of warfarin observed at 3–5 days post administration; serum concentration and potency are monitored by prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR). Asian patients have a higher sensitivity to warfarin and require lower doses than patients of European descent. Patients are advised to avoid grapefruit and cranberry products, eat a consistent amount of green leafy vegetables and other vitamin K containing foods, and limit herbal supplement intake of garlic, ginger, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, and fish oil. Vitamin K can be used as a reversal agent after administration of warfarin, but its use is accompanied by many side effects.

### Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors [^00abd369]. Circulation Research (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, have been the mainstay of oral anticoagulation for many decades. Although effective, warfarin has numerous limitations, including a variable dose requirement from patient to patient because of differences in dietary vitamin K intake, common genetic polymorphisms, and multiple drug interactions that affect its pharmacodynamics and metabolism. Consequently, warfarin requires frequent monitoring to ensure that a therapeutic anticoagulant effect has been achieved because excessive anticoagulation can lead to bleeding, and because insufficient anticoagulation can result in thrombosis. Such monitoring is burdensome for patients and physicians and is costly for the health care system. These limitations have prompted the development of new oral anticoagulants that target either factor Xa or thrombin. Although the path to the development of these drugs has been long, the new drugs are at least as effective and safe as warfarin, but they streamline clinical care because they can be administered in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring. This article focuses on rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, the oral factor Xa inhibitors in the most advanced stages of development. After 20 years of discovery research, these agents are already licensed for several indications. Thus, the long path to finding replacements for warfarin has finally reached fruition. Therefore, development of the oral factor Xa inhibitors represents a translational science success story.

### Development of a clinical prediction model for an international normalised ratio ≥ 4. 5 in hospitalised patients using vitamin K antagonists [^3adf0591]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are frequently used medications in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease (Wysowski et al, 2007; Ansell et al, 2008). However, the benefit of their use is partially offset by the increased risk of bleeding complications. The reported overall risk of major bleeding complications is 1·4–2·1 per 100‐person years of VKA treatment (Palareti et al, 1996; Schulman et al, 2008; Roskell et al, 2012).

The risk of bleeding is related to the international normalised ratio (INR) and is influenced by many factors, such as dietary intake of vitamin K, concomitant medication, comorbidities and genetic factors (Schulman et al, 2008). Although numerous risk factors have been linked to a higher bleeding risk, it is difficult for physicians to assess the risk of bleeding by VKAs for an individual patient. Prediction models could help physicians to predict VKA‐associated bleeding complications and make more accurate assessments, which may lead to adjustments in therapy or closer monitoring.

New oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation — dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are described as advances over warfarin due to more predictable pharmacological profiles, fewer drug–drug interactions, absence of dietary effects, and less risk of intracranial bleeding; they have rapid onset and offset so bridging at initiation is not needed, adherence is critical since missing even 1 dose could leave a period without protection, and the FDA issued black box warnings that discontinuation can increase thromboembolism risk and coverage with another anticoagulant may be needed; reversal agents are noted as not available, dose adjustments may be warranted in chronic kidney disease or body weight extremes, and these agents do not require regular monitoring of INR or activated partial thromboplastin time.

### Height, VKORC1 1173, and CYP2C9 genotypes determine warfarin dose for pediatric patients with Kawasaki disease in southwest China [^058e2620]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Medicines and food could also affect warfarin dose. Children on phenobarbital/carbamazepine or receiving enteral nutrition required elevated doses. Drugs and diet types potentiate or attenuate warfarin effects. It was even proposed that the dietary state of vitamin K possibly explains most individual differences besides clinical and genetic factors. Assessing drug effects, Kaitlyn et al. analyzed over 10 concomitant drugs, and found no associations with warfarin dose. To evaluate the effects of food, we compared warfarin dosages between children partly receiving milk powder and those with normal diet, and found the former required lower doses than the latter (1.203 ± 0.439 mg vs. 1.957 ± 0.769 mg, P = 0.004); however, the former cases were all infants. A study of 300 adults showed vegetarian or accidentally nonvegetarian patients intake lower warfarin doses than non-vegetarians. Besides, diverse warfarin indications require different daily doses. Kaitlyn et al. found the Fontan procedure demanded a lower dose (2.5 ± 1.2 mg) than deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism patients (5.0 ± 2.6 mg; P = 0.002) or other diseases (4.7 ± 2.4 mg; P = 0.001). This may be related to increased sensitivity, abnormal liver function, loss of appetite, reduced intake of vitamin K, and lack of exercise after surgery. Interestingly, ancestry affects warfarin dosage, with Indian and Pakistani patients requiring higher doses compared with other ethnic origins. The current cohort included only Kawasaki disease patients from Southwest China, avoiding the effects of indications and ethnicity. Studies assessing drugs, food, indications, and races are relatively rare, partly because they are very hard to design and execute; in addition, their potential effects on warfarin dose are not well-defined.

A limitation of this study was its type, i.e. a single institution retrospective study, which failed to control for or/and analyze some factors, including test frequency of echocardiography and INR, the specific doses of other drugs, and diets. Another shortcoming was sample size in the experimental group, which resulted in reduced number of VKORC1 genotypes.

### Should we be applying warfarin pharmacogenetics to clinical practice? No, not now [^2f2255a6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration modified warfarin labeling in 2007 to suggest, but not mandate, pharmacogenetic testing. Genetic analysis is now commercially available. However, results predict only one third of all dosing variation, the value of testing in reducing bleeding and thrombosis rates remains unproved, and cost-effectiveness is not established. Careful consideration of clinical factors that influence dosing, conscientious prothrombin time monitoring, and sage dosage adjustment remain paramount in warfarin management. Further study is required before routine warfarin pharmacogenetic testing can be recommended.

### Ximelagatran: oral direct thrombin inhibition as anticoagulant therapy in atrial fibrillation [^f2012a32]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) causes 50,000 to 100,000 ischemic strokes annually in the U.S., most of which could be prevented by oral anticoagulant treatment of the highest-risk patients. The greatest barrier to such treatment is the narrow therapeutic index of the vitamin K antagonists ([VKAs]: warfarin and related coumarin derivatives), the only oral anticoagulant agents currently available. Safe and effective treatment with the VKAs requires careful monitoring, because they interact with many other drugs and foods, and their anticoagulant action is unpredictable. Besides vitamin K, candidate targets for anticoagulant therapy include thrombin, a key prothrombotic mediator. Ximelagatran, the oral direct thrombin inhibitor at the most advanced stage of clinical development, is rapidly absorbed and bioconverted to its active moiety, melagatran-a potent, competitive inhibitor of both free and clot-bound thrombin. Two large clinical trials have demonstrated that fixed-dose oral ximelagatran, 36 mg twice daily, administered without coagulation monitoring, prevents stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with nonvalvular AF as effectively as well-controlled, adjusted-dose warfarin (international normalized ratio 2.0 to 3.0). The overall risk of bleeding was lower with ximelagatran than warfarin, although differences in rates of major hemorrhage were not statistically significant. Elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase levels above 3x the upper limit of normal occurred in approximately 6% of ximelagatran-treated patients but typically returned toward pretreatment levels without associated symptoms. In terms of preventing thromboembolism without hemorrhage, ximelagatran may have a more favorable benefit:risk profile than warfarin for patients with AF.

Vitamin K intake and supplementation during vitamin K antagonist therapy — effects on international normalized ratio (INR) stability are detailed: After low-dose vitamin K, the INR initially decreased and reestablishing a therapeutic INR with increased warfarin dosing took from 2 to 35 days; in a randomized, blinded trial of 70 unstable patients over a 6-month period, vitamin K 150 μg/d reduced INR SD (−0.24 ± 0.14 vs −0.11 ± 0.18; P < .001) and increased time within target INR range (28% ± 20% vs 15% ± 20%; P < .01) vs placebo; in phenprocoumon-treated patients randomized to 100 μg/d vitamin K vs placebo (100 vs 100), vitamin K improved stability with a relative risk for maximal stability of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1–2.7); variable INR was defined as a minimum of three warfarin dose changes or three INRs outside of the therapeutic range in the preceding 6 months.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with cancer and atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d21d06f2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common serious abnormal heart rhythm, affecting > 30 million people. 1, 2, 3 AF‐associated thromboembolic events are the leading cause of substantial morbidity and mortality, 4, 5 and thus high‐risk AF patients often require anticoagulation therapy. 6 Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, are the most commonly used anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with AF. However, VKAs have many disadvantages that limit their use, including marked inter‐ and intraindividual variations in medication dosage, a narrow therapeutic window, frequent monitoring of anticoagulant activity, and various drug‐drug or drug‐food interactions. 7, 8 Instead, non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) could overcome these shortcomings and have been recommended as the first‐line anticoagulants in recent AF guidelines. 6, 9 The efficacy and safety of NOACs (1 direct thrombin inhibitor [dabigatran] and 3 direct Xa inhibitors [rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban]) have been validated in 4 hallmark randomized clinical trials (RCTs). 10, 11, 12, 13 In patients with AF, NOACs are at least as effective as VKAs for stroke prevention and even have a better safety profile. 10, 11, 12, 13

Objective

To report a case of warfarin-cranberry juice interaction, which resulted in an international normalized ratio (INR) elevation on 2 separate occasions.

Case Summary

A 46-year-old female was receiving a total weekly dose of 56 mg of warfarin. During the 4 months prior to the incident INR, her average INR was 2.0, with a range of 1.6–2.2, while taking the same weekly dose of warfarin. Her INR increased to 4.6 after drinking approximately 1.5 quarts (1420 mL) of cranberry juice cocktail daily for 2 days. Her INR 14 days later without cranberry juice cocktail consumption was 2.3. For the next 3 months, while taking warfarin 56 mg per week, her average INR was 2.1, with a range of 1.4–2.5. At a subsequent visit, after drinking approximately 2 quarts (1893 mL) of cranberry juice cocktail daily for 3–4 days, her INR had increased to 6.5. Her INR after holding warfarin for 3 days was 1.86. Her INR 7 days after resuming the weekly dose of warfarin 56 mg was 3.2. During both of the elevated INR episodes, no other factors were identified that would have resulted in an elevated INR, such as drug, herbal, disease, or other food interactions. An objective causality assessment revealed the interaction was highly probable.

Discussion

Warfarin is the most commonly used anticoagulant for chronic therapy. There have been several case reports of cranberry juice or cranberry sauce potentiating the effects of warfarin by elevating the INR; however, clinical trials evaluating this interaction have failed to demonstrate a significant effect on an INR.

Conclusions

Our case report describes INR elevations in a patient previously stable on warfarin after ingestion of cranberry juice cocktail daily for several days. This elevation occurred on 2 separate occasions, which distinguishes our case from other published literature.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^777020fd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 General Information

Drugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. It is important to note that some drugs may interact by more than one mechanism.

More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [see Boxed Warning].

Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding.

7.2 CYP450 Interactions

CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4. The more potent warfarin S -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the R -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4.

Inhibitors of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to increase the effect (increase INR) of warfarin by increasing the exposure of warfarin.
Inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to decrease the effect (decrease INR) of warfarin by decreasing the exposure of warfarin.

Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and 3A4 are below in Table 2; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, stopping, or changing dose of concomitant medications. Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer.

7.3 Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk

Examples of drugs known to increase the risk of bleeding are presented in Table 3. Because bleeding risk is increased when these drugs are used concomitantly with warfarin, closely monitor patients receiving any such drug with warfarin.

7.4 Antibiotics and Antifungals

There have been reports of changes in INR in patients taking warfarin and antibiotics or antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin.

Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin.

### Effect of vitamin K intake on the stability of oral anticoagulant treatment: dose-response relationships in healthy subjects [^bec17690]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulants exert their effect by blocking the utilization of vitamin K, yet little is known about competitive aspects of their interaction with dietary vitamin K. We carried out systematic dose-response studies in healthy volunteers who had been stably anticoagulated and maintained on their individualized doses for 13 weeks. First, we studied the response to weekly incremental doses (50 microg-500 microg) of vitamin K(1) supplements (K(1)) taken daily for 7 days. The threshold K(1) dose causing a statistically significant lowering of the INR was 150 microg/day. In 25% of the participants the INR change was regarded as clinically relevant at a vitamin K intake of 150 microg/day. Circulating undercarboxylated osteocalcin did not decrease until 300 microg K(1)/day compared with 100 microg K(1)/day for undercarboxylated FII, suggesting differential antidotal effects on bone and hepatic gamma-carboxylation. Next, we tested the response to vitamin K-rich food items. The short-lived response after meals of spinach and broccoli suggested an inefficient bioavailability from these 2 sources. We conclude that short-term variability in intake of K(1) is less important to fluctuations in the international normalized ratio (INR) than has been commonly assumed and that food supplements providing 100 microg/day of vitamin K(1) do not significantly interfere with oral anticoagulant therapy.

### Possible interaction between pomegranate juice and warfarin [^b49f31ab]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Pomegranate juice is growing in popularity in the UK. We report a potential interaction between pomegranate juice and warfarin. Laboratory studies have shown that pomegranate juice inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in warfarin metabolism. As with previous reports of interactions between food and warfarin, this case does not definitively prove the association between pomegranate juice consumption and increased warfarin bioactivity but highlights the importance of taking a complete drug, food and juice history when assessing patients with unstable anticoagulation.

### Treatment of acute pulmonary embolism after catheter-directed thrombolysis with dabigatran vs warfarin: results of a multicenter randomized RE-SPIRE trial [^22a70a43]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Thrombolytic therapy (TT) is effective method of PE treatment, leading to faster improvement in pulmonary obstruction. Treatment is most effective within the first 48 hours after the symptoms onset, although positive effects are recorded within the first 2 weeks.TT was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of hemodynamic decompensation or collapse, but in parallel with an increased risk of severe extracranial and intracranial bleeding. Moreover, TT reduces the risk of death by two-fold in intermediate risk category. Percutaneous catheter-directed treatment (CDT) includes mechanical fragmentation, thrombus aspiration with regional reduced-dose thrombolysis (RDT). This method decreases the right ventricular/left ventricular diameter ratio at 24 hours, without an increased risk of bleeding. This technique leads the improvement in right ventricular function, lung perfusion, and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in patients with intermediate- or high-risk PE. New oral anticoagulants should be prescribed to all patients with PE, regardless of the method of early pulmonary revascularization. New oral anticoagulants have important advantages over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in the treatment of VTE, because treatment with a VKA requires frequent monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR), and there are multiple interactions of VKA known with foods and other drugs. Owing to stable anticoagulation, high efficacy, and significantly less bleeding, dabigatran is very attractive for use in patients with high or intermediate risk PE, including patients after percutaneous CDT with RDT or full-dose systemic thrombolysis. In the Phase III Study Testing Efficacy & Safety of Oral Dabigatran Etexilate vs Warfarin for 6 m Treatment for Acute Symp Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) (RE-COVER) and RE-COVER II trials, dabigatran was as effective as warfarin in the treatment of acute VTE. A total of 2553 patients received dabigatran and 2554 warfarin, each for an average of 164 days. The incidence of any bleeding was significantly lower with dabigatran (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61–0.79), as was the incidence of combined events and clinically significant minor bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50–0.76). However, these trials did not include patients with hemodynamically unstable PE who had previous open embolectomy, percutaneous CDT, or systemic TT. Thus, the efficacy and safety of dabigatran treatment after CDT in patients with hemodynamically unstable PE has not been studied.

Phytonadione (vitamin K1) for warfarin-associated coagulopathy — route, time course, and safety: Low doses of phytonadione can be administered orally with temporary warfarin interruption in patients not requiring urgent reversal, and when given this way approximately 1.4 days are required for an INR between 6 and 10 to decline to < 4.0; when administered intravenously, low doses produce similar INR reductions at 24 h, while subcutaneous administration appears less effective than low-dose oral phytonadione. For bleeding patients at higher doses, intravenously administered phytonadione works more rapidly, with reduction of the INR beginning within 2 h and correction to within the normal range generally achieved within 24 h if hepatic function is normal and if a sufficiently large dose is given; at 24 h, 5 mg oral and 1 mg IV vitamin K produce similar effects on the INR. IV phytonadione may cause anaphylactoid reactions with a true frequency about three per 10,000 doses administered, and to minimize risk vitamin K should be mixed in a minimum of 50 mL of intravenous fluid and administered, using an infusion pump, over a minimum of 20 min.

### Direct oral anticoagulant adherence of patients with atrial fibrillation transitioned from warfarin [^95ca5040]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

While the 2019 Focused Update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation recommends switching patients from warfarin to a DOAC if they are unable to maintain a therapeutic INR, they do not define TTR thresholds at which patients should be switched. The 2020 ESC Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation recommend considering switching to a DOAC or targeted TTR‐based interventions for those with TTR < 0.7. In this study, we found that among switchers, 70% achieved DOAC adherence (PDC ≥ 0.8) at 1 year despite a pre‐switch TTR < 0.5. When including patients not achieving a TTR of 0.7, which is more common in high‐performing peer countries, the proportion that had post‐switch adherence was even slightly higher (73%). With wider availability of DOACs, a favorable safety profile, and availability of Factor Xa inhibitor reversal agents, these findings provide support for proactive switching of patients with low TTR. However, in modern integrated health care systems with a high level of success with warfarin anticoagulation, higher TTR thresholds for switching may be more reasonable.

Several factors can lead to low warfarin TTR, including medication adherence, dietary changes, interactions with other medications, variations in drug metabolism, or health care system support. However, low TTR was associated with a lower likelihood of achieving PDC ≥ 0.8, which suggests a group of individuals with low TTR partially driven by challenges with medication adherence. The impact of poor DOAC adherence is not insignificant, and has been associated with higher mortality and stroke rates. However, pharmacist‐led DOAC education and monitoring has been shown to improve adherence, and proactive enrollment of these high‐risk patients could improve outcomes in this vulnerable population. For patients with low TTR continued on warfarin, targeted approaches including intensive calls and letters from anticoagulation centers and multi‐dose drug dispensing have also been shown to help improve TTR over time.

### Warfarin sodium [^a518afa4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation

Warfarin sodium has a narrow therapeutic range (index), and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during warfarin sodium therapy. Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with warfarin sodium, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of warfarin sodium therapy.

2.5 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal failure. Monitor INR more frequently in patients with compromised renal function to maintain INR within the therapeutic range [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.6 Missed Dose

The anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose of warfarin sodium at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose.

2.7 Treatment During Dentistry and Surgery

Some dental or surgical procedures may necessitate the interruption or change in the dose of warfarin sodium therapy. Consider the benefits and risks when discontinuing warfarin sodium even for a short period of time. Determine the INR immediately prior to any dental or surgical procedure. In patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures who must be anticoagulated prior to, during, or immediately following these procedures, adjusting the dosage of warfarin sodium to maintain the INR at the low end of the therapeutic range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation.

### Effect of stress on international normalized ratio during warfarin therapy [^ee08e212]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the effect of stress on the international normalized ratio (INR) when patients are taking warfarin.

Case Summary

Two patients at a pharmacist-managed anticoagulation clinic who were stable with anticoagulation developed elevated INR values after a stressful event occurred. All other factors known to elevate the INR were unchanged; furthermore, the INR values returned to the prior level of control after resolution of the stressful events.

Discussion

Management of anticoagulation with warfarin requires the knowledge of factors that may alter an INR. Many of these factors, such as dietary changes, illnesses, drug interactions, patient compliance, and physical activity, have been described. In spite of this understanding, many patients continue to experience variability in their INR values, suggesting there are other factors that can alter the INR that have not been fully described. The cases presented here demonstrate that stressful events, physical or psychological, can elevate the INR. The mechanism for this occurrence is unknown, but may be related to decreased metabolism of warfarin during stress.

Conclusions

When an unexplained INR value exists, a stressor should be evaluated as a potential cause.

### Clinical prediction model for time in therapeutic range while on warfarin in newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation [^ff8565ef]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a growing public health and clinical problem, as an aging population, prolonged survival of patients with cardiac conditions predisposing to AF, enhanced detection of more sporadic forms of AF, and other factors have collectively served to expand the number of AF diagnoses. 1 AF portends a 5‐fold increased risk of thromboembolic events; thus, any new AF diagnosis requires assessment of thromboembolic risk and in many cases, proper oral anticoagulation (OAC) to mitigate excess risk. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Though warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have been the primary OACs for several decades, the recent introduction of 4 non–vitamin K antagonists, direct OACs (DOACs), has expanded the therapeutic options for thromboprophylaxis in AF. Meta‐analyses have reported small improvements in efficacy and safety with DOACs compared with warfarin; however, these modest improvements must be considered with the higher cost of DOACs, which have created uncertainty about their overall cost‐effectiveness. 7, 8, 9, 10 Other concerns limiting more widespread use of DOACs include an inability to monitor their anticoagulation effects, short half‐lives that increase thrombosis risk when doses are missed, and lack of experience with reversal agents that may be needed in urgent settings. 11 Alternatively, warfarin is an inexpensive, long‐used, well‐researched, and effective therapeutic, associated with a 64% reduction in ischemic stroke in nonvalvular AF compared with placebo. 12, 13 However, warfarin possesses multiple untoward attributes complicating its use, including a narrow therapeutic range, numerous drug and dietary interactions, and a metabolism strongly dependent on multiple genetic polymorphisms that make warfarin's ultimate pharmacologic effects difficult to predict. 9, 12, 13, 14

### An update on the bleeding risks associated with DOACs [^39c4345e]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), also referred to as novel (or non-vitamin K antagonist) oral anticoagulants (NOACs), represent a major development in anticoagulation therapy due to their rapid onset of action, predictable dose-response with fixed doses and limited interactions with food and drugs. 1,2 However, these agents have been in widespread clinical use for less than a decade and, compared with extensive experience with warfarin, there is uncertainty relating to optimal laboratory monitoring of anticoagulation, perioperative management and treatment of bleeding.3 In addition, there is currently only one drug licensed in the UK for rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effect of a DOAC. Here, we review DOAC-related bleeding and the role of drugs to reverse the anticoagulant action of DOACs.

### Special considerations for therapeutic choice of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for Japanese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^09e7b017]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is known as a risk factor for stroke. It was reported that approximately 20% of hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke in Japan had AF complications. 1 Warfarin has been used to prevent AF‐associated stroke for more than 50 years, but warfarin treatment is a burden for patients and physicians because it requires a dose adjustment achieved by monitoring the prothrombin time–international normalized ratio (PT‐INR). Warfarin also interacts with food and many other drugs.

Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were developed to overcome these disadvantages of warfarin, and the efficacy and safety of NOACs have been tested in comparative studies with warfarin as a control. In recent years, several NOACs have become available. Based on the results of phase 3 clinical trials, Savelieva and Camm presented a chart (the Camm chart) to help physicians choose the best available NOAC in light of each patient's condition. 2 However, because the chart was created based on the results of international collaborative clinical trials, it must be used carefully for Japanese patients.

First, the therapeutic range of warfarin's PT‐INR for Japanese patients is different from that for patients in other countries. The range of 1.6 to 2.6 is recommended for Japanese elderly patients (age ≥ 70 years), whereas a range of 2.0 to 3.0 is recommended in the EU and US guidelines. 3 This difference in the therapeutic range in INR is based on the higher incidence of warfarin‐related intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in Asians, including Japanese. 4

Based on the present review, therefore, we propose a method for selecting NOACs for Japanese patients with AF based on the results of subanalyses of Asian patients in the following clinical trials: Randomized Evaluation of Long‐term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE‐LY), 5 Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF), 6 and Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE), 7 as well as the Japanese–ROCKET AF (J‐ROCKET AF) study in which Japanese patients participated. 8

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^5c6e3fc2]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulants can be classified into conventional vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (Table 1). The prototype drug among VKAs is warfarin, which until recently was the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant worldwide. Acenocoumarol, fluindione, and phenprocoumon are the other less commonly used VKAs. Based on their mechanism of action, DOACs are classified into direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) and direct factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1.
Mechanism of action of oral anticoagulants. Modified from Mavrakanas and Bounameaux. DOACs, direct oral anticoagulants; Vit K, vitamin K; VKORC 1, vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1.

As compared to VKAs, DOACs have certain pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic advantages. They have a rapid onset of action, more predictable anticoagulation profile, wider therapeutic window, no need for monitoring, and fewer food-drug and drug-drug interactions. Several meta-analyses of large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with atrial fibrillation have shown that DOACs are superior (dabigatran 150 mg and apixaban) or noninferior (dabigatran 110 mg, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) to VKAs in terms of stroke prevention, with similar (dabigatran 150 mg) or lower bleeding rates (dabigatran 110 mg, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban). Current guidelines thus advocate DOACs as the first-choice oral anticoagulant except in certain situations, such as mechanical heart valves, patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis, antiphospholipid syndrome, or patients requiring a higher net anticoagulation (international normalized ratio [INR] > 3).

### Switching warfarin to direct oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation: insights from the NCDR PINNACLE registry [^35feef68]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Anticoagulation significantly decreases stroke risk in atrial fibrillation (AF). 1 Although warfarin was previously the standard treatment for stroke prevention in AF, direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) medications have been approved for nonvalvular AF since 2010. Compared to warfarin, these medications have been shown to provide more consistent anticoagulant effect, substantially reduce the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, have fewer interactions with other drugs/food, and do not require international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring. 2, 3 As a result, the 2019 update to the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) AF guidelines favor the use of DOACs over warfarin for stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF with a class 1A recommendation. 4

Previous studies from the National Cardiovascular Disease Registry's (NCDR) Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence (PINNACLE) registry have examined patterns of DOAC use in AF, and have noted disparities in DOAC use based on sex, race, and insurance status. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 However, these analyses have focused exclusively on patients newly initiating anticoagulation for AF. There is limited data evaluating how commonly patients on warfarin are switched to DOACs and why they are switched. 7 The NCDR PINNACLE registry longitudinally follows patients with AF, providing insight into patterns of switching oral anticoagulant therapy and identifying patient and practice‐level factors associated with switching. 10

Accordingly, we sought to examine patterns of anticoagulation among patients with AF treated with warfarin, determine predictors of switching from warfarin to DOACs, and identify potential disparities in care based on sociodemographic and clinical factors. We hypothesized that there would be significant disparities in switching patterns and substantial patient/practice‐level variations.

### Evaluation of the novel factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: design and rationale for the effective aNticoaGulation with factor xA next GEneration in atrial fibrillation-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction study 48 (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48) [^d80166c9]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin K antagonists have been the standard oral antithrombotic used for more than a half century for prevention and treatment of thromboembolism. Their limitations include multiple food and drug interactions and need for frequent monitoring and dose adjustments. Edoxaban is a selective and direct factor Xa inhibitor that may provide effective, safe, and more convenient anticoagulation.

Study Design

ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multinational, noninferiority design megatrial comparing 2 exposure strategies of edoxaban to warfarin. Approximately 20,500 subjects will be randomized to edoxaban high exposure (60 mg daily, adjusted for drug clearance), edoxaban low exposure (30 mg daily, adjusted for drug clearance), or warfarin titrated to an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. The edoxaban strategies provide for dynamic dose reductions in subjects with anticipated increased drug exposure. Blinded treatment is maintained through the use of sham international normalized ratios in patients receiving edoxaban. Eligibility criteria include electrical documentation of atrial fibrillation ≤ 12 months and a CHADS(2) score ≥ 2. Randomization is stratified by CHADS(2) score and anticipated drug exposure. The primary objective is to determine whether edoxaban is noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism. The primary safety end point is modified International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding. Recruitment began in November 2008. The expected median follow-up is 24 months.

Conclusions

ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 is a phase 3 comparison of the novel oral factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban to warfarin for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Multivitamin supplements may affect warfarin anticoagulation in susceptible patients [^9080e4bf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report an interaction of a multivitamin preparation containing small amounts of vitamin K(1) (25 microg) with warfarin in a case series and to assess the prevalence of vitamin K(1) deficiency in ambulatory anticoagulated patients.

Case Summaries

We describe 3 patients whose anticoagulation was stabilized with warfarin in whom initiation or cessation of a self-prescribed multivitamin supplement delivering 25 microg of vitamin K(1) daily was associated with an otherwise unexplained significant fall or rise in international normalized ratio (INR), respectively, with major thrombosis or hemorrhage in 2. This interaction was rated probable on the Naranjo probability scale. Suspecting vitamin K(1) deficiency as an explanation for this oversensitivity, we assessed the prevalence of vitamin K(1) deficiency in our clinic by determining plasma vitamin K(1) levels in 179 stable consecutive patients, finding very low levels (< 0.1 ng/mL) in 22 of 179 (12%).

Discussion

Vitamin K(1) supplements of 25 microg daily are far below the dose thought to affect anticoagulant control. We hypothesize that, in our patients, unsuspected vitamin K(1) deficiency caused an oversensitivity to small vitamin K(1) supplements. In patients with low vitamin K(1) status, even such low doses represent a significant increment in daily intake, thus lowering the sensitivity to warfarin. Our analysis suggests that low vitamin K(1) status exists in a small, but important, minority of ambulatory patients undergoing anticoagulation.

Conclusions

Clinicians should instruct anticoagulated patients to report the use of multivitamin supplements and inquire about it in cases of unexplained INR changes.

2.4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation

Warfarin sodium tablets have a narrow therapeutic range (index), and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during warfarin sodium tablets therapy. Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with warfarin sodium tablets as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of warfarin sodium tablets therapy.

2.5 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal failure. Monitor INR more frequently in patients with compromised renal function to maintain INR within the therapeutic range [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.6 Missed Dose

The anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium tablets persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose of warfarin sodium tablets at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose.

2.7 Treatment During Dentistry and Surgery

Some dental or surgical procedures may necessitate the interruption or change in the dose of warfarin sodium tablets therapy. Consider the benefits and risks when discontinuing warfarin sodium tablets even for a short period of time. Determine the INR immediately prior to any dental or surgical procedure. In patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures who must be anticoagulated prior to, during, or immediately following these procedures, adjusting the dosage of warfarin sodium tablets to maintain the INR at the low end of the therapeutic range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation.

### Analysis of anticoagulation therapy and anticoagulation-related outcomes among Asian patients after mechanical valve replacement [^6e612401]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

To balance the thromboembolic and bleeding risk, regular monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) is indispensable during warfarin therapy. Factors such as drug and food interaction, age, sex, and race may all affect bleeding risk. Obtaining an optimal INR can prevent complications. According to the 2021 European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (ESC/EACTS) and 2020 AHA/ACC guidelines, the INR targets for AVR and MVR are 2.5 and 3.0 respectively. All current guidelines are based on trials involving European and US populations. However, the clinical INR range for Europeans and US residents is considerably higher than that for the Asian population. Various studies have also reported that anticoagulant requirements vary according to racial background, but precise studies are still lacking. We hypothesized that for an Asian population, an INR target lower than that recommended in current guidelines is preferable.

Thus, this study investigated the association between INR range and the incidence of bleeding and thromboembolism by using a multicenter medical database. The objective of this study was to examine the optimal INR target for an Asian population after mechanical AVR or MVR.

### Oral anticoagulants for prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation: systematic review, network meta-analysis, and cost effectiveness analysis [^8831ca7e]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation roughly doubles with each decade of age, rising to almost 9% at 80–90 years. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic stroke fivefold, as a result of blood pooling in the left atrium and systemic embolisation to the brain. More than a fifth of the 130 000 annual strokes in England and Wales are attributed to atrial fibrillation (annual incidence of 114 in 100 000). Patients with thromboembolic stroke from atrial fibrillation have higher mortality, higher morbidity, and longer hospital stays than patients with other stroke subtypes.

The oral anticoagulant warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is effective for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, bleeding associated with warfarin is among the top five reasons for hospital stays, secondary to adverse drug effects, in England. Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic index as well as problematic drug and dietary interactions. The international normalised ratio (INR) requires monitoring (through hospital, primary care, anticoagulation clinics based in pharmacies, or by home monitoring with clinic support) to ensure optimal warfarin efficacy while limiting the risk of bleeding. Such monitoring is a large proportion of the overall cost of warfarin use, estimated at £90 million annually in the National Health Service (NHS) in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Because of its perceived risk and inconvenience warfarin is underused, particularly in those at high risk of stroke. It is estimated that only 46% of those who should be on warfarin are receiving it, with up to 40% of these not in the optimal therapeutic range of 2.0–3.0 INR units.

### Betrixaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: results of a phase 2, randomized, dose-ranging study (explore-Xa) [^3aadfd89]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia that affects an estimated 7 million people in the USA and the European Union with a median age of 75 years. The greatest risk associated with AF is ischaemic stroke resulting from embolism of thrombus from the left atrium. Guidelines recommend treatment with a vitamin K antagonist for stroke prevention in patients with AF based on the results of randomized, controlled trials comparing warfarin with placebo or no warfarin. – The use of warfarin is challenging because it has an unpredictable anticoagulant effect, a high propensity for food and drug interactions, and a risk of significant bleeding. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of contemporary randomized clinical trials comprising over 50 000 patient-years on warfarin revealed major bleeding rates ranging from 1.4 to 3.4% per year, and are likely higher outside the confines of a clinical trial. Routine coagulation monitoring is required, which is inconvenient for patients and costly for the health care system.

Thrombin plays a key role in arterial and venous thromboses by activating platelets and facilitating the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Recently, dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has been shown to be superior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke with improved ease of use; and is available in many countries. Factor Xa is also an attractive target for anticoagulant therapy as it is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Rivaroxaban and apixaban, factor Xa inhibitors, have been shown to be effective for stroke prevention in AF. –

Betrixaban is an oral, once-daily, direct factor Xa inhibitor. It is rapidly absorbed with mean peak concentrations occurring 3 to 4 h after oral administration, a pharmacodynamic half-life of 20 h and a low peak-to-trough concentration ratio over each 24 h dosing period. Oral bioavailability of an 80 mg dose is 34% and protein binding is ∼60%. Betrixaban is mostly excreted unchanged in bile, with low (17%) renal excretion. When administered immediately after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast, C max and AUC were reduced by ∼50% compared with the fasting state. Betrixaban is a substrate for efflux proteins, including P-glycoprotein; however, it is not a substrate for major CYP enzymes.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^af2e94ec]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hemorrhage

Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4.0), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)], certain concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)], and long duration of warfarin therapy.

Perform regular monitoring of INR in all treated patients. Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding.

Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Instruct patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.2 Tissue Necrosis

Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other tissues, which is an uncommon but serious risk (< 0.1%). Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin sodium therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported.

Careful clinical evaluation is required to determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

5.3 Calciphylaxis

Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium uremic arteriolopathy, which has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat calciphylaxis as appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy.

### Oral vitamin K lowers the international normalized ratio more rapidly than subcutaneous vitamin K in the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy. A randomized, controlled trial [^219b48e7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Excessive anticoagulation due to warfarin use is associated with hemorrhage. Subcutaneously administered vitamin K has not been evaluated for the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy, yet it is widely used.

Objective

To show that oral vitamin K is more effective than subcutaneous vitamin K in the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy.

Design

Randomized, controlled trial.

Setting

Two teaching hospitals.

Patients

Patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0.

Intervention

Warfarin therapy was withheld, and 1 mg of vitamin K was given orally or subcutaneously.

Measurements

The primary outcome measure was the INR on the day after administration of vitamin K. Secondary outcome measures were hemorrhage and thrombosis during a 1-month follow-up period.

Results

15 of 26 patients receiving oral vitamin K and 6 of 25 patients receiving subcutaneous vitamin K had therapeutic INRs on the day after study drug administration (P = 0.015; odds ratio, 4.32 [95% CI, 1.13 to 17.44]).

Conclusion

Oral vitamin K lowers INR more rapidly than subcutaneous vitamin K in asymptomatic patients who have supratherapeutic INR values while receiving warfarin.

### Factor Xa and thrombin as targets for new oral anticoagulants [^531ca201]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Although currently available anticoagulants are effective for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders, they have several drawbacks. Low molecular weight heparin and fondaparinux produce a predictable level of anticoagulation that obviates the need for coagulation monitoring, but they must be given parenterally, which renders them inconvenient for long-term use. Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, are administered orally, but produce a variable anticoagulant response because genetic polymorphisms, dietary vitamin K intake and multiple drug-drug interactions affect their metabolism. Consequently, coagulation monitoring and frequent dose adjustments are needed to ensure that a therapeutic level of anticoagulation is achieved. This is burdensome for patients and physicians, and costly for the healthcare system. These limitations have prompted the development of new oral anticoagulants that target thrombin or factor Xa. The new agents produce such a predictable anticoagulant response that they can be given in fixed doses without monitoring. This paper focuses on the new oral anticoagulants in the most advanced stages of development.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Warfarin was not present in human milk from mothers treated with warfarin from a limited published study. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including bleeding in a breastfed infant, consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need for warfarin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from warfarin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition before prescribing warfarin sodium to a lactating woman.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor breastfeeding infants for bruising or bleeding.

Data

Human Data

Based on published data in 15 nursing mothers, warfarin was not detected in human milk. Among the 15 full-term newborns, 6 nursing infants had documented prothrombin times within the expected range. Prothrombin times were not obtained for the other 9 nursing infants. Effects in premature infants have not been evaluated.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Pregnancy Testing

Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating warfarin sodium therapy.

Contraception

Females

Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the final dose of warfarin sodium.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Adequate and well-controlled studies with warfarin sodium have not been conducted in any pediatric population, and the optimum dosing, safety, and efficacy in pediatric patients is unknown. Pediatric use of warfarin sodium is based on adult data and recommendations, and available limited pediatric data from observational studies and patient registries. Pediatric patients administered warfarin sodium should avoid any activity or sport that may result in traumatic injury.

The developing hemostatic system in infants and children results in a changing physiology of thrombosis and response to anticoagulants. Dosing of warfarin in the pediatric population varies by patient age, with infants generally having the highest, and adolescents having the lowest milligram per kilogram dose requirements to maintain target INRs. Because of changing warfarin requirements due to age, concomitant medications, diet, and existing medical condition, target INR ranges may be difficult to achieve and maintain in pediatric patients, and more frequent INR determinations are recommended. Bleeding rates varied by patient population and clinical care center in pediatric observational studies and patient registries.

Infants and children receiving vitamin K-supplemented nutrition, including infant formulas, may be resistant to warfarin therapy, while human milk-fed infants may be sensitive to warfarin therapy.

### Cardioembolic stroke: everything has changed [^bea4fdcb]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Variations in both intake of vitamin K from food, and changes in production of vitamin K by intestinal bacteria also will result in turbulence of the INR. A manoeuvre that may be helpful in reducing INR turbulence is to give a daily small oral dose of vitamin K. This would result in requirement for a higher dose of warfarin, but reduce turbulence of the INR.

With the exception of haemorrhages from amyloid angiopathy, virtually all intracerebral haemorrhages can be prevented by effective blood pressure control. In the medical arm of the North American Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, we reduced intracranial haemorrhage (including subarachnoid haemorrhage and haemorrhage from amyloid angiopathy) to 0.5% of strokes by insisting that site physicians increase antihypertensive medication whenever blood pressure was above the targets specified in the protocol.(Another article in this issue of the journal addresses control of resistant hypertension.) Most severe gastrointestinal haemorrhages can probably be prevented by diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori.

### Micro-mechanical blood clot testing using smartphones [^4be83a70]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The human body responds to injury with bleeding, followed by clot formation and eventually lysis. This carefully maintained homeostasis minimizes the risks of hemorrhage and inappropriate clotting like ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolus. However, for millions of people, medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves and genetic mutations increase the risk of morbidity and mortality from blood clotting. These individuals require lifelong administration of anticoagulation drugs such as warfarin, an effective medication but also one of the most common causes of hospitalization due to adverse drug events. Hence, medication effects must be closely monitored via frequent prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) tests to assess coagulation properties due to the drug's narrow therapeutic index and interactions with food and other medications. While newer anticoagulants that do not rely on regular PT/INR testing are increasing in popularity, studies show that warfarin remains the most commonly prescribed outpatient blood thinner.

PT/INR testing monitors extrinsic and common pathways of the coagulation cascade. These tests are usually performed in a laboratory on expensive equipment after separating plasma from whole blood. Home PT/INR monitors directly utilize blood and have been shown to lengthen the amount of time spent in the therapeutic range, decrease the risk of thromboembolism in young patients and improve patient satisfaction and quality of life. Time spent in the therapeutic window benefits patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation on warfarin, since the risk of bleeding is five times higher with overly aggressive anticoagulation and the risk of ischemic events is three times higher with insufficient anticoagulation compared to levels in the therapeutic range.

Despite the existence of several home PT/INR testing modules, access to affordable and accurate PT/INR testing remains a challenge. Patients in the United States are in the therapeutic range only about 64% of the time. Patients in developing countries like Botswana, Uganda, and India are in this range, only 40% of the time due to less frequent testing –. Despite the potential for improvements from home PT/INR testing, these devices cost hundreds of dollars, limiting their utility in resource-constrained environments.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart lesions [^60df95d6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. It was estimated to affect up to 6.1 million Americans in 2010, and since AF is more common with increasing age, it is predicted to affect 12.1 million in the United States by 2030. 1 AF increases the risk of stroke 5‐fold across all age groups, and AF‐related stroke incidence ranges from < 1% to > 20% per year in the absence of anticoagulation. 2 AF is implicated in ≈15% of all strokes in the United States. 3

Stroke prevention is central to the management of patients with AF. For many years, the use of oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin, described as a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), has been the standard therapy for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with AF. 4, 5 Warfarin is an inexpensive and effective therapeutic; however, its use is complicated by a narrow therapeutic window, which makes it difficult to maintain patients within a defined anticoagulation range. Additionally, warfarin is associated with numerous drug and dietary interactions, and its susceptibility to genetic variations makes dosage requirements vary widely among individuals. Regular blood monitoring and dose adjustment are necessary to maintain the international normalized ratio within the target therapeutic range.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^d4a72c9a]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — intermediate stroke risk (CHADS2 score = 1) management: For patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at intermediate risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score = 1), "we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy (Grade 1B)." The guideline also states "We suggest oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 2B) or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 2B)." Quantified 1-year effects for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy include, versus no therapy, "five fewer deaths and 15 fewer nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients at the cost of eight more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds"; versus aspirin, VKA is anticipated to "prevent nine nonfatal strokes for every 1,000 patients treated for 1 year compared with aspirin but will result in three additional bleeds and no reduction in all-cause mortality"; and versus aspirin plus clopidogrel, VKA is expected to result in "six fewer nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients over a 1-year period, anywhere from four fewer to three more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds, and no reduction in all-cause mortality." For patients unsuitable for or choosing not to take an oral anticoagulant for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding, such as "difficulty maintaining a stable INR, lifestyle limitations of regular INR monitoring, dietary restrictions that are too burdensome, or costs of new anticoagulant drugs that are too high," the text states that combination aspirin and clopidogrel "provides additional benefit of stroke reduction at the cost of additional bleeding" and that they "should be informed that they are choosing an inferior treatment with regard to stroke prevention."

Drug: Warfarin — mechanism, dosing target, and determinants of dose: Warfarin is administered orally as a racemic mixture of S-warfarin and R-warfarin and specifically inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase, reducing activation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic index with concentration-dependent risks of bleeding or lack of efficacy. Clinically, dosing is tailored to the international normalized ratio with a target INR of 2 to 3 for most indications, and genetic variants along with age, body size, vitamin K intake, comorbidities, and concomitant medications contribute to warfarin sensitivity and dose requirements.

### Using lean six sigma methodologies to reduce risk of warfarin medication omission at hospital discharge [^b1e245e7]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

In an urban tertiary care 500 bed hospital in Illinois, USA, chart review of every new start warfarin patient managed with one-time warfarin doses between July and August 2016 revealed one patient/month discharged without warfarin, despite the intent to continue therapy.

Warfarin (Coumadin) is an anticoagulant indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and reduces the risk of death and thromboembolic events including stroke and embolisation after myocardial infarction. Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic index, requires daily dosing, has multiple drug–drug and drug–food interactions, and requires close monitoring of prothrombin time/international normalised ratio (INR). Unintentional anticoagulant omission increases the risk of a thromboembolic event.

At our institution, prescribers are primarily responsible for appropriate warfarin management. Order sets and clinical decision support which includes dose range, allergy and drug–drug interaction checking are available to assist and guide the safe and effective use of warfarin. Clinical rules and alerts are used in the electronic health record (EHR). Although we do not have a formal pharmacy warfarin dosing service, pharmacy plays an important role in the safe use of warfarin. Pharmacists evaluate warfarin therapy for appropriate dosing, duplicate therapy, drug–drug interactions, drug–disease interactions and drug–lab interactions. Pharmacists may order a baseline INR for patients starting warfarin therapy when one is not already available. Pharmacists monitor INR results and notify physicians of subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic INRs. Pharmacists also provide warfarin education to patients and families starting warfarin as a new medication. All warfarin doses are administered at a defined standard time of 1800. Nursing must review the INR result and document the INR prior to administering warfarin.

AZD0837 — mechanism, pharmacokinetics, formulations, and phase 2 findings in atrial fibrillation: AZD0837 is a prodrug metabolized by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 to AR-H067637, a selective and reversible direct inhibitor of thrombin; the half-life of AR-H067637 is 9 to 14 h in healthy subjects, and AZD0837 and its metabolites are excreted in the urine and the feces. The oral bioavailability of AZD0837 is in the range of 22% to 55%, with plasma levels peaking about 1.5 h after oral administration, and coadministration with food prolongs the time to peak by about 2 h. Both immediate-release and extended-release formulations have been developed, the extended-release form having potential for once-daily administration, and both formulations have been explored as alternatives to warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation. In a phase 2 study, the immediate release formulation (in doses of 150 or 350 mg) was compared with warfarin (dose-adjusted to achieve an INR of 2–3) in 250 patients; total bleeding events occurred in six patients at 150 mg, 15 at 350 mg, and eight with warfarin, and elevations in alanine aminotransferase were infrequent with similar rates to warfarin. An extended-release study compared 150, 300, and 450 mg once daily and 200 mg bid with warfarin (dose-adjusted to achieve an INR between 2.0 and 3.0) in 955 patients, with total bleeding events 5.3% to 14.7% with AZD0837 and 14.5% with warfarin; adverse events were similar overall, but gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea and nausea, were more frequent with AZD0837, and alanine aminotransferase elevations were similar. A second phase 2 study compared 150 or 300 mg once daily with standard therapy (nothing, aspirin, or clopidogrel) in 131 patients unwilling or unable to take a vitamin K antagonist for a median duration of 6 weeks; minor or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in none at 150 mg, five at 300 mg, and six with standard therapy, with no major bleeding events. Side effects of AZD0837 include dyspepsia and a reversible elevation in the serum creatinine level that appears to be the result of decreased inhibition of the tubular secretion of creatinine, and phase 3 trials have not yet been initiated.

### Supratherapeutic international normalized ratio due to reduced vitamin K intake secondary to prolonged vomiting in a patient on warfarin [^2fea8e72]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of prolonged vomiting during warfarin therapy, leading to an elevated international normalized ratio (INR).

Case Summary

A 32-year-old female with a history of cyclic vomiting syndrome since early childhood and bilateral pulmonary emboli diagnosed 4 months prior to this acute event presented to the clinic for routine monitoring of warfarin therapy. The warfarin dose had been maintained at 35 mg/wk for 3½ months (INR 2–3.5), but it was increased to 37.5 mg/wk because the INR had trended down to the low goal range over the preceding month. At presentation, the patient reported a 15-day history of vomiting with minimal oral intake that required intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration. The INR was 4.7; warfarin was withheld, and oral vitamin K 5 mg as well as subcutaneous vitamin K 10 mg was administered the following day. The INR then decreased to 1.3. Therapy was transitioned to subcutaneous enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours for the duration of the patient's anticoagulation therapy.

Discussion

Multiple reports have demonstrated malabsorption of warfarin and decreased INR response in the presence of underlying gastrointestinal disease. Despite a prolonged episode of cyclic vomiting syndrome, our patient had an elevated INR. In normal circumstances, warfarin is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and reaches maximum serum concentrations in approximately 90 minutes. Studies have shown that although the presence of food does not affect overall absorption of the medication, it can decrease the rate of absorption. Our patient was vomiting 20–30 minutes after oral dose administration. Because the patient was not consuming food, absorption of warfarin was potentially prompt, thus contributing to the elevated INR. The variability of vitamin K in the diet also can have significant impact on the response to warfarin. Our patient's INR had been stable while she consumed 3 servings each week of foods rich in vitamin K. This consumption was abruptly discontinued with the onset of the cyclic vomiting syndrome. We believe that decreased intake and retention of oral vitamin K-containing foods from the diet due to the prolonged vomiting coupled with the rapid onset of absorption resulted in a notably increased INR and subsequent bruising in our patient.

Conclusions

In the presence of prolonged vomiting, warfarin therapy requires more frequent monitoring than usual to detect fluctuations in INR that may increase the risk of adverse events.

### Rivaroxaban vs warfarin in acute left ventricular thrombus following myocardial infarction: RIVAWAR, an open-label RCT [^8f38662f]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute left ventricular thrombus (LVT), a serious complication of myocardial infarction (MI), poses a significant risk of embolic events and death. Its incidence varies based on infarct characteristics, timing of intervention, and imaging methods. Meta-analyses report LVT rates of 2.7% to 6.3% in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 9.1% to 12.2% in anterior STEMI, and up to 19.2% in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% in the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) era. LVT poses a significant risk of embolic complications, with an estimated stroke rate of 16%, which increases with subtherapeutic anticoagulation.

Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, remains the first-line therapy for LVT and is Food and Drug Administration–approved for this indication. Although effective in preventing thromboembolic events when the international normalized ratio (INR) is maintained within the therapeutic range, warfarin has several limitations. These include the need for frequent INR monitoring, a delayed onset of action, and susceptibility to drug and food interactions. In addition, warfarin use is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, particularly in post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients who require dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).

Warfarin clinical modifiers — several conditions and exposures influence responsiveness and dosing; "Hepatic dysfunction potentiates the response to warfarin," and such patients may appear "auto-anticoagulated" with elevated INRs that are "not sufficient to prevent thromboembolism." "Hypermetabolic states" from fever or hyperthyroidism "increase warfarin responsiveness," while cigarette smoke components "may induce CYP1A2," with warfarin dose requirements "observed to decline after smoking cessation." Chewing tobacco "contains high quantities of vitamin K that can increase warfarin dose requirements," heart failure exacerbations "can increase responsiveness," and end-stage renal disease with reduced "CYP2C9" activity leads to "lower warfarin dosing requirements." With advanced age, "Warfarin dosing requirements decline," and "age may be the single most important easily obtained predictor of warfarin dosing requirement."

### Ximelagatran versus warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. SPORTIF II: a dose-guiding, tolerability, and safety study [^6718f245]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to compare the tolerability and safety of three fixed doses of ximelagatran versus warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

Background

Anticoagulants such as warfarin lower the risk of stroke in patients with NVAF. Ximelagatran is a novel, oral direct thrombin inhibitor with predictable pharmacokinetics and no known food or pharmacokinetic drug interactions.

Methods

This was a 12-week, randomized, parallel-group, dose-guiding study of NVAF patients with at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary end point was the number of thromboembolic events and bleedings. Three groups received ximelagatran (n = 187) at 20, 40, or 60 mg twice daily, given in a double-blind fashion, without routine coagulation monitoring. In a fourth group, warfarin (n = 67) was managed and monitored according to normal routines, aiming for an International Normalized Ratio of 2.0 to 3.0.

Results

A total of 254 patients received study drug. One ischemic stroke (nonfatal) and one transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurred in the ximelagatran group. Two TIAs occurred in the warfarin group. No major bleeds were observed in the ximelagatran group. One major bleed occurred in a warfarin-treated patient. The number of minor and multiple minor bleeds was low, but there was a slight increase by ximelagatran dose. The 60-mg dose resulted in the same number of bleeding events as that with warfarin. S-alanine aminotransferase was increased in eight patients (4.3%) taking ximelagatran, but normalized with continuous treatment or cessation of the drug.

Conclusions

Fixed oral doses of ximelagatran up to 60 mg twice daily were well tolerated, without the need for dose adjustment or coagulation monitoring.
