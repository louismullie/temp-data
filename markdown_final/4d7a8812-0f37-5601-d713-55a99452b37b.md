## Question

Distended abdomen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a distended abdomen. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing bloating from true distension and establishing the clinical context. Then, I should verify alarm features that mandate urgent workup. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis by pathophysiology and outline a targeted diagnostic approach. After that, I need to appraise special populations and red flags. Finally, I will synthesize management strategies, including mechanism-specific therapies and follow-up, while double-checking where the evidence is strong versus uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the foundational distinction: bloating is a subjective sensation of fullness or pressure, whereas distension is a measurable increase in abdominal girth. Patients often conflate these, so I need to ask explicitly whether the abdomen visibly enlarges and, if so, whether it fluctuates or is persistent, because that shapes both the differential and urgency of evaluation [^3260c058] [^2a696d24].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should screen for alarm features that override routine pathways and push me toward immediate imaging and specialty input: unintentional weight loss, GI bleeding, persistent vomiting, iron-deficiency anemia, family history of GI malignancy or IBD, new-onset dyspepsia or pain, or an abnormal exam with a mass or organomegaly. In women over 50, visible distension raises concern for ovarian cancer and warrants expedited imaging and CA-125, given the population-level risk signal even though PPVs are modest in primary care [^0ed4201f] [^9e3cc9f5] [^fedee32f].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiologic buckets to structure the differential: increased intra-abdominal volume (gas, stool, fluid, mass), decreased abdominal compliance (obesity, pregnancy, abdominal wall hernia, tight binders), and abnormal viscero-somatic responses such as abdominophrenic dyssynergia. I need to ensure I keep functional disorders in perspective, as they are common but diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out organic disease when alarm features are present [^2a696d24] [^e0d17236] [^31db1b51].

> I will now examine gas-related causes. Excess intestinal gas alone rarely explains marked visible distension in functional disorders; instead, impaired gas handling and transit with visceral hypersensitivity are more typical, and SIBO can contribute but is overdiagnosed. I should confirm risk factors and, if present, consider glucose or lactulose breath testing, while remembering that symptom overlap with non-SIBO DGBIs is substantial and that breath tests have imperfect specificity [^2a696d24] [^1bfaf95a] [^385ce5dd].

> Wait, let me verify the role of abdominophrenic dyssynergia. Multiple studies using CT and EMG show that episodic visible distension in functional patients is driven by paradoxical diaphragmatic descent coupled with anterior abdominal wall relaxation, redistributing contents and increasing girth without a major rise in intra-abdominal volume. Importantly, patients can learn to reverse this with biofeedback, which I should consider when distension is episodic and disproportionate to gas content [^31db1b51] [^385ce5dd] [^029e342c].

> Let me consider constipation and pelvic floor dysfunction. I should confirm stool form, frequency, straining, and sensation of incomplete evacuation, and if present, I need to check for dyssynergic defecation with anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion. Prolonged balloon expulsion predicts distension in constipated patients, and biofeedback is first-line therapy that improves both bloating and distension when dyssynergia is present [^b7d7544f] [^c2771e2e] [^611d4708].

> I should double-check for fluid-related etiologies. Ascites from cirrhosis, heart failure, malignancy, or tuberculosis presents with progressive, persistent distension and shifting dullness when volumes exceed about 1.5 liters; ultrasound is sensitive even for smaller volumes and guides diagnostic paracentesis with SAAG and cell count to distinguish portal hypertensive from other causes. In decompensated cirrhosis, ascites carries high 1-year mortality, so I need to stage severity and consider TIPS or palliative strategies when refractory [^cc24e4c6] [^af6c964c] [^bde7f294].

> But wait, what if the distension is acute and tympanic with pain and vomiting? I need to check for obstruction or volvulus. Plain radiographs can show air-fluid levels or a coffee-bean sign, but CT is definitive for differentiating mechanical obstruction from ileus and for identifying transition points. Cecal volvulus tends to be acute, whereas sigmoid volvulus is more indolent and recurrent; both can progress to ischemia, so I should not delay imaging when obstruction is suspected [^de326ab7] [^a3b98309].

> I need to ensure I do not miss abdominal compartment syndrome in the critically ill. Marked distension with oliguria, high ventilatory pressures, and hemodynamic compromise should prompt bladder pressure measurement; IAH is defined as sustained IAP ≥ 12 mmHg, and ACS as IAP > 20 mmHg with new organ dysfunction. Management hinges on treating the cause, decompressing the gut, evacuating fluid collections, and, if refractory, open abdomen decompression, with mortality high if unrecognized [^88dd8bce] [^669e758f].

> Let me think about special populations. In neonates and infants, distension at birth or shortly thereafter demands urgent evaluation for congenital obstruction, volvulus, Hirschsprung disease, or urinary tract obstruction with ascites. In older adults, ovarian cancer and sigmoid volvulus rise on the list, and medication-induced constipation or pseudo-obstruction is common. In pregnancy, physiologic relaxation of the abdominal wall and gravid uterus can mimic or exacerbate distension, but I should still rule out obstetric emergencies if pain or hypertension is present [^32c1931b] [^9e3cc9f5] [^de326ab7].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach in a stepwise fashion. Start with a careful history of timing, relation to meals, bowel habits, weight change, and medications. Examine for shifting dullness, masses, organomegaly, and hernias. Reserve labs for anemia, electrolytes, liver panel, TSH, and celiac serology when indicated. Use ultrasound first for suspected ascites, masses, or gallbladder disease, and escalate to CT when obstruction, malignancy, or volvulus is suspected. Avoid routine gastric emptying or motility testing unless nausea and vomiting are prominent or symptoms are refractory [^0ed4201f] [^0abed3ba] [^fe0c299a].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of endoscopy. Upper endoscopy is not routine for bloating or distension without alarm features; reserve it for dyspepsia, anemia, weight loss, or age-appropriate colorectal screening. Similarly, colonoscopy is indicated for age-appropriate screening, iron-deficiency anemia, or change in bowel habits, not for uncomplicated bloating alone [^0abed3ba].

> I will now examine management principles. For functional bloating and distension, education and expectation-setting are essential. Dietary strategies such as a structured low-FODMAP trial, lactose restriction if suspected, and fiber titration can help. Probiotics have not shown consistent benefit for bloating or distension and are not routinely recommended. For abdominophrenic dyssynergia, diaphragmatic breathing and respiratory-targeted biofeedback reduce distension and improve quality of life. For constipation-predominant symptoms, treat constipation and consider pelvic floor biofeedback when dyssynergia is present [^2a696d24] [^7f3ef34a] [^029e342c] [^611d4708].

> Let me reconsider pharmacologic options. Antispasmodics like hyoscyamine can be tried for cramping and bloating, though evidence is limited. Neuromodulators such as low-dose TCAs or SNRIs may help when visceral hypersensitivity or comorbid anxiety is prominent. Prokinetics are reserved for documented gastroparesis or severe dysmotility after specialist evaluation. And for refractory ascites, step from salt restriction and diuretics to TIPS or tunneled peritoneal catheters in carefully selected patients, balancing encephalopathy and infection risks [^2a696d24] [^7fb9a631] [^bde7f294].

> I should double-check follow-up and safety netting. Reassess in 4–6 weeks to confirm response to diet, constipation therapy, or biofeedback. If alarm features emerge or distension becomes persistent and progressive, escalate to cross-sectional imaging and targeted testing. In women over 50 with new, persistent distension, maintain a low threshold for ovarian cancer evaluation with ultrasound and CA-125, recognizing that early disease can present with subtle symptoms [^0ed4201f] [^9e3cc9f5].

> In summary, I need to ensure I distinguish bloating from distension, screen rigorously for alarm features, and then tailor testing to the most likely pathophysiology: gas handling and visceral hypersensitivity, constipation with pelvic floor dysfunction, abdominophrenic dyssynergia, fluid accumulation, or mechanical obstruction. By aligning therapy with mechanism — dietary modification, pelvic floor biofeedback, respiratory biofeedback, or disease-specific interventions — outcomes improve and unnecessary testing is avoided [^2a696d24] [^6f633c64] [^385ce5dd].

A distended abdomen is a **visible increase in abdominal girth** [^3260c058] and can reflect gas, fluid, stool, fat, or mass. The most common causes are **constipation, IBS, and ascites** [^2a696d24], but red flags (weight loss, bleeding, vomiting, severe pain) require urgent evaluation [^0ed4201f]. Initial workup should include a focused history, exam, CBC, CMP, and abdominal ultrasound [^0ed4201f]; CT is reserved for alarm features or unclear cases [^0ed4201f]. Management is cause-specific: treat constipation/IBS with diet, laxatives, and pelvic floor therapy [^6f633c64]; manage ascites with salt restriction, diuretics, and paracentesis [^cc24e4c6]; and use biofeedback for abdominophrenic dyssynergia [^029e342c]. Persistent or progressive distension, especially with red flags, needs **prompt imaging and specialist referral** [^0ed4201f].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** underlie abdominal distension:

- **Increased intraluminal gas**: Commonly associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional bloating [^2a696d24] [^e0d17236].

- **Fluid accumulation**: Ascites, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and malignancy can cause significant fluid accumulation, leading to marked abdominal distension [^af6c964c].

- **Solid mass or organomegaly**: Tumors, cysts, or organ enlargement (e.g. hepatomegaly, splenomegaly) can cause localized or generalized distension [^e9593b7b].

- **Abnormal abdominal wall mechanics**: Abdominophrenic dyssynergia, characterized by paradoxical diaphragmatic contraction and relaxation of the anterior abdominal wall, contributes to visible distension in functional disorders [^31db1b51] [^385ce5dd].

## Common causes of abdominal distension

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Functional gastrointestinal disorders | - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [^2a696d24] <br/> - Functional bloating [^3260c058] <br/> - Functional constipation [^c48013a8] |
| Organic gastrointestinal conditions | - Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) [^1bfaf95a] <br/> - Celiac disease [^0abed3ba] <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [^e9593b7b] <br/> - Bowel obstruction (mechanical or functional) [^de326ab7] <br/> - Gastroparesis [^7fb9a631] |
| Ascites | - Liver cirrhosis [^af6c964c] <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Malignancy (e.g. ovarian, peritoneal) [^9e3cc9f5] <br/> - Nephrotic syndrome [^af6c964c] |
| Abdominal masses | - Tumors (benign or malignant) [^e9593b7b] <br/> - Cysts <br/> - Organomegaly (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly) |
| Abnormal abdominal wall mechanics | - Abdominophrenic dyssynergia [^31db1b51] <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Pregnancy |

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough **clinical evaluation** is essential to determine the underlying cause:

- **History**: Onset, duration, progression, associated symptoms (pain, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, changes in bowel habits), dietary habits, medication use, and family history [^0ed4201f].

- **Physical examination**: Inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation to assess for organomegaly, masses, fluid accumulation (shifting dullness), and bowel obstruction [^cc24e4c6].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), liver function tests, thyroid function tests, celiac serology, and urinalysis as indicated [^0ed4201f].

- **Imaging studies**: Abdominal ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice, particularly for detecting ascites, organomegaly, or masses. Computed tomography (CT) is indicated for suspected obstruction, malignancy, or when ultrasound findings are inconclusive [^0ed4201f].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **stepwise diagnostic approach** is recommended:

- **Initial evaluation**: History, physical examination, and basic laboratory tests (CBC, CMP, liver function tests) [^0ed4201f].

- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound as the first-line imaging study; CT scan if ultrasound is inconclusive or if malignancy, obstruction, or complex pathology is suspected [^0ed4201f].

- **Specialized tests**: Breath tests for SIBO, gastric emptying studies for gastroparesis, anorectal manometry for pelvic floor dysfunction, and endoscopy for suspected organic gastrointestinal conditions [^0abed3ba].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Functional gastrointestinal disorders**: Dietary modifications (low FODMAP diet, lactose-free diet), probiotics, antispasmodics, neuromodulators, and biofeedback therapy for abdominophrenic dyssynergia [^2a696d24] [^029e342c].

- **Ascites**: Sodium restriction, diuretics (spironolactone, furosemide), therapeutic paracentesis, and management of underlying liver disease or malignancy [^cc24e4c6].

- **Bowel obstruction**: Nasogastric decompression, surgical intervention if mechanical obstruction is present [^notfound].

- **Abdominal masses**: Surgical resection, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy depending on the nature of the mass [^notfound].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention

Certain symptoms associated with abdominal distension require **immediate medical evaluation**:

- **Severe abdominal pain**: Sudden onset, severe, or persistent pain [^notfound].

- **Vomiting**: Persistent vomiting, especially with inability to pass stool or gas [^notfound].

- **Weight loss**: Unintentional weight loss (> 10% of body weight) [^0ed4201f].

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Hematemesis or melena [^0ed4201f].

- **Signs of peritonitis**: Rebound tenderness, rigidity, or guarding [^notfound].

---

Abdominal distension is a common clinical finding with a broad differential diagnosis. A **structured approach** — history, examination, targeted labs, and imaging — is essential to identify the cause and guide therapy. Most cases are benign and manageable, but red flags warrant **urgent evaluation** to exclude serious disease [^0ed4201f].

Abdominal bloating and distention — Rome IV definitions and diagnostic scope indicate that abdominal bloating is a subjective sensation, whereas abdominal distention is a visible increase in abdominal girth; the Rome IV criteria define functional bloating and distention as DGBIs with recurrent symptoms of abdominal fullness or pressure or a visible increase in abdominal girth with symptoms at least 1 day per week and active for 3 months, with onset of 6 months, and without a predominance of pain and alteration in bowel habits. Rome IV has an abdominal bloating and distention category that is separate from other DGBIs. A large global population-based study found a prevalence as high as 3.5% (4.6% in women and 2.4% in men), and bloating and distention are much more prevalent (> 50%) when associated with other DGBIs such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), constipation, and FD. When the Rome IV diagnostic criteria are met, the patient should not fulfill criteria for a diagnosis of IBS, functional constipation, functional diarrhea, or FD, and diagnostic testing will depend on an algorithmic approach based on presumptive causes.

### Bloating and abdominal distension: old misconceptions and current knowledge [^0920dbe1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Bloating, as a symptom and abdominal distension, as a sign, are both common functional-type complaints and challenging to manage effectively. Individual patients may weight differently the impact of bloating and distension on their well-being. Complaints may range from chronic highly distressing pain to simply annoying and unfashionable protrusion of the abdomen. To avoid mishaps, organic bloating, and distension should always be considered first and appropriated assessed. Functional bloating and distension often present in association with other manifestations of irritable bowel syndrome or functional dyspepsia and in that context patients tend to regard them as most troublesome. A mechanism-based management bloating and distension should be ideal but elucidating key operational mechanisms in individual patients is not always feasible. Some clues may be gathered through a detailed dietary history, by assessing bowel movement frequency and stool consistency and special imaging technique to measure abdominal shape during episodes of distension. In severe, protracted cases it may be appropriate to refer the patient to a specialized center where motility, visceral sensitivity, and abdominal muscle activity in response to intraluminal stimuli may be measured. Therapeutic resources focussed upon presumed or demonstrated pathogenetic mechanism include dietary modification, microbiome modulation, promoting gas evacuation, attenuating visceral perception, and controlling abdominal wall muscle activity via biofeedback.

### Management of chronic abdominal distension and bloating [^2a696d24]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal bloating and distension are 2 of the most commonly reported gastrointestinal symptoms. Abdominal bloating is characterized by symptoms of trapped gas, abdominal pressure, and fullness. Abdominal distension is defined as a measurable increase in abdominal girth. These symptoms frequently co-exist, although they can occur separately. Defined by Rome IV criteria, functional abdominal bloating and distension commonly coincide with other functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and functional constipation. Abdominal bloating and distension can develop for multiple reasons, including food intolerances, a previous infection that perturbed the intestinal microbiota, disordered visceral sensation, delayed intestinal transit, or an abnormal viscero-somatic reflux. Treatment can be challenging to patients and providers-no regimen has been consistently successful. Successful treatment involves identifying the etiology, assessing severity, educating and reassuring patients, and setting expectations. Therapeutic options include dietary changes, probiotics, antibiotics, prokinetic agents, antispasmodics, neuromodulators, and biofeedback. We review the epidemiology and effects of chronic bloating and distension and pathophysiology, discuss appropriate diagnostic strategies, and assess available treatment options.

Diagnostic testing and imaging for bloating and distention — testing is selective and guided by alarm features and examination. "Symptoms of bloating and distention do not routinely require laboratory testing or obtaining radiologic imaging or endoscopy unless the history discloses concerning symptoms, an abdominal physical examination, or alarm features." The authors "advise ordering tests with worsening dyspepsia or abdominal pain, particularly of recent onset; vomiting; GI bleeding; unintentional weight loss > 10% of body weight; chronic diarrhea; or a family history of GI malignancy, CD, or inflammatory bowel disease." If visible abdominal distension is present, "an abdominal examination will help to evaluate for an abdominal mass," and with abnormal findings, "Any abnormalities would lead to a computed tomography scan or ultrasound of the abdomen to evaluate for ascites or a mass or to identify increased bowel gas due to ileus, obstruction, or pseudo-obstruction." The text adds, "Bloating and abdominal fullness are often presenting symptoms in patients with ovarian cancer; the highest risk is in women 50 years or older."

### The pathogenesis of bloating and visible distension in irritable bowel syndrome [^29404106]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal bloating is a relevant, troublesome, and poorly understood clinical problem. Despite its clinical importance, bloating remains substantially ignored, without proper clinical classification, known pathophysiology, and effective treatment. It is not even clear to what extent the complaints of individual patients correlate with objective evidence of abdominal distension, and this uncertainly regarding the subjective or objective origin of the complaints further adds to confusion. This article proposed a framework for investigating bloating, considering key factors potentially involved in its pathophysiology: distorted sensation, physical abdominal expansion, and abdominal wall dystony. Some data indicate that patients complaining of bloating have impaired transit and tolerance of intestinal gas loads. The problem does not seem to be too much gas, however, but rather abnormal responses to gas. Furthermore, abnormal control of abdominal muscle activity in these patients may contribute to objective distension. Bloating, like many other abdominal symptoms, probably represents a heterogeneous condition produced by a combination of pathophysiological mechanisms that differ among individual patients, resulting in a polymorphic clinical presentation.

### New insights into bloating and abdominal distension: is it all outlet obstruction? [^287253f9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

The sensation of bloating, a common but poorly understood problem, is the subject of two papers in this issue. The first study showed that patients with bloating as their main complaint have delayed clearance of infused gas from the colon, while the second study showed that bloaters had impaired defecation. Together, these studies suggest that behavioral factors may be important in this important symptom complex and propose novel approaches to its treatment.

### Abdominal bloating [^4bd96c18]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal bloating is a common and significant clinical problem that remains to be scientifically addressed. Bloating is one of the most bothersome complaints in patients with various functional gut disorders. However, in the current standard classification, abdominal bloating is merely regarded as a secondary descriptor, which masks its real clinical effect. Four factors are involved in the pathophysiology of bloating: a subjective sensation of abdominal bloating, objective abdominal distention, volume of intra-abdominal contents, and muscular activity of the abdominal wall. The primer to elicit subjective bloating may be any of the other 3 factors, or the sensation may be related to distorted perception. All of these mechanisms may play an independent role or may be interrelated. Gas transit studies have evidenced that patients with bloating have impaired reflex control of gut handling of contents. Segmental pooling, either of gas or of solid/liquid components, may induce a bloating sensation, particularly in patients with altered gut perception. Furthermore, altered viscerosomatic reflexes may contribute to abdominal wall protrusion and objective distention, even without major intra-abdominal volume increment. Bloating probably is a heterogeneous condition produced by a combination of pathophysiological mechanisms that differ among individual patients and that in most cases are subtle and undetectable by conventional methods. Further advances in the pathophysiology and clinical forms of bloating are warranted to develop mechanistic strategies rather than the current empiric treatment strategies for comprehensive and effective management of this problem.

1 INTRODUCTION

Abdominal distension is an important issue in clinical practice, because it affects a large proportion of patients with functional gut disorders and constitutes their most bothersome complaint. Frequently, patients complain of self‐limited episodes of visible abdominal distension (swollen abdomen with increase in girth) that appear as the day goes on and resolve after overnight rest. In between episodes, patients report their abdomen going back to normal (no visible distension) or some residual degree of mild distension.

Visible abdominal distension is frequently, but not necessarily, associated with sensation of increased abdominal pressure/tension (abdominal bloating), but not all sensation of bloating is accompanied by visible distension. The terms distension and bloating are sometimes used indistinctively, but if properly questioned, the patients clearly identify whether they are referring to visible distension, which is the object of the present study, or to sensation of increased abdominal pressure, and this distinction is key to understanding and management of their complaint. Epidemiological studies distinguishing visible distention and bloating are scarce. A large study in the general population reported that that about half of the subjects complaining of bloating also experienced visible distension. Another study found that among 542 IBS patients reporting bloating, 410 also reported distension.

Visible abdominal distension in patients with functional gut disorders has been attributed, without conclusive evidence, to multiple causes, for example, bacterial overgrowth, visceral hypersensitivity, dysbacteriosis, carbohydrate intolerance, abnormal motility. However, regardless of the underlying causes, the claim of self‐limited episodes of visible abdominal distension may originate by three basic mechanisms: distorted interpretation (patients believe their abdomen is visibly distended without objective evidence), transient increases of abdominal content (intestinal gas being the most likely candidate), or abnormal postural tone of the abdominal walls and redistribution of contents. The latter mechanism, termed abdominophrenic dyssynergia, was described by a series of studies, that measured the activity of the abdominal walls by means of abdominal CT imaging and/or abdominothoracic EMG recording and showed that episodes of abdominal distension were associated with a diaphragmatic push (increased tone and descent of the diaphragm), coupled with reduced tone and protrusion of the anterior abdominal wall.

### Towards a better understanding of abdominal bloating and distension in functional gastrointestinal disorders [^ccc129a3]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal bloating is an extremely common symptom affecting up to 96% of patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders and even 30% of the general population. To date bloating has often been viewed as being synonymous with an actual increase in abdominal girth, but recent evidence suggests that this is not necessarily the case. This review examines the relationship between the symptom of bloating and the physical sign of abdominal distension, as well as examining the epidemiology, pathophysiology and treatment options available for this debilitating aspect of the functional gastrointestinal disorders. Pathophysiological mechanisms explored include psychological factors, intestinal gas accumulation, fluid retention, food intolerance and malabsorption of sugars, weakness of abdominal musculature, and altered sensorimotor function. Treatment options are currently rather limited but include dietary changes, pharmacological approaches, probiotics and hypnotherapy.

Abdominal bloating and distention — diagnostic and treatment algorithm organizes care by branch labels and paired actions: Under "Is constipation present?" diagnosis includes "Detailed history with rectal exam," "Rome IV criteria for IBS-C, or chronic constipation," and "ARM to diagnose pelvic floor dyssynergia," with treatment to "Treat the constipation" and "Biofeedback therapy if dyssynergic defecation is present." For "Food intolerance?" treatment lists "Carbohydrate or FODMAP restriction" and "Gluten-free diet for CD or if suspected NCGS." For "Alarm symptoms (vomiting, weight loss > 10%, GI bleeding, FHx IBD) or recent worsening nausea or pain present?" diagnosis advises to "Consider CBC, CMP, other labs as indicated, KUB, abdominal ultrasound, CT/MRI, endoscopy to exclude structural abnormalities" and "Motility studies to diagnose gastroparesis, CIP, or other motility disorders," with treatment "Treatment based on clinical findings" and "Prokinetics for motility disorders." When "SIBO risk factors present?" diagnosis includes "Hydrogen-based breath testing with glucose or lactulose or small bowel aspirates." For "Abdominophrenic dyssynergia (APD) or visceral hypersensitivity (VH) suspected?" diagnosis notes "APD: abdominal distention not explained by increased intestinal gas, worse after meals" and "VH: abdominal pain, severe bloating," and treatment includes "Diaphragmatic breathing," "Central neuromodulators," and "Brain–gut behavior therapies"; per the note, these "may be considered for treatment of abdominal bloating and distention regardless of diagnostic correlates."

### Diagnostic laparoscopy guidelines: this guideline was prepared by the SAGES guidelines committee and reviewed and approved by the board of governors of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), November 2007 [^96f10966]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) in the intensive care unit (ICU) — indications include unexplained sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and multisystem organ failure; additional uses include abdominal pain or tenderness associated with other signs of sepsis without an obvious indication for laparotomy (e.g., pneumoperitoneum, massive gastrointestinal bleeding, small bowel obstruction), fever and/or leukocytosis in an obtunded or sedated patient not explained by another identifiable problem, metabolic acidosis not explained by another process, and increased abdominal distention not due to bowel obstruction. Contraindications include inability to tolerate pneumoperitoneum or being so sick that there is no realistic chance of survival even if a "treatable" intra-abdominal process were found, an obvious indication for surgical intervention such as bowel obstruction or perforated viscus, uncorrectable coagulopathy or uncorrectable hypercarpnia > 50 torr, a tense and distended abdomen (clinically suspected abdominal compartment syndrome), abdominal wall infection, and extensive previous abdominal surgery with multiple incisional scars or after a laparotomy within the last 30 days.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^0abed3ba]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) best practice advice for diagnostic evaluation of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention includes the following statements. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Clinical history and physical examination findings and impedance pH monitoring can help to differentiate between supragastric and gastric belching. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Rome IV criteria should be used to diagnose primary abdominal bloating and distention. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Carbohydrate enzyme deficiencies may be ruled out with dietary restriction and/or breath testing. In a small subset of at-risk patients, small bowel aspiration and glucose- or lactose-based hydrogen breath testing may be used to evaluate for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Serologic testing may rule out celiac disease in patients with bloating and, if serologies are positive, a small bowel biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis. A gastroenterology dietitian should be part of the multidisciplinary approach to care for patients with celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Abdominal imaging and upper endoscopy should be ordered in patients with alarm features, recent worsening symptoms, or an abnormal physical examination only. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Gastric emptying studies should not be ordered routinely for bloating and distention, but may be considered if nausea and vomiting are present. Whole gut motility and radiopaque transit studies should not be ordered unless other additional and treatment-refractory lower gastrointestinal symptoms exist to warrant testing for neuromuscular disorders. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: In patients with abdominal bloating and distention thought to be related to constipation or difficult evacuation, anorectal physiology testing is suggested to rule out a pelvic floor disorder.

Practitioner's points

In patients with functional gut disorders complaining of visible abdominal distension,

1. The subjective claim is substantiated by objective evidence, and hence, patients deserve credibility and warrant medical attention.

2. The possibility of excess gas, a common belief, is very unlikely.

3. Abdominophrenic dyssynergia (diaphragmatic contraction and anterior abdominal wall relaxation) seems to be the rule in the majority of patients, although CT imaging has diagnostic limitations, particularly in the evaluation of the diaphragm.

### Unraveling functional abdominal bloating and distension: the role of thoraco-abdominal accommodation and a physical sign to aid its detection [^d23f00dd]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2012). Low credibility.

Bloating and distension are common complaints in patients with irritable bowel syndrome of which the cause has remained elusive, although it has been shown that the obvious explanation of excessive gas is unlikely. The recent application of technologies such as the gas challenge technique, abdominal inductance plethysmography, CT scanning, as well as electromyography of the diaphragm and anterior abdominal wall, have allowed the situation to be slowly unraveled. It is now seems probable that the pathophysiology of bloating and distension are subtly different with the former having a sensory component whereas mechanical factors, such as disordered abdominal accommodation, contribute more to the latter.

Abdominophrenic dyssynergia (APD) — pathophysiology and clinical features: APD is a "paradoxical viscerosomatic reflex response" characterized by a compensatory pattern in which "the diaphragm paradoxically contracts (goes down), and the anterior abdominal wall muscles relax, leading to increased abdominal girth." Computed tomography (CT) scans "demonstrate the APD response even with small increases in intraluminal gas (approximately 10%)," and, in contrast to severe intestinal dysmotility, patients there "do not exhibit an APD pattern." For many patients, "the APD distention occurs during or immediately after a meal."

Functional abdominal pain: the basic science — mechanisms of nociception in the digestive tract emphasize distension and contractions. Primary causes of abdominal pain of digestive tract origin are distension and excessively strong contractions of the musculature, whereas other stimuli such as pinching and burning of the mucosa do not evoke pain. Hypersensitivity of the mechanoreceptors detecting stretch (distension) and contractile force is described as a pain factor in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), and hypersensitivity to distension is found in a substantial subset of patients that meet Rome III symptom-based criteria for diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

1 INTRODUCTION

Bloating and distension have been reported by 30% of the general population and up to 95% of patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Bloating refers to the subjective sensation of increased abdominal pressure and fullness, particularly during the postprandial period, and distension refers to an objective increase in abdominal girth., Not all patients with bloating have distension.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition characterized by chronic gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habit. The etiology of IBS is multifactorial with altered gut motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and dysfunction of the brain–gut axis having been suggested. There is no recognized biomarker, and patients usually have structurally normal bowel on standard investigations such as cross‐sectional imaging and endoscopy. Approximately 44% of IBS patients with a sensation of bloating also describe abdominal distension. Bloating with visible distension is more commonly seen in patients with IBS‐C than with IBS‐D. Furthermore, distension is frequently seen in patients with associated constipation and slow colonic transit.

Rome IV defines functional bloating and/or distension (FABD) as recurring bloating and distension occurring on average > 1 day per week, with bloating and distension as the predominant symptoms in individuals not meeting diagnostic criteria for other functional gut disorders. Thus, there are patients with abdominal bloating and distension who have normal bowel habit and do not fit the IBS pattern.

Whatever the underlying Rome IV patient classification, bloating is a pervasive symptom extremely difficult to treat and negatively contributing to patients' quality of life.

There are various theories about the cause of bloating, including increased colonic fecal content, excessive diaphragmatic descent, or altered perception of abdominal sensations by the patient. Abnormal transit, constipation, and increased colonic diameter are also postulated to contribute to symptoms, although remain controversial.

We wish to acknowledge some limitations of our study. Since not all patients underwent both CT and EMG, the values of the tests cannot be compared in the whole pool of patients. Nevertheless, our data indicate that both distorted interpretation and intestinal gas accumulation, two key questions of our study, seem unlikely. The predominance of constipation‐predominant IBS and functional bloating in our study population is not unexpected but may be related to a referral bias; furthermore, the vast majority of our patients were women. We acknowledge that from these data it cannot be ascertained whether the mechanism of abdominal distension in other functional digestive disorders, such as diarrhea or functional dyspepsia, or in men is the same. Our data apply specifically to patients with episodic distention, which allows comparisons between distension episodes and basal conditions, but the situation of patients complaining of continuous abdominal distention may be different. Indeed, complaints of steady, unremitting distension may be due to a prominent, fatty abdomen.

Etiology of IAH/ACS (Cause)

The third element to consider in IAH management is the etiology of the elevated IAP, which allows selection of the best possible treatment option. The course of disease also needs to be considered. An initial increase in IAP up to 18 mmHg after elective abdominal hernia repair may be well tolerated and could be just observed, whereas the same value of IAP in a patient with severe acute pancreatitis and shock still needing massive fluid resuscitation to preserve organ perfusion presents a high risk for developing ACS and needs immediate attention and measures (e.g. sedation, muscle relaxation) to control the IAP.

All reasonable attempts should be made to ascertain the underlying disease leading to elevated IAP before starting treatment. Knowledge of the patient's medical history and present condition and a full general and abdominal clinical examination usually offer the first clues. Directed imaging, such as ultrasound or computed tomography (CT), may also be necessary. A plethora of risk factors for IAH/ACS has been described, but they can be largely divided into three categories: increased intra-abdominal volume, decreased abdominal compliance, and a combination of both.

Increased Intra-abdominal Volume

This can be caused by increased intraluminal or extraluminal volume within the abdominal cavity. The presence of increased intraluminal volume can be suspected based on the clinical circumstances and diagnosed with medical imaging techniques if indicated (e.g. gastric distention after gastroscopy due to gas insufflation, added colonic volume in Clostridium difficile colitis, or severe constipation). Increased extraluminal volume may accumulate freely in the abdominal cavity or localized in abdominal collections. Free abdominal air, fluid, or blood can be diagnosed easily by bedside ultrasound and can be evacuated by percutaneous catheter drainage. Extraluminal abdominal collections are mostly associated with underlying abdominal diseases (e.g. pancreatitis, abdominal sepsis, or abdominal hematoma) and usually require abdominal ultrasound or CT imaging for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Tissue edema — often in a context of resuscitation or fluid overload — may be another cause of increased extraluminal volume, without any discernible collections. In rare cases, IAH/ACS may be caused by increased native solid organ volume (e.g. splenomegaly or in solid organ transplants, e.g. in children receiving adult organs).

INTRODUCTION

Chronic bloating and abdominal distension are common in the general population and particularly common in disorders of the gut-brain interaction (DGBIs). Although there are many causes of bloating in DGBIs, a series of studies by Azpiroz et al. indicated that abdominal distension in patients with functional gut disorders is by and large mediated by abdominophrenic dyssynergia (APD) without substantial increments in intra-abdominal contents. In APD, an abnormal somatic response causes paradoxical movement of the chest and abdominal wall that results in abdominal distension (Figure 1). This response is often triggered by the sensation of bloating. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of APD and what is needed to better serve patients with this disorder.

Figure 1.
Schematic representation of abdominophrenic interactions. (a) In normal conditions, the abdominal walls actively adapt to its content: A volume increase elicits a coordinated relaxation of the diaphragm and contraction of the anterior wall to expand the abdominal cavity without anterior protrusion. (b) In patients, abdominal distension is produced by a paradoxical contraction of the diaphragm and anterior wall relaxation.

4 DISCUSSION

Our study shows that in most patients complaining of self‐limited episodes of visible abdominal distention: (a) their claim is substantiated by objective evidence, (b) an increase in intestinal gas does not justify visible abdominal distention, and (c) abdominophrenic dyssynergia can be consistently evidenced by dynamic functional studies; static imaging largely confirms this mechanism of distention but bears some limitations in the evaluation of the diaphragm.

A previous study evaluating patients with functional gut disorders failed to detect differences in abdominal circumference between those who reported visible abdominal distension versus those who did not. Since visible abdominal distension is intermittent, that is, blows up during discrete episodes and remits, distension may be missed at the time of the consultation, and physicians are frequently confronted with a normal examination. In this case, the patient may be instructed to return when they are distended, but our study suggests that this may not be necessary, because with proper interrogation, patients reliably recognize episodes of visible abdominal distension.

Abdominal distention is commonly attributed to excess intestinal gas by patients and their attending physicians., This belief is reinforced by the fact that visible distention is usually associated with other symptoms seemingly related to gas, such as bloating sensation, defined as sensation of increased abdominal pressure/fullness, borborygmi and flatulence. However, our study showed that visible distention in our patients was associated with an increase in gas over 300 mL in only a minority (5 out of 104 patients), and even these patients exhibited a clear pattern of abdominophrenic dyssynergia (diaphragmatic push and downwards displacement of contents). In normal conditions, the walls of the abdomen actively adapt to its content, and a volume increase induces diaphragmatic relaxation and upwards expansion of the abdominal cavity with minor repercussions on the anterior wall, a phenomenon termed abdominal accommodation. Hence, even the largest increase in gas observed in the minority of patients would not justify per se their visible abdominal distention (Figure 1). Furthermore, the level of distention in these patients was similar to that in the rest, suggesting that abdominophrenic dyssynergia was the key driver of distention. The same reasoning applies when considering changes in total abdominal contents.

Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Recommendations — diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) for non-specific acute abdominal pain: DL is technically feasible and can be applied safely in appropriately selected patients with acute non-specific abdominal pain (grade B). The procedure should be avoided in patients with hemodynamic instability and may have a limited role in patients with severe abdominal distention or a clear indication for laparotomy (grade C). The procedure should be considered in patients without a specific diagnosis after appropriate clinical examination and imaging studies (grade C). Based on the available evidence, an invasive procedure cannot be recommended before other non-invasive diagnostic options have been exhausted. DL may be superior to observation for nonspecific abdominal pain, but evidence is mixed and a firm recommendation is difficult; DL may be preferable to exploratory laparotomy in appropriately selected patients with an indication for operative intervention provided that laparoscopic expertise is available (grade C).

2 MATERIAL AND METHODS

2.1 General procedure, participants, and experimental design

Patients whose predominant complaints were episodes of severe visible abdominal distension in the absence of organic cause were studied, that is, patients complained of episodes of severe visible abdominal distension (swollen abdomen with increased girth), and in between these episodes (basal conditions) they felt well (without or with only mild visible abdominal distension). Patients complaining of continuous, unremitting visible abdominal distension were not included in the study. Patients were instructed to come to the laboratory under two different conditions: during basal conditions, when they felt their abdomen was normal or with minimal visible distension, and during episodes of severe visible distension. On each occasion, the following outcomes were measured: patient's rating of visible abdominal distension (how severe is your visible abdominal distension now), girth measurement, abdominal or abdominothoracic CT scanning (Figure 1), and EMG recording of the anterior abdominal muscles, intercostals and diaphragm (see "Demographics and study flow" below). This paper provides a global analysis of the data of various studies with the same inclusion criteria, experimental design, and procedures. The individual study protocols were previously approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Hospital Vall d'Hebron (Comitè d'Ètica d'Investigació Clinica, protocol number PR[AG]60/2009 approved May 5, 2009). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient included in the study. Some of the studies were registered withno: NCT01205100. The study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by the institution's human research committee.

### Abdominophrenic dyssynergia: a narrative review [^e0d17236]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Bloating refers to the subjective sensation of abdominal fullness, pressure, or gas and has been recently defined as the sensation of increased abdominal pressure/tension, whereas distension describes the objective (visible) increase in abdominal girth. These 2 phenomena are often associated (and frequently conflated), but up to 50% of the time, bloating occurs without distension. Occasional bloating and distension are common in the general population, with a prevalence of approximately 40%. Although bloating and distension are associated with a wide range of pathologies (both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal) (Table 1), these symptoms are particularly common in DGBIs such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD). Indeed, up to 90% of patients with IBS and 85% of patients with DGBIs regularly experience these symptoms. Multiple mechanisms may contribute to bloating and distension in DGBIs, including dysbiosis, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, dysmotility, pelvic floor dysfunction, aerophagia, abnormal gas handling, carbohydrate intolerance or malabsorption, visceral hypersensitivity, central sensitization, and abnormal viscerosomatic responses.

Chronic bloating and abdominal distension are common and highly bothersome gastrointestinal symptoms. Although the differential diagnoses for bloating and distension are broad, these symptoms are frequently associated with disorders of the gut-brain interaction. Functional abdominal bloating may be a result of visceral hypersensitivity, whereas abdominal distension seems to be a somatic behavioral response associated with abdominophrenic dyssynergia, featuring diaphragmatic contraction and abdominal wall relaxation. We review the available literature regarding abdominophrenic dyssynergia and comment on its epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and avenues to address in the near future.

### WSES consensus guidelines on sigmoid volvulus management [^a3b98309]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Recommendation 1: Initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical examination. A full panel of blood tests including blood gas and lactate levels are also important to look for suggestions of bowel ischemia. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation, based on low- or very-low-quality evidence, 1C.

Symptoms of sigmoid volvulus include abdominal pain, constipation and vomiting (a late sign). In 30–41% of cases, patients report previous episodes of abdominal distention. This triad is much more common in endemic volvulus, rather than the sporadic kind of volvulus (88% versus 33%).

In the "volvulus belt" countries, the clinical presentation may be acute with peritonitis and shock. In this fulminant clinical presentation, the prognosis is poor because colonic necrosis and perforation would possibly have already occurred, by the time the patient first presents for care. Conversely, in Western countries, the patient usually presents 3 to 4 days after the onset of symptoms. The classic patient is elderly, institutionalized and under psychotropic medications that causes chronic constipation. The history should elicit the above-mentioned risk factors, including a personal history of previous sigmoid volvulus, which is present in 30–40% of cases.

Classically, the clinical examination will identify abdominal distension, diminished bowel sounds and often an empty rectum on digital examination. However, the examination is often difficult due to the presence of abdominal distension, which is the result of colonic obstruction of several days duration; if there are no signs of peritoneal irritation, as is often the case, this may result in a delay in diagnosis. Nonetheless, the absence of peritonitis does not indicate the absence of bowel ischemia. Asymmetric gaseous abdominal distention associated with emptiness of the left iliac fossa is pathognomonic for sigmoid volvulus, though this can be very challenging to detect.

The duration of symptoms lasts from a few hours to several days. As these patients are typically old with comorbidities, any vomiting and dehydration can tip them over into renal insufficiency. Thus, blood testing of electrolytes and renal function is necessary.

### Sensation of bloating and visible abdominal distension in patients with irritable bowel syndrome [^7ee9d5eb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Abdominal bloating and distension are common symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The postulated pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these symptoms include increased production, retention, or perception of gas or luminal contents. The aims of this study were to prospectively compare the prevalence of, and clinical factors related to, bloating and distension in an IBS patient population.

Methods

A total of 714 consecutive patients who met Rome I criteria for IBS were prospectively surveyed, and were classified as having bloating alone (B) or bloating and distension (B+D) based on a comprehensive bowel symptom questionnaire. GI, extraintestinal, and psychological symptoms, as well as health-related quality of life measures were also assessed using validated survey instruments.

Results

A total of 542 IBS patients (76%) who reported abdominal bloating were studied. Of these, 132 patients fulfilled criteria for the B group, whereas 410 patients fulfilled criteria for the B+D group. There was a significantly different gender distribution in the B and B+D groups (female:male ratios, 1.4:1 and 2.8:1, respectively p < 0.02). There was also a significantly different bowel habit subgroup distribution, with a greater predominance of constipation in B+D group and of diarrhea in the B group (p < 0.03). Both groups were similar in other clinical parameters, including progressive worsening of symptoms during the day, and relief by passing stool or gas. Both bloating and distension worsened when other abdominal symptoms worsened. Abdominal distension was associated with greater symptom severity and less diurnal variation in symptoms, and was less often perceived as associated with food intake.

Conclusions

Bloating and visible abdominal distension may arise from two distinct but interrelated physiological processes. Although the sensation of bloating may be related to enhanced sensitivity to visceral afferent stimulation, abdominal distension in more severely affected patients may be related to triggering of a visceromotor reflex affecting the tone of abdominal wall muscles.

### Intraabdominal hypertension, abdominal compartment syndrome, and the open abdomen [^669e758f]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is the end point of a process whereby massive interstitial swelling in the abdomen or rapid development of a space-filling lesion in the abdomen (such as ascites or a hematoma) leads to pathologically increased pressure. This results in so-called intraabdominal hypertension (IAH), causing decreased perfusion of the kidneys and abdominal viscera and possible difficulties with ventilation and maintenance of cardiac output. These effects contribute to a cascade of ischemia and multiple organ dysfunction with high mortality. A few primary disease processes traditionally requiring large-volume crystalloid resuscitation account for most cases of IAH and ACS. Once IAH is recognized, nonsurgical steps to decrease intraabdominal pressure (IAP) can be undertaken (diuresis/dialysis, evacuation of intraluminal bowel contents, and sedation), although the clinical benefit of such therapies remains largely conjectural. Surgical decompression with midline laparotomy is the standard ultimate treatment once ACS with organ dysfunction is established. There is minimal primary literature on the pathophysiological underpinnings of IAH and ACS and few prospective randomized trials evaluating their treatment or prevention; this concise review therefore provides only brief summaries of these topics. Many modern studies nominally dealing with IAH or ACS are simply epidemiologic surveys on their incidence, so this paper summarizes the incidence of IAH and ACS in a variety of disease states. Especially emphasized is the fact that modern critical care paradigms emphasize rational limitations to fluid resuscitation, which may have contributed to an apparent decrease in ACS among critically ill patients.

### Abdominal distension after eating lettuce: the role of intestinal gas evaluated in vitro and by abdominal CT imaging [^25088fbf]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Previous studies in healthy subjects using abdominal CT imaging combined with EMG of the abdominal walls showed that the anterior wall and the diaphragm, adapt their muscular tone to the intraabdominal content. Increases of intraabdominal content, induce an abdominal accommodation response, featuring a relaxation and upward displacement of the diaphragm with cephalad expansion of the abdominal cavity and limited impact on the anterior abdominal wall. 3, 17, 27, 28 The present study shows that abdominal distension after eating lettuce in our patients is produced by a paradoxical contraction of the diaphragm with caudo‐ventral redistribution of abdominal content. This mechanism of abdominal distension has been also detected in other patients with episodic abdominal distension not specifically related to meals. 5, 6 To treat this condition, we developed in our laboratory a biofeedback technique that allows patients to control the activity of the abdominal walls. 5, 19 The fact that our patients learned to modulate the activity of the abdominal walls, and thereby prevented lettuce‐induced distension, suggests that the latter is a behavioral response under volitional control.

We wish to acknowledge that this pilot study included a small sample size and did not include proper controls for the specificity of lettuce as the offending foodstuff. Furthermore, we can only speculate on the mechanisms of conditioning, ie what in lettuce and by which mechanism triggers the abnormal somatic response. An interesting study by the Nottingham group has recently shown that lettuce increases water content in the small bowel, possibly due to irritant latex‐like lactucins inducing secretion. 29 In our study, the increment in total intraabdominal contents in the postprandial distension scan was within the normal range and would normally elicit a proper abdominal accommodation. However, in sensitive individuals either the irritant component in lettuce or even a relatively small increase small bowel water content not detectable by CT imaging, may release the abnormal response. Alternatively, or additionally, lettuce‐induced distension may be related to cognitive/affective factors: anticipation may trigger the behavioral response, ie conditioned patients might become distended if they believe they will. In general, stress is reported as a frequent triggering factor, which supports the potential role of the mental sphere. 30 Nevertheless, why these patients in the first place learned this abnormal behavior is not known.

All symptoms had positive predictive values below 1%, except for abdominal distension. These low values reflect both the high frequency of abdominal symptoms in the "healthy" population allied to the relatively low incidence of ovarian cancer. Nevertheless, a 2.5% risk of ovarian cancer with abdominal distension clearly warrants investigation. This symptom was also reported by over a third of women. Furthermore, it remained associated with cancer even when we removed the final six months from analysis. It was also equally as common in stages I and II cancer as it was in advanced cancer, as has been noted before. Yet, abdominal distension is not included in current guidance for urgent investigation; if it were, some women could have their diagnosis expedited by many months.

An allied symptom is bloating. This is not a mainstream medical term in the UK, and it is likely that the records of bloating represent a verbatim note of the word the woman used. Women, however, use the term for two different symptoms: either persistent (or progressive) distension or intermittent distension. The latter is the more common use. In this study, those with a record of abdominal distension will include some women whose use of the word "bloating" had been replaced by the term distension, once the exact symptom had been clarified. Other doctors will have retained the term bloating. The converse is less likely, of patients using the term distension yet actually experiencing intermittent swelling. Thus, the abdominal distension variable is likely to be relatively "pure," containing largely patients with persistent distension, whereas the bloating variable probably includes some women more correctly described as having distension. Most previous studies have accepted the term bloating without further definition and have found it to be associated with ovarian cancer. When the two different meanings were separated, however, one small study found that intermittent distension was not associated with cancer. Our results are compatible with this only if we accept that some of those labelled bloating had persistent distension. Even if true intermittent distension does carry some risk, it is considerably less than persistent distension, as shown by the much smaller odds ratios and positive predictive values.

### Idiopathic abdominal cocoon: a rare presentation of small bowel obstruction in a virgin abdomen. how much do we know? [^564f9cc8]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A healthy 44-year-old man with no medical or surgical history presented to the Emergency Department with 2 days history of abdominal pain associated with bloating and constipation. There was h/o not passing flatus or motion since morning. Abdominal pain was generalised, and has been progressing in severity and associated with abdominal distension. There was h/o vomiting of 1 episode — the oral contrast. The patient gave a significant history around 1 year back of partial small bowel obstruction that was treated conservatively.

On arrival in the A&E, he was tachycardic with a pulse rate of 111 beats perminute. The patient was well built.

Abdominal examination revealed a distended abdomen that was soft, with no localised tenderness or palpable masses. There was an umbilical hernia defect of 1 cm that was fully reducible. Digital rectal examination showed soft stool, with no blood.

His labs showed the following: haemoglobin 14.9 g/dl, white blood cells 10.7 x10^9/L, neutrophils 8.5 x10^9/L, platelets 283 x10^9/L and C reactive protein 14.5 mg/L. Other lab tests were normal, including renal function tests, lactate and coagulation.

His abdominal x-ray showed hugely dilated small bowel, with air seen in the rectum, consistent with partial bowel obstruction.

He underwent CT abdomen (Figure 1) which showed the following:

Radiation — potential impact to GI/Hepatic system: Abdomen, pelvis, or spine (lumbar, sacral, whole) therapeutic exposure has the potential late effect of bowel obstruction; periodic evaluation includes HISTORY of abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and constipation yearly, and PHYSICAL examination for tenderness, abdominal guarding, and distension yearly. Additional information states bowel obstruction is rarely seen in individuals treated with abdominal radiation who have not had abdominal surgery, and to consider cancer/treatment factors such as abdominal surgery and radiation dose ≥ 20 Gy (especially ≥ 45 Gy); obstruction may occur in people who received lower doses of abdominal radiation during childhood. Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include imaging as clinically indicated for suspected obstruction and surgical consultation in patients unresponsive to medical management.

### Effect of rectal distension on abdominal girth [^1a31c461]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2004). Low credibility.

It has been postulated that a viscerosomatic reflex activated by gut distension and inhibiting abdominal wall muscle tone may be one of the mechanisms underlying functional abdominal distension. Any demonstration of such a reflex has to take into account the fact that gut distension may increase abdominal girth as a result of volume displacement. As biomechanical and sensory rectal responses vary at different rates of rectal distension, we hypothesized that different rates of rectal distension might reveal different changes in abdominal girth. Abdominal girth was continuously recorded in 14 healthy subjects using a previously validated extensometer. The rectal distensions were made in a randomized order at rates of 100 mL min(-1) or 10 mL min(-1) up to 150 mL, and sham distensions were used as controls. An increase in abdominal girth was observed at the end of both distensions (P ≤ 0.008): it was greater after the fast (1.1 ± 0.5 mm) than after the slow distension (0.8 ± 0.7 mm), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.2). In conclusion, we were unable to demonstrate the existence of a viscerosomatic reflex activated by gut distension under our experimental conditions.

### Visible abdominal distension in functional gut disorders: objective evaluation [^6e1a6f74]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

The aim of the present study was to determine the mechanism of visible abdominal distension in patients with functional gut disorders. Data of consecutive patients complaining of self‐limited episodes of visible abdominal distension, included in previous studies, were analyzed, to identify the percentage of patients, whose complaint is related to either distorted interpretation, increase in intestinal gas or abdominophrenic dyssynergia. Patients had been evaluated, following a standard procedure in the acquisition of CT abdominal imaging and abdominothoracic EMG recording, both during basal conditions and during episodes of severe distension, and the mechanism of distension was investigated by comparing abdominal morpho‐volumetric parameters between both condition.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colonic volvulus and acute colonic pseudo-obstruction [^de326ab7]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Colonic volvulus — initial evaluation should include a focused history, physical examination, and basic laboratory assessment. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Presenting symptoms are often nonspecific and may include abdominal pain, bloating, or cramping, nausea, emesis, and obstipation; physical examination typically reveals a distended and tympanic abdomen, and digital rectal examination usually reveals an empty vault. Although the duration of symptoms before presentation ranges from a few hours to several days, cecal volvulus tends to present more acutely, whereas sigmoid volvulus often has a more indolent presentation. Emergency presentation, with clinical signs of peritonitis or shock related to ischemia or perforation occurs in up to 25% and 35% of patients with sigmoid and cecal volvulus. It may be difficult to obtain an accurate history in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders and those residing in long-term care facilities, and laboratory testing is often helpful; in general, the history and physical examination and/or radiological evaluations occur in parallel to facilitate care.

A previously healthy 3-week-old boy presented with 5 hours of marked fussiness, abdominal distention, and poor feeding. He was afebrile and well perfused. His examination was remarkable for localized abdominal tenderness and distention. He was referred to the emergency department in which an abdominal radiograph revealed gaseous distention of the bowel with a paucity of gas in the pelvis. Complete blood cell count and urinalysis were unremarkable. His ongoing fussiness and abnormal physical examination prompted consultation with surgery and radiology. Our combined efforts ultimately established an unexpected diagnosis.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

### Management of tension gastrothorax: experience from sub-saharan Africa [^eb70113f]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Tension gastrothorax is a form of obstructive shock resulting from increased intrathoracic pressure due to a distended herniated stomach. The clinical features of tension gastrothorax are similar to the clinical features of the more common tension pneumothorax. Clinical recognition of this trauma has remained difficult especially in the tropics where most responders are not specialists. We managed a 31-year-old male who, in addition to typical features of obstructive shock secondary to increased intrathoracic pressures, had a recent meal prior to the trauma and a scaphoid abdomen at presentation. We argue that a history of a recent meal before trauma and an unusually scaphoid abdomen could be suggestive of tension gastrothorax and may help to differentiate it from tension pneumothorax. We recommend improved emergency preparedness to help recognise and treat this pathology.

3.3 Is abdominal distension related to an increase in intestinal gas?

Intestinal gas volume in the distension scans was within ± 300 mL from that measured in the baseline scans in all but 5 patients, in whom the difference was above that range; these 5 patients exhibited an increase in abdominal perimeter similar to the rest (group A in Figure 3), and despite the larger gas volumes, they exhibited a diaphragmatic descent (group A in Figure 4) indicative of abdominophrenic dyssynergia (Figure 1).

FIGURE 4
Changes in intestinal gas and diaphragmatic position by CT from basal to distension (n = 103). The 5 patients with a > 300 mL increase in gas during distension (group A) exhibited diaphragmatic descent. During episodes of abdominal distension, the diaphragm was below basal conditions in 82 patients and above in 21 patients (diaphragmatic dome not visible in 1 scan). Note similar changes in intestinal gas regardless of changes in diaphragmatic position, even in extreme cases with more pronounced diaphragmatic ascent (group B) or descent (group C)

Total intraabdominal content decreased in 10 patients (group A in Figures 5 and 6), increased less than 1500 mL in 86 patients and more than that in 8 patients (group B in Figures 5 and 6); no differences in the changes of abdominal perimeter (Figure 5) and diaphragmatic position (Figure 6) were observed between the three groups.

### Prolonged balloon expulsion is predictive of abdominal distension in bloating [^c2771e2e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Abdominal bloating and distension are common in patients with constipation. The precise mechanism of abdominal distension remains uncertain. We hypothesized that constipated patients with bloating plus distension exhibit a greater degree of anorectal dysfunction, potentially affecting gas evacuation, than those without distension. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate anorectal function and other clinical features in patients with constipation who exhibit bloating with and without distension.

Methods

In all, 88 female patients with abdominal bloating and either non-diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional constipation were included in the study. The presence or absence of abdominal distension was assessed according to the Rome II questionnaire, and all patients underwent comprehensive clinical assessment and anorectal function studies.

Results

Patients were divided into two groups: abdominal bloating with distension (D; n = 53) and abdominal bloating without distension (ND; n = 35). D featured a prolonged balloon expulsion time (P = 0.005), a higher resting anal sphincter pressure (P = 0.002), and a higher maximum anal sphincter squeeze pressure (P = 0.015) than ND. They also experienced more bloating (P < 0.001), more abdominal pain (P = 0.004), harder stools (P = 0.01), and more incomplete emptying (P = 0.005). In logistic regression modeling, prolonged balloon expulsion time was a significant predictor of abdominal distension (P = 0.018).

Conclusions

This is the first study to show that prolonged balloon expulsion time predicts abdominal distension in patients with bloating and constipation. Hence, ineffective evacuation of gas and stool associated with prolonged balloon expulsion may be an important mechanism underlying abdominal distension.

Central neuropathological factors — mechanisms for exaggerated distension sensitivity in IBS involve peripheral and central contributions: The evidence is consistent with altered peripheral sensory transduction as an underlying factor; mechanosensitive primary afferents in the gut wall become hypersensitive and transmit at elevated firing frequencies interpreted as nociception; alternatively, normally functioning mechanoreceptors may transmit accurate information that is then misinterpreted in spinal cord and/or brain processing circuits to evoke disordered sensations from the gut.

### Visible abdominal distension in functional gut disorders: objective evaluation [^385ce5dd]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Visible abdominal distension has been attributed to: (A) distorted perception, (B) intestinal gas accumulation, or (C) abdominophrenic dyssynergia (diaphragmatic push and anterior wall relaxation).

Methods

A pool of consecutive patients with functional gut disorders and visible abdominal distension included in previous studies (n = 139) was analyzed. Patients (61 functional bloating, 74 constipation‐predominant irritable bowel syndrome and 4 with alternating bowel habit) were evaluated twice, under basal conditions and during a self‐reported episode of visible abdominal distension; static abdominal CT images were taken in 104 patients, and dynamic EMG recordings of the abdominal walls in 76, with diaphragmatic activity valid for analysis in 35.

Key Results

(A) Objective evidence of abdominal distension was obtained by tape measure (increase in girth in 138 of 139 patients), by CT imaging (increased abdominal perimeter in 96 of 104 patients) and by abdominal EMG (reduced activity, i.e. relaxation, in 73 of 76 patients). (B) Intestinal gas volume was within ± 300 mL from the basal value in 99 patients, and above in 5 patients, who nevertheless exhibited a diaphragmatic descent. (C) Diaphragmatic contraction was detected in 34 of 35 patients by EMG (increased activity) and in 82 of 103 patients by CT (diaphragmatic descent).

Conclusions and Inferences

In most patients complaining of episodes of visible abdominal distention: (A) the subjective claim is substantiated by objective evidence; (B) an increase in intestinal gas does not justify visible abdominal distention; (C) abdominophrenic dyssynergia is consistently evidenced by dynamic EMG recording, but static CT imaging has less sensitivity.

### Gravity and the gut: a hypothesis of irritable bowel syndrome [^4a30de8b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL (THE BOLSTER)

Whereas the spinal column offers posterior support of the abdominal viscera, the anterior abdominal wall bolsters the peritoneal cavity to prevent its contents from spilling forward in the upright stance. In addition, the abdominal wall contributes to gravity-dependent bloating and distension through a mechanism called abdominophrenic dyssynergia (-). Normally, when gas accumulates in the intestines, the diaphragm relaxes and the anterior abdominal wall contracts to maintain the upright visceral stack against gravity. However, in many people with bloating and distension, intraluminal gas causes paradoxical contraction of the diaphragm, leading to gravity-enabled descent of the peritoneal contents and dyssynergic relaxation of the abdominal wall. This sequence of events can lead to abdominal distension (Figure 7), a physical sign common among patients with IBS.

Figure 7.
Abdominophrenic dyssynergia. Normally, when the intestines fill with gas, the diaphragm relaxes and the anterior abdominal wall contracts to bolster the abdominal cavity. By contrast, abdominal distension results when the diaphragm contracts, the viscera fall with gravity, and the anterior abdominal wall relaxes, leading to outpouching in the upright position (Image from Lacy B et al.).

### Mechanisms of abdominal distension in severe intestinal dysmotility: abdomino-thoracic response to gut retention [^41891950]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Background

We previously showed that abdominal distension in patients with functional gut disorders is due to a paradoxical diaphragmatic contraction without major increment in intraabdominal volume. Our aim was to characterize the pattern of gas retention and the abdomino-thoracic mechanics associated with abdominal distension in patients with intestinal dysmotility.

Methods

In 15 patients with manometrically proven intestinal dysmotility, two abdominal CT scans were performed: one during basal conditions and other during an episode of severe abdominal distension. In 15 gender- and age-matched healthy controls, a basal scan was performed.

Key Results

In basal conditions, patients exhibited more abdominal gas than healthy subjects, particularly in the small bowel, and the volume significantly increased during an episode of distension. During episodes of abdominal distension, the increase in abdominal content was associated with increased girth and antero-posterior abdominal diameter, as well as a cephalic displacement of the diaphragm, which reduced the height of the lung. The consequent reduction in the air volume of the lung was attenuated by an increase in the antero-posterior diameter of the chest.

Conclusions & Inferences

Abdominal distension in patients with severe intestinal dysfunction is related to marked pooling of gut contents, particularly in the small bowel. This increase in content is accommodated within the abdominal cavity by a global and coordinated abdomino-phreno-thoracic response, involving an accommodative ascent of the diaphragm and a compensatory expansion of the chest wall.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Demographics and study flow

One hundred thirty‐nine patients (130 women, 9 men; age range: 19–79 years) participated in the studies. All patients had a functional disorder diagnosis based on Rome II or III criteria; of note, all patients but four (with alternating IBS), fulfilled criteria of constipation‐predominant IBS or functional bloating,(Table 1).

TABLE 1
Demographics and Clinical data

Measurements of patient's rating of visible abdominal distension (by scales) and girth (by tape measure) were obtained in all patients (see reproducibility data in Supplemental material). Abdominal CT imaging (including anterior wall, diaphragm, and abdominal content) was obtained in 104 patients; in 47 patients, imaging also included the thorax (abdominothoracic CT scans). EMG recordings of the abdominothoracic muscles were performed in 76 patients (anterior wall and intercostals); diaphragmatic activity was obtained in 35 patients. Forty‐one patients underwent both CT imaging and EMG recordings. No differences in demographic and clinical characteristics were found in patients who underwent CT scanning, electromyography, or both (Table S1).

3.2 Is abdominal distension real? Changes of the anterior abdominal wall

Following the study instructions, in the study day corresponding to an episode of abdominal distension, all patients rated visible abdominal distension more severe than in the visit corresponding to basal conditions (4.9 ± 0.1 vs 1.8 ± 0.1 score; respectively; p < 0.001). Objective proof of abdominal distension was gathered by three lines of evidence, as follows.

(a) Girth measured by tape measure (n = 139) was larger during episodes of abdominal distension than during basal conditions (by 24 ± 1 mm) in all patients but one, who exhibited a minor decrease in girth (by 6 mm).

(b) Muscular activity of the anterior abdominal wall, measured at the level of the internal oblique by EMG (n = 76), was lower (indicative of reduced tone) during episodes of abdominal distension than during basal conditions (by 45 ± 2%) in all but 3 patients (group A in Figure 2).

### Patient information: what is cirrhosis? [^83353bd9]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Cirrhosis occurs when scar tissue replaces normal liver tissue, causing permanent liver damage. Cirrhosis affects about 2. 2 million people in the US. The most common causes of cirrhosis in the US are alcohol use disorder, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and hepatitis C. However, because there are now medications that can cure hepatitis C infection, the current leading causes of newly diagnosed cirrhosis in the US are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol use disorder. Patients with cirrhosis frequently have no signs or symptoms for many years. Physical signs of cirrhosis may include yellow-colored skin and eyes, dilated blood vessels on the face, male breast enlargement, distended blood vessels across the abdomen, atrophy of the testicles, red-colored palms, white-colored nails, and decreased body hair.

Common symptoms of cirrhosis include muscle cramps, itching, poor sleep, and sexual dysfunction. Potential Complications of Cirrhosis Ascites: fluid buildup in the abdomen Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: infected abdominal fluid in patients with ascites Hepatic encephalopathy: confusion and impaired brain function Variceal bleeding: bleeding due to enlarged veins that burst, often in the esophagus. Treatments for Cirrhosis and Its Complications Ascites is typically treated with medications. Fluid removal with a needle or catheter provides temporary relief for patients who have a large amount of fluid buildup that is causing abdominal discomfort. Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy includes medications and a high-protein diet.

The risk of variceal bleeding is reduced with medications that decrease pressure in the veins, and patients with variceal bleeding have improved 1-year survival if a stent is placed in the liver by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure. Although cirrhosis is rarely reversible, treatment of the underlying condition can prevent further progression. Abstinence from alcohol is recommended for all patients with cirrhosis due to alcohol use disorder. Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease should receive nutritional counseling, medical weight loss treatments, and, in certain cases, weight loss surgery.

### Thoracic causes of acute abdominal pain [^1e3c5f25]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The origin of abdominal pain may be extra-abdominal, caused by a thoracic illness. This article illustrates the various thoracic disorders that may present with acute abdominal pain. An erroneous focus on the abdomen alone can easily lead to misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment. In cases of unexplained acute abdominal pain, radiologists should be aware of also viewing beyond the borders of the abdomen. The key to most of these thoracic diagnoses is detection of pulmonary consolidation, pleural fluid or pericardial fluid.

### Abdomino-phrenic dyssynergia in patients with abdominal bloating and distension [^37ae0160]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The abdomen normally accommodates intra-abdominal volume increments. Patients complaining of abdominal distension exhibit abnormal accommodation of colonic gas loads (defective contraction and excessive protrusion of the anterior wall). However, abdominal imaging demonstrated diaphragmatic descent during spontaneous episodes of bloating in patients with functional gut disorders. We aimed to establish the role of the diaphragm in abdominal distension.

Methods

In 20 patients complaining of abdominal bloating and 15 healthy subjects, we increased the volume of the abdominal cavity with a colonic gas load, while measuring abdominal girth and electromyographic activity of the anterior abdominal muscles and of the diaphragm.

Results

In healthy subjects, the colonic gas load increased girth, relaxed the diaphragm, and increased anterior wall tone. With the same gas load, patients developed significantly more abdominal distension; this was associated with paradoxical contraction of the diaphragm and relaxation of the internal oblique muscle.

Conclusions

In this experimental provocation model, abnormal accommodation of the diaphragm is involved in abdominal distension.

3.2.3 Mechanism of abdominal distension

Abdominal morphometric analysis

Morphometric analysis of abdominal CT images showed that abdominal distension was associated with a marked increase in abdominal girth (20 ± 2 mm greater than in basal scans; P < .001), confirming the tape measurements, and in the antero‐posterior abdominal diameter (16 ± 5 mm greater than in the basal scan; P = 0.011). Abdominal distension was associated with a caudal displacement of the diaphragm, measured as a decrease in the distance from the diaphragmatic dome to T 12 (7 ± 3 mm descent; P = 0.027; Figure 3). The difference in total intraabdominal volume (between the fasting basal scan and the postprandial distension scan was 835 ± 187 mL.

Figure 3

Reponses to biofeedback treatment

Under the visual guidance provided by the EMG signal, all patients were able to effectively control their abdominal muscular activity. Treatment was associated with a significant improvement in the subjective sensation of abdominal distension (from 4.5 ± 0.2 score to 2.2 ± 0.3 score; 50 ± 7% reduction; P < .001) and decrease in girth (by 50 ± 2 mm; P < .001).

### Abdominal distension after eating lettuce: the role of intestinal gas evaluated in vitro and by abdominal CT imaging [^59374721]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Some patients complain that eating lettuce, gives them gas and abdominal distention. Our aim was to determine to what extent the patients' assertion is sustained by evidence.

Methods

An in vitro study measured the amount of gas produced during the process of fermentation by a preparation of human colonic microbiota (n = 3) of predigested lettuce, as compared to beans, a high gas-releasing substrate, to meat, a low gas-releasing substrate, and to a nutrient-free negative control. A clinical study in patients complaining of abdominal distention after eating lettuce (n = 12) measured the amount of intestinal gas and the morphometric configuration of the abdominal cavity in abdominal CT scans during an episode of lettuce-induced distension as compared to basal conditions.

Key Results

Gas production by microbiota fermentation of lettuce in vitro was similar to that of meat (P = 0.44), lower than that of beans (by 78 ± 15%; P < .001) and higher than with the nutrient-free control (by 25 ± 19%; P = 0.05). Patients complaining of abdominal distension after eating lettuce exhibited an increase in girth (35 ± 3 mm larger than basal; P < .001) without significant increase in colonic gas content (39 ± 4 mL increase; P = 0.071); abdominal distension was related to a descent of the diaphragm (by 7 ± 3 mm; P = 0.027) with redistribution of normal abdominal contents.

Conclusion and Inferences

Lettuce is a low gas-releasing substrate for microbiota fermentation and lettuce-induced abdominal distension is produced by an uncoordinated activity of the abdominal walls. Correction of the somatic response might be more effective than the current dietary restriction strategy.

### Abdominal distention at birth… [^32c1931b]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE CHILD BORN with a markedly distended abdomen presents a startling and challenging picture. Abdominal distention at the time of birth has been described infrequently, and many textbooks of pediatrics, pediatric surgery, and newborn care fail to mention the syndrome. There are, however, several well-documented causes for the syndrome, many of which require immediate diagnosis and treatment if life is to be preserved. The obstetrical problem of dystocia which such children encounter has been recently reviewed, 1 as has the roentgenologic diagnosis of neonatal ascites. 2 However, the problems of diagnosis and management which such children present in the neonatal period have received scant attention. The two patients reported here illustrate some of the problems. In addition, these patients provided an opportunity to study the mechanisms by which ascites is produced in infants with urinary tract obstruction. Report of Cases Case 1.

The following constitutes key background information on ascites:

- **Definition**: Ascites is a pathologic accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity that usually develops as a result of liver disease, congestive HF, or nephrotic syndrome.
- **Pathophysiology**: Ascites is most frequently caused by portal hypertension occurring in the setting of cirrhosis. Other causes are broadly divided into pre-hepatic (portal vein thrombosis, lymphoma, abdominal lymphatic injury or obstruction, bowel perforation, renal failure, pancreatitis, peritoneal tuberculosis or malignancy with peritoneal implants) and post-hepatic (congestive HF, constrictive pericarditis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and stricture/web formation in the IVC) causes.
- **Disease course**: Ascites causes clinical manifestations of abdominal distention, abdominal fullness, discomfort, shortness of breath, early satiation, and a sense of reduced mobility.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Ascites is associated with a 1-year mortality of 40%. Refractory ascites has a median survival rate of 6 months.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^bde7f294]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Abdominal distension attributable to refractory ascites — palliative options and outcomes include the following: Large volume paracentesis (LVP) requires multiple visits to the hospital and can be burdensome, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an option but many patients with refractory ascites are not candidates because of encephalopathy, cardiac contraindications, or high MELD scores. Indwelling peritoneal drains or catheters have been evaluated for palliation, and a systematic review including 176 patients reported patients' MELD scores ranged from 10 to 22, technical success was 100% with noninfectious complications generally low (< 12%), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurred in 0%–42% with an overall combined rate of 17%, and other complications included cellulitis at the catheter insertion site (6%), transient hyponatremia (11%), and increased serum creatinine (8%). A 12-week, small feasibility, unblinded randomized controlled trial compared LVP to long-term abdominal drains in 36 transplant-ineligible patients with refractory ascites, noted no drain-related serious adverse events or drain removals attributable to complications, found patients in the LVP group had more than double the ascites-related hospital time than the drain group, observed self-limiting cellulitis/leakage 41% versus 11% and peritonitis 6% versus 11%, and reported overall attrition 42% with deaths 7 of 16 and 5 of 18; at study end, all surviving drain participants elected to retain the drains.

Differential diagnosis for bloating and distension

Abnormal viscerosomatic responses seem to be a key contributor to bloating and distension in DGBIs. This phenomenon was first identified by the Barcelona group when a small cohort of patients with either IBS or functional bloating developed abdominal pain and distension associated with dystonia of the abdominal wall when they were challenged with rectal gas infusion. Specifically, the abdominal wall failed to contract and there was paradoxical relaxation of the internal oblique muscle. This abnormal response (which was not seen in healthy controls) explained the exaggerated abdominal distension in response to intestinal gas infusion. A subsequent study used computed tomography (CT) to compare intestinal gas volumes in healthy controls, in those with DGBIs, and in patients with small bowel dysmotility (chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction). During reported periods of bloating, patients with dysmotility had increased intestinal gas volumes and anterior protrusion of the abdominal wall, which is consistent with the impaired intestinal motor function. Patients with IBS and FD, however, had no increase in gas volume but did show a diaphragmatic descent and caudoventral redistribution of the abdominal wall and intestinal contents (Figure 2). The role of the diaphragm in bloating and distension was also demonstrated in a cohort of patients with either functional bloating or IBS with constipation. Electromyography (EMG) identified that abdominal distension in these patients was driven by paradoxical contraction of the diaphragm and relaxation of the internal oblique muscle, and the term abdominophrenic dyssynergia was coined for this condition. The same pathophysiology was subsequently demonstrated in patients with FD complaining of distension: In patients, abdominal distension in response to a test meal was related to APD; by contrast, the test meal in healthy subjects induced a coordinated relaxation of the diaphragm and anterior wall contraction. Furthermore, ingestion of lettuce (which is a low gas-releasing substrate for microbial fermentation) led to abdominal distension, produced by uncoordinated activity of the abdominal wall, in patients who believed that eating lettuce would cause them gas and bloating, suggesting that distension is a behavioral response. More recently, a study in healthy volunteers demonstrated that voluntary contraction of the diaphragm is associated with abdominal distension and symptoms of bloating and abdominal discomfort.

Definitions

The terms used in this article have been defined by the International Ascites Club

Uncomplicated ascites

Ascites that is not infected and which is not associated with the development of the hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Ascites can be graded as mild when ascites is detectable only by ultrasound examination, moderate when it causes moderate symmetrical distension of the abdomen and large when it causes marked abdominal distension.

Refractory ascites

Ascites that cannot be mobilised or the early recurrence of which (ie, after therapeutic paracentesis) cannot be satisfactorily prevented by medical treatment. This includes two different subgroups.

Diuretic-resistant ascites

Ascites that is refractory to dietary sodium restriction and intensive diuretic treatment.

Diuretic-intractable ascites

Ascites that is refractory to treatment owing to the development of diuretic-induced complications that preclude the use of an effective diuretic dosage.

Evaluation of patients with ascites

Clinical evaluation should include history of exposure to risk factors for cirrhosis and physical examination to look for evidence to support chronic liver disease or an alternative diagnosis. Shifting dullness is detectable when about one and a half litres of free fluid accumulate in the abdomen; the physical sign has 83% sensitivity and 56% specificity in detecting ascites. However, in the presence of obesity or smaller amount of fluid, imaging such as ultrasound or CT is necessary to confirm the presence of ascites.

A total of 8 infants presenting with sepsis-like illness were diagnosed to have human parechovirus (HPeV) infection; of which, 5 had abdominal distension and 6 had an erythematous rash. A combination of abdominal distension and erythematous rash was observed in 4 infants. The abdominal symptoms can be very prominent and signs could be confused with acute surgical conditions. Although fever and central nervous symptoms are important features, a red rash with abdominal distension and a low C-reactive protein value and lymphocyte count can be clues to recognize this infection.

### Massively distended abdomen caused by fibromatosis previously misdiagnosed as myxofibrosarcoma | JCO oncology practice… [^20c31fe8]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

A 6-year-old boy presented with a massively distended abdomen, abdominal pain, and cachexia. Three years prior, he had presented with abdominal pain in his native Siberia. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed an intra-abdominal mass of unknown origin. Because resection was deemed impossible, the patient was discharged with palliative support. On parental demand, follow-up investigation was performed 2 years later and showed further tumor progression without distant tumor manifestations. At presentation in our department, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a huge intra-abdominal mass originating from the retroperitoneum, resulting in organ displacement and encircling the large abdominal vessels. Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was normal, and metastases were excluded.

A rebiopsy was performed, and reference pathology rejected the diagnosis of myxofibrosarcoma and reclassified the tumor as fibromatosis, with positive staining for desmin; negative staining for smooth muscle actin, S-100, CD56, and CD34; and perinuclear β-catenin expression. The typical pattern of aggressive fibromatosis of the desmoid subtype could not be confirmed. However, the clinical picture with infiltrative growth of the adjacent structures corresponded to that of AF. Because the boy was in fairly poor clinical condition, we opted for therapy. The therapy of first choice in AF is complete resection, but the tumor was unresectable. Discussion Fibromatoses can be classified in two major groups: AF and juvenile-type fibromatoses. It is a group of benign fibrous tissue proliferations with a heterogeneous biologic behavior. Desmoid fibromatosis is the most important subtype of AF.

A 79-year-old woman presented with a 4 day history of central abdominal pain and vomiting. Clinical examination revealed a distended abdomen with predominantly right sided tenderness. Following an initial period of supportive treatment pending further imaging, evolving abdominal signs became evident. Based on the suspicion of a perforated hollow viscus, an emergency laparotomy was carried out. Operative findings were of a Meckel's diverticulum with evidence of pressure necrosis and perforation near its apex, which was distended due to a 6 cm faecolith. Resection and primary anastomosis was performed. Despite a lower respiratory tract infection, the patient was deemed clinically stable enough to be discharged on the 24th postoperative day.

Point-of-care ultrasound performed in the emergency department allowed for rapid diagnosis of a large amount of free intra-abdominal fluid, which together with the physical findings, prompted emergent operative exploration revealing chylous ascites. Although no areas of active volvulus were identified intraoperatively, findings in the case were suggestive of small bowel volvulus and deemed as the most likely etiology for this patient's presentation. In this report, we review the relevant aspects of ultrasonography for ascites and discuss the diagnosis of chylous ascites.

A middle-aged man presented at 4:00 with tense distended abdomen, severe pain and numb legs. His medical background included poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes. Abdominal x-ray showed a massively distended, featureless viscus on the left side of the abdomen thought to be a sigmoid volvulus. CT scan was delayed due to respiratory compromise from diaphragmatic splinting. Nasogastric and flatus tube decompression were attempted. Eventually CT was obtained and provisionally reported as a sigmoid volvulus. Emergency laparotomy was performed due to the risk of impending perforation. Operative findings were of a hugely distended stomach extending into the left iliac fossa almost completely occupying the abdominal cavity. Gastrotomy was used to decompress the stomach. No mechanical obstruction was identified. Postoperatively he had an episode of massive haematemesis thought to be due to sloughing of gastric mucosa. He was taken back to theatre and died on table.

### Abdominal wall muscle activity in irritable bowel syndrome with bloating [^a58db7ad]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Recurrent episodes of bloating and visible abdominal distension are common and distressing in irritable bowel syndrome, but the mechanisms are unknown. Patients often note that the distension is most pronounced in the upright posture, suggesting that the bloating may be the result of a decrease or absence of the normal rise in electromyograph activity in the abdominal wall muscles when standing. There are no reports of noninvasive electromyograph recordings of abdominal wall muscles in irritable bowel syndrome. We examined the hypothesis that abdominal distension is the result of relaxation of anterior abdominal wall musculature.

Methods

Studies were performed on patients with irritable bowel syndrome and a history of visible distension (n = 11, mean age 48.6 yr, body mass index 24.8) and normal volunteers (n = 13, mean age 39.9 yr, body mass index 24.6). Surface recordings of muscle activity were made while subjects were lying, performing voluntary contraction of the abdominal wall, and standing. The examiners were blind as to the clinical status of the subjects.

Results

There were no differences in abdominal wall muscle activity (by electromyograph voltage) when comparing patients with irritable bowel syndrome to normal volunteers (e.g., relaxed lower abdomen supine mean electromyograph voltage in irritable bowel syndrome was 14.0 vs 14.6 in controls, p = 0.7, and relaxed lower abdomen standing in irritable bowel syndrome was 29.6 vs 25.2 in controls, p = 0.4). There was increased activity in both groups when contracting the muscles and when standing.

Conclusions

Patterns of abdominal wall muscle activity do not differ between normal subjects and patients with irritable bowel syndrome. However, there is a clear increase in muscle activity in the standing position. Episodic distension is unlikely to be due to permanent anterior abdominal muscle weakness or a persistent inability of the muscles to activate with standing in irritable bowel syndrome.

### The AIUM practice parameter for the performance of an ultrasound examination of the abdomen and / or retroperitoneum [^fe0c299a]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Gallbladder and biliary tract — Routine gallbladder examination should be conducted on an adequately distended gallbladder whenever possible, and in most cases, fasting for at least 4 hours prior to elective examination will permit adequate distention of a normally functioning gallbladder. The gallbladder evaluation should include long-axis and transverse views obtained in the supine position, and other positions, such as erect or prone imaging, may be helpful to evaluate the gallbladder and its surrounding areas completely and to differentiate mobile gallstones from impacted gallstones. Measurements in longitudinal and/or transverse planes may aid in determining gallbladder wall thickening, and in adults, wall thickness of greater than 3 mm is abnormal, while if the patient presents with pain, tenderness to transducer compression over the gallbladder should be assessed (eg, a sonographic Murphy sign).

### Secondary peritonitis: principles of diagnosis and intervention [^6f51c2fd]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Secondary peritonitis accounts for 1% of urgent or emergent hospital admissions and is the second leading cause of sepsis in patients in intensive care units globally. Overall mortality is 6%, but mortality rises to 35% in patients who develop severe sepsis. Despite the dramatic growth in the availability and use of imaging and laboratory tests, the rapid diagnosis and early management of peritonitis remains a challenge for physicians in emergency medicine, surgery, and critical care. In this article, we review the pathophysiology of peritonitis and its potential progression to sepsis, discuss the utility and limitations of the physical examination and laboratory and radiographic tests, and present a paradigm for the management of secondary peritonitis.

### Management of ascites: expert panel narrative review [^fe731bc3]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ascites can develop in the setting of a variety of pathologies. The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.

### Abdominothoracic mechanisms of functional abdominal distension and correction by biofeedback [^029e342c]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

In patients with functional gut disorders, abdominal distension has been associated with descent of the diaphragm and protrusion of the anterior abdominal wall. We investigated mechanisms of abdominal distension in these patients.

Methods

We performed a prospective study of 45 patients (42 women, 24–71 years old) with functional intestinal disorders (27 with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, 15 with functional bloating, and 3 with irritable bowel syndrome with alternating bowel habits) and discrete episodes of visible abdominal distension. Subjects were assessed by abdominothoracic computed tomography (n = 39) and electromyography (EMG) of the abdominothoracic wall (n = 32) during basal conditions (without abdominal distension) and during episodes of severe abdominal distension. Fifteen patients received a median of 2 sessions (range, 1–3 sessions) of EMG-guided, respiratory-targeted biofeedback treatment; 11 received 1 control session before treatment.

Results

Episodes of abdominal distension were associated with diaphragm contraction (19% ± 3% increase in EMG score and 12 ± 2 mm descent; P < .001 vs basal values) and intercostal contraction (14% ± 3% increase in EMG scores and 6 ± 1 mm increase in thoracic antero-posterior diameter; P < .001 vs basal values). They were also associated with increases in lung volume (501 ± 93 mL; P < .001 vs basal value) and anterior abdominal wall protrusion (32 ± 3 mm increase in girth; P < .001 vs basal). Biofeedback treatment, but not control sessions, reduced the activity of the intercostal muscles (by 19% ± 2%) and the diaphragm (by 18% ± 4%), activated the internal oblique muscles (by 52% ± 13%), and reduced girth (by 25 ± 3 mm) (P ≤ .009 vs pretreatment for all).

Conclusions

In patients with functional gut disorders, abdominal distension is a behavioral response that involves activity of the abdominothoracic wall. This distension can be reduced with EMG-guided, respiratory-targeted biofeedback therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^1bfaf95a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

SIBO symptoms and symptom-based diagnostic limitations — Evidence suggests that abdominal pain, bloating, gas, distension, flatulence, and diarrhea are the most common symptoms reported in patients with SIBO, with severe cases sometimes showing vitamin B12, vitamin D, and iron deficiencies that are usually subtle or undetectable. However, in one study that compared symptom burden, Jacobs et al. compared 38 subjects with culture-positive SIBO to 74 subjects with culture-negative SIBO and reported no difference in the intensity, frequency, and duration of abdominal pain or in bloating, fullness, belching, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gas. Therefore, close attention should be paid not only to a patient's symptom profile but also to risk factors for SIBO and any history of previous attempts to treat other underlying conditions, when evaluating SIBO as a possible diagnosis in a patient presenting with unexplained abdominal pain, gas, bloating, diarrhea, and/or malabsorptive symptoms.

### Jodhpur disease revisited: a rare cause of severe protein energy malnutrition [^956fcf3f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Case report

A 3.5-year-old unimmunized developmentally normal female child presented with vomiting for 6 months, intermittent fever for 5 months, abdominal distention for 4 months and painful abdomen for 1 month. Vomiting was non bilious, non projectile, 4–5 episodes/day, occurring 1–2 h after meal and contained food particles. Fever was on and off, low-grade, not associated with chills and rigor. Pain was localized to upper abdomen, non colicky, aggravated by food intake, relieved by vomiting or medications. The child had significant weight loss (> 5 kg) during the past 4 months and had received one unit packed red cell transfusion at some other center. There was no history of loose stools at any point of time, constipation, jaundice, bleeding from any site or contact with a tuberculosis patient. On examination, she was malnourished with her weight only 6.5 kg and height 84 cm, both below the 3 rd percentile of WHO standards. She was pale and dehydrated, with sparse and lusterless hair. Abdomen was soft and distended, with tympanic note on percussion, normal bowel sounds and without organomegaly. The rest of the systemic examination did not show any abnormality.

On investigation, her hemogram and chest X-ray were normal, but serum electrolytes were abnormal (hyponatremia with hypokalemia). HIV serology, PPD test and gastric aspirates (n = 3) for tuberculosis were negative. Stool examination was negative for ova, cysts or opportunistic pathogens. X-ray abdomen showed no air-fluid level but only gaseous distention of stomach and intestine. Ultrasound of abdomen showed distended stomach with normal pyloric canal. Barium meal showed grossly distended stomach with slow passage of barium from the antero-pyloric region distally (Fig. 1). Suspecting gastric outlet obstruction, exploratory laparotomy was done that revealed hugely distended stomach with normal smooth muscle thickness but no intra-luminal valve, ring or diaphragm or extra-luminal compression was seen (Fig. 2). Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty was done. Pyloric biopsy showed sub-mucosal edema and mild congestion and no inflammatory cells were seen. The diagnosis of primary acquired gastric outlet obstruction during infancy and childhood (Jodhpur disease) with severe malnutrition was made. The child recovered well postoperatively, became asymptomatic gradually and gained 2.5 kg in one month post surgery.

### Abdominal distension after eating lettuce: the role of intestinal gas evaluated in vitro and by abdominal CT imaging [^de550ab5]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

2.2.1 Participants

Twelve women (age range 24‐58 years) who complained of abdominal distension after eating lettuce participated in the study. Only patients who reported episodes of visible distension related to ingestion of lettuce in contrast to basal periods with mild or no distension were included in the study. The entry criteria required lettuce as the primary offending foodstuff, regardless that other green leafy vegetables could have a deleterious effect as well. All patients had a functional disorder diagnosis based on Rome III criteria 12: 8 functional bloating (7.1 ± 0.5 bowel movements per week; 3.2 ± 0.3 score on the Bristol stool form scale) and four constipation‐predominant irritable bowel syndrome (2.2 ± 0.3 bowel movements per week, 2.0 ± 0.4 Bristol score). Symptom duration was 6 ± 4 years.

The study protocol had been previously approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, and all subjects gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. This study is an exploratory arm of a larger study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01205100) involving a subset of patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria described above, and hence, no power calculation was performed; data on abdominal CT imaging have not been previously published.

2.2.2 Experimental procedure

After having recognized lettuce as the reproducible offending meal, ie patients knew that eating lettuce would give them abdominal distension, two visits were scheduled within a 2‐day interval: patients were instructed to report in the laboratory (a) during fasting when they felt minimal or no abdominal distension (basal conditions), (b) and within 1 hour after eating the offending foodstuff (lettuce salad dressed at taste). During each condition (basal and distension) the subjective sensation of abdominal distension and abdominal girth were measured, and a CT scan was taken, as detailed below. Afterward, patients were offered a biofeedback treatment to correct abdominal distension.

2.2.3 Subjective sensation of abdominal distension

The patient's subjective sensation of abdominal distension was measured on a 6‐score graphic rating scale graded from 0 (no distension) to 6 (extremely severe distension).

### Prediction of postoperative abdominal distension in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery: a cross-sectional study [^f25fffaf]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Abdominal distension is a common postoperative complication among individuals undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery, with risk prediction often based on individualized factors. This study aimed to evaluate whether pain numeric rating scale (NRS) scores, alone or in combination with other risk factors, could reliably predict the early onset of abdominal distension induced by weakened intestinal peristalsis and incomplete residual gas absorption in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery.

Methods

A total of 961 patients who underwent gynecological laparoscopic surgery were recruited for the study. Pain NRS scores were compared between patients who developed postoperative abdominal distension and those who did not.

Results

Patients who experienced abdominal distension had significantly higher pain NRS scores compared to those without this complication. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the pain NRS score was significantly associated with the risk of abdominal distension after laparoscopic surgery, independent of conventional risk factors. Women in the highest quartile of pain NRS scores exhibited an 8.75-fold greater risk of developing abdominal distension post-surgery compared to those in the lowest quartile (odds ratio 8.75, 95% confidence interval 2.43–31.58). Further, incorporating the pain NRS score into conventional prediction models significantly improved the area under the curve for predicting postoperative abdominal distension (0.772 vs 0.725, P = 0.019).

Conclusion

The findings of this study demonstrated a significant and independent association between pain NRS scores and the risk of postoperative abdominal distension following gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Integrating pain NRS scores with conventional prediction models might improve the accuracy of risk prediction for this complication.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, radiologic findings, and treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome, which is defined as an acute elevation of the intraabdominal pressure with organ dysfunction.

Conclusion

Abdominal compartment syndrome is not well reported in the radiology literature. In this review, we discuss a range of CT signs such as elevated diaphragm, collapsed inferior vena cava, bowel wall thickening, bowel mucosal hyperenhancement, hemoperitoneum, and increasing abdominal girth, which, in combination, may allow the radiologist to raise the possibility of abdominal compartment syndrome.
