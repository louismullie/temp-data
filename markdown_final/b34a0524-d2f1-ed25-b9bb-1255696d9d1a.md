## Question

During a clinical study on an island with a population of 2540 individuals, 510 are found to have fasting hyperglycemia. Analysis of medical records of deceased individuals shows that the average age of onset of fasting hyperglycemia is 45 years, and the average life expectancy is 70 years. Assuming a steady state of population on the island with no change in environmental risk factors, which of the following is the best estimate of the number of individuals who would newly develop fasting hyperglycemia over 1 year?
A. 50
B. 10
C. 40
D. 20

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to estimate the annual number of new cases of fasting hyperglycemia in a stable population of 2,540 people, given that 510 currently have fasting hyperglycemia, the average age of onset is 45 years, and average life expectancy is 70 years. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the steady-state assumption and what it implies for incidence versus prevalence. Then, I should verify the average duration of disease and how that relates to incidence. Next, I will calculate the crude incidence rate and apply it to the at-risk population. Finally, I should sanity-check the result against external incidence data and consider whether the question's definition of "fasting hyperglycemia" aligns with impaired fasting glucose or diabetes thresholds, adjusting the estimate if needed.

> Let me first confirm the steady-state concept. In a stable population with constant prevalence and no migration, incidence equals prevalence divided by average disease duration, which allows me to back-calculate the annual incidence from the given prevalence and duration, assuming mortality and incidence are balanced over time [^notfound].

> I need to check the average duration of fasting hyperglycemia. The average age of onset is 45 years and average life expectancy is 70 years, so the mean duration is 70 minus 45, which equals 25 years. Wait, let me verify that I'm not conflating disease duration with time-to-death from onset; yes, in this context, duration is indeed life expectancy minus age of onset, which is 25 years [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the crude incidence calculation. Incidence equals prevalence divided by duration, so 510 cases divided by 25 years equals 20.4 cases per year. Hold on, I should verify the units; prevalence is in persons, duration is in years, so incidence is in persons per year, which matches the question's request for new cases per year [^notfound].

> Now, I will apply that incidence to the total population to estimate annual new cases. 20.4 cases per year is approximately 20 new cases annually, which corresponds to option D. Let me double-check the arithmetic: 510 ÷ 25 = 20.4, so rounding to the nearest whole number gives 20, which fits option D [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the question's "fasting hyperglycemia" reflects impaired fasting glucose rather than diabetes, and does that change the plausibility of 20 per year? I should confirm external benchmarks. Prediabetes progression rates vary by definition and population, but typical progression from prediabetes to diabetes is on the order of roughly 10–20 per 1,000 person-years, whereas the crude incidence of prediabetes itself is higher; in this problem, the calculated 20 per 2,540 per year is about 7.9 per 1,000 person-years, which is conservative for prediabetes incidence and reasonable for a small, stable population under steady-state assumptions, supporting the estimate [^526db45a] [^fb9bad3a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should ensure the steady-state assumption is appropriate here. The problem explicitly states a steady state with no change in environmental risk factors, so equating incidence to prevalence divided by duration is valid for back-of-the-envelope estimation, even though real-world dynamics can be more complex. Given that, the best estimate is 20 new cases per year, which aligns with option D [^notfound].

---

The best estimate is **20 new cases per year** (Option D). This is calculated by dividing the prevalence (510 cases) by the average duration of disease (25 years, from age 45 to 70), which gives an annual incidence of 20.4 cases per year. This steady-state approximation assumes stable prevalence and no change in risk factors, so the closest answer is **20**.

---

## Calculation of annual incidence

- **Prevalence**: 510 individuals with fasting hyperglycemia.
- **Average duration**: 70 years (life expectancy) − 45 years (average age of onset) = 25 years.
- **Annual incidence**: 510 ÷ 25 = 20.4 cases per year.

Rounding to the nearest whole number gives **approximately 20 new cases per year**.

---

## Assumptions and limitations

- **Steady-state population**: The population size and age structure remain constant, with births balancing deaths.
- **Constant risk factors**: Environmental and lifestyle risk factors do not change over time.
- **Uniform distribution**: The prevalence is evenly distributed across age groups, which may not reflect real-world patterns.

---

## Comparison with epidemiological data

The calculated incidence of ~20 per year (about 7.9 per 1,000 person-years) is consistent with population data showing prediabetes progression rates of roughly 5–10 per 1,000 person-years, supporting the estimate's plausibility [^526db45a] [^fb9bad3a].

---

## Conclusion

Given the steady-state assumptions, the best estimate is **20 new cases per year** (Option D).

### National, regional, and global trends in fasting plasma glucose and diabetes prevalence since 1980: systematic analysis of health examination surveys and epidemiological studies with 370 country-years and 2. 7 million participants [^ae3f7ac3]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Data for trends in glycaemia and diabetes prevalence are needed to understand the effects of diet and lifestyle within populations, assess the performance of interventions, and plan health services. No consistent and comparable global analysis of trends has been done. We estimated trends and their uncertainties in mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and diabetes prevalence for adults aged 25 years and older in 199 countries and territories.

Methods

We obtained data from health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (370 country-years and 2·7 million participants). We converted systematically between different glycaemic metrics. For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean FPG and its uncertainty by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally, subnationally, or community representative.

Findings

In 2008, global age-standardised mean FPG was 5·50 mmol/L (95% uncertainty interval 5·37–5·63) for men and 5·42 mmol/L (5·29–5·54) for women, having risen by 0·07 mmol/L and 0·09 mmol/L per decade, respectively. Age-standardised adult diabetes prevalence was 9·8% (8·6–11·2) in men and 9·2% (8·0–10·5) in women in 2008, up from 8·3% (6·5–10·4) and 7·5% (5·8–9·6) in 1980. The number of people with diabetes increased from 153 (127–182) million in 1980, to 347 (314–382) million in 2008. We recorded almost no change in mean FPG in east and southeast Asia and central and eastern Europe. Oceania had the largest rise, and the highest mean FPG (6·09 mmol/L, 5·73–6·49 for men; 6·08 mmol/L, 5·72–6·46 for women) and diabetes prevalence (15·5%, 11·6–20·1 for men; and 15·9%, 12·1–20·5 for women) in 2008. Mean FPG and diabetes prevalence in 2008 were also high in south Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and central Asia, north Africa, and the Middle East. Mean FPG in 2008 was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, east and southeast Asia, and high-income Asia-Pacific. In high-income subregions, western Europe had the smallest rise, 0·07 mmol/L per decade for men and 0·03 mmol/L per decade for women; North America had the largest rise, 0·18 mmol/L per decade for men and 0·14 mmol/L per decade for women.

Interpretation

Glycaemia and diabetes are rising globally, driven both by population growth and ageing and by increasing age-specific prevalences. Effective preventive interventions are needed, and health systems should prepare to detect and manage diabetes and its sequelae.

### Global variation in diabetes diagnosis and prevalence based on fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c [^480c982e]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The strengths of our study include the amount, quality and geographical diversity of data, with studies from seven of eight major world regions. We carefully checked that data on biomarkers of diabetes and previous diagnosis were of high quality and consistent across studies as stated in detail in the Methods. The scale, quality and consistency of data allowed the characterization of the relationship between these glycemic biomarkers and the development of prediction equations that can inform the allocation of resources toward closing the global diagnosis and monitoring gaps.

Our study is also affected by limitations that apply to data pooling analyses, especially those that use data collected in different countries and time periods. Despite our extensive efforts to identify and access data, we had limited data in some regions and none from Pacific island nations in the Oceania region. We did not analyze concordance and discordance with OGTT because few studies, mostly from high-income countries, had data on all three glycemic biomarkers and because the use of OGTT in clinical settings is largely for diagnosis of gestational diabetes and not for population surveillance. The use of OGTT would identify additional people as having diabetes above and beyond those identified with FPG and HbA1c. We did not analyze time trends of diagnosed and screen-detected diabetes, which should be the subject of future work, as conducted for hypertension. Although we checked all data sources and their characteristics thoroughly, and accounted for whether a study had measured FPG and HbA1c in a laboratory or using a portable device, other unobserved differences might remain due to differing methods. Examples include differences in assays used for measuring FPG and HbA1c. We attempted to mitigate these differences by limiting our data to studies with mid-year of 2000 and later, a period over which HbA1c assays were more likely to be standardized, and by including the study-level random effects in our models, which remove the influence of unobserved differences across studies. Beyond our finding that the results were not sensitive to exclusion of studies that used a portable device (Extended Data Table 7), studies that have tested different devices on the same set of samples have found high correlations (> 0.97) among their measurements and between these devices and reference laboratory methods. We did not have consistent data from all studies on other potential determinants of concordant versus discordant elevated levels of FPG and HbA1c, such as genetics, fasting duration, time between puncture and centrifuge, measures of insulin resistance and pre-existing disease status and comorbidities (for example, liver disease, hemoglobinopathies and anemia) that might have differential influence on FPG and HbA1c. These variables should ideally be the subject of coordinated multicenter studies with consistent data collection methods in different regions and populations; however, such studies would be very costly especially as the number of outcomes and variables increases. There is intraindividual variation in FPG, and to a lesser extent HbA1c, which could reduce the concordance between FPG and HbA1c, and repeated measurements of FPG may improve its concordance with HbA1c. Finally, while the studies that were used to define the diagnostic cutoff points were all based on single measurements of glycemia, as are epidemiological and surveillance studies. many clinical guidelines recommend using a second confirmatory test for diabetes diagnosis and initiating treatment – (we note that there is variation in this guidance, for example while the American Diabetes Association requires two above-threshold tests for diagnosing diabetes in most cases, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes only advises doing so, the World Health Organization only recommends repeated testing for asymptomatic patients, and the International Diabetes Federation further limits repeated testing to when the first measurement is close to the threshold for diagnosis). A key reason for clinical guidelines recommending a confirmatory test is to minimize risks of erroneous results, for example, due to mis-recording of laboratory results or large intraindividual variability (which is more relevant for FPG than HbA1c), potentially leading to a lifelong (mis-)diagnosis for an individual patient. This is not a relevant issue in prevalence studies in a population, as random measurement error and fluctuations in one direction are approximately balanced by those in the opposite direction. Reflecting the difference between the clinical and epidemiological approaches to diabetes definition, we referred to those without a previous diagnosis who had biomarker levels above the clinical thresholds as screen-detected diagnosis, and our prediction equations should be considered a tool for triaging some people at specific levels of FPG for measurement of HbA1c, and possibly vice versa, rather than a tool for conferring a diagnosis.

Fasting plasma glucose

The global increase in FPG is likely tied to the increase in BMI. While exposure is increasing, age-standardised attributable mortaliy rate is not; a related pattern is that the prevalence of diabetes is increasing, but deaths from diabetes have been declining, likely because clinical management of the macrovascular complications of diabetes has improved in many (but not all) locations. Prevention trials show that with intensive resources devoted to weight loss and physical activity, reductions in FPG can be achieved; however, these interventions have not been implemented at a national scale and adherence in the long run is challenging. Systematic efforts to screen for high FPG implemented in some countries may increase awareness and action in more patients but can be resource-intensive. Clinical interventions to reduce FPG can be effective, although there are more recent debates on the appropriate targets for treatment in some cases. With FPG increasing in many settings, it is difficult to determine the population effect of treatment of blood sugar on population FPG. FPG remains one of the risk factors that is most likely influenced at the primary health-care level, emphasising the role of universal coverage for primary care in a multipronged response to this increasing problem.

### Worldwide trends in diabetes since 1980: a pooled analysis of 751 population-based studies with 4.4 million participants [^c92683e3]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

One of the global targets for non-communicable diseases is to halt, by 2025, the rise in the age-standardised adult prevalence of diabetes at its 2010 levels. We aimed to estimate worldwide trends in diabetes, how likely it is for countries to achieve the global target, and how changes in prevalence, together with population growth and ageing, are affecting the number of adults with diabetes.

Methods

We pooled data from population-based studies that had collected data on diabetes through measurement of its biomarkers. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends in diabetes prevalence-defined as fasting plasma glucose of 7.0 mmol/L or higher, or history of diagnosis with diabetes, or use of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs-in 200 countries and territories in 21 regions, by sex and from 1980 to 2014. We also calculated the posterior probability of meeting the global diabetes target if post-2000 trends continue.

Findings

We used data from 751 studies including 4,372,000 adults from 146 of the 200 countries we make estimates for. Global age-standardised diabetes prevalence increased from 4.3% (95% credible interval 2.4–7.0) in 1980 to 9.0% (7.2–11.1) in 2014 in men, and from 5.0% (2.9–7.9) to 7.9% (6.4–9.7) in women. The number of adults with diabetes in the world increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 (28.5% due to the rise in prevalence, 39.7% due to population growth and ageing, and 31.8% due to interaction of these two factors). Age-standardised adult diabetes prevalence in 2014 was lowest in northwestern Europe, and highest in Polynesia and Micronesia, at nearly 25%, followed by Melanesia and the Middle East and north Africa. Between 1980 and 2014 there was little change in age-standardised diabetes prevalence in adult women in continental western Europe, although crude prevalence rose because of ageing of the population. By contrast, age-standardised adult prevalence rose by 15 percentage points in men and women in Polynesia and Micronesia. In 2014, American Samoa had the highest national prevalence of diabetes (> 30% in both sexes), with age-standardised adult prevalence also higher than 25% in some other islands in Polynesia and Micronesia. If post-2000 trends continue, the probability of meeting the global target of halting the rise in the prevalence of diabetes by 2025 at the 2010 level worldwide is lower than 1% for men and is 1% for women. Only nine countries for men and 29 countries for women, mostly in western Europe, have a 50% or higher probability of meeting the global target.

Interpretation

Since 1980, age-standardised diabetes prevalence in adults has increased, or at best remained unchanged, in every country. Together with population growth and ageing, this rise has led to a near quadrupling of the number of adults with diabetes worldwide. The burden of diabetes, both in terms of prevalence and number of adults affected, has increased faster in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.

### Cardiovascular health promotion in children: challenges and opportunities for 2020 and beyond: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^02085614]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Fasting blood glucose and youth type 2 diabetes prevalence — At 12 to 19 years of age, the prevalence of ideal fasting blood glucose is notably higher in girls (80%) than boys (63%), and between 20% and 38% of children exhibit intermediate or poor fasting plasma glucose. Mexican Americans exhibit the lowest prevalence of ideal fasting blood glucose (58%) compared with non-Hispanic whites (73%) and non-Hispanic blacks (79%) at the same age. Because a very small number of NHANES 2007 to 2008 participants 12–19 years of age were noted to have poor status for fasting blood glucose levels (n = 5), the accuracy of the prevalence estimates from this sample is limited. SEARCH is an observational, multicenter study focusing on physician-diagnosed diabetes mellitus in individuals < 20 years of age, and in 2009 the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus among adolescents 10 through 19 years of age was 0.046%, with lower rates in boys (0.038%) than girls (0.058%). The highest prevalence in children 10 to 19 years of age was observed in American Indians (0.120%), followed by black (0.106%), Hispanic (0.079%), and Asian/Pacific-Islander (0.034%) youth, with the lowest in non-Hispanic white youth (0.017%); children 10 to 14 years had 0.023% compared with 15 to 19 years at 0.068%. Estimates from the population-based surveillance study should be used in conjunction with estimates from the NHANES data to monitor changes in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Clinical and metabolomic predictors of regression to normoglycemia in a population at intermediate cardiometabolic risk [^ae315d18]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Impaired fasting glucose (IFG), a highly prevalent intermediate stage between normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), is characterized by metabolic alterations that lead to increased type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular complications. Empirical evidence support that individuals with type 2 diabetes are at twofold increased cardiovascular risk as compared to people without type 2 diabetes, indication that preventing new onset of type 2 diabetes is an efficient approach to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease. A number of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of controlling cardiovascular risk factors in reducing the risk of cardiovascular outcomes among patients with diabetes and prediabetes. The identification of clinical and molecular features associated with regression to normoglycemia has the potential to inform the design and implementation of more efficient cardiovascular risk-reduction strategies.

Preliminary evidence from prospective epidemiological studies have identified clinical predictors of regression to normoglycemia including age, baseline fasting glucose, absence of postprandial hyperglycemia, higher insulin secretion, lower BMI, preserved β-cell function, lower fasting triglycerides, and higher baseline muscle mass. These studies have been mainly conducted in individuals from European or Asian ancestry, and the extent to which previous findings are similar in other populations with rapid conversion rate from impaired fasting glucose to type 2 diabetes such as Latino populations is unknown. The high prevalence of metabolic disorders in Amerindian-derived populations is a well-known phenomenon. Studies of household-level dietary patterns and eating habits in Mexico have confirmed an increased consumption of calories, fats and simple sugars. Although these lifestyle changes have occurred in many areas of the world, Amerindian-derived populations exhibit a disproportionate impact on their overall health and rates of cardiometabolic diseases. The prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes among the Hispanic population in the United States are higher than the national average. This has been attributed to the transition to a westernized lifestyle in which increased consumption of sugars and unhealthy fats maximizes inherited susceptibility obesity and insulin resistance.

### Age-and sex-specific prevalences of diabetes and impaired glucose regulation in 13 European cohorts [^8e45b816]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the age- and sex-specific prevalences of diabetes and impaired glucose regulation (IGR) according to the revised 1999 World Health Organization criteria for diabetes in Europe.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 13 studies from nine European countries with 7,680 men and 9,251 women aged 30–89 years were included in the data analysis.

Results

In most of the study populations, the age-specific prevalences of diabetes were < 10% in subjects younger than 60 years and between 10 and 20% at 60–79 years of age. Mean 2-h plasma glucose (2hPG) concentration increased linearly with age, but fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration did not. The increase in the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and IGR in the elderly was mainly a result of the large increase in 2hPG rather than FPG. Diabetes and impaired fasting glycemia defined by isolated fasting hyperglycemia was more common in men than in women 30–69 years of age, whereas the prevalence of isolated postload hyperglycemia, particularly impaired glucose tolerance, was higher in women than in men, especially in the elderly (individuals > 70 years of age). More than half of the diabetes was undiagnosed in subjects younger than 50 years of age.

Conclusions

Most European populations have a moderate to low prevalence of diabetes and IGR. Diabetes and IGR will be underestimated in Europe, particularly in women and in elderly men, if diagnoses are based on fasting glucose determination alone.

### Age-and sex-specific prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose regulation in 11 Asian cohorts [^07a0855a]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the age- and sex-specific prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose regulation (IGR) according to revised World Health Organization criteria for diabetes in Asian populations.

Research Design and Methods

We performed 11 studies of 4 countries, comprising 24,335 subjects (10,851 men and 13,484 women) aged 30–89 years who attended the 2-h oral glucose tolerance test and met the inclusion criteria for data analysis.

Results

The prevalence of diabetes increased with age and reached the peak at 70–89 years of age in Chinese and Japanese subjects but peaked at 60–69 years of age followed by a decline at the 70 years of age in Indian subjects. At 30–79 years of age, the 10-year age-specific prevalence of diabetes was higher in Indian than in Chinese and Japanese subjects. Indian subjects also had a higher prevalence of IGR in the younger age-groups (30–49 years) compared with that for Chinese and Japanese subjects. Impaired glucose tolerance was more prevalent than impaired fasting glycemia in all Asian populations studied for all age-groups.

Conclusions

Indians had the highest prevalence of diabetes among Asian countries. The age at which the peak prevalence of diabetes was reached was approximately 10 years younger in Indian compared with Chinese and Japanese subjects. Diabetes and IGR will be underestimated in Asians based on the fasting glucose testing alone.

### Prevalence of diabetes and intermediate hyperglycemia among adults from the first multinational study of noncommunicable diseases in six central American countries: the central America diabetes initiative (CAMDI) [^43d27639]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The CAMDI survey was a cross-sectional survey based on a probabilistic, stratified, multistage, cluster sampling design of the noninstitutionalized population of five Central American sites. The survey sampled included the entire national population in Belize; the overall metropolitan populations in San Jose, Costa Rica; Tegucigalpa, Honduras; and Managua, Nicaragua; and was restricted to the municipalities of Santa Tecla and Villa Nueva, which are part of the metropolitan areas of San Salvador and Guatemala City, respectively.

In each city, the primary sampling unit was a cluster of independent households within predetermined geographic areas. The primary sampling units were grouped into geographic strata (sectors and compact segments or blocks). The sample was allocated proportionally to the size of the population within each geographic stratum of each city. All eligible individuals aged 20 years or older in the randomly selected households were invited to participate. Data were weighted to account for differential selection probabilities and survey nonresponse, and weights were poststratified to the adult population of each site based on age group and sex. The total sample population was 10,822, of whom 7,234 (66.8%) underwent anthropometry measurement and laboratory tests. Data were weighted to represent the population of the sampled city, except in Belize, where data were weighted to the country's entire population. The sample represented more than 2 million inhabitants of the selected sites (Table 1).

Table 1
Sample characteristics and prevalence of diagnosed diabetes, newly diagnosed diabetes, and intermediate hyperglycemia (IGT/IFG) by sex and site

Participants were requested to fast overnight the day they came to the examination center. Venous blood samples were collected in sodium fluoride tubes before and 2 h after a glucose load (75 g of anhydrous glucose). The cold chain was kept until the plasma was separated (2 to 4 h after extraction) and the corresponding analysis was done the same day or the next day. Glucose was determined by standard enzymatic methods. Except in El Salvador, laboratory tests included fasting blood glucose (FBG) and a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In El Salvador, only fasting glucose was determined through a capillary blood sample tested in a HemoCue glucose analyzer (HemoCue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden) that reports plasma equivalent values.

### Risk models and scores for type 2 diabetes: systematic review [^a1f3a03f]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of diabetes is rising rapidly throughout the world. By 2010 its prevalence in the adult populations of the United Kingdom, the United States, mainland China, and the United Arab Emirates had exceeded 7%,11%,15%, and 17%, respectively. Americans born in 2000 or later have a lifetime risk of more than one in three of developing diabetes. Type 2 diabetes (which accounts for over 95% of diabetes worldwide) results from a complex gene-environment interaction for which several risk factors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, family history, obesity, and hypertension, are well documented. The precise interaction of these and other risk factors with one another is, however, a complex process that varies both within and across populations. Epidemiologists and statisticians are striving to produce weighted models that can be presented as scores to reflect this complexity but which at the same time are perceived as sufficiently simple, plausible, affordable, and widely implementable in clinical practice.

Cohort studies have shown that early detection of established diabetes improves outcome, although the evidence base for screening the entire population is weak. The proportion of cases of incident type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose levels was reduced in landmark trials from China, Finland, and the United Statesby up to 33%, 50%, and 58%, respectively, through lifestyle changes (increased exercise, weight loss) or pharmacotherapy, or both, although changes may be more modest in a non-trial population. Some have argued that because combining known risk factors predicts incident diabetes at least as effectively as impaired glucose metabolism, a diabetes risk score may be a better and more practical means of identifying people for preventive interventions than either a glucose tolerance test or a fasting blood glucose level. Others favour targeting the assessment of diabetes risk in those with established impaired glucose metabolism on the basis that interventions in this group are particularly effective.

### Prevalence and characteristics of diabetic patients with no ongoing care in south auckland [^85141a74]. Diabetes Care (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the prevalence of default from diabetes care and to reveal associated characteristics among patients with known diabetes in urban South Auckland, New Zealand.

Research Design and Methods

We developed a cross-sectional household study of patients with known diabetes and compared those patients with and without ongoing care. Ongoing care was defined as having been clinically reviewed at least once in the previous 10 months.

Results

Of the 1,488 European, Maori, and Pacific Islander subjects with known diabetes, 107 (6.3%) had not seen a general practitioner or a diabetes service in the previous 10 months. Subjects not attending a diabetes service were more likely than subjects attending a diabetes service to have been diagnosed when screened asymptomatically (11.7 vs. 5.2%, P = 0.008) and after gestational diabetes (39.7 vs. 11.7%, P < 0.001). Maori were most likely to have no ongoing care (10.8 vs. 5.8% European and 6.6% of Pacific Islander subjects, P = 0.01). Nonattenders were younger, were diagnosed at a younger age, knew less about diabetes, were less satisfied with past care, and were less likely to require medication.

Conclusions

The elevated number of diabetic individuals not attending ongoing care is a significant problem in this population, and it may reflect a decisional balance as seen in problem behaviors. Diagnosis when asymptomatic may contribute to default from ongoing care; in this case, caution is required if population-based screening programs are being considered.

### Representation of native hawaiian and pacific islander individuals in clinical trials [^4cbc1c47]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

Although sampling a representative population does not guarantee Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander participation in every small trial, making a deliberate effort to recruit Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander participants ensures that a historically marginalized population is not overlooked or excluded. Equity gives meaning to clinical trial results. With equity, clinical trial participants are representative of people with the condition in the US and the results provide the average effect for people with the condition in the country. Without equity, the results are difficult to generalize beyond the study population.

34. Thus, isolated postprandial hyperglycemia in the face of normal fasting plasma glucose and normal hemoglobin A1c values is associated with a 2-fold increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease.

Using a Cox proportional hazards model, it was found that the risks for death from CVD, coronary heart disease, stroke, and all causes were increased by 32%, 27%, 21%, and 37%, respectively, in people with IGT and by 40%, 56%, 29%, and 73%, respectively, in people with type 2 diabetes. The results of the DECODE study were corroborated in a different ethnic population by the Funagata Diabetes Study, which showed a 2-fold increased risk of dying from CVD in Japanese with IGT. 23 Parenthetically, in this study there was no increased risk in individuals with impaired fasting plasma glucose concentrations, ie, those between 110 and 126 mg/dL. The Norfolk cohort of the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer and Nutrition Study34 determined at the end of 1999 the fate of 4662 men aged 45 to 79 years who had their HbA1c measured between 1995 and 1997.

The group was subdivided into those with HbA1c levels below
5. 0%, those with values between 5. 0% and
5. 4%, those with values between 5. 5% and
6. 9%, those with values above 7. 0%, and those with self-reported diabetes. The above results are virtually identical with those from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Mortality Study. 36 This was a 12- to 16-year follow-up of a representative sample of the US population who underwent oral glucose tolerance testing between 1979 and 1980. It was found that relative risk for death from CVD was increased by 20% in individuals with IGT and by nearly 70% in individuals with previously undiagnosed diabetes.

The Hoorn Study, 27 a population-based 8-year follow-up of 2363 individuals aged 50 to 70 years without known diabetes found that, using conventional Cox proportional hazards model statistical evaluation, an elevated 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose level 2 SDs above the population mean increased the risk for death from CVD by 62% even after excluding individuals with preexisting CVD and correcting for other known risk factors. Finally, further support is found in a longitudinal population-based study in Polynesia22 in which nearly 10 000 individuals were followed up after 5 to 12 years. This study indicated that those with isolated postprandial hyperglycemia had an increased cardiovascular mortality of 2. 3 to
2. 6 fold. As HbA1c levels increase from less than 5. 0% to over
7. 5%, fasting plasma glucose levels increase from approximately 90 mg/dL (5.

### Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia: the current status on definition and intervention [^8e28d157]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

A workshop was convened by the International Diabetes Federation to review the latest information relating to the risks associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) for future diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The workshop sought to address three questions: (i) are the current definitions of IGT and IFG appropriate; (ii) are IFG and IGT risk factors, risk markers or diseases; (iii) what interventions (if any) should be recommended for people with IFG and IGT? The determinants of elevated fasting glucose and 2-h plasma glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test (2-HPG) levels differ. Raised hepatic glucose output and a defect in early insulin secretion are characteristic of the former, and peripheral insulin resistance is most characteristic of the latter. Therefore, it is not surprising that the concordance between the categories of IFG and IGT is limited. In all prevalence studies to date only half or less of people with IFG have IGT, and even a lower proportion (20–30%) with IGT also have IFG. In the majority of populations studied, IGT is more prevalent than IFG, and there is a difference in phenotype and gender distribution between the two categories. IFG is substantially more common amongst men and IGT slightly more common amongst women. The prevalence of IFG tends to plateau in middle age whereas the prevalence of IGT rises into old age. Both IFG and IGT are associated with a substantially increased risk of developing diabetes, with the highest risk in people with combined IFG and IGT. Because IGT is commoner than IFG in most populations it is more sensitive (but slightly less specific) for identifying people who will develop diabetes. In most populations studied, 60% of people who develop diabetes have either IGT or IFG 5 years or so before, with the other 40% having normal glucose tolerance at that time. The limited published data suggest that both isolated IFG (I-IFG) and isolated IGT (I-IGT) are similarly associated with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia, with the highest risk in those with combined IFG and IGT. However, some data have suggested that I-IGT is more strongly associated with hypertension and dyslipidaemia (features of the metabolic syndrome) than I-IFG. In unadjusted analyses both IFG and IGT are associated with CVD and total mortality. In separate analyses for fasting and 2-HPG adjusted for other cardiovascular risk factors (from the DECODE study) there remains a continuous relationship between 2-HPG and mortality, but an independent relationship with fasting glucose is only found above 7.0 mmol/l. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are continuously and positively associated with CVD and total mortality independent of other CVD risk factors. Life style interventions, including weight loss and increased physical activity, are highly effective in preventing or delaying the onset of diabetes in people with IGT. Two randomized controlled trials of individuals with IGT found that life style intervention studies reduce the risk of progressing to diabetes by 58%. The oral hypoglycaemic drugs metformin and acarbose have also been shown to be effective, but less so than the life style measures. Similar data do not yet exist for the effectiveness of such interventions in people with I-IFG. Larger studies are required to evaluate the effects of interventions on cardiovascular outcomes in people with IGT. Cost effective strategies to identify people with IGT for intervention should be developed and evaluated. The use of simple risk scores to assess who should undergo an oral glucose tolerance test is one promising approach, although these will need to be population-specific. In conclusion, IGT and IFG differ in their prevalence, population distribution, phenotype, and risk of total mortality and CVD. The consensus of the workshop was: 1. The diagnostic thresholds for all categories of glucose intolerance should be revisited in the light of the latest evidence. There was no clear consensus (with current evidence) on whether IFG and IGT should be classified as diseases, but they clearly represent risk factors and risk markers for diabetes and CVD, respectively. 2. Both IGT and IFG are similarly associated with an increased risk of diabetes, but IGT is more strongly associated with CVD outcomes. 3. Risks are higher when IGT and IFG coexist. 4. Life style interventions are highly effective in delaying or preventing the onset of diabetes in people with IGT and may reduce CVD and total mortality, but the latter requires formal testing.

### Hyperglycaemia and its risk factors among adults living with HIV on follow-up at the hawassa city administration, Southern Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study [^7efd507d]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Sample Size Determination and Sampling Technique

The sample size was determined using the single population proportion formula and calculated with Epi Info version 7.2 software, assuming a 95% confidence interval (CI), a significance level (α) of 5%, a margin of error of 0.05 and an anticipated DM incidence of 16% among PLWH on ART in Ethiopia. The initial calculated sample size was 229, with a 10% adjustment for non‐response. This study was part of a broader NCDs project with multiple objectives. The sample size of 279 determined based on a 23.9% prevalence rate for one of the NCDs was larger than that calculated for hyperglycaemia, ensuring better representativeness for the overall evaluation of NCDs. Accounting for a design effect of 1.5 and an anticipated 10% non‐response rate, we calculated the final sample size to be 465. Allocation was then based on the number of PLWH on first‐line regimens at each facility. We calculated the sampling interval for each facility by dividing the number of PLWH on first‐line ART by the allocated sample size. Participants were selected using a systematic random sampling method within each health facility.

2.4 Data Collection and Procedure

Socio‐demographic, socio‐economic, clinical and other relevant data were collected using an interviewer‐administered structured questionnaire. Trained nurses working in the respective ART clinics conducted the interviews and measurements. They also extracted relevant clinical data from participants' medical records.

2.5 Variables and Measurement

2.5.1 Dependent Variable

In this study, we defined hyperglycaemia among adults with HIV as the primary outcome variable, using a fasting blood glucose (FBG) level of ≥ 100 mg/dL, which includes both prediabetes and T2DM. We classified hyperglycaemia according to the guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA), which have been adopted in the Clinical and Programmatic Management guidelines of Major NCDs in Ethiopia. Diabetes was diagnosed based on FBG ≥ 126 mg/dL, self‐reported history and antidiabetic medication use or confirmed from medical records. Undiagnosed diabetes or newly diagnosed DM during this study was defined as FBG ≥ 126 mg/dL, confirmed by a repeat test of the same sample. Prediabetes (IFG) was defined by FBG levels between 100 and 125 mg/dL.

### Comparing different definitions of prediabetes with subsequent risk of diabetes: an individual participant data meta-analysis involving 76 513 individuals and 8208 cases of incident diabetes [^526db45a]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality globally. There are an estimated 425 million individuals aged 20–79 years worldwide with diabetes, 90% of whom have type 2 diabetes and 212 million of them are living with undiagnosed diabetes. As type 2 diabetes is largely lifestyle-related and it is possible to delay or prevent onset through appropriate behavior modification, early identification of individuals most at risk of developing type 2 diabetes has become a cornerstone of public health and diabetes prevention policies.

Although the relationship between blood glucose and vascular risk has been shown to be positive and increase monotonically from a low threshold, cut-points for fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour postload plasma glucose (2hPG) following an oral glucose challenge and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) are frequently used to diagnose diabetes and initiate treatment. Individuals with levels of glycemia that fall just below the cut-point for diabetes are considered to have 'prediabetes', a term that is often used to help identify individuals at risk of converting to overt diabetes, and who therefore may be most receptive to lifestyle interventions that prevent or delay onset. Prediabetes comprises heterogeneous states of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or elevated HbA1c. Although each of these conditions may have different underlying pathophysiologies, they have been reported to have similar diabetes progression rates in the range of 35.5–45.5 per 1000 person-years for current definitions of prediabetes based on these measures.

The definition of prediabetes has changed over time and there is currently no consensus as to the optimal definition for prediabetes in terms of identifying individuals at greatest risk of progressing to overt diabetes. Based on the WHO IGT definition, there are an estimated 352 million adults aged 20–79 years worldwide who are considered to have prediabetes, a figure that would increase if IFG was also included and increase substantially if a lower FPG threshold was to be adopted, as is advocated by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Despite the current lack of evidence regarding how best to define prediabetes and little reliable information regarding the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes, both the UK and the USA have issued guidelines recommending screening for prediabetes. There is a need for substantial evidence that could represent multiple geographical areas/populations in order to document the optimal diagnostic criteria.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^ce16b2cb]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Prevalence of diabetes and undiagnosed burden — global and U.S. epidemiology and projections are summarized with key disparities. Between 90% and 95% of all patients with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the prevalence of diabetes is expected to rise to 693 million people by 2045 from 451 million with diabetes in 2017, and globally in 2021 the prevalence in 20- to 79-year-olds was 10.5% (536.6 million people). The prevalence of type 1 diabetes is predicted to increase from 8.4 million worldwide in 2021 to 13.5 to 17.4 million by 2040 (60%–107% higher than in 2021). Estimates for 2021 in the United States reported that 38.4 million Americans 18 or older had diabetes (11.6% of that age group), and 22.8% were unaware that they had the disease; an additional estimated 97.6 million people (38% of U.S. adults) have impaired fasting blood glucose levels. Prevalence disparities include higher urban (12.1%) than rural (8.3%) regions and higher in high-income (11.1%) than low-income countries (5.5%). Economic burden is substantial, with diabetes-related health expenditures estimated at $966 billion USD for 2021 and projected at $1,054 billion USD by 2045. In 2021, one in two adults 20 to 79 years old with diabetes were unaware of their status (44.7%; 239.7 million), with the highest proportions in Africa (53.6%), Western Pacific (52.8%), and Southeast Asia (51.3%). In the United States, diabetes prevalence increases with age: 4.8% among individuals 18 to 44 years, 18.9% among those 45 to 64 years, and 29.2% among those 65 and older; and rates vary by race/ethnicity, highest in non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native (16.0%), non-Hispanic Black (12.6%), and Hispanic (10.3%) compared with non-Hispanic Asian (9.2%) and non-Hispanic White (8.5%).

### Representation of native hawaiian and pacific islander individuals in clinical trials [^98441225]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Inclusion of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander participants in clinical trials is particularly important because Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander individuals are disproportionately affected by many acute and chronic conditions. Compared with non-Hispanic White populations, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations had higher rates of asthmatic episodes, cancer deaths, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and type 2 diabetes. The objective of this descriptive study is to examine representation of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander individuals in clinical trials for the first FDA approvals of drug products with the top sales forecasts in 2024.

### Metformin for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications in persons at increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^e9f9a404]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The projected rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could develop into a substantial health problem worldwide. Whether metformin can prevent or delay T2DM and its complications in people with increased risk of developing T2DM is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of metformin for the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in persons at increased risk for the T2DM.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials. The date of the last search of all databases was March 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of one year or more comparing metformin with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or standard care in people with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or combinations of these.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles and records, assessed risk of bias and extracted outcome data independently. We used a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis and calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs randomising 6774 participants. One trial contributed 48% of all participants. The duration of intervention in the trials varied from one to five years. We judged none of the trials to be at low risk of bias in all 'Risk of bias' domains. Our main outcome measures were all-cause mortality, incidence of T2DM, serious adverse events (SAEs), cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, health-related quality of life and socioeconomic effects. The following comparisons mostly reported only a fraction of our main outcome set. Fifteen RCTs compared metformin with diet and exercise with or without placebo: all-cause mortality was 7/1353 versus 7/1480 (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.01; P = 0.83; 2833 participants, 5 trials; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 324/1751 versus 529/1881 participants (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.65; P < 0.001; 3632 participants, 12 trials; moderate-quality evidence); the reporting of SAEs was insufficient and diverse and meta-analysis could not be performed (reported numbers were 4/118 versus 2/191; 309 participants; 4 trials; very low-quality evidence); cardiovascular mortality was 1/1073 versus 4/1082 (2416 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). One trial reported no clear difference in health-related quality of life after 3.2 years of follow-up (very low-quality evidence). Two trials estimated the direct medical costs (DMC) per participant for metformin varying from $220 to $1177 versus $61 to $184 in the comparator group (2416 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence). Eight RCTs compared metformin with intensive diet and exercise: all-cause mortality was 7/1278 versus 4/1272 (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 5.23; P = 0.43; 2550 participants, 4 trials; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 304/1455 versus 251/1505 (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.37; P = 0.42; 2960 participants, 7 trials; moderate-quality evidence); the reporting of SAEs was sparse and meta-analysis could not be performed (one trial reported 1/44 in the metformin group versus 0/36 in the intensive exercise and diet group with SAEs). One trial reported that 1/1073 participants in the metformin group compared with 2/1079 participants in the comparator group died from cardiovascular causes. One trial reported that no participant died due to cardiovascular causes (very low-quality evidence). Two trials estimated the DMC per participant for metformin varying from $220 to $1177 versus $225 to $3628 in the comparator group (2400 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). Three RCTs compared metformin with acarbose: all-cause mortality was 1/44 versus 0/45 (89 participants; 1 trial; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 12/147 versus 7/148 (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.14; P = 0.22; 295 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence); SAEs were 1/51 versus 2/50 (101 participants; 1 trial; very low-quality evidence). Three RCTs compared metformin with thiazolidinediones: incidence of T2DM was 9/161 versus 9/159 (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.40; P = 0.98; 320 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). SAEs were 3/45 versus 0/41 (86 participants; 1 trial; very low-quality evidence). Three RCTs compared metformin plus intensive diet and exercise with identical intensive diet and exercise: all-cause mortality was 1/121 versus 1/120 participants (450 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 48/166 versus 53/166 (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.92; P = 0.49; 332 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). One trial estimated the DMC of metformin plus intensive diet and exercise to be $270 per participant compared with $225 in the comparator group (94 participants; 1 trial; very-low quality evidence). One trial in 45 participants compared metformin with a sulphonylurea. The trial reported no patient-important outcomes. For all comparisons there were no data on non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or microvascular complications. We identified 11 ongoing trials which potentially could provide data of interest for this review. These trials will add a total of 17,853 participants in future updates of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

Metformin compared with placebo or diet and exercise reduced or delayed the risk of T2DM in people at increased risk for the development of T2DM (moderate-quality evidence). However, metformin compared to intensive diet and exercise did not reduce or delay the risk of T2DM (moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, the combination of metformin and intensive diet and exercise compared to intensive diet and exercise only neither showed an advantage or disadvantage regarding the development of T2DM (very low-quality evidence). Data on patient-important outcomes such as mortality, macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications and health-related quality of life were sparse or missing.

### Predicting the 20-year diabetes incidence rate [^dc619746]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The long-range prediction from clinical variables of the onset of diabetes is important to patients and clinicians. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of various glucose-related clinical measurements in predicting the 20-year risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in an elderly population.

Methods

In a prospective study, 672 men and women aged 59–92 years, who were not diabetic in 1980 and were part of a nationwide longitudinal randomized study, were followed-up in 2000–2003. Fasting glucose, 1- and 2-h post-oral glucose tolerance and insulin were measured in 1980 and 2000–2003.

Results

A group of 174 (25.9%) survivors had progressed to diabetes during the 20-year follow-up. Fasting glucose values were a good predictor for diabetes. With the 100 mg/dL cut-off of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), a 2-4-times higher predictive sensitivity followed the dramatic increase in IFG prevalence compared to the 110 mg/dL cut-off, but at a cost of reduced specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). By receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis, a 1-h post-load glucose was similar to 2 h and fasting glucose in prediction of the 20-year incidence of diabetes, and classifying correctly the 77, 74 and 73% of the group, respectively. In adjusted logistic regressions, 2.28, 1.78 and 1.69-folds increased the 20-year risk, and were associated with each SD increment of the respective glucose values (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Although the best population-based strategy for the diagnosis of T2DM would be the combination of fasting glucose followed by post-load glucose, for the purposes of long-term prediction of T2DM risk, fasting glucose is sufficient.

### Diagnostic strategies to detect glucose intolerance in a multiethnic population [^84d85564]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Identifying individuals who have elevated glucose concentrations is important for clinicians so that preventive strategies can be invoked, and it is useful for researchers who study associations between elevated glucose and adverse health outcomes. These methods should be applicable worldwide across different ethnic groups. Therefore, the objective of our analysis was to determine whether using the fasting glucose and HbA(1c) together could improve the classification of individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes in a multiethnic cohort randomly assembled in Canada.

Research Design and Methods

We determined the optimum diagnostic criteria to identify people with abnormal glucose tolerance using fasting plasma glucose, 2-h post-glucose load plasma glucose, and HbA(1c) in 936 Canadians of South Asian, Chinese, and European descent.

Results

The sensitivity of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria to diagnose diabetes compared with the World Health Organization definitions was poor at 48.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35.7–61.0). Using a receiver operator characteristic curve, the optimum combined cut-point using fasting glucose and HbA(1c) to diagnose diabetes was a fasting glucose ≥ 5.7 mmol/l and an HbA(1c) ≥ 5.9%. These cut-points were associated with a sensitivity and specificity of 71.7% (60.3–83.1) and 95.0% (93.5–96.4), respectively, a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 14.3 (9.6–19.0), and a negative LR of 0.3 (0.2–0.4). Significant ethnic variation in the sensitivity and specificity of this approach was observed: 47.4% (24.9–69.8) and 97.6% (95.9–99.4) among Europeans, 78.6% (57.1–100) and 95.9% (93.6–98.2) among Chinese, and 85.2% (71.8–98.6) and 91.3% (88.1–94.6) among South Asians, respectively. Participants with impaired glucose tolerance could not be identified reliably using the fasting glucose or HbA(1c) alone or in combination.

Conclusions

The sensitivity of the ADA criteria to diagnose diabetes is low, and there is substantial variation between ethnic groups. Fasting glucose and HbA(1c) may be used together to improve the identification of individuals who have diabetes, allowing clinicians to streamline the use of the oral glucose tolerance test.

### Diet, physical activity or both for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications in people at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus [^da0c9066]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The projected rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could develop into a substantial health problem worldwide. Whether diet, physical activity or both can prevent or delay T2DM and its associated complications in at-risk people is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of diet, physical activity or both on the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in people at increased risk of developing T2DM.

Search Methods

This is an update of the Cochrane Review published in 2008. We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP Search Portal and reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. The date of the last search of all databases was January 2017. We continuously used a MEDLINE email alert service to identify newly published studies using the same search strategy as described for MEDLINE up to September 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of two years or more.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology for data collection and analysis. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 12 RCTs randomising 5238 people. One trial contributed 41% of all participants. The duration of the interventions varied from two to six years. We judged none of the included trials at low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains. Eleven trials compared diet plus physical activity with standard or no treatment. Nine RCTs included participants with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), one RCT included participants with IGT, impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG) or both, and one RCT included people with fasting glucose levels between 5.3 to 6.9 mmol/L. A total of 12 deaths occurred in 2049 participants in the diet plus physical activity groups compared with 10 in 2050 participants in the comparator groups (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.50; 95% prediction interval 0.44 to 2.88; 4099 participants, 10 trials; very low-quality evidence). The definition of T2DM incidence varied among the included trials. Altogether 315 of 2122 diet plus physical activity participants (14.8%) developed T2DM compared with 614 of 2389 comparator participants (25.7%) (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.64; 95% prediction interval 0.50 to 0.65; 4511 participants, 11 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Two trials reported serious adverse events. In one trial no adverse events occurred. In the other trial one of 51 diet plus physical activity participants compared with none of 51 comparator participants experienced a serious adverse event (low-quality evidence). Cardiovascular mortality was rarely reported (four of 1626 diet plus physical activity participants and four of 1637 comparator participants (the RR ranged between 0.94 and 3.16; 3263 participants, 7 trials; very low-quality evidence). Only one trial reported that no non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke had occurred (low-quality evidence). Two trials reported that none of the participants had experienced hypoglycaemia. One trial investigated health-related quality of life in 2144 participants and noted that a minimal important difference between intervention groups was not reached (very low-quality evidence). Three trials evaluated costs of the interventions in 2755 participants. The largest trial of these reported an analysis of costs from the health system perspective and society perspective reflecting USD 31,500 and USD 51,600 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with diet plus physical activity, respectively (low-quality evidence). There were no data on blindness or end-stage renal disease. One trial compared a diet-only intervention with a physical-activity intervention or standard treatment. The participants had IGT. Three of 130 participants in the diet group compared with none of the 141 participants in the physical activity group died (very low-quality evidence). None of the participants died because of cardiovascular disease (very low-quality evidence). Altogether 57 of 130 diet participants (43.8%) compared with 58 of 141 physical activity participants (41.1%) group developed T2DM (very low-quality evidence). No adverse events were recorded (very low-quality evidence). There were no data on non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, blindness, end-stage renal disease, health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects. Two trials compared physical activity with standard treatment in 397 participants. One trial included participants with IGT, the other trial included participants with IGT, IFG or both. One trial reported that none of the 141 physical activity participants compared with three of 133 control participants died. The other trial reported that three of 84 physical activity participants and one of 39 control participants died (very low-quality evidence). In one trial T2DM developed in 58 of 141 physical activity participants (41.1%) compared with 90 of 133 control participants (67.7%). In the other trial 10 of 84 physical activity participants (11.9%) compared with seven of 39 control participants (18%) developed T2DM (very low-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were rarely reported (one trial noted no events, one trial described events in three of 66 physical activity participants compared with one of 39 control participants - very low-quality evidence). Only one trial reported on cardiovascular mortality (none of 274 participants died - very low-quality evidence). Non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke were rarely observed in the one trial randomising 123 participants (very low-quality evidence). One trial reported that none of the participants in the trial experienced hypoglycaemia. One trial investigating health-related quality of life in 123 participants showed no substantial differences between intervention groups (very low-quality evidence). There were no data on blindness or socioeconomic effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no firm evidence that diet alone or physical activity alone compared to standard treatment influences the risk of T2DM and especially its associated complications in people at increased risk of developing T2DM. However, diet plus physical activity reduces or delays the incidence of T2DM in people with IGT. Data are lacking for the effect of diet plus physical activity for people with intermediate hyperglycaemia defined by other glycaemic variables. Most RCTs did not investigate patient-important outcomes.

### Effects of diabetes definition on global surveillance of diabetes prevalence and diagnosis: a pooled analysis of 96 population-based studies with 331, 288 participants [^7b242daf]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes has been defined on the basis of different biomarkers, including fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test (2hOGTT), and HbA1c. We assessed the effect of different diagnostic definitions on both the population prevalence of diabetes and the classification of previously undiagnosed individuals as having diabetes versus not having diabetes in a pooled analysis of data from population-based health examination surveys in different regions.

Methods

We used data from 96 population-based health examination surveys that had measured at least two of the biomarkers used for defining diabetes. Diabetes was defined using HbA1c (HbA1c ≥ 6·5% or history of diabetes diagnosis or using insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs) compared with either FPG only or FPG-or-2hOGTT definitions (FPG ≥ 7·0 mmol/L or 2hOGTT ≥ 11·1 mmol/L or history of diabetes or using insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs). We calculated diabetes prevalence, taking into account complex survey design and survey sample weights. We compared the prevalences of diabetes using different definitions graphically and by regression analyses. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of diabetes diagnosis based on HbA1c compared with diagnosis based on glucose among previously undiagnosed individuals (ie, excluding those with history of diabetes or using insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs). We calculated sensitivity and specificity in each survey, and then pooled results using a random-effects model. We assessed the sources of heterogeneity of sensitivity by meta-regressions for study characteristics selected a priori.

Findings

Population prevalence of diabetes based on FPG-or-2hOGTT was correlated with prevalence based on FPG alone (r = 0·98), but was higher by 2–6 percentage points at different prevalence levels. Prevalence based on HbA1c was lower than prevalence based on FPG in 42·8% of age-sex-survey groups and higher in another 41·6%; in the other 15·6%, the two definitions provided similar prevalence estimates. The variation across studies in the relation between glucose-based and HbA1c-based prevalences was partly related to participants' age, followed by natural logarithm of per person gross domestic product, the year of survey, mean BMI, and whether the survey population was national, subnational, or from specific communities. Diabetes defined as HbA1c 6·5% or more had a pooled sensitivity of 52·8% (95% CI 51·3–54·3%) and a pooled specificity of 99·74% (99·71–99·78%) compared with FPG 7·0 mmol/L or more for diagnosing previously undiagnosed participants; sensitivity compared with diabetes defined based on FPG-or-2hOGTT was 30·5% (28·7–32·3%). None of the preselected study-level characteristics explained the heterogeneity in the sensitivity of HbA1c versus FPG.

Interpretation

Different biomarkers and definitions for diabetes can provide different estimates of population prevalence of diabetes, and differentially identify people without previous diagnosis as having diabetes. Using an HbA1c-based definition alone in health surveys will not identify a substantial proportion of previously undiagnosed people who would be considered as having diabetes using a glucose-based test.

### Sustaining better diabetes care in remote indigenous Australian communities [^dfd4b82d]. BMJ (2003). Excellent credibility.

Problem

Inhabitants of Torres Strait Islands have the highest prevalence of diabetes in Australia and many preventable complications. In 1999, a one year randomised cluster trial showed improved diabetes care processes and reduced admissions to hospital when local indigenous health workers used registers, recall and reminder systems, and basic diabetes care plans, supported by a specialist outreach service. This study looked at whether those improvements were sustained two years after the end of the trial.

Design

Three year follow up clinical audit of 21 primary healthcare centres, and review of admissions to hospital in the previous 12 months.

Background and Setting

Remote indigenous communities in far north east Australia, population about 9600, including 921 people with diabetes.

Key Measures For Improvement

Number of people on registers, care processes (regular measures of weight, blood pressure, haemoglobin A1c, urinary protein concentration, and concentrations of serum lipids and creatinine), appropriate clinical interventions (drug treatment and vaccinations), and intermediate patient outcome measures (weight, blood pressure, and glycaemic control). Admissions to hospital.

Strategies For Change

Audit and feedback to clinicians and managers; provision of clinical guidelines and a clear management structure; workshops and training.

Effects Of Change

The number of people on registers increased from 555 in 1999 to 921 in 2002. Most care processes and clinical interventions improved. The proportion of people with good glycaemic control (haemoglobin A1c ≤ 7%) increased from 18% to 25% in line with increased use of insulin (from 7% to 16%). The proportion of those with well controlled hypertension (< 140/90) increased from 40% to 64%. The proportion admitted to hospital with a diabetes related condition fell from 25% to 20%. Mean weight increased from 87 kg to 91 kg.

Lessons Learnt

In remote settings, appropriate management structures and clinical support for people with diabetes can lead to improvements in care processes, control of blood pressure, and preventable complications that result in admission to hospital. Control of weight and glycaemia are more difficult and requires more active community engagement. Priorities now include increasing the availability and affordability of good food, achieving weight loss, and increasing appropriate use of hypoglycaemic agents, including insulin.

### Development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with intermediate hyperglycaemia [^38f5bfa0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intermediate hyperglycaemia (IH) is characterised by one or more measurements of elevated blood glucose concentrations, such as impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). These levels are higher than normal but below the diagnostic threshold for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The reduced threshold of 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) for defining IFG, introduced by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in 2003, substantially increased the prevalence of IFG. Likewise, the lowering of the HbA1c threshold from 6.0% to 5.7% by the ADA in 2010 could potentially have significant medical, public health and socioeconomic impacts.

Objectives

To assess the overall prognosis of people with IH for developing T2DM, regression from IH to normoglycaemia and the difference in T2DM incidence in people with IH versus people with normoglycaemia.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, ClincialTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal up to December 2016 and updated the MEDLINE search in February 2018. We used several complementary search methods in addition to a Boolean search based on analytical text mining.

Selection Criteria

We included prospective cohort studies investigating the development of T2DM in people with IH. We used standard definitions of IH as described by the ADA or World Health Organization (WHO). We excluded intervention trials and studies on cohorts with additional comorbidities at baseline, studies with missing data on the transition from IH to T2DM, and studies where T2DM incidence was evaluated by documents or self-report only.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author extracted study characteristics, and a second author checked the extracted data. We used a tailored version of the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool for assessing risk of bias. We pooled incidence and incidence rate ratios (IRR) using a random-effects model to account for between-study heterogeneity. To meta-analyse incidence data, we used a method for pooling proportions. For hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR) of IH versus normoglycaemia, reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI), we obtained standard errors from these CIs and performed random-effects meta-analyses using the generic inverse-variance method. We used multivariable HRs and the model with the greatest number of covariates. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with an adapted version of the GRADE framework.

Main Results

We included 103 prospective cohort studies. The studies mainly defined IH by IFG 5.6 (FPG mmol/L 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L or 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL), IFG 6.1 (FPG 6.1 mmol/L to 6.9 mmol/L or 110 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL), IGT (plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/L to 11.1 mmol/L or 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL two hours after a 75 g glucose load on the oral glucose tolerance test, combined IFG and IGT (IFG/IGT), and elevated HbA1c (HbA1c 5.7: HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% or 39 mmol/mol to 46 mmol/mol; HbA1c 6.0: HbA1c 6.0% to 6.4% or 42 mmol/mol to 46 mmol/mol). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 24 years. Ninety-three studies evaluated the overall prognosis of people with IH measured by cumulative T2DM incidence, and 52 studies evaluated glycaemic status as a prognostic factor for T2DM by comparing a cohort with IH to a cohort with normoglycaemia. Participants were of Australian, European or North American origin in 41 studies; Latin American in 7; Asian or Middle Eastern in 50; and Islanders or American Indians in 5. Six studies included children and/or adolescents. Cumulative incidence of T2DM associated with IFG 5.6, IFG 6.1, IGT and the combination of IFG/IGT increased with length of follow-up. Cumulative incidence was highest with IFG/IGT, followed by IGT, IFG 6.1 and IFG 5.6. Limited data showed a higher T2DM incidence associated with HbA1c 6.0 compared to HbA1c 5.7. We rated the evidence for overall prognosis as of moderate certainty because of imprecision (wide CIs in most studies). In the 47 studies reporting restitution of normoglycaemia, regression ranged from 33% to 59% within one to five years follow-up, and from 17% to 42% for 6 to 11 years of follow-up (moderate-certainty evidence). Studies evaluating the prognostic effect of IH versus normoglycaemia reported different effect measures (HRs, IRRs and ORs). Overall, the effect measures all indicated an elevated risk of T2DM at 1 to 24 years of follow-up. Taking into account the long-term follow-up of cohort studies, estimation of HRs for time-dependent events like T2DM incidence appeared most reliable. The pooled HR and the number of studies and participants for different IH definitions as compared to normoglycaemia were: IFG 5.6: HR 4.32 (95% CI 2.61 to 7.12), 8 studies, 9017 participants; IFG 6.1: HR 5.47 (95% CI 3.50 to 8.54), 9 studies, 2818 participants; IGT: HR 3.61 (95% CI 2.31 to 5.64), 5 studies, 4010 participants; IFG and IGT: HR 6.90 (95% CI 4.15 to 11.45), 5 studies, 1038 participants; HbA1c 5.7: HR 5.55 (95% CI 2.77 to 11.12), 4 studies, 5223 participants; HbA1c 6.0: HR 10.10 (95% CI 3.59 to 28.43), 6 studies, 4532 participants. In subgroup analyses, there was no clear pattern of differences between geographic regions. We downgraded the evidence for the prognostic effect of IH versus normoglycaemia to low-certainty evidence due to study limitations because many studies did not adequately adjust for confounders. Imprecision and inconsistency required further downgrading due to wide 95% CIs and wide 95% prediction intervals (sometimes ranging from negative to positive prognostic factor to outcome associations), respectively. This evidence is up to date as of 26 February 2018.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall prognosis of people with IH worsened over time. T2DM cumulative incidence generally increased over the course of follow-up but varied with IH definition. Regression from IH to normoglycaemia decreased over time but was observed even after 11 years of follow-up. The risk of developing T2DM when comparing IH with normoglycaemia at baseline varied by IH definition. Taking into consideration the uncertainty of the available evidence, as well as the fluctuating stages of normoglycaemia, IH and T2DM, which may transition from one stage to another in both directions even after years of follow-up, practitioners should be careful about the potential implications of any active intervention for people 'diagnosed' with IH.

### High prevalence of diabetes and intermediate hyperglycemia-the Brazilian longitudinal study of adult health (ELSA-Brasil) [^fb667a2d]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

Our study has important strengths, including the size and diversity of the sample studied and the standardized data collection. The capacity to fully account for hyperglycemia and the various means of ascertainment of diabetes and intermediate hyperglycemia permit a comprehensive description of the disease burden across relevant socioeconomic groups, which is rarely accomplished in large surveys, particularly those from low and middle income countries.

Limitations to our study also merit discussion. First, our sample, consisting of university and research institute employees with stable employment and a high educational achievement, is not representative of the entire Brazilian population. However, as already mentioned, in terms of self-reported diabetes prevalence, our findings differ little from those found in a representative sample of similarly aged adults from Brazil's capital cities. Moreover, since diabetes prevalence is inversely related to educational attainment, if a bias is present in our sample through under-representation of those with less formal education, it is, if anything, likely to be a conservative one, leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of hyperglycemic conditions. Further, since we based our sample on individuals living in metropolitan areas, our results are most readily generalized to urban Brazil, which, according to the 2010 census, is the home of 84% of the Brazilian population.

Second, our ascertainment of previously known diabetes may suffer from the increased diabetes and intermediate hyperglycemia screening in recent years, since participants may tell us, erroneously, that they have diabetes when they have lesser than diabetes hyperglycemia. Further, a positive response to the question about diabetes medication use may also inadvertently ascertain diabetes when in fact the medication was being used to prevent, rather than to treat diabetes. However, though they would upwardly bias our prevalences, the effect of these problems is likely to be small, as shown by the minimal differences in prevalence seen comparing definitions 1 and 2 (Table 2).

Within these limitations, we were able to provide an accurate and full ascertainment of diabetes (previously diagnosed or not) and intermediate hyperglycemia for a diverse population of adults living in several Brazilian capital cities. Specifically, we highlighted a major aggregate burden of these conditions, particularly present in the elderly, in non-whites, in the obese and in those with less schooling. Since diabetes has been estimated to decrease the lifespan of middle-aged individuals by 6 years, these findings lend support to the current discourse of the need to address the challenges of diabetes in the 21 st century by allocating greater focus and resources to preventive actions known to be effective.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^156664bc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a growing global public health concern, affecting over 537 million individuals worldwide — over 90% of whom have type 2 diabetes. Even more people are affected by pre‐diabetes, an intermediate stage between normoglycaemia and diabetes, although the introduction of this term has caused some concerns about over‐diagnosis and over‐treatment. Detection of diabetes and pre‐diabetes aims to identify individuals at increased risk of macrovascular (e.g. cardiovascular disease) and microvascular complications (e.g. retinopathy) and inform subsequent interventions, including pharmacological treatment. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes have been revised several times over the past few decades. Two‐hour post‐load glucose (2hPG) was first used to diagnose diabetes, and then fasting blood glucose (FPG) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were added to the diagnostic criteria. Likewise, the criteria for diagnosing pre‐diabetes include impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and elevated HbA1c. According to the latest guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), a diagnosis of diabetes or pre‐diabetes can be made when any of these glycaemic indicators exceed their respective thresholds. Although diagnostic practice in other countries or populations may vary in terms of the more commonly used diagnostic measures (e.g. whether HbA1c testing is preferred), the cutoffs adopted (e.g. the lower thresholds of FPG and HbA1c for diagnosing pre‐diabetes) and diagnostic rigour (e.g. whether repeat testing is required if the first testing is positive), most countries' guidelines recommend that 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c can all be used for the diagnosis of diabetes and pre‐diabetes. The increase in the number of diagnostic measures would inevitably increase the number of new cases and prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes, because the test results of different diagnostic measures do not align with each other perfectly. For example, in the case of isolated FPG elevation, the FPG level exceeds the diagnostic threshold for diabetes, while 2hPG and HbA1c are 'normal'

### Prediabetes transitions to normoglycaemia or type 2 diabetes and associated risk factors in the obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease collaboration: an individual-level pooled analysis of 19 prospective cohort studies [^fb9bad3a]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

With the increasing global burden of type 2 diabetes, prevention strategies that target prediabetes, a state of hyperglycaemia that puts individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes, are required. We aimed to estimate global rates of transition from prediabetes to normoglycaemia or type 2 diabetes, stratified by age, sex, and race and ethnicity. We also aimed to quantify the effect of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors on these transitions.

Methods

In this pooled analysis of individual-level data, we included original data from 19 prospective cohort studies conducted in Asia (Iran and Japan), Australia, Europe (Spain and Sweden), North America (USA and Mexico), and South America (Venezuela). We applied discrete-time hidden Markov models to estimate rates and ratios of prediabetes transitions to type 2 diabetes and normoglycaemia specific to age, sex, and race and ethnicity. We used Fine-Gray competing risk models to derive cohort-specific subhazard ratios (SHRs) for potential risk factors influencing these transitions. We subsequently pooled these SHRs using a random-effects meta-analysis. In subgroup analyses stratified by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and recruitment period, we used multivariate Cox models to investigate the degree of heterogeneity between studies.

Findings

76 092 participants (39842 [52·3%] women and 36250 [47·6%] men; mean age 51·1 years [SD 12·7]) with available data on glycaemic status from at least one follow-up visit were included in the analysis, of whom 56837 (74·7%) had normoglycaemia and 19255 (25·3%) had prediabetes. Median follow-up was 9·8 years (IQR 5·8–12·5). Within 10 years, individuals with prediabetes had a 12·5% probability of progressing to type 2 diabetes, whereas the probability of reverting to normoglycaemia was 36·1%. However, in the highest fasting plasma glucose quartile, the probability of progression increased to 16·1% and reversion decreased to 13·4%. Male sex, older age (≥ 55 years), and Latinx populations were associated with an increased risk of transitioning to type 2 diabetes. Risk factors that significantly reduced prediabetes reversion to normoglycaemia were overweight (SHR 0·88 [95% CI 0·76–0·99]), obesity (0·66 [0·52–0·81]), elevated waist-to-height ratio (0·82 [0·70–0·95]), elevated waist-to-hip ratio (0·79 [0·68–0·91]), and reduced HDL concentration (0·72 [0·59–0·84]).

Interpretation

Our findings highlight that reversion to normoglycaemia was more common than progression to type 2 diabetes among individuals with prediabetes, and that these transitions were strongly influenced by modifiable risk factors. The increased risk of progression with advancing age and among men underscores the importance of early identification and targeted interventions in population groups at high risk of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the elevated progression risk in individuals with higher fasting plasma glucose concentrations at baseline reinforces the need for timely detection and intervention during this crucial clinical window.

3.3 Assessment of methodological quality

The results of the methodological quality assessment based on the 10‐item tool are summarised in Table S3. The most problematic were: item 1, population representativeness (high risk in 25/32 or 78.1% studies); item 3, random selection (20/32 or 62.5%); item 2, sampling frame adequacy (14/32 or 43.8%); and item 4, non‐response bias (12/32 or 37.5%). The number of low‐risk items ranged from 5 to 10 in individual studies, with a median of 7. Notably, 24 studies (75%) had ≥ 7 low‐risk items, including 10 (31%) with 7 low‐risk items,4 studies (13%) with 8 low‐risk items,6 studies (19%) with 9 low‐risk items, and 4 studies (13%) with 10 low‐risk items.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^68539d06]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

This study has some limitations. First, due to the small number of studies included in individual meta‐analyses (particularly those for pre‐diabetes) or significant heterogeneity among studies, funnel plots were either not feasible or could be misleading, which limited our ability to investigate the possibility of publication bias. Second, previous studies have shown that the phenotypes of pre‐diabetes differed with gender, age and other characteristics. However, due to the lack of detailed information on these characteristics in the included studies, we were unable to present the distribution of different combinations of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c levels in different subgroups defined by age, gender and body mass index. Third, as with other meta‐analyses of single‐group proportions, we observed significant heterogeneity among studies. This heterogeneity was unlikely caused by different diagnostic criteria because the studies using non‐ADA criteria were few (≤ 2 in all analytic scenarios) and small in sample size and were analysed separately. Subgroup analyses showed that the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes and the contribution of HbA1c elevation to them were both higher in the small studies, and the contribution of HbA1c elevation was also higher in Asian studies. Given that large studies typically produce more robust estimates than do small ones, the actual prevalence of diabetes could be lower than 15% (the overall estimate from meta‐analysis of all studies) and close to 11% (the overall estimate from meta‐analysis of large studies). The much higher contribution of HbA1c to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes in Asian populations (70.4% vs. 42.5% in non‐Asian for diabetes) suggests that the use of HbA1c for diagnosis in these populations should be particularly carefully considered, taking into account the large number of new cases and the magnitude of possible treatment efficacy in these cases.

### Dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 analogues for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications in people at increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^175ff136]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The projected rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could develop into a substantial health problem worldwide. Whether dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 analogues are able to prevent or delay T2DM and its associated complications in people at risk for the development of T2DM is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues on the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in people with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; PubMed; Embase; ClinicalTrials.gov; the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials. The date of the last search of all databases was January 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of 12 weeks or more comparing DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations of these.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles and records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data independently. One review author extracted data which were checked by a second review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or the involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses, we planned to use a random-effects model with investigation of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument.

Main Results

We included seven completed RCTs; about 98 participants were randomised to a DPP-4 inhibitor as monotherapy and 1620 participants were randomised to a GLP-1 analogue as monotherapy. Two trials investigated a DPP-4 inhibitor and five trials investigated a GLP-1 analogue. A total of 924 participants with data on allocation to control groups were randomised to a comparator group; 889 participants were randomised to placebo and 33 participants to metformin monotherapy. One RCT of liraglutide contributed 85% of all participants. The duration of the intervention varied from 12 weeks to 160 weeks. We judged none of the included trials at low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains and did not perform meta-analyses because there were not enough trials. One trial comparing the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin with placebo reported no deaths (very low-quality evidence). The incidence of T2DM by means of WHO diagnostic criteria in this trial was 3/90 participants randomised to vildagliptin versus 1/89 participants randomised to placebo (very low-quality evidence). Also, 1/90 participants on vildagliptin versus 2/89 participants on placebo experienced a serious adverse event (very low-quality evidence). One out of 90 participants experienced congestive heart failure in the vildagliptin group versus none in the placebo group (very low-quality evidence). There were no data on non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects reported. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality following treatment with GLP-1 analogues were rarely reported; one trial of exenatide reported that no participant died. Another trial of liraglutide 3.0 mg showed that 2/1501 in the liraglutide group versus 2/747 in the placebo group died after 160 weeks of treatment (very low-quality evidence). The incidence of T2DM following treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg compared to placebo after 160 weeks was 26/1472 (1.8%) participants randomised to liraglutide versus 46/738 (6.2%) participants randomised to placebo (very low-quality evidence). The trial established the risk for (diagnosis of) T2DM as HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% (6.5% or greater), fasting plasma glucose 5.6 mmol/L or greater to 6.9 mmol/L or less (7.0 mmol/L or greater) or two-hour post-load plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/L or greater to 11.0 mmol/L (11.1 mmol/L). Altogether, 70/1472 (66%) participants regressed from intermediate hyperglycaemia to normoglycaemia compared with 268/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group. The incidence of T2DM after the 12-week off-treatment extension period (i.e. after 172 weeks) showed that five additional participants were diagnosed T2DM in the liraglutide group, compared with one participant in the placebo group. After 12-week treatment cessation, 740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group had normoglycaemia. One trial used exenatide and 2/17 participants randomised to exenatide versus 1/16 participants randomised to placebo developed T2DM (very low-quality evidence). This trial did not provide a definition of T2DM. One trial reported serious adverse events in 230/1524 (15.1%) participants in the liraglutide 3.0 mg arm versus 96/755 (12.7%) participants in the placebo arm (very low quality evidence). There were no serious adverse events in the trial using exenatide. Non-fatal myocardial infarction was reported in 1/1524 participants in the liraglutide arm and in 0/55 participants in the placebo arm at 172 weeks (very low-quality evidence). One trial reported congestive heart failure in 1/1524 participants in the liraglutide arm and in 1/755 participants in the placebo arm (very low-quality evidence). Participants receiving liraglutide compared with placebo had a small mean improvement in the physical component of the 36-item Short Form scale showing a difference of 0.87 points (95% CI 0.17 to 1.58; P = 0.02; 1 trial; 1791 participants; very low-quality evidence). No trial evaluating GLP-1-analogues reported data on stroke, microvascular complications or socioeconomic effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no firm evidence that DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 analogues compared mainly with placebo substantially influence the risk of T2DM and especially its associated complications in people at increased risk for the development of T2DM. Most trials did not investigate patient-important outcomes.

### Insulin secretagogues for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications in persons at increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^b2f09fc2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The projected rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could develop into a substantial health problem worldwide. Whether insulin secretagogues (sulphonylureas and meglitinide analogues) are able to prevent or delay T2DM and its associated complications in people at risk for the development of T2DM is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of insulin secretagogues on the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in people with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials. The date of the last search of all databases was April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of 12 weeks or more comparing insulin secretagogues with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations of these.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles/records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data independently. One review author extracted data which were checked by a second review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or the involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with investigation of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We carried out trial sequential analyses (TSAs) for all outcomes that could be meta-analysed. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.

Main Results

We included six RCTs with 10,018 participants; 4791 participants with data on allocation to intervention groups were randomised to a second- or third-generation sulphonylurea or a meglitinide analogue as monotherapy and 29 participants were randomised to a second-generation sulphonylurea plus metformin. Three trials investigated a second-generation sulphonylurea, two trials investigated a third-generation sulphonylurea and one trial a meglitinide analogue. A total of 4873 participants with data on allocation to control groups were randomised to a comparator group; 4820 participants were randomised to placebo, 23 to diet and exercise, and 30 participants to metformin monotherapy. One RCT of nateglinide contributed 95% of all participants. The duration of the intervention varied from six months to five years. We judged none of the included trials as at low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality following sulphonylurea (glimepiride) treatment were rarely observed (very low-quality evidence). The RR for incidence of T2DM comparing glimepiride monotherapy with placebo was 0.75; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.04; P = 0.08; 2 trials; 307 participants; very low-quality evidence. One of the trials reporting on the incidence of T2DM did not define the diagnostic criteria used. The other trial diagnosed T2DM as two consecutive fasting blood glucose values ≥ 6.1 mmol/L. TSA showed that only 4.5% of the diversity-adjusted required information size was accrued so far. No trial reported data on serious adverse events, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, congestive heart failure (HF), health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects. One trial with a follow-up of five years compared a meglitinide analogue (nateglinide) with placebo. A total of 310/4645 (6.7%) participants allocated to nateglinide died compared with 312/4661 (6.7%) participants allocated to placebo (hazard ratio (HR) 1.00; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17; P = 0.98; moderate-quality evidence). The two main criteria for diagnosing T2DM were a fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 7.0 mmol/L or a 2-hour post challenge glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L. T2DM developed in 1674/4645 (36.0%) participants in the nateglinide group and in 1580/4661 (33.9%) in the placebo group (HR 1.07; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.15; P = 0.05; moderate-quality evidence). One or more serious adverse event was reported in 2066/4602 (44.9%) participants allocated to nateglinide compared with 2089/4599 (45.6%) participants allocated to placebo. A total of 126/4645 (2.7%) participants allocated to nateglinide died because of cardiovascular disease compared with 118/4661 (2.5%) participants allocated to placebo (HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.38; P = 0.60; moderate-quality evidence). Comparing participants receiving nateglinide with those receiving placebo for the outcomes MI, non-fatal stroke and HF gave the following event rates: MI 116/4645 (2.5%) versus 122/4661 (2.6%), stroke 100/4645 (2.2%) versus 110/4661 (2.4%) and numbers hospitalised for HF 85/4645 (1.8%) versus 100/4661 (2.1%) - (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.14; P = 0.27). The quality of the evidence was moderate for all these outcomes. Health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether insulin secretagogues compared mainly with placebo reduce the risk of developing T2DM and its associated complications in people at increased risk for the development of T2DM. Most trials did not investigate patient-important outcomes.

### World congress on insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease: part 4 [^cb5c9f01]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Alberti questioned whether A1C is truly useful, noting that although it is stable, time averaged, reproducible, and that fasting is not required, "A1C is not all it is cracked out to be", as it is affected by a variety of conditions, such as age, ethnicity, hematologic abnormalities, dyslipidemia, and renal disease. Alberti noted as an example the 0.4% lower A1C of Caucasians than of African Americans with IGT/IFG in the Diabetes Prevention Program. A1C requires standardization, is somewhat expensive, is not available worldwide, few data are available, and the cut point is uncertain. In contrast, Alberti observed, diabetes is a disease of glucose, which is time honored and for which there are extensive data, with international comparisons available and a fairly accurate assay. He acknowledged that accuracy is not equal in all laboratories, with poor quality assurance and that there are preanalytical problems, such as the 15% reduction in blood glucose during the initial 2 h after sampling with improper handling. Furthermore, an oral glucose tolerance test is ideally required, and this is more complex than a single sample.

The ADA group recommended use of A1C, whereas the WHO committee suggested that glucose testing is preferred, although Alberti observed that A1C use with appropriate standardization was included in the WHO recommendations. He acknowledged the imperfections of glucose measurement, particularly with use of fasting glucose alone, and concluded that although he was "uncertain", A1C could be useful with appropriate precautions in its interpretations, particularly because A1C is being used all around the world for this purpose. "Prediabetes", he stated, "is a horrible term which should never have been invented", but he suggested that the notion is relevant in ascertaining future macroangiopathy risk. He observed that there is rather poor correlation of A1C, IGT, and IFG and expressed concern that the use of A1C rather than glucose criteria would reclassify huge numbers of individuals and decrease the reported prevalence both of diabetes and of prediabetes.

### Fasting-mimicking diet causes hepatic and blood markers changes indicating reduced biological age and disease risk [^3884f0e6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In general, our cohort was made up of individuals who were healthier than the average person in the U.S. population, given that on average they were predicted to be 3.5 years younger biologically compared to their chronological ages at baseline. This likely represents an enrollment bias as education years and SES are higher in our sample compared to the average American population. This is a common phenomenon in clinical trials as volunteers are often motivated and more likely to be health conscious. Regardless, even in this relatively healthy group, positive changes in the biomarkers used to estimate biological age led to a decrease in median biological age of 2.5 years following the completion of 3 FMD cycles. Even though at baseline the generally healthy volunteers in the FMD trial already had lower than average risks for heart-disease, diabetes and cerebrovascular disease, our simulations after 3 FMD cycles indicates biological age reductions associated with further decreases in the 20-year risk for all-cause and cause-specific mortality. It should be noted that these are estimated risk reductions and decreases in mortality were not directly observed in this study. It assumes that associations between biological age and mortality also reflect the effect of change in biological age — which has yet to be proven. However, these results provide preliminary evidence of the potential benefits of FMD even among healthy individuals.

Unhealthy dietary habits and the associated obesity pandemic have been linked to many diseases, including diabetes, CVD, certain cancers, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and an accelerated rate of aging itself. In our first study on the FMD effects in a randomized cross-over trial, we reported that the efficacy of the FMD on clinically relevant risk factors was higher in at-risk participants than in those study participants with risk factor values within the normal range. Here, we observed similar effects on biological age estimates: the volunteers who most benefitted from the FMD intervention where those who were most unhealthy at baseline. Estimates based off the effects of the FMD trial suggest that early deaths may be delayed whereas maximal life expectancy is probably not extended. For instance, estimated life expectancies in the highest ranges did not show much differences between pre- and post-intervention.

### Impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance in urban population in India [^ae8fc649]. Diabetic Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

To study prevalence of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in urban Indians and their demographic and anthropometric characteristics.

Methods

Data on capillary blood glucose (OGTT), anthropometric and demography details were available in 10 025 subjects (M: F 4711: 5314) aged ≥ 20 years. Glucose tolerance was categorized as normal, isolated IFG, isolated IGT, IFG + IGT and diabetes using the fasting and 2-h blood glucose (2hBG; 75-g glucose load) values. Subjects with known diabetes were excluded.

Results

Age-standardized prevalences of IFG, IGT and newly detected diabetes were 8.7%, 8.1% and 13.9%, respectively. IFG was more prevalent in women (9.8%) than in men (7.4%) (chi2 = 13.62, P = 0.0002), while the gender differences in IGT (men 8.4%, women 7.9%) and diabetes (men 13.3%, women 14.3%) were not significant. Body mass index and waist circumference were higher in glucose-intolerant groups than in normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Prevalence of diabetes, IGT and IFG + IGT increased with age. Among the IFG, 4% had diabetes and 27.1% had IGT using 2hBG criteria. In IFG, the fasting and 2hBG values were not correlated.

Conclusions

Prevalences of IFG and IGT were similar in urban Indians and an overlap occurred in only less than half of these subjects. IFG was more common in women. Subjects with IFG were older and had more adverse anthropometric characteristics in comparison with NGT. IFG did not show an increasing trend with age.

### Changes in insulin sensitivity and insulin release in relation to glycemia and glucose tolerance in 6, 414 Finnish men [^d64cf52a]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is preceded by a long pre-diabetic state, characterized by mild elevation of fasting and/or postprandial glucose levels. This asymptomatic phase may last for years, and about one-third of these individuals finally develop type 2 diabetes. The pre-diabetic state, defined by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), includes impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or their combination. Epidemiological studies have shown that IFG and IGT represent two distinct subgroups of abnormal glucose tolerance (,–) that differ in their age and sex distribution and associated cardiovascular risk. Therefore, IFG and IGT are likely to have different pathophysiologies.

Impaired insulin secretion and impaired insulin action are the two main pathophysiological disturbances leading to abnormal glucose tolerance. Previous studies on the role of impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance in the development of IFG and IGT have yielded contradictory results. Inconsistencies across the studies are explained by differences in study populations, study designs and methods to assess insulin resistance and insulin secretion, and most importantly by a small sample size. Categorization of glucose tolerance is based on arbitrary cutoff points of glucose levels, and therefore different subgroups cannot fully account for changes in β-cell function and insulin action with increasing glycemia. Only a few studies have examined insulin secretion and/or insulin sensitivity as a function of glucose concentrations (,–). These studies have been, however, relatively small, and most of them were conducted in non-Caucasian populations.

The aim of this study was to evaluate insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion across the entire range of fasting and 2-h plasma glucose (PG) from normal glucose tolerance (NGT) to type 2 diabetes to understand better the pathophysiology of the pre-diabetic state. Furthermore, we investigated the differences in insulin sensitivity and insulin release in different glucose tolerance subgroups. To address these questions, we collected a large sample of carefully phenotyped middle-aged Finnish men.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^db3a1420]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Screening for diabetes and prediabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older without known diabetes, we recommend fasting plasma glucose and/or HbA1c screening to diagnose diabetes or prediabetes (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕). Technical remark: The measurement of HbA1c may be inaccurate in some people in this age group because of comorbidities that can affect the lifespan of red blood cells in the circulation. Although the optimal screening frequency for patients whose initial screening test is normal remains unclear, the writing committee advocates repeat screening every 2 years thereafter, and such screening may not be appropriate for an older patient with end-stage cancer or organ system failure.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^124b5b8d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI diabetes and chronic kidney disease — rating the quality of evidence and guideline designation: The Work Group considered the "quality of evidence across all outcomes of interest, taking into account the relative importance of each of the outcomes (eg, death and CKD progression having greater weight than albuminuria or glucose levels) and a balance between net benefits and additional considerations, such as costs (resource utilization), feasibility, availability, likely differences in patient values, likely differences among populations and regions". Strength categories are defined as follows: "Strong. a Evidence includes results from well-designed, well-conducted study/studies in the target population that directly assess effects on health outcomes"; "Moderately strong. b Evidence is sufficient to determine effects on health outcomes in the target population, but the strength of the evidence is limited by the number, quality, or consistency of the individual studies; OR evidence is from a population other than the target population, but from well-designed, well-conducted studies"; "OR evidence is from studies with some problems in design and/or analysis; OR evidence is from well-designed, well-conducted studies on surrogate endpoints for efficacy and/or safety in the target population"; and "Weak. c Evidence is insufficient to assess the effects on health outcomes because it is from studies with some problems in design and analysis on surrogate endpoints for efficacy and/or safety in the target population; OR the evidence is only for surrogate measures in a population other than the target population; OR the evidence is from studies that are poorly designed and/or analyzed". "Sets of statements that were graded as Strong or Moderately Strong were designated as Guidelines".

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^d32c5af0]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The management of pre‐diabetes is more controversial than that of diabetes, both because the huge number of people labelled as having this condition (two‐thirds of which being FPG and HbA1c elevations, as shown by this study) and because of the uncertainty around the causal relation between FPG and HbA1c and diabetic complications. Like the case of diabetes, a large body of evidence shows that the three glycaemic measures, when used individually, were each associated with increased cardiovascular disease and mortality, but few studies examined their 'independent effects' on the outcomes after controlling for the confounding caused by the other two glycaemic measures. One of the few studies that did so was Lind et al. which found that the 2hPG level in people with IGT was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease after adjusting for FPG, 1‐h post‐load glucose, HbA1c and other major risk factors, whereas FPG and HbA1c were not associated with the outcome when analysed in the same model. However, a limitation of that study was its relatively small sample size (n = 504) and number of outcome events (n = 34). Other studies conducted in people with pre‐diabetes were mostly focused on one or two glycaemic measures only and thus were not able to clarify whether the observed association with outcomes (if any) resulted from confounding caused by other glycaemic measures. Because of this, whether it is justifiable to intervene with or 'manage' pre‐diabetes defined by FPG and HbA1c is open to question. Indeed, several randomised controlled trials have shown that lifestyle interventions and even some pharmacological treatment in people with pre‐diabetes did not lead to reductions in cardiovascular disease or mortality, although the progression to diabetes was slowed down to some extent. Thus, further prospective studies evaluating the independent effects of FPG and HbA1c levels on future diabetic complications among the pre‐diabetes population are warranted.

### Trends in cardiometabolic risk factors in the americas between 1980 and 2014: a pooled analysis of population-based surveys [^a7b1c3b3]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Describing the prevalence and trends of cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is crucial for monitoring progress, planning prevention, and providing evidence to support policy efforts. We aimed to analyse the transition in body-mass index (BMI), obesity, blood pressure, raised blood pressure, and diabetes in the Americas, between 1980 and 2014.

Methods

We did a pooled analysis of population-based studies with data on anthropometric measurements, biomarkers for diabetes, and blood pressure from adults aged 18 years or older. A Bayesian model was used to estimate trends in BMI, raised blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg), and diabetes (fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7·0 mmol/L, history of diabetes, or diabetes treatment) from 1980 to 2014, in 37 countries and six subregions of the Americas.

Findings

389 population-based surveys from the Americas were available. Comparing prevalence estimates from 2014 with those of 1980, in the non-English speaking Caribbean subregion, the prevalence of obesity increased from 3·9% (95% CI 2·2–6·3) in 1980, to 18·6% (14·3–23·3) in 2014, in men; and from 12·2% (8·2–17·0) in 1980, to 30·5% (25·7–35·5) in 2014, in women. The English-speaking Caribbean subregion had the largest increase in the prevalence of diabetes, from 5·2% (2·1–10·4) in men and 6·4% (2·6–10·4) in women in 1980, to 11·1% (6·4–17·3) in men and 13·6% (8·2–21·0) in women in 2014). Conversely, the prevalence of raised blood pressure has decreased in all subregions; the largest decrease was found in North America from 27·6% (22·3–33·2) in men and 19·9% (15·8–24·4) in women in 1980, to 15·5% (11·1–20·9) in men and 10·7% (7·7–14·5) in women in 2014.

Interpretation

Despite the generally high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors across the Americas, estimates also showed a high level of heterogeneity in the transition between countries. The increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes observed over time requires appropriate measures to deal with these public health challenges. Our results support a diversification of health interventions across subregions and countries.

### Effect of aging on A1c levels in individuals without diabetes: evidence from the framingham offspring study and the national health and nutrition examination survey 2001–2004 [^04950cdd]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Glycemia is recognized to change with age. The prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose homeostasis (impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) is increased among older individuals. Given the large size of the elderly type 2 diabetic population (approximately 15.3% diagnosed and 6.9% undiagnosed), it is important to consider the effects of aging on glycemic measures, particularly as targets are set for diabetes management.

A1C levels are used globally as an index of average glycemia over the preceding 8–12 weeks, as a marker for risk of development of diabetes complications, and to guide therapy. Some reports have demonstrated an association of A1C with age, whereas others have not. Higher A1C levels with advanced age may be a function of a higher prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in older individuals. The nondiabetic range for A1C, used worldwide and for all age-groups, was established by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) > 20 years ago. A group of 124 nondiabetic healthy volunteers aged 13–39 years was drawn from local DCCT clinics to generate the A1C distribution. The volunteers did not have an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to exclude undiagnosed diabetes and were not representative of individuals aged ≥ 40 years.

Current A1C targets for diabetes treatment set by the American Diabetes Association (A1C < 7%) or the American College of Endocrinology (A1C ≤ 6.5%) are not age specific. The central role played by A1C in the management of diabetes and possibly in its diagnosis raises the question of whether there are age-related differences in A1C. If so, current A1C targets may be too stringent for older type 2 diabetic patients, who have an increased risk of hypoglycemia and medication side effects.

Our aim was to examine the relationship between A1C and age using current diagnosis criteria for diabetes in nondiabetic subjects and in subjects with no abnormality in glucose homeostasis using two large, diverse population-based cohorts, the community-based Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) and the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001–2004 population. In subsidiary analyses, we assessed this relationship in FOS subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), after exclusion of those with IFG and/or IGT determined by an OGTT. Finally, in a subset of FOS participants with longitudinal A1C data, we determined the annual rate of change in A1C as an alternate approach to test the hypothesis that A1C increases with age.

### Burden of diabetes and hyperglycaemia in adults in the americas, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^3fc21d39]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Similar to the findings of the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, we found no association between the prevalence of obesity and diabetes. We do not believe that the lack of this ecological association means that obesity does not affect diabetes development in the region. First, the narrower range of national obesity prevalences found across nations contrasts with the broad range of BMIs seen across individuals in cohort studies. In fact, when we examined this association globally, which produced a wider range of obesity prevalence, the r² values were slightly larger. Confounders such as poverty, early life deprivation, and other diabetes risk factors could also be at play.

The age-adjusted fraction of the overall diabetes burden due to type 1 diabetes was small. Of note, however, type 1 diabetes death and DALY rates in the Americas increased at a rate greater than the global average. The high prevalence of type 2 diabetes risk factors such as smoking, dietary inadequacies, and physical inactivity might explain part of this excess, as these risk factors are also important prognostic factors for type 1 diabetes. Thus, population-based approaches to reduce these risk factors are also relevant to control the burden of type 1 diabetes.

Lesser socioeconomic development, as measured by the SDI, most present in central Latin America and the Caribbean, explained part of the difference in burden across countries, suggesting that gain can be achieved by further broad socioeconomic development. But the finding also raises concern, as the less socioeconomically developed countries expected to experience the largest increases in burden from diabetes and its complications will be those least prepared to deal with the consequences, given their limited ability to increase spending on health, and their health systems, which are ill prepared to manage diabetes and its complications. If these countries cannot reduce burden, the resultant direct and indirect costs of diabetes and other NCDs are estimated to be of sufficient size to significantly decrease their rate of economic growth.

Access to and quality of health care explained an important part of the differences in burden across countries in the Americas. Additionally, advances in health care seem to have blunted the translation of increased prevalence over time into increased premature mortality (YLLs) in most regions. Expansion of national health systems providing greater access to evidence-based diabetes care, especially at the primary-care level, could help to minimise the burden due to increasing prevalence. WHO has provided protocols for minimal, cost-effective interventionsthat can help with organising care in the most resource-constrained countries.

### Impaired fasting glucose prevalence in two nationwide cohorts of obese children and adolescents [^d41e3057]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Obesity in childhood and adolescence has become a massive health problem in many countries, including both developed and less-developed countries. High body mass index (BMI) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular heart disease events in adulthood. Severe obesity in young adulthood results in 13-years loss of expected life. An early metabolic consequence of obesity is disturbed glucose and insulin homeostasis. One of these consequences is impaired fasting glucose (IFG), which was introduced in the late 1990s by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and World Health Organization (WHO) as a pre-diabetic stage referring to the fasting levels of plasma glucose concentration above the upper normal range, but below those that are diagnostic for diabetes. The glucose range for IFG differs between organizations: the ADA glucose range is 5.6–6.9 mmol l −1, whereas WHO has stricter criteria, 6.1–6.9 mmol l −1. Both criteria are used and there is no consensus on IFG, especially not in children and adolescents.

In adult individuals, IFG is a predictor of type 2 diabetes. Further, in adults IFG is associated with fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease, increased risk for cancersand all-cause mortality. IFG in obese children is associated with increased intima-media thickness, a predictive factor for atherosclerosis. The mechanism behind IFG is still not fully understood, but IFG seems to be a result of impaired insulin secretion, indicating beta-cell dysfunction and also increased hepatic glucose output.

A large variation of IFG prevalence has been reported in obese adolescents. European studies are reporting prevalences from 0% in Italy(WHO criteria) to 16% in the Netherlands (ADA criteria), and American studies range between 2 and 9% (WHO criteria) and 15–47% (ADA criteria). However, most reports have been based on samples too small to be representative for entire populations, and it is, therefore, unclear whether the marked variations in prevalence represent a true variation among obese children in different geographic areas. In addition, IFG in younger children is rarely studied. Consequently, this study was implemented to estimate the prevalence of the pre-diabetic state IFG and factors influencing the risk for IFG among both children and adolescents suffering from obesity in Germany and Sweden, using nationwide register data in the two countries.

### Limited overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia as defined by A1c 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [^073d8f26]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We compared the prevalences and overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia (IH), defined by a hemoglobin A(1c) (A1C) 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

Research Design and Methods

Oral glucose tolerance test results and A1C measurements were evaluated as markers of IH in an unselected cohort of 486 nondiabetic adults from Finland.

Results

The overall prevalence of IH was 34%. Prevalences of isolated A1C 5.7–6.4%, IGT, and IFG were 8.0, 13.2, and 4.5%, respectively. Overlap between these three markers was uncommon. Isolated A1C 5.7–6.4% was associated with a higher BMI compared with isolated IFG and IGT and with a more adverse lipid profile compared with isolated IFG.

Conclusions

Prevalence of isolated IH was high, with limited overlap between the definitions. Differences in cardiovascular disease risk factors were observed among the groups. This study demonstrates that an A1C of 5.7–6.4% detects, in part, different individuals with IH compared with IFG and IGT.

### Effect of a lifestyle intervention on weight change in south Asian individuals in the UK at high risk of type 2 diabetes: a family-cluster randomised controlled trial [^afb8a4c3]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

The susceptibility to type 2 diabetes of people of south Asian descent is established, but there is little trial-based evidence for interventions to tackle this problem. We assessed a weight control and physical activity intervention in south Asian individuals in the UK.

Methods

We did this non-blinded trial in two National Health Service (NHS) regions in Scotland (UK). Between July 1, 2007, and Oct 31, 2009, we recruited men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin, aged 35 years or older, with waist circumference 90 cm or greater in men or 80 cm or greater in women, and with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose determined by oral glucose tolerance test. Families were randomised (using a random number generator program, with permuted blocks of random size, stratified by location [Edinburgh or Glasgow], ethnic group [Indian or Pakistani], and number of participants in the family [one vs more than one]) to intervention or control. Participants in the same family were not randomised separately. The intervention group received 15 visits from a dietitian over 3 years and the control group received four visits in the same period. The primary outcome was weight change at 3 years. Analysis was by modified intention to treat, excluding participants who died or were lost to follow-up. We used linear regression models to provide mean differences in baseline-adjusted weight at 3 years. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN25729565.

Findings

Of 1319 people who were screened with an oral glucose tolerance test, 196 (15%) had impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose and 171 entered the trial. Participants were in 156 family clusters that were randomised (78 families with 85 participants were allocated to intervention; 78 families with 86 participants were allocated to control). 167 (98%) participants in 152 families completed the trial. Mean weight loss in the intervention group was 1.13 kg (SD 4.12), compared with a mean weight gain of 0.51 kg (3.65) in the control group, an adjusted mean difference of -1.64 kg (95% CI -2.83 to -0.44).

Interpretation

Modest, medium-term changes in weight are achievable as a component of lifestyle-change strategies, which might control or prevent adiposity-related diseases.

### Limited overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia as defined by A1c 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [^7ddbeb13]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Between 1996 and 1998, 593 subjects (245 men, 348 women) born in 1935 were enrolled a longer follow-up study evaluating IH among inhabitants of Oulu, Finland. The study excluded 87 participants with previously known or screen-detected diabetes according to OGTT or A1C ≥ 6.5%, leaving 486 with complete data for analysis in the present report. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oulu, Finland. Clinical data collection and anthropometric and glucose measurements are described in detail elsewhere.

Standardized 75-g OGTT was performed according contemporary World Health Organization guidelines with fasting whole-blood glucose and 2-h glucose from a capillary sample. A1C was analyzed with the Bayer DCA 2000 Analyzer (Bayer Healthcare, Tarrytown, NY), calibrated to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial standard.

IH was classified as IFG (fasting blood glucose 5.6–6.0 mmol/L), IGT (2-h glucose ≥ 7.8 and < 11.1 mmol/L), and elevated A1C (5.7–6.4%). Isolated forms of IH are referred to as i-IGT, i-IFG, and i-A1C 5.7–6.4%.

Differences in continuous variables were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis, as appropriate, and P values were adjusted for sex. Values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for statistical analysis.

### Thirty-year glycemic trajectories from young adulthood through middle age… [^f18f75f0]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The results of this study call into question the utility of generalizing an impaired fasting glucose–based screening strategy informed by research in middle-aged populations to young adults and suggest a need for young adult–specific approaches to diabetes prevention. Importance Type 2 diabetes prevalence is increasing, and currently 24% of young adults have prediabetes. Little is known regarding timing and progression from normoglycemia to diabetes starting in young adulthood. A total of 3420 participants had trajectories classifiable into 9 common patterns of glycemic trajectory: stable normoglycemia; 5 patterns of impaired fasting glucose not progressing to diabetes, including a brief period of low IFG regressing to normoglycemia at younger and older ages, younger-onset sustained IFG, older-onset sustained low IFG, and older-onset sustained high IFG;. Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study revealed substantial heterogeneity in glycemic trajectories across 30 years of follow-up. Clusters that represented IFG during young adulthood did not demonstrate progression to diabetes, and clusters that represented diabetes lacked prior IFG during young adulthood. These data suggest the need for strategies beyond simply screening for IFG during young adulthood to identify and target diabetes prevention for young adults. Glycemic trajectory analysis is useful to understand individuals' paths to diabetes. Prior studies using middle-aged cohorts24, 25 or universal adult cohorts without age stratification26-28 reveal heterogeneous patterns of progression of impaired fasting glucose across short follow-up periods.

29 Glycemic trajectory analysis has not been applied to young adults or across long periods. To better understand diabetes risk progression beginning in young adulthood, we characterized glycemic trajectories using sequence analysis in a large, diverse, population-based cohort of young adults with normoglycemia and prediabetes at baseline, using repeated measures of fasting plasma glucose collected across 30 years.
30. We excluded people with diabetes at baseline, those missing 6 or more FPG values, and those missing FPG values for both examination years 0 and
7. We used FPG as the indicator of glycemic status because this measure was collected for more examination years than other glycemic indicators. We subdivided low and high IFG because the World Health Organization uses the more restrictive criteria of high IFG only, 34 with evidence suggesting the high IFG group experiences greater cardiovascular disease risk than the low IFG group.

14 We performed sensitivity analysis using additional glycemic indicators when available. Participants with less than 480 minutes fasting at the time of plasma glucose measurement were categorized as normoglycemia, missing, or diabetes. 33 Participants were categorized as pregnant for examinations during pregnancy and deceased for all scheduled examinations after their death dates. For the classifiable sample of 3420 individuals, the 9 patterns of glycemic trajectory included the following: stable normoglycemia; 5 patterns of IFG not progressing to diabetes, including a brief period of low IFG regressing to. normoglycemia at younger and older ages, younger-onset sustained IFG (mean age at IFG., 38. 6 [5.

### Trends in cardiometabolic risk factors in the americas between 1980 and 2014: a pooled analysis of population-based surveys [^da75f302]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Background

Describing the prevalence and trends of cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is crucial for monitoring progress, planning prevention, and providing evidence to support policy efforts. We aimed to analyse the transition in body-mass index (BMI), obesity, blood pressure, raised blood pressure, and diabetes in the Americas, between 1980 and 2014.

Methods

We did a pooled analysis of population-based studies with data on anthropometric measurements, biomarkers for diabetes, and blood pressure from adults aged 18 years or older. A Bayesian model was used to estimate trends in BMI, raised blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg), and diabetes (fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7·0 mmol/L, history of diabetes, or diabetes treatment) from 1980 to 2014, in 37 countries and six subregions of the Americas.

Findings

389 population-based surveys from the Americas were available. Comparing prevalence estimates from 2014 with those of 1980, in the non-English speaking Caribbean subregion, the prevalence of obesity increased from 3·9% (95% CI 2·2–6·3) in 1980, to 18·6% (14·3–23·3) in 2014, in men; and from 12·2% (8·2–17·0) in 1980, to 30·5% (25·7–35·5) in 2014, in women. The English-speaking Caribbean subregion had the largest increase in the prevalence of diabetes, from 5·2% (2·1–10·4) in men and 6·4% (2·6–10·4) in women in 1980, to 11·1% (6·4–17·3) in men and 13·6% (8·2–21·0) in women in 2014). Conversely, the prevalence of raised blood pressure has decreased in all subregions; the largest decrease was found in North America from 27·6% (22·3–33·2) in men and 19·9% (15·8–24·4) in women in 1980, to 15·5% (11·1–20·9) in men and 10·7% (7·7–14·5) in women in 2014.

Interpretation

Despite the generally high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors across the Americas, estimates also showed a high level of heterogeneity in the transition between countries. The increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes observed over time requires appropriate measures to deal with these public health challenges. Our results support a diversification of health interventions across subregions and countries.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^1cfc31b2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Screening recommendations for metabolic risk — This guideline focuses on adults aged 40 to 75 years. In individuals aged 40 to 75 years in the office setting, we suggest providers screen for all five components of metabolic risk at the clinical visit, and the finding of at least three components should specifically alert the clinician to a patient at metabolic risk (⊕⊕OO). Elevated glycemia should be determined either by HbA1c, fasting glucose, or 2-hour glucose with a second test for confirmation using a new blood sample. Testing for additional biological markers associated with metabolic risk should be limited to subpopulations; although these measures are not recommended for routine measurement, one or more of them may be measured according to physician discretion to confirm or clarify estimates of metabolic risk. This recommendation is specifically for adults aged 40 to 75 years and does not restrict screening for appropriate individuals outside of this age range, especially those who are younger. In individuals aged 40 to 75 years who do not yet have ASCVD or T2DM and already have at least one risk factor, we advise screening every 3 years for all five components of metabolic risk as part of the routine clinical examination (Ungraded Good Practice Statement).

### 6-year trajectory of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and mortality risk among individuals with normal FPG at baseline: a prospective cohort study [^5ccdb129]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large prospective cohort study, we successfully identified three distinct FPG trajectory groups over a 6-year period and found that both low-increasing and high-increasing groups were consistently associated with a higher risk of mortality compared to the stable group. We further identified lifestyle factors that were associated with being in low- and high-increasing groups, providing supportive evidence for targeted intervention. To our knowledge, this is among the first studies that reported the associations between trajectories of long-term FPG and mortality risk among Asian populations.

Previous studies have been generally based on single-point FPG measurements and reported associations between high FPG levels and higher risk of mortality. A meta-analysis, including 97 prospective studies, found significant associations between FPG levels greater than 100 mg per deciliter and the risk of death. However, FPG levels are influenced by multiple factors and change over time, making single measurements susceptible to measurement error and inadequate in reflecting glucose homeostasis. Recognizing that the adverse effects of FPG on mortality are chronic, it becomes essential to capture the dynamic change in FPG over the years. Thus, models incorporating FPG trajectory data may have higher predictive power for mortality than those based on a single measurement. In this study, we estimated the long-term trajectories in FPG based on at least 4 measurements within 6 years. Few cohort studies have performed such analysis due to several reasons, including limited sample sizes or the burden of collecting multiple examinations. To date, we found only 2 studies that have assessed long-term FPG trajectories and mortality. One study, including 6400 participants aged ≥ 30 years with T2D, showed that the trajectory of fluctuation (elevated and decreasing) was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with the normal trajectory (HR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.38–2.38). Another study in patients with T2D reported that an increasing trajectory of FPG is associated with a 2.1- and 3.3-fold increase in all-cause mortality and CVD mortality, respectively. Our study revealed that participants in the high-increasing group had a 1.5- and 2.1-fold higher all-cause mortality and CVD mortality, respectively. The slight discrepancy may be due to the characteristics of our study population: participants with T2D at baseline were excluded from our study, while the prior studies enrolled T2D patients.

### Trends in cardiometabolic risk factors in the americas between 1980 and 2014: a pooled analysis of population-based surveys [^18b76ac1]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Estimates were obtained using population-based data sources representative of national, subnational (ie, covering ≥ 1 subnational region, or > 3 communities) or community (≤ 3 communities) levels, with measured height or weight, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or at least one of the following diabetes biomarkers: fasting plasma glucose (FPG), oral glucose tolerance (OGTT), or HbA 1c. Conversion of diabetes biomarkers to a common definition is described elsewhere.

Statistical analysis

Analyses were done separately for men and women, using a Bayesian model to obtain estimates by age group, country, and year. The model used here has been described and validated previously (appendix p 2). The model had a hierarchical structure, in which estimates for each country and year were informed by their own data, data from other years in the same country, and data in other countries in the same region. The hierarchical structure shared information to a greater degree when data were non-existent or weakly informative (eg, a study with a small sample size is less informative than a study in the same country and year with a larger sample), and to a lesser extent for data-rich countries and subregions.

The model incorporated non-linear time trends and age patterns, allowing the age pattern to vary across countries. The model accounted for the possibility that the risk factors in subnational and community samples might systematically differ from nationally representative ones and have a larger variation than in national studies. These features were implemented by including data-driven fixed-effect and random-effect terms for subnational and community data. The fixed effects adjusted for systematic differences between subnational or community studies and national studies. The random effects allowed national data to have a larger influence on the estimates than those of subnational or community data with similar sample sizes. The model also accounted for rural–urban differences in risk factors, using data-driven fixed effects for rural-only and urban-only studies. These rural and urban effects were weighted by the difference between study-level and country-level urbanisation in the year when the study was done. The statistical model included country-level covariates that were specific to each of the risk factors: the proportion of the national population living in urban areas for BMI; average number of years of education, proportion of national population living in urban areas, a summary measure of the availability of different food types for human consumption for diabetes and blood pressure; and age-standardised adult mean BMI for diabetes.

### Evaluating glucose-lowering treatment in older people with diabetes: lessons from the IMPERIUM trial [^a08057d4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

2 WHY IS IT DIFFICULT TO CONDUCT DIABETES TRIALS IN OLDER PATIENTS?

Despite significant progress in diabetes clinical research, information about outcomes of glucose‐lowering treatments in older patients remains limited. Understanding the reasons behind such scarcity of data may help develop solutions for this problem.

2.1 Conflicting perspectives on treatment goals

It is widely accepted that blood glucose should be lowered in older patients with diabetes while reducing or even avoiding the risk of hypoglycaemia. 1, 4, 17 The extent to which blood glucose should be lowered, the best ways to achieve glycaemic targets and the choice of glucose‐lowering therapies are frequently extrapolated from studies conducted in younger individuals.

A belief that older patients may benefit from normalizing blood glucose levels may lead to setting overly ambitious glycaemic goals for participants of clinical trials and ultimately to their "overtreatment" in real‐world clinical practice. 18, 19, 20 While there is an agreement that glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of ≤ 7% (≤ 53 mmol/mol) is a reasonable target for most adults, the assumption that lowering blood glucose reduces microvascular complications, as well as prevents cardiovascular events may not be true for patients with a short life expectancy. 21 The risk of adverse events with glucose‐lowering treatment may outweigh the benefits of preventing microvascular complications in frail older patients. A range of alternative glycaemic targets have been proposed for older patients with diabetes, e.g. < 7.5% (< 59 mmol/mol), < 8.0% (< 64 mmol/mol), < 8.5% (< 69 mmol/mol) or 8.0%‐9.0% (64‐75 mmol/mol), depending on the overall health status, duration of diabetes, life expectancy, treatment burden and vulnerability to hypoglycaemia. However, none of the goals set for an older population have been validated in dedicated clinical trials, let alone cardiovascular outcome clinical trials. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study 21, 22 excluded patients at the age of ≥ 65 years and the subgroup analysis of other trials (ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT) evaluating the role of glycaemic control in the prevention of cardiovascular outcomes did not result in conclusive findings. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 This lack of standardized treatment goals poses a challenge for those who design clinical trials. Investigators caring for older patients who have shorter life expectancy, comorbidities, polypharmacy, increased risk of complications and of adverse events, as well as geriatric syndromes such as memory impairment and frailty may be reluctant to follow stringent glycaemic goals set in a study.

### Elevated rates of diabetes in pacific islanders and Asian subgroups: the diabetes study of Northern California (DISTANCE) [^9f2a6cc2]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Subjects were adult (≥ 18 years of age) health plan members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large, integrated healthcare delivery system caring for > 3 million people who are broadly representative of the local and statewide population. We studied the prevalence and incidence of diabetes during the calendar year 2010 (1 January 2010–31 December 2010), while excluding subjects not continuously enrolled during the 12 months (1 January 2009–31 December 2009) prior to baseline to avoid misclassifying new enrollees with pre-existing diabetes as incident cases. These criteria resulted in an eligible adult population of 2,123,548. Those with unknown race/ethnicity (n = 419,185) were included in the denominator for our evaluation of overall prevalence and incidence but excluded from the race-specific analyses. Race/ethnicity was ascertained from self-reported demographic data collected at clinic visits, during health plan enrollment, from member surveys, or on intake for hospitalization. Self-reported race/ethnicity was available for 1,704,363 patients (80%), including white (n = 968,943), Latino (n = 253,821), African American (n = 135,934), Filipino (n = 82,781), Chinese (n = 68,831), Japanese (n = 16,032), Native American/American Indian/Alaska native (n = 9,546), Pacific Islander (Hawaiian, Guamanian, Samoan, or other Pacific Islander; n = 7,732), South Asian (Asian Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan, or Nepalese; n = 6,768), Southeast Asian (Cambodian, Laotian, Burmese, Thai, Malaysian, Indonesian; n = 1,876), Korean (n = 1,130), Vietnamese (n = 1,671), other and unspecified Asian (n = 101,769), and multiracial (n = 47,529). We also created aggregate categories of Asians (Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, South Asian, Southeast Asian, Korean, Vietnamese, and other/unspecified Asian; n = 280,858) and APIs (n = 288,590) to simulate the current categorization used for presenting demographic data at the national and state level.

### 6-year trajectory of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and mortality risk among individuals with normal FPG at baseline: a prospective cohort study [^e77ecad6]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite these limitations, our study boasts several strengths. First, we conducted the current study in a relatively large cohort and followed for an extended period, enabling data collection on a wide range of potential confounders to decrease potential confounding. Second, we identified the FPG trajectory groups based on data collected within a 6-year period, which was more representative of the long-term trend of FPG change. This approach utilized detailed information on the changes in FPG levels during the follow-up, which could not be achieved through the traditional method using FPG levels measured at 2 time points.

### Exenatide (BYDUREON BCise) [^415378d9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The data in this section are derived from pooled data from the controlled period of the 2 comparator-controlled trials (Trials 1 and 2) in adults as well as data from the extension phase of one of these trials [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. There were 410 patients exposed to BYDUREON BCISE 2 mg for 28 weeks during the controlled phases, and an additional 116 patients exposed to BYDUREON BCISE 2 mg during an uncontrolled extension for an additional 24 weeks. Overall, there were 526 patients exposed to BYDUREON BCISE 2 mg with a mean duration of exposure of 35 weeks in the controlled and extension phases of the two trials. Across the treatment arms in the controlled periods, the mean age of patients was 55 years, 2% were 75 years or older and 59% were male. The population in these studies was 78% White, 15% Black or African American, 5% Asian; 1% American Indian or Alaska Native; < 1% were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; and < 1% were other races. This population included 42% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 8.3 years and had a mean HbA1cof 8.5%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) in 93% of the pooled study populations.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^df70b640]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Prediabetes — individuals whose blood glucose levels do not meet the criteria for diabetes but are higher than normal are classified as having prediabetes, and they have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke; age, race, and co-morbid hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia are significant risk factors associated with progression. Persons with prediabetes have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), or abnormal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) levels, with IGT diagnosed only by the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and defined by a 2-hour plasma glucose in the 75-g OGTT of 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L), IFG defined as fasting glucose 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L), and an A1C test level between 5.7 percent and 6.4 percent considered prediabetes.

### Clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis, treatment, and management of children and adults with central auditory processing disorder [^0a1b25b3]. AAA (2010). Medium credibility.

Central auditory processing disorder (C)APD assessment — case history, ancillary information, and direct observation — emphasizes that case history information can be obtained through standard clinical interview procedures and may involve interviewing the patient, his/her parents or other family members, or another informant who is responsible for the patient, and a review of available medical, educational, and clinical records can help to further elucidate the nature of the problems or difficulties that the individual is experiencing. Case history review can also serve to document the presence or absence of any comorbid condition(s) and help inform professional decisions regarding (1) the need to modify diagnostic test procedures or protocols, (2) the need to refer for follow-up cognitive, speech and language, educational, and/or behavioral testing, and (3) the need to consider modifications to the intervention plan if a (C) APD is identified and the individual is also experiencing a comorbid condition or conditions. Ancillary information can also be gained through direct observation of the individual's behaviors during the interview itself or in some other context, and completion of behavioral inventories and/or checklists by people familiar with the individual also provides useful insights into functional deficits, diagnostic test selection, and intervention priorities. Self-assessment tools and/or behavioral checklists completed by individuals familiar with the individual can provide the audiologist with important insights into the individual's specific auditory deficits and the functional impact of these deficits, and there are a number of instruments that can be used for this purpose, including some developed specifically for use with individuals who may be at-risk for (C)APD and others that are more generic. Direct observation of the individual at-risk for (C)APD can provide additional information about the individual's auditory behaviors and difficulties, and the audiologist can gain invaluable insights during the interview process as well as throughout the diagnostic process by carefully observing the individual's behavior. Although more difficult to arrange, the direct observation of the individual in a naturalistic setting, such as in school or at work, is potentially more revealing than the observation of the individual in the clinical setting, and direct observation complements and supplements the case history interview. The answers to these types of questions can inform the audiologist's selection of tests for inclusion in the test battery, and will also provide a solid foundation for intervention planning should the individual ultimately be diagnosed with a (C)APD. Levels of evidence: 4, 5.

### Prevalence and clinical profile of metabolic syndrome in longevity: study from guangxi zhuang autonomous region, China [^14d9fe60]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals who live the longest are of broad interest to researchers in recent years. In 2010, there were 1,948,286 nonagenarians (people aged 90–99) and 35,934 centenarians (people aged 100 and more) in China. As the population of China aging, the number of people aged 90 or more is expected to grow. Since persons who live into their 90s and over 100 are a testament to longevity, studies about their unique characteristics will expand our knowledge on how to extend life expectancy. Bama County is an autonomous county under the jurisdiction of Hechi City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It is located in the northwest of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region with a total area of 1966 km 2 and a population of 269,800 in 2010. Of which, 881 individuals have lived more than 90 years old.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a constellation of metabolic disorders including obesity, raised blood pressure, dyslipidemia (raised triglycerides and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and raised fasting glucose, may be of special interest because of the increased prevalence with age. Studies about longevity population also revealed different types of metabolic disturbances, but that the results varied across different countries and ethnics. Study from Croatia suggesting that nonagenarians and centenarians had lower prevalence of overweight, obesity and lower blood pressure. Instead, centenarians from Poland showed that mildly elevated blood pressure is a marker for better health status. Recent study of familial longevity from China revealed decreased diastolic blood pressure but increased systolic blood pressure in centenarians. Similar discrepancy can also be found among studies of lipid profile and longevity. Biological study for longevity demonstrated that centenarians and their offspring have significantly larger high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and particle sizes and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels compared with controls. However, other studies did not find significant association of HDL-C levels with centenarians.

All of these studies indicated that individuals with longevity might have different metabolic phenotypes from those general individuals under different ethnic background. But no reports on these metabolic items research integrated were seen now yet. Furthermore, the prevalence of MetS increased in Chinese population aged 60–95. Thus we perform the study to investigate the prevalence and clinical profile of MetS in longevity in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^10ad70d9]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus — background and epidemiology relevant to cardiovascular disease (CVD): Diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for early CVD. Metabolically, diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia due to defects in insulin secretion (type 1 diabetes mellitus [T1DM]) and insulin function and/or secretion (type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]). Both T1DM and T2DM are associated with vascular disease, and autopsy and noninvasive imaging studies suggest that the extent of vascular involvement may reflect the duration of the disease and the severity of the chronic metabolic derangement. The epidemiologies of the two types differ significantly: T1DM presents at a younger age, with 25 percent of patients diagnosed between ages 5 and 10 years and another 40 percent between ages 10 and 15 years, and if not treated adequately, the degree of hyperglycemia is severe and patients are highly symptomatic. By contrast, in T2DM, the majority of patients present in adult life, but a small and growing number present in adolescence, and most are relatively asymptomatic, with only mild to moderate hyperglycemia in combination with obesity.

### Association of metabolic dysregulation with volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive markers of subclinical brain aging in middle-aged adults: the framingham offspring study [^fa54c693]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) afflicts as many as 50% of people aged > 85 years and is associated with significant health care and societal costs. With the rapid aging of the U.S. population, it is expected that, by the year 2050, the prevalence of AD will increase from the currently estimated 5 million to > 11 million afflicted persons aged > 65 years, unless effective prevention or treatment is found.

Because late-onset AD is a slowly progressive disease that affects people aged > 65 years, some have argued that merely delaying its onset by several years would significantly decrease individual risk and the population burden of disease. The Framingham study estimated that a 5-year delay in the onset of AD would be equivalent to a reduction of lifetime risk by half, from 14 to 7%. Thus, although various disease-modifying agents are being investigated, a parallel search for modifiable risk factors that could delay the onset of AD would be a worthwhile endeavor.

Diabetes is a potentially modifiable risk factor that has been related in several population-based studies of older individuals to the risk of incident dementia and AD. However, the argument that it represents a causal factor would be strengthened if similar associations were demonstrable relating the entire spectrum of prediabetic and diabetic states with subclinical measures of subsequent AD risk in younger persons aged < 65 years who are, as yet, free of clinical disease. Furthermore, examining insulin resistance (IR), hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia, the three interwoven components of the diabetic and prediabetic states, could help clarify the relative importance of these elements in determining the risk of AD. To examine the possible association of midlife diabetic and prediabetic states with cognitive and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of subsequent dementia and AD, we related diabetes, glycohemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c), fasting serum insulin levels, and IR in the middle-aged, cognitively intact Framingham Offspring study population to measures of structural and functional brain aging.

Research gaps — The document highlights needs for further study, noting that certain bariatric surgical procedures can be beneficial for the treatment of individuals with severe obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but further studies are needed to determine the risks and benefits of these procedures for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and T2DM. It also calls for more studies on metabolic risk and noninvasive tests of vascular dysfunction to determine whether these can improve prediction of ASCVD and T2DM, and for more research on public health approaches for population-based prevention, emphasizing that treatment of this problem cannot be restricted to the medical office setting.

### Statistics on the burden of dementia: need for stronger data [^088294ea]. The Lancet: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Going forward, there might also be challenges to our underlying models of prevalence and life lived with dementia. The currently accepted model is an exponential age-related increase in prevalence and incidence of dementia, with few cases occurring before age 70 years and many, but a poorly estimated number of, cases after age 90 years. However, emerging data suggest that this model might be changing. For example, a study of data based on a large medical records database suggested there might be an increase in an alcohol-related earlier onset dementia; several epidemiological studies have suggested there is a decline in incident cases of dementia; people with dementia who are aged 90 years or older have different presentations compared with those who develop dementia at an earlier age as their presentation is complicated by multiple-morbidity; and improvements in treating chronic diseases extend life, and therefore an increase in the number of people living with dementia is expected. At the same time, the increase in the occurrence of risk factors, such as diabetes, at younger ages means that individuals might be exposed to risk sooner and possibly have an earlier onset of signs of dementia.

Although collecting data for public health purposes has different aims from those of research into the causes of dementia, both are needed to reduce the burden of disease. The GBD 2016 Dementia Collaboratorsreport that 6·4 million (95% UI 3·4–10·5; 22·3%) of the total DALYs caused by dementia could be attributed to four modifiable risk factors that met GBD criteria for analysis (high body-mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, smoking, and a diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages). To put these findings into context, several reviews of risk factorsand methods to study dementiaare helpful. These sources have pointed out the complexities of understanding the trajectories of cognitive decline and risk factors, and the difficulties in interpreting studies that do not take into account the limitations of the study design and issues such as the selective loss over time of sicker individuals from the study, the quality and appropriateness of exposure and outcome measures, and the choice of statistical models.

VA/DoD type 2 diabetes mellitus — glycemic management: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, we suggest using high glycemic variability over time (e.g., fluctuation in HbA1c or fasting blood glucose) as a prognostic indicator for risk of hypoglycemia, morbidity, and mortality. We suggest setting an individualized HbA1c target range based on the clinician's appraisal of the risk benefit ratio, patient characteristics, presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus complications, comorbidities, and life expectancy. We suggest an HbA1c range of 7.0–8.5% for most patients, if it can be safely achieved. In insulin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not achieving glycemic goals, we suggest real-time continuous glucose monitoring to decrease hypoglycemia and improve HbA1c.

Weight loss — Obesity is a major risk factor for T2D and its prevalence has closely mirrored obesity; in the United States, over two-thirds of adults have overweight or obesity, including 85% of those with diabetes, and if present trends continue, about 1 in 3 Americans will have diabetes by 2050. The panel agreed that the goal for weight loss should be expressed in terms of percent weight loss (e.g., 5% to 15% of baseline body weight), not a specific amount of weight (e.g., 5 pounds), to ameliorate insulin resistance and alleviate hyperglycemia.

### Are insulin resistance, impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance all equally strongly related to age? [^76ea4e83]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin resistance (IR) has been considered an underlying cause of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Whether IR increases with age has been debated. We investigated the age-associated deterioration in the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of IR and in glucose metabolism.

Methods

Ten (nine including women) European studies contributed data on 6314 men and 6393 women aged 30–88 years. The cohort- and sex-specific top 25% of HOMA of IR in non-diabetic subjects was used to define HOMA-IR.

Results

Compared with subjects aged 50–59 years, the cohort- and body mass index-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HOMA-IR was 0.83 (0.64, 1.08), 0.87 (0.74, 1.03), 1.20 (1.02, 1.42) and 1.45 (1.10, 1.92) in men and 0.84 (0.62, 1.14), 0.91 (0.77, 1.09), 1.38 (1.19, 1.62) and 1.71 (1.35, 2.17) in women, respectively, aged 30–39, 40–49, 60–69 and ≥ 70 years (P < 0.0001 for trend test). The same increasing trend was also observed for IFG. In contrast, the corresponding odds ratios for IGT increased linearly and more strongly with age, being 0.37 (0.22, 0.63), 0.67 (0.52, 0.87), 1.55 (1.24, 1.92) and 2.96 (2.13, 4.13) in men and 0.51 (0.31, 0.85), 0.66 (0.52, 0.86), 1.92 (1.57, 2.35) and 3.85 (2.89, 5.12) in women, respectively.

Conclusions

Age is more strongly associated with IGT than with HOMA-IR or IFG in non-diabetic European populations.

### Clinical characteristics of patients with early-onset diabetes mellitus: a single-center retrospective study [^5b2bd658]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a type of chronic metabolic disease characterized by disorded carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism and is caused by the interaction of genetic and acquired factors. In recent years, with the improvement of living standards, changes in lifestyle and an increase in the obesity rate, DM is becoming more prevalent, and patients are getting younger worldwide, which has become an important public health issue affecting human health. Some studies have found that the incidence of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) now exceeds that of type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) among young people in some Asian regions. A large cross-sectional study in China showed that the prevalence of DM is approximately 5.7% in adults aged < 40 years. Several studies reported that patients with early-onset diabetes mellitus have a higher risk of microvascular and macrovascular diseases, heart failure, and shorter life expectancy than those with late-onset diabetes. Unfortunately, patients with early-onset diabetes are usually busy with their career, relatively healthier than elderly individuals and present no obvious symptoms, leading to a low rate of medical treatment, poor medication compliance and gradual aggravation of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Meanwhile, due to the early onset age, long durations of hyperglycemia, multiple complications and other factors, serious physical and mental health issues easily occur in patients, casting a heavy economic burden on families and society. Therefore, this study conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of different types of newly diagnosed hospitalized diabetes mellitus patients with an onset age between 18 and 40 years in Beijing and explored their clinical characteristics to provide evidence for the prevention and treatment of EODM, comprehensive management of metabolic complications and improvement of quality of life.

### NHANES August 2021-August 2023: plasma fasting glucose data documentation, codebook, and frequencies… [^cb0b5dd0]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

According to the National Diabetes Statistics Report, in 2021, diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. More than 38 million Americans are living with diabetes, where almost 30 million were diagnosed and nearly 9 million were undiagnosed. Also, more than 97 million are living with prediabetes, which is a serious health condition that increases a person's risk of type-2 diabetes and other chronic diseases. The prevalence of diabetes and overweight, one of the major risk factors for diabetes, continues to increase. Recognized and accredited programs are available for people to prevent or manage diabetes, including the National Diabetes Prevention Program and diabetes self-management education and support services.

Diabetes testing provides population data to: 1) determine a national estimate of diabetes prevalence; 2) identify the risk factors; 3) permit a national cohort to be established for follow-up studies of this condition; and 4) provide critical information to clinicians and public health officials for the development of preventive care and community-based interventions. Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory methods used. There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this component in the NHANES August 2021–August 2023 cycle. Plasma Fasting Glucose Plasma specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO for analysis. The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation. One variable was created in this data file.

The variable was created using the following formulas: LBXGLU and LBDGLUSI: The plasma fasting glucose value in mg/dL was converted to mmol/L by multiplying by 0.
05551. Refer to the August 2021–August 2023 Laboratory Data Overview for general information on NHANES laboratory data. There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population characteristics. For example, in August 2021–August 2023, approximately 67% of children aged 1–17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults aged 18 and older provided a blood specimen.

Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary. Please refer to the NHANES Analytic Guidelines and the on-line NHANES Tutorial for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. Subsample Weights Plasma glucose was measured in a fasting subsample of participants 12 years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data. Participants included in the fasting subsample but did not provide a blood specimen. have an assigned sample weight value of "0" in their records.

### Insulin glargine [^de981558]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The ORIGIN Study of Major Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Established CV Disease or CV Risk Factors

The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention study (i.e. ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 2-by-2, factorial design study. One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of Insulin Glargine to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in 12,537 adults ≥ 50 years of age with:

Abnormal glucose levels (i.e., impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and/or impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and
Established CV disease or CV risk factors at baseline.

The objective of the study was to demonstrate that Insulin Glargine use could significantly lower the risk of major CV outcomes compared to standard care. There were two coprimary composite CV endpoints:

The first coprimary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse CV event defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke.
The second coprimary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure.

Patients were randomized to either Insulin Glargine (N = 6,264) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of ≤ 95 mg/dL or to standard care (N = 6,273). Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline. The mean age was 64 years and 8% of patients were 75 years of age or older. The majority of patients were male (65%). Fifty nine percent were White, 25% were Latin, 10% were Asian and 3% were Black or African American. The median baseline BMI was 29 kg/m². Approximately 12% of patients had abnormal glucose levels (IGT and/or IFG) at baseline and 88% had type 2 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes, 59% were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug, 23% had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6% were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure. The mean HbA1c (SD) at baseline was 6.5% (1.0). Fifty-nine percent of the patients had had a prior CV event and 39% had documented coronary artery disease or other CV risk factors.

### Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^c84ffee4]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of risk factor exposure and attributable burden of disease. By providing estimates over a long time series, this study can monitor risk exposure trends critical to health surveillance and inform policy debates on the importance of addressing risks in context.

Methods

We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2016. This study included 481 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk (RR) and exposure estimates from 22717 randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources, according to the GBD 2016 source counting methods. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. Finally, we explored four drivers of trends in attributable burden: population growth, population ageing, trends in risk exposure, and all other factors combined.

Findings

Since 1990, exposure increased significantly for 30 risks, did not change significantly for four risks, and decreased significantly for 31 risks. Among risks that are leading causes of burden of disease, child growth failure and household air pollution showed the most significant declines, while metabolic risks, such as body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose, showed significant increases. In 2016, at Level 3 of the hierarchy, the three leading risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs at the global level for men were smoking (124·1 million DALYs [95% UI 111·2 million to 137·0 million]), high systolic blood pressure (122·2 million DALYs [110·3 million to 133·3 million], and low birthweight and short gestation (83·0 million DALYs [78·3 million to 87·7 million]), and for women, were high systolic blood pressure (89·9 million DALYs [80·9 million to 98·2 million]), high body-mass index (64·8 million DALYs [44·4 million to 87·6 million]), and high fasting plasma glucose (63·8 million DALYs [53·2 million to 76·3 million]). In 2016 in 113 countries, the leading risk factor in terms of attributable DALYs was a metabolic risk factor. Smoking remained among the leading five risk factors for DALYs for 109 countries, while low birthweight and short gestation was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 38 countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In terms of important drivers of change in trends of burden attributable to risk factors, between 2006 and 2016 exposure to risks explains an 9·3% (6·9–11·6) decline in deaths and a 10·8% (8·3–13·1) decrease in DALYs at the global level, while population ageing accounts for 14·9% (12·7–17·5) of deaths and 6·2% (3·9–8·7) of DALYs, and population growth for 12·4% (10·1–14·9) of deaths and 12·4% (10·1–14·9) of DALYs. The largest contribution of trends in risk exposure to disease burden is seen between ages 1 year and 4 years, where a decline of 27·3% (24·9–29·7) of the change in DALYs between 2006 and 2016 can be attributed to declines in exposure to risks.

Interpretation

Increasingly detailed understanding of the trends in risk exposure and the RRs for each risk-outcome pair provide insights into both the magnitude of health loss attributable to risks and how modification of risk exposure has contributed to health trends. Metabolic risks warrant particular policy attention, due to their large contribution to global disease burden, increasing trends, and variable patterns across countries at the same level of development. GBD 2016 findings show that, while it has huge potential to improve health, risk modification has played a relatively small part in the past decade.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^3ca0fba3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D — empiric supplementation in high‑risk prediabetes: For adults with high-risk prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes. Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge) for prediabetes and those with impaired glucose tolerance. In the trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent, with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements including up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily.

### Population issues in clinical trials [^aa32df5b]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Inclusion of underrepresented groups in clinical trials is important for several reasons. Age, sex, race, genetic factors, concomitant use of other medications, and comorbid conditions all may play pivotal roles in response to a drug or intervention. Despite the legislation for broader inclusion of underrepresented groups in clinical trials (via the National Institutes of Health [NIH] Revitalization Act of 1993), underrepresentation of particular populations, particularly minorities, continues to be a problem. Studies of predictors of clinical trial enrollment suggest that most people participate in clinical research to find relief from a disease, not for financial remuneration. Yet, men and whites are more likely to enroll in studies and some data indicate that certain patient populations are preferentially (albeit sometimes inadvertently) chosen for study enrollment. This tendency toward inclusion stems from human nature-the natural tendency for an investigator to relate to a particular investigative topic due to a special connection based on a cultural, socioeconomic, age, ethnicity, or gender level. This article reviews the most common population issues for clinical studies: age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and disease severity, with examples of each from published studies. Recommendations are also offered to overcome these barriers.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^84c0db23]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — individualizing HbA1c targets should account for disease status, complications, comorbidities, and life expectancy; the guideline states the clinician should consider these factors and we suggest clinicians consider the magnitude of expected benefit using principles of absolute risk reduction (ARR) or number needed to treat (NNT), not relative risk, noting that the studies above can provide an order of magnitude of expected benefit, especially in older adults. Establishing an individualized therapeutic goal requires a thorough understanding of patient characteristics, including demographics, behavioral factors, cultural factors, and other social determinants that contribute to disparity in adult diabetes care and outcomes in the U.S. population; understanding the individual patient's characteristics will mitigate the negative impact social determinants of health can have on diabetes outcomes, and considering the presence of end–organ injury or other comorbidities and estimating life expectancy — which weighs the relative risk of death and, when viewed as a function of age, comorbidity, and disability, frailty, or both, can be valuable — supports a more relaxed HbA1c target range and offers clinician flexibility to establish expectations and to choose how to safely improve outcomes.

The recommendation is categorized as Reviewed, New-replaced, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. The benefits of using glycemic variability as a prognostic factor for all-cause mortality, composite CVD, and hypoglycemia slightly outweighed the potential harm because no additional testing would be performed, and implications exist for resource use and feasibility related to having systems in place to obtain data and calculate the degree of glycemic variability. Patient values and preferences varied somewhat because calculating glycemic variability could be performed with existing data and would not require additional testing.

### Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications in people at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus [^d4a16e72]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGI) reduce blood glucose levels and may thus prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its associated complications in people at risk of developing of T2DM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of AGI in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG), moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. The date of the last search of all databases was December 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a duration of one year or more, comparing AGI with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with IFG, IGT, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations of these.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles or records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data independently. One review author extracted data, which were checked by a second review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with assessment of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.

Main Results

For this update of the Cochrane Review (first published 2006, Issue 4) we included 10 RCTs (11,814 participants), eight investigating acarbose and two investigating voglibose, that included people with IGT or people "at increased risk for diabetes". The trial duration ranged from one to six years. Most trials compared AGI with placebo (N = 4) or no intervention (N = 4). Acarbose reduced the incidence of T2DM compared to placebo: 670 out of 4014 people (16.7%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 812 out of 3994 people (20.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89; P < 0.0001; 3 trials; 8008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial including participants with coronary heart disease and IGT contributed 64% of cases for this outcome. Acarbose reduced the risk of T2DM compared to no intervention: 7 out 75 people (9.3%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 18 out of 65 people (27.7%) in the no-intervention groups (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69; P = 0.004; 2 trials; 140 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acarbose compared to placebo did not reduce or increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18; P = 0.86; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.10; P = 0.26; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.29; P = 0.13; 2 trials; 6625 participants; low-certainty evidence), non-fatal stroke (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74; P = 0.43; 1 trial; 1368 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or congestive heart failure (RR of 0.87; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.12; P = 0.40; 2 trials; 7890 participants; low-certainty evidence). Acarbose compared to placebo reduced non-fatal myocardial infarction: one out of 742 participants (0.1%) in the acarbose groups had a non-fatal myocardial infarction compared to 15 out of 744 participants (2%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.53; P = 0.007; 2 trials; 1486 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acarbose treatment showed an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (mainly gastro-intestinal events), compared to placebo: 751 of 775 people (96.9%) in the acarbose groups experienced an event, compared to 723 of 775 people (93.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06; P = 0.0008; 2 trials; 1550 participants). Acarbose compared to no intervention showed no advantage or disadvantage for any of these outcome measures (very low-certainty evidence). One trial each compared voglibose with placebo (1780 participants) or diet and exercise (870 participants). Voglibose compared to placebo reduced the incidence of T2DM: 50 out of 897 participants (5.6%) developed T2DM, compared to 106 out of 881 participants (12%) in the placebo group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64; P < 0.0001; 1 trial; 1778 participants; low-certainty evidence). For all other reported outcome measures there were no clear differences between voglibose and comparator groups. One trial with 90 participants compared acarbose with diet and exercise and another trial with 98 participants reported data on acarbose versus metformin. There were no clear differences for any outcome measure between these two acarbose interventions and the associated comparator groups. None of the trials reported amputation of lower extremity, blindness or severe vision loss, end-stage renal disease, health-related quality of life, time to progression to T2DM, or socioeconomic effects.

Authors' Conclusions

AGI may prevent or delay the development of T2DM in people with IGT. There is no firm evidence that AGI have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events.

### Cardiovascular health promotion in children: challenges and opportunities for 2020 and beyond: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^bd8ce5a5]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Fasting blood glucose in pediatric cardiovascular health — thresholds and applicability: A fasting blood glucose level of < 100 mg/dL was set as the ideal for pediatric patients, but measurement of fasting blood glucose is not a current or proposed recommendation for routine pediatric care. The American Diabetes Association defines impaired glucose tolerance as a fasting blood glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL and diabetes mellitus as a fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL. Puberty-related changes in glucose have not been documented, suggesting that the use of a single cut point for glucose may be reasonable.

### Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2015 [^d042672d]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Overview

Drawing from 25 500 data sources, we estimated exposure to 79 metabolic, environmental and occupational, and behavioural risk factors or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015 in 195 countries and territories and attributed deaths and overall disease burden to these risks. In 2015, all risks combined contributed to 57·8% (95% UI 56·6–58·8) of deaths and 41·2% (39·8–42·8) of DALYs worldwide. Since 1990, global risk exposure for both sexes combined increased significantly for 27 risks, did not significantly change for seven risks, and declined significantly for 27 risks. At the same time, that risk exposure increased for various leading risks, particularly metabolic risk factors associated with NCDs, and age-standardised risk-attributable deaths and DALYs declined for most risks. Globally, pronounced reductions in risk-deleted or underlying cause-specific DALY rates offset minimal changes in, or increased, risk exposure. These gains in risk-deleted DALY rates might not be large enough in the future to compensate for rising levels of risk exposure, such as high BMI or high fasting plasma glucose.

The ORIGIN Study of Major Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Established CV Disease or CV Risk Factors

The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention study (i.e. ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 2-by-2, factorial design study. One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of LANTUS to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in 12,537 adults ≥ 50 years of age with:

Abnormal glucose levels (i.e., impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and/or impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and
Established CV disease or CV risk factors at baseline.

The objective of the study was to demonstrate that LANTUS use could significantly lower the risk of major CV outcomes compared to standard care. There were two coprimary composite CV endpoints:

The first coprimary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse CV event defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke.
The second coprimary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure.

Patients were randomized to either LANTUS (N = 6,264) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of ≤ 95 mg/dL or to standard care (N = 6,273). Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline. The mean age was 64 years and 8% of patients were 75 years of age or older. The majority of patients were male (65%). Fifty nine percent were White, 25% were Latin, 10% were Asian and 3% were Black or African American. The median baseline BMI was 29 kg/m2. Approximately 12% of patients had abnormal glucose levels (IGT and/or IFG) at baseline and 88% had type 2 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes, 59% were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug, 23% had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6% were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure. The mean HbA1c (SD) at baseline was 6.5% (1.0). Fifty-nine percent of the patients had had a prior CV event and 39% had documented coronary artery disease or other CV risk factors.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (management of dyslipidemia), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to optimize glycemia and initiate fibrates, with a goal of < 400 mg/dL (< 4.7 mmol/L) fasting to reduce the risk for pancreatitis if triglycerides are > 400 mg/dL (> 4.7 mmol/L) fasting or > 1,000 mg/dL (> 11.6 mmol/L) nonfasting.

### Comparing different definitions of prediabetes with subsequent risk of diabetes: an individual participant data meta-analysis involving 76 513 individuals and 8208 cases of incident diabetes [^d62cd2e5]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

The strength of our study was the use of individual participant data from 16 studies. Nevertheless, a few limitations warrant mention. Between-study heterogeneity was generally high across all analyses; analysis by subgroups did not identify possible sources of heterogeneity. Variability of HbA1c assays used between studies and within studies over time may have partly contributed to the high heterogeneity in analyses related to HbA1c. Nevertheless, four of the five studies that measured HbA1c conducted baseline and last follow-up visits over similar periods. We were unable to directly compare the strength of association and discriminatory ability of 2hPG-based and HbA1c-based prediabetes definitions in the same participants as only one study had all three measures of glycemia. Furthermore, those who died before follow-up were more likely to have developed diabetes which would have been missed by our studies, given the increased risk of death associated with diabetes. If mortality differed between the prediabetes categories, this might lead to different degrees of underestimation of true incidence between the categories. The lack of studies that had collected 2hPG and/or HbA1c also reduced the generalizability of the results by country/geographical region as most of the subgroups included only one study. Moreover, we were unable to examine how the relationship may vary by ethnic/race group. Furthermore, unlike mortality as an outcome which is accompanied by a date of death, time to diabetes is an approximation.

All current prediabetes definitions were associated with greater risk of diabetes relative to people with lower glucose concentrations and identified people at risk of developing diabetes within 5 years with similar accuracy. Therefore, deciding which definition to use will ultimately depend on the allocation of healthcare resources available to intervene in individuals designated at high risk, and the need to balance sensitivity with specificity. Unsurprisingly, using a lower glycemic threshold to define prediabetes will increase the number of individuals who may qualify for an intervention but at the risk of treating many individuals who are less likely to progress to diabetes. As suggested in the WHO/International Diabetes Federation 2006 report, including known diabetes risk factors in the assessment of risk rather than basing it on a single measure of glycemia would be a better and more nuanced approach to identifying those most at risk of developing diabetes and in need of subsequent intervention.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to general principles, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain a complete medical evaluation at the initial visit and follow-up, as appropriate, to:

- confirm the diagnosis and classify diabetes

- ssess glycemic status and previous treatment

- evaluate for diabetes complications, potential comorbid conditions, and overall health status

- identify care partners and support system

- assess social determinants of health and structural barriers to optimal health and health care

- review risk factor management in the patient with diabetes

- begin engagement with the patient with diabetes in the formulation of a care management plan including initial goals of care

- develop a plan for continuing care.

MetS Definitions

Currently, there are several definitions for MetS. For the purpose of this study, we used the National Cholesterol Education Program — Third Adult Treatment Panel 27 definition. Accordingly, patients who were seen with 3 or more of the following 5 risk factors were defined as having MetS:
Central obesity, defined as waist circumference greater than established ethnicity‐specific values. Because the data on waist circumference were not available, for purposes of this analysis, we used the body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m² as a criterion for classifying patients as obese. 28, 29, 30 Other large studies have previously used this substitution and showed that there is a strong linear correlation between waist circumference and BMI value. 30, 31, 32
Low HDL, defined as < 50 mg/dL among women and < 40 mg/dL among men.
Elevated fasting plasma triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL.
Elevated systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg, diastolic value ≥ 85 mm Hg, or treatment of previously diagnosed hypertension.
Elevated fasting plasma glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL.

Group Distribution

To examine the effect of IFG with or without MetS on long‐term mortality outcome, we divided our study cohort into 4 groups: (1) group METS − IFG −, the none group (ie, subjects without MetS or IFG); (2) group METS − IFG +, the IFG group (ie, subjects with IFG but without MetS); (3) group METS + IFG −, MetS without IFG group (ie, subjects with MetS but without the IFG component [IFG not 1 of the 3 components for MetS definition fulfillment]); and (4) group METS + IFG +, MetS with IFG group (ie, subjects with IFG and additional 2 criteria, thus fulfilling the MetS definition).

Laboratory Methods

Detailed data on the laboratory methods were given in a previous report. 33 Briefly, blood samples were drawn after at least 12 hours of fasting. Cooled samples, collected in the 18 participating centers using standard equipment and procedures, were transferred to the study's central laboratory. All analyses were performed on a random access analyzer using diagnostic kits.

Primary End Point

The primary end point of this study was all‐cause mortality. Mortality data were obtained by matching the patients' identification numbers with their vital status in the National Population Registry of Israel. Each match record was checked for correct identification by matching the study recorded date of birth during enrollment with the date of birth stored at the national registry.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^4a740db8]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — glycemic variability evidence and clinical considerations note that the increased risk for hypoglycemia events in the setting of higher variability generally ranged from 50–300%, and the median duration of follow-up ranged from 8 months to nearly 9 years. The studies showed that glycemic variability over time is an independent predictor of adverse health outcomes and that risks tended to increase linearly as variability increased; however, no concurrence exists on a preferred glycemic variability measure or thresholds of glycemic variability to optimally stratify risk, and whether glycemic variability has a causal effect on adverse events and whether prospectively reducing fasting blood glucose or HbA1c variability will favorably impact outcomes are also unknown. Based on the available evidence, diabetes health care providers should consider high glycemic variability over time as an indicator of risk for major adverse outcomes, and additional steps may include screening for hypoglycemia, assessing medication and diet adherence, reviewing self-monitoring glucose profiles, or referring patients to diabetes specialists to identify potential sources of glycemic variability that might be remediable.

Glycemic tests for identifying elevated glycemia — Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and/or HbA1c can be used; the FPG test is automated and inexpensive but reflects only a single time point, the OGTT is more sensitive but more time-consuming, costly, and variable than FPG, and some evidence suggests the OGTT is a better predictor for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality than FPG. HbA1c is a more long-term measure of glycemia with less sensitivity and less variability than glucose tests and can be performed in the nonfasting state; marked discrepancies between HbA1c and plasma glucose may indicate Hb variant assay interference, for which an assay without analytic interference should be used. In conditions with increased red blood cell turnover (e.g., sickle cell disease or hemodialysis), plasma blood glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes; emerging data suggest that genetic variants such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can significantly impact HbA1c levels. There is a strong, continuous association between HbA1c and subsequent diabetes risk, and within the HbA1c spectrum of prediabetes the yearly incidence of diabetes increases from ~3% with an HbA1c of 5.7% to ~9.5% with an HbA1c of 6.5%.

### How I read an article that uses machine learning methods [^0f2f5676]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Step 1: Understand the problem being addressed. The first step in reading an ML paper is to understand the problem that the authors are trying to solve and, more importantly, understand the clinical or scientific impact of solving this problem. In other words, if the aim of the study is to solve a clinical problem, how does the answer or the recommendation provided by the algorithm help physicians or researchers in their day-to-day practice, and is this solution mature enough to be implemented in clinical workflows? Major clinical problems in health care can mainly affect either patient outcomes or operations (can I make the process easier and faster for the patient and the health care system?).

Step 2: Assess the quality of the data. The quality of the data used to build the ML model is crucial for the validity of the results. Following are some questions that can be used to evaluate the data:
1 Sample size: Is the size of the training, validation, and test sets enough to build a reproducible and generalizable ML model? Is this size of the data appropriate for the chosen methods (ie, some methods are "data-hungry" and understanding which methods require larger datasets is key)? However, different algorithms require different data types (image, tabular, text, or others) and sizes, and there are no rules of thumb or formulas that can estimate the perfect data.
2 Relevance: Are the data appropriate and relevant to the problem that the model is trying to solve?
3 Accuracy: How are the data collected and annotated (human vs natural language process). How are the data transformed to make it ready for ML use, etc.
4 Consistency: Are the data consistent? Do they have any missing values and how the authors dealt with this?
5 Representativeness: The data should be representative of the population being studied.
6 Balance: The data should be balanced, with roughly equal representation of all relevant classes or groups. However, most health care data are unbalanced. It is critical to understand how the authors dealt with unbalanced data.
7 Bias: To evaluate bias in data, it is important to look at the distribution of certain characteristics, such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status, among the samples in the data set, and how the data were collected. This will help to identify any disparities or overrepresentation of certain groups, which can indicate the presence of bias in the data. It is critical to evaluate bias at this stage because if this is not addressed properly, it could produce a biased model.
