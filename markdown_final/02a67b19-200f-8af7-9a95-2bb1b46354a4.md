## Question

Sickle cell acute exacerbation treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating a sickle cell acute exacerbation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes an "acute exacerbation" in sickle cell disease and how to distinguish vaso-occlusive crisis from acute chest syndrome. Then, I should verify the universal principles that apply to all acute presentations, including rapid analgesia, reassessment cadence, and care setting. Next, I will examine management of vaso-occlusive crisis, followed by management of acute chest syndrome, and then consider special scenarios and disposition. Finally, I should integrate disease-modifying and preventive strategies and close with a concise algorithmic summary, making sure each step aligns with guideline strength and evidence certainty.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities encompassed by "acute exacerbation". In sickle cell disease, the two most common and consequential are vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), which is ischemic pain from sickling and vaso-occlusion, and acute chest syndrome (ACS), a pulmonary complication with new infiltrate and respiratory symptoms that carries high morbidity and mortality; distinguishing them guides transfusion decisions and monitoring intensity, so I need to keep both in mind up front [^9a65661b] [^f2879327].

> Next, I should review universal principles that apply regardless of the specific exacerbation. Wait, let me verify the timing targets: ASH 2020 recommends rapid assessment and administration of analgesia within 1 hour of ED arrival with frequent reassessments every 30–60 minutes; this is a strong recommendation despite low certainty because delays cause harm, and non-IV routes can facilitate speed when appropriate [^852fe028] [^ae17019e]. I also need to ensure we prefer SCD-specific acute care facilities when available, as they reduce admissions, shorten time to first dose, and lower 48-hour ED returns, though the evidence is observational and the recommendation is conditional [^d6e58458] [^3b89658a]. Hold on, I should verify fluid guidance: ASH 2020 issues no recommendation for or against IV fluids for acute pain due to potential harm from over-resuscitation and lack of RCTs, so fluids should be individualized rather than routine [^bff47c3a] [^bd266e40].

> Now, for vaso-occlusive crisis, I will examine pharmacologic therapy. Opioids remain the mainstay for moderate to severe pain, and I should tailor dosing to baseline opioid exposure and prior effective regimens; this is a conditional recommendation with moderate certainty in adults and low in children, and it underscores the need for individualized care plans and documentation to avoid undertreatment or unsafe escalation [^b80c134b] [^bf89258c]. I should confirm NSAID use: a short 5–7 day NSAID course is suggested as adjunct to opioids when not contraindicated, with renal, GI, and cardiovascular risks assessed; again, conditional and very low certainty, so shared decision-making is key [^e0f4e690] [^c0af11ec]. But wait, what if pain is refractory despite opioids? ASH suggests subanesthetic ketamine infusion as adjunct in hospitalized patients, starting 0.1–0.3 mg/kg/hr with a maximum of 1 mg/kg/hr; this is conditional with very low certainty and should be reserved for refractory cases with appropriate monitoring [^a9c32fac] [^8cf5e027]. I should double-check nonpharmacologic options: massage, yoga, TENS, VR, and guided relaxation can be offered as low-risk adjuncts, acknowledging indirect evidence and patient preference [^ecc83887].

> For acute chest syndrome, I need to ensure I escalate beyond analgesia. Let me think about supportive care first: supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 greater than 95%, close monitoring for hypoxemia and bronchospasm, and incentive spirometry to reduce atelectasis and progression are standard, with the latter supported by NHLBI as a strong recommendation despite limited direct evidence in SCD, which I should note explicitly [^5e94d0c3] [^755be0e7]. I should confirm antibiotics: even though infectious and noninfectious etiologies overlap, empiric coverage with a cephalosporin plus a macrolide is recommended; evidence quality is low and no RCTs exist, so this remains standard practice pending better data [^5e94d0c3] [^d436616a]. Hold on, I should verify transfusion thresholds: simple transfusion is indicated for symptomatic ACS when hemoglobin is more than 1.0 g/dL below baseline, with exchange transfusion considered for severe disease, rapid progression, or high baseline hemoglobin; this aligns with NHLBI and contemporary reviews emphasizing early transfusion to prevent deterioration [^a7cdfa35] [^f2879327]. I need to check bronchodilators: although bronchial hyper-responsiveness is common, there are no RCTs in ACS; nonetheless, inhaled short-acting bronchodilators are reasonable for wheeze or suspected bronchospasm, recognizing the evidence gap [^68d242a2].

> Let me consider special scenarios and disposition. If the patient is in an SCD-specific day hospital or infusion center, that setting can expedite care and reduce ED use, but I should confirm that higher-acuity backup is available if deterioration occurs; this is a conditional recommendation based on observational data [^d6e58458] [^3b89658a]. For refractory VOC pain, I should remember regional anesthesia as a potential adjunct when pain is localized and expertise is available, though evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized [^652bbc36]. I should double-check that we avoid routine corticosteroids for acute pain because of rebound pain risk; steroids are not recommended for acute VOC unless there is another indication such as asthma, in which case careful coordination is needed [^9f209e2f] [^bc955ffd].

> Next, I should review disease-modifying and preventive strategies that influence recurrence risk. Hydroxyurea is strongly recommended for patients with frequent VOCs, severe anemia, or recurrent ACS; importantly, modern pediatric consensus supports considering hydroxyurea for essentially all children with SCA given the cumulative burden of disease, which I need to emphasize in follow-up planning [^24e52f98] [^02aa4b78]. Chronic transfusion is not first-line for recurrent acute pain due to burden and risks; ASH suggests against routine monthly transfusions for this indication, reserving them for select refractory cases after shared decision-making and with iron chelation planning, which I should document clearly [^182418fd] [^d6504049]. For secondary stroke prevention and certain high-risk scenarios, chronic transfusion remains indicated, but that is outside the scope of acute exacerbation management and should be addressed in longitudinal care [^24e52f98].

> I will now synthesize a practical algorithm, but let me first confirm alignment with guideline strength. Universal steps: rapid assessment and analgesia within 1 hour, frequent reassessment, and consideration of SCD-specific acute care settings when available are strong or conditional recommendations with low to moderate certainty, so I should prioritize these consistently [^852fe028] [^d6e58458]. For VOC: start opioids tailored to baseline exposure, add NSAIDs if appropriate, escalate to ketamine if refractory, and incorporate nonpharmacologic adjuncts; avoid routine steroids and avoid transfusion solely for VOC pain, which is a strong recommendation from NHLBI [^b80c134b] [^b5c34047]. For ACS: oxygen to maintain SpO2 greater than 95%, incentive spirometry, empiric antibiotics with cephalosporin plus macrolide, and transfuse early when indicated by hemoglobin drop or severity, with exchange transfusion for severe or rapidly progressive disease; this reflects NHLBI guidance and contemporary reviews [^5e94d0c3] [^f2879327]. Throughout, I need to ensure documentation of baseline opioid regimen, pain scores, functional goals, and a plan for follow-up and prevention, including hydroxyurea optimization and vaccination updates, which are essential to reduce future exacerbations [^24e52f98] [^526ecf3d].

> Finally, I should acknowledge evidence limitations so we do not overstate certainty. Much of the acute pain literature in SCD is low to very low quality, with small studies and indirect evidence; ASH explicitly notes this and issues mostly conditional recommendations, reinforcing the need for shared decision-making and individualized care plans [^38caa616] [^4b17b04c]. For ACS, high-quality transfusion trials are sparse, and current practice relies on physiologic rationale, observational data, and expert consensus; I should communicate this uncertainty when discussing risks and benefits with patients and families [^3f1ed99f] [^f2879327].

For sickle cell acute exacerbations, **rapid analgesia within 1 hour** [^852fe028] and frequent reassessment are essential [^ae17019e]; use **opioids tailored to baseline use** [^b80c134b] plus NSAIDs when not contraindicated [^e0f4e690]. Avoid routine corticosteroids due to rebound pain risk [^9f209e2f] [^bc955ffd]. For acute chest syndrome, give oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 95% [^5e94d0c3], empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone plus azithromycin) [^b4b4133d], and transfuse if hemoglobin drops > 1 g/dL below baseline or if severe/progressive disease [^a7cdfa35] [^f2879327]; use exchange transfusion for severe cases [^640bdc6b]. Hydration should be cautious to avoid overload [^bff47c3a] [^bd266e40], and **ketamine is reasonable for refractory pain** [^a9c32fac] [^8cf5e027]. Manage in SCD-specific centers when possible [^d6e58458] [^3b89658a], and monitor for complications such as ACS, stroke, and infection [^9a65661b].

## General principles of acute management

- **Rapid assessment and analgesia**: Assess within 1 hour of arrival and provide analgesia promptly, with reassessment every 30–60 minutes [^852fe028] [^ae17019e].

- **Individualized opioid dosing**: Tailor opioid dosing to baseline opioid use and prior effective regimens [^b80c134b] [^bf89258c].

- **NSAID adjuncts**: Use NSAIDs for 5–7 days if no contraindications (e.g. renal disease, GI bleeding) [^e0f4e690] [^c0af11ec].

- **Avoid routine corticosteroids**: Do not use for acute pain due to rebound pain risk [^9f209e2f] [^bc955ffd].

---

## Management of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC)

- **Opioids**: Mainstay for moderate-to-severe pain; consider PCA for severe cases [^f0f69c2d] [^97f1ebd1].

- **NSAIDs**: Add for enhanced analgesia and opioid-sparing effect [^e0f4e690] [^5fe6f8bd].

- **Hydration**: Use cautious hydration; avoid overload, especially in renal/cardiac disease [^bff47c3a] [^bd266e40].

- **Adjuncts**: Consider ketamine for refractory pain [^a9c32fac] [^8cf5e027].

---

## Management of acute chest syndrome (ACS)

- **Oxygen**: Maintain SpO2 > 95% [^5e94d0c3] [^b4b4133d].

- **Antibiotics**: Empiric ceftriaxone plus azithromycin for possible infection [^5e94d0c3] [^b4b4133d].

- **Transfusion**: Simple transfusion if hemoglobin drops > 1 g/dL below baseline; exchange transfusion for severe/progressive ACS or high baseline hemoglobin [^a7cdfa35] [^f2879327].

- **Incentive spirometry**: Use to reduce atelectasis and recurrence [^755be0e7] [^87caef14].

---

## Special considerations

- **Ketamine**: Consider for refractory pain at 0.1–0.3 mg/kg/hr (max 1 mg/kg/hr) [^a9c32fac] [^8cf5e027].

- **Regional anesthesia**: Consider for localized refractory pain [^652bbc36].

- **SCD-specific centers**: Prefer when available for rapid, expert care [^d6e58458] [^3b89658a].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **continuous assessment** of pain, respiratory status, oxygenation, and neurologic function. Complications to watch for include ACS, stroke, infection, and organ dysfunction [^9a65661b]. Arrange close follow-up to optimize disease-modifying therapy and prevent recurrence [^fd883635].

---

## Evidence-based treatment algorithm

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| VOC | - Opioids (tailored dosing) <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - Cautious hydration <br/> - Ketamine if refractory [^b80c134b] [^e0f4e690] [^bff47c3a] [^a9c32fac] |
| ACS | - Oxygen (SpO2 > 95%) <br/> - Ceftriaxone + azithromycin <br/> - Simple transfusion if indicated <br/> - Exchange transfusion if severe <br/> - Incentive spirometry [^5e94d0c3] [^b4b4133d] [^a7cdfa35] [^640bdc6b] [^755be0e7] |
| Refractory pain | - Ketamine infusion <br/> - Regional anesthesia [^a9c32fac] [^652bbc36] |

---

Effective care for sickle cell acute exacerbations hinges on **rapid analgesia**, complication-specific management (especially for ACS), and vigilant monitoring, with care ideally delivered in SCD-experienced settings [^d6e58458].

Sickle cell disease pain burden and practice gaps — pain causes significant morbidity for individuals living with SCD, manifests as both acute and intermittent pain, chronic daily pain, and/or acute-on-chronic pain, and spans the life course beginning as early as the first year of life with chronic pain emerging with increasing age. Currently, opioids constitute the mainstay of treatment of acute SCD pain in health care settings and are frequently used for both acute and chronic pain at home, yet variability in practice for chronic opioid therapy is likely driven by a paucity of data to support or refute its use, and the use and role of nonopioid pharmacological therapy and nonpharmacological therapies have not been well studied. The panel evaluated evidence for these pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies and, given widespread practice, also sought to evaluate the evidence for chronic transfusion therapy for prevention and treatment of recurrent acute and chronic pain because evidence-based recommendations do not exist for the indications for transfusion.

Recommendation 2c — ketamine infusion for acute SCD pain states that for adults and children presenting with acute pain related to SCD who are hospitalized, the ASH guideline panel suggests a subanesthetic (analgesic) ketamine infusion as adjunctive treatment of pain that is refractory or not effectively treated with opioids alone (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects). The recommended dose for subanesthetic infusion for acute exacerbation of SCD pain starts at 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg per hour with a maximum of 1 mg/kg per hour.

Recommendation 2b — corticosteroids for acute SCD pain indicates that for adults and children presenting for acute pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests against corticosteroids for acute pain management (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects). Remarks clarify that steroids should still be used when appropriate for other medical indications such as asthma, and that systemic corticosteroid exposure, particularly cessation of steroids, has been associated with rebound pain and other complications; therefore decisions for other indications should be made in collaboration with experts in SCD.

### Blood transfusions for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease [^12c55f1f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited autosomal recessive blood condition and is one of the most prevalent genetic blood diseases worldwide. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, as well as a major cause of morbidity and the greatest single cause of mortality in children with SCD. Standard treatment may include intravenous hydration, oxygen as treatment for hypoxia, antibiotics to treat the infectious cause and blood transfusions may be given.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of blood transfusions, simple and exchange, for treating ACS by comparing improvement in symptoms and clinical outcomes against standard care.

Search Strategy

We searched The Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 27 March 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing either simple or exchange transfusion versus standard care (no transfusion) in people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome.

Data Collection and Analysis

No studies were identified for inclusion in the review.

Main Results

No studies were identified for inclusion in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no reliable evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of blood transfusions as treatment options for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. Well-designed, adequately-powered randomised controlled trials are now required to assess the benefits and risks of this form of treatment.

### Blood transfusions for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease [^3f1ed99f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease is an inherited autosomal recessive blood condition and is one of the most prevalent genetic blood diseases worldwide. Acute chest syndrome is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, as well as a major cause of morbidity and the greatest single cause of mortality in children with sickle cell disease. Standard treatment may include intravenous hydration, oxygen as treatment for hypoxia, antibiotics to treat the infectious cause and blood transfusions may be given. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010 and updated in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of blood transfusions, simple and exchange, for treating acute chest syndrome by comparing improvement in symptoms and clinical outcomes against standard care.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 30 May 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing either simple or exchange transfusion versus standard care (no transfusion) in people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently selected trials and assessed the risk of bias, no data could be extracted.

Main Results

One trial was eligible for inclusion in the review. While in the multicentre trial 237 people were enrolled (169 SCC, 42 SC, 15 Sβ⁰-thalassaemia, 11Sβ + -thalassaemia); the majority were recruited to an observational arm and only ten participants met the inclusion criteria for randomisation. Of these, four were randomised to the transfusion arm and received a single transfusion of 7 to 13 mL/kg packed red blood cells, and six were randomised to standard care. None of the four participants who received packed red blood cells developed acute chest syndrome, while 33% (two participants) developed acute chest syndrome in standard care arm. No data for any pre-defined outcomes were available.

Authors' Conclusions

We found only one very small randomised controlled trial; this is not enough to make any reliable conclusion to support the use of blood transfusion. Whilst there appears to be some indication that chronic blood transfusion may play a roll in reducing the incidence of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease and albeit offering transfusions may be a widely accepted clinical practice, there is currently no reliable evidence to support or refute the perceived benefits of these as treatment options; very limited information about any of the potential harms associated with these interventions or indeed guidance that can be used to aid clinical decision making. Clinicians should therefore base any treatment decisions on a combination of; their clinical experience, individual circumstances and the unique characteristics and preferences of adequately informed people with sickle cell disease who are suffering with acute chest syndrome. This review highlights the need of further high quality research to provide reliable evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions for the relief of the symptoms of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^741c2428]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of acute and chronic pain for individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD) is a clinical challenge. This reflects the paucity of clinical SCD pain research and limited understanding of the complex biological differences between acute and chronic pain. These issues collectively create barriers to effective, targeted interventions. Optimal pain management requires interdisciplinary care.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines developed by the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in pain management decisions for children and adults with SCD.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary panel, including 2 patient representatives, that was thoroughly vetted to minimize bias from conflicts of interest. The Mayo Evidence-Based Practice Research Program supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic reviews. Clinical questions and outcomes were prioritized according to importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used, including GRADE evidence-to-decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel reached consensus on 18 recommendations specific to acute and chronic pain. The recommendations reflect a broad pain management approach, encompassing pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions and analgesic delivery.

Conclusions

Because of low-certainty evidence and closely balanced benefits and harms, most recommendations are conditional. Patient preferences should drive clinical decisions. Policymaking, including that by payers, will require substantial debate and input from stakeholders. Randomized controlled trials and comparative-effectiveness studies are needed for chronic opioid therapy, nonopioid therapies, and nonpharmacological interventions.

### Crises in sickle cell disease [^9a65661b]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

In spite of significant strides in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD), SCD crises are still responsible for high morbidity and early mortality. While most patients initially seek care in the acute setting for a seemingly uncomplicated pain episode (pain crisis or vaso-occlusive crisis), this initial event is the primary risk factor for potentially life-threatening complications. The pathophysiological basis of these illnesses is end-organ ischemia and infarction combined with the downstream effects of hemolysis that results from red blood cell sickling. These pathological changes can occur acutely and lead to a dramatic clinical presentation, but are frequently superimposed over a milieu of chronic vasculopathy, immune dysregulation, and decreased functional reserve. In the lungs, acute chest syndrome is a particularly ominous lung injury syndrome with a complex pathogenesis and potentially devastating sequelae, but all organ systems can be affected. It is, therefore, critical to understand the SCD patients' susceptibility to acute complications and their risk factors so that they can be recognized promptly and managed effectively. Blood transfusions remain the mainstay of therapy for all severe acute crises. Recommendations and indications for the safest and most efficient implementation of transfusion strategies in the critical care setting are therefore presented and discussed, together with their pitfalls and potential future therapeutic alternatives. In particular, the importance of extended phenotypic red blood cell matching cannot be overemphasized, due to the high prevalence of severe complications from red cell alloimmunization in SCD.

### Acute pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease [^68557842]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary problems in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, in particular acute chest syndrome (ACS), cause significant mortality and morbidity. It is important to differentiate ACS from pneumonia to avoid inappropriate or inadequate treatment. Asthma may increase the risk of ACS and co-morbid asthma and SCD are associated with worse patient outcomes and, in preclinical models, more severe inflammation. Recurrent wheezing, however, can occur in the absence of a diagnosis of asthma; it is likely due to SCD related inflammation and additional therapies than those that treat asthma may be required. Further research is merited to clarify these issues.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^bd40ab99]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Recommendation 10 — chronic transfusion therapy for recurrent acute pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) is supported by very low certainty evidence: the systematic review identified 7 studies; of these, there were 4 RCTs enrolling a total of 439 children and 72 pregnant women and 3 studies comparing rates before and after starting transfusions (31 children and 15 adults). The only studies to include a substantial proportion of people with recurrent acute pain at entry were small (13 to 17 participants), and none reported on HRQOL outcomes. In the transfused arms, the rate of acute pain episodes decreased by 17 to 61 per 100 person-years in children and from 50% to 16% during pregnancy. The panel discussed the fact that monthly blood cell transfusion has a moderate risk of harm and a very high burden, and overall determined that the balance of effects favors the comparison, leading to a conditional recommendation against the intervention.

Regarding medical management for sickle cell disease, more specifically with respect to management of pain (acute), ASH 2020 guidelines recommend to consider using tailored opioid dosing, if opioid therapy is indicated, based on consideration of baseline opioid therapy and before effective therapy in patients with SCD presenting to an acute care setting with acute pain related to SCD, both for adult
and pediatric patients.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^8129bc53]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease pain guidelines — interpretation of recommendation strength and good practice statements: The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends") or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests"). For strong recommendations, most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, most individuals should follow it, the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations, and it is supported by credible research making additional research unlikely to alter its direction. For conditional recommendations, a majority of individuals would want the suggested course but many would not; clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate and help each patient arrive at a decision consistent with their values and preferences; policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders and performance measures should focus on if an appropriate decision-making process is duly documented; and the recommendation is likely to be strengthened by additional research. Good practice statements endorse interventions or practices with unequivocal net benefit, are not based on a systematic review of available evidence, and may be interpreted as strong recommendations; the panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty in the evidence and formulate recommendations.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^31588375]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology sickle cell disease pain guideline — aims and audience focus on providing evidence-based recommendations to facilitate management of acute and chronic pain in individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD), targeting patients and their caregivers, hematologists, general practitioners, internists, emergency medicine providers, and other clinicians and decision makers. Through improved provider and patient education regarding the available evidence and evidence-based recommendations, these guidelines aim to support shared decision making, and because most recommendations are conditional, shared decision making is necessary between patients and providers before a definitive decision on implementation of the considered therapies. These recommendations take into consideration acceptability, feasibility, cost effectiveness, resource use, and impact on health equity, and the panel acknowledged variability in patient and provider knowledge as well as variability in their perceptions of harms vs benefits and other patient-important outcomes when developing these recommendations.

Chronic transfusion therapy (CTT) for recurrent acute pain in sickle cell disease — recommendation: The clinical question asked whether chronic monthly transfusion therapy to suppress hemoglobin S levels to < 30% vs no transfusions or on-demand transfusions should be used for children and adults with SCD who have recurrent acute pain and/or chronic pain. For adults and children with SCD and recurrent acute pain, the ASH guideline panel suggests against chronic monthly transfusion therapy as a first-line strategy to prevent or reduce recurrent acute pain episodes (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕⊕◯◯).

### The challenge of clinical end points in sickle cell disease [^88497bc6]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

As most patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) do not have access to curative therapies, the availability of drug therapies that can modify disease severity remains highly desirable. Despite an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD, only 4 drugs are approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration. Most drug trials in SCD have involved the use of acute pain episodes as the primary clinical end point. These studies have typically been to prevent or shorten the duration of such episodes. To date, no drug has received regulatory approval for shortening the duration of acute vaso-occlusive complications, likely highlighting the complex pathophysiology of acute pain episodes. Trials to prevent acute pain episodes have largely evaluated those episodes requiring health care use as a surrogate end point. However, with differences in culture and health care practices among countries, health care use may not reliably predict clinically important effects on acute pain episodes. This article discusses issues related to the use of health care use as the primary end point for prevention trials of acute pain episodes and highlights the importance of evaluating patient-reported outcomes as well as other SCD-related complications as outcome measures.

### The intersection between asthma and acute chest syndrome in children with sickle-cell anaemia [^44d9e479]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Acute chest syndrome is a frequent cause of acute lung disease in children with sickle-cell disease. Asthma is common in children with sickle-cell disease and is associated with increased incidence of vaso-occlusive pain events, acute chest syndrome episodes, and earlier death. Risk factors for asthma exacerbation and an acute chest syndrome episode are similar, and both can present with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and wheezing. Despite overlapping risk factors and symptoms, an acute exacerbation of asthma or an episode of acute chest syndrome are two distinct entities that need disease-specific management strategies. Although understanding has increased about asthma as a comorbidity in sickle-cell disease and its effects on morbidity, substantial gaps remain in knowledge about best management.

### How would you treat this patient with acute and chronic pain from sickle cell disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^6473b2a4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell disease is prevalent in large numbers of patients in the United States and has a significant global impact. Its complications span numerous organs and lead to reduced life expectancy. Acute and chronic sickle cell pain is a common cause of patient suffering. The American Society of Hematology published updated guidelines on management of acute and chronic pain from sickle cell disease in 2019. Several of the recommendations are conditional and leave specific decisions to the treating physician. These include conditional recommendations about the use of ketamine for acute pain and the initiation and discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. Here, 2 hematologists discuss these guidelines and make contrasting recommendations for the management of acute and chronic pain for a patient with sickle cell disease.

Nonopioid pharmacological therapy for acute sickle cell disease (SCD) pain — For adults and children presenting with acute pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests a short course (5 to 7 days) of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in addition to opioids for acute pain management (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). NSAIDs are defined broadly to include selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, and patient-specific assessment of harms should guide use and drug/class selection; patients at increased risk of renal toxicity should be identified, and if comorbidities confer significant risk, the mild potential benefit may not outweigh the risk. It is good practice to provide patient-centered education and surveillance related to NSAID toxicity, especially in patients with end-organ comorbidities, given limited long-term safety data and potential vascular, bleeding, and renal risks.

Individualized care plans that include effective medications and doses can be embedded in the electronic medical record to guide dosing, and for a minority of patients frequent acute care treatment using individualized opioid dosing may be ineffective or detrimental to long-term care goals, warranting a more chronic care paradigm. Patient preferences should be incorporated into shared decision-making with education on limitations and harms, and adequate clinical infrastructure including appropriate records, communication between facilities, and a multidisciplinary team is needed to create or update care plans.

In remarks, the panel notes that in unique circumstances when all other measures have failed and when shared decision making can be fully applied, a trial of monthly transfusions may be reasonable; decisions should be individualized and informed by patient preference with education and shared decision making around initiation and cessation; IV access and adherence to chelation and erythrocytapheresis can favor monthly transfusions in exceptional circumstances; and cessation can be associated with other SCD complications, so caution, initiation of other disease-modifying therapies, and increased surveillance are important. For adults and children with chronic pain from SCD, the panel makes no recommendation for or against chronic monthly transfusion therapy as an option for pain management.

### Moving toward a multimodal analgesic regimen for acute sickle cell pain with non-opioid analgesic adjuncts: a narrative review [^e9d6f7e7]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Definition of Acute Sickle Cell Pain

While classic VOCs have long been a focus of research and treatment, more recently an expert panel defined three overarching classifications of sickle cell pain: acute, chronic, and acute-on-chronic. Acute SCD pain encompasses not only VOCs but also other forms of acute pain. The core diagnostic criteria for acute SCD pain are defined as
"Diagnosis of SCD as confirmed by laboratory testing.
Reports of increased pain that lasts ≥ 2hours and started in the past 10 days.
Must display ≥ 1 of the following signs: Palpation of region of reported pain elicits pain or tenderness Movement of region of pain elicits focal pain Decreased range of motion or weakness in region of reported pain
Pain is not entirely explained by specific physical examination findings (leg ulcers, priapism…)."

Chronic SCD pain is defined differently and based primarily on pain being present during a majority of days during a 3- to 6-month interval. The prevalence of chronic SCD pain in a four-city cohort of patients presenting with acute SCD pain to either emergency departments (ED) or infusions centers was 68%. Thus, chronic SCD pain often colors the presentation of acute SCD pain. Specifically, VOCs (as part of acute-on-chronic pain) are more frequent among SCD patients with chronic pain.

Admittedly, applying these new definitions to interpret SCD pain raises a misclassification problem. SCD patients may still refer to all SCD pain, acute and chronic, as "crises." It may also be unclear whether, causally, acute SCD pain is a VOC, is an acute exacerbation of otherwise chronic pain or is due to opioid withdrawal or opioid-induced hyperalgesia. The focus of this review will be on acute SCD pain secondary to a VOC.

The majority of SCD pain – whether acute, chronic, or acute-on-chronic – is self-managed at home., However, healthcare utilization for SCD pain presenting as a VOC is highly prevalent among the subset of SCD patients aged 18 to 34 years. In fact, VOCs account for as much as 85% of hospitalizations and readmissions for SCD. In 2016 alone, hospitalizations for SCD accounted for $811.4 million in cost, with a length of stay averaging 5 days.

This recommendation assumes safe administration in a hospital inpatient unit with appropriate expertise; the recommended dose for subanesthetic infusion for acute exacerbation of SCD pain starts at 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg per hour with a maximum of 1 mg/kg per hour, and there is no standardized definition of refractory, leaving determination to the patient or clinician's discretion.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^38caa616]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Limitations of these guidelines — evidence base and applicability: certainty of evidence was often low or very low with very limited direct evidence in individuals with sickle cell disease, typically from small, noncomparative studies and with a significant lack of phase 3 randomized controlled trials. Due to this paucity, the panel turned to indirect evidence. Pediatric evidence was frequently low, very low, or uncertain, limiting the ability to make recommendations and underscoring the need for pediatric-specific investigations. Recognition of chronic pain as a distinct entity in sickle cell disease is recent, the evidence base was not expansive, and distinguishing acute from chronic outcomes was often difficult. Because self-report is the gold standard of pain assessment, standardized self-report assessments and outcomes are imperative; variability in study outcomes hindered pooling and led the panel to call for validated, agreed-upon end points for sickle cell disease pain to enable comparisons of efficacy and effectiveness. The panel also notes that the prioritized questions addressed may not constitute the full list of clinically important questions.

### Current issues in sickle cell pain and its management [^55af676b]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

Pain is the insignia of sickle cell disease and the acute painful crisis is the number-one cause of hospital admissions. Tissue damage due to vaso-occlusion releases numerous inflammatory mediators that initiate the transmission of painful stimuli and the perception of pain. The acute sickle cell painful crisis evolves along four distinct phases coupled with changes in certain markers of the disease. Hospital readmission within 1 week occurs in about 16% of discharged patients. Failure to treat acute pain aggressively may lead to chronic pain syndrome. Management of sickle pain is primarily pharmacologic in nature, and opioids are the analgesics used most often. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of opioids explain individual differences among patients and justify the use of individualized treatment plans.

### Antibiotics for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease [^d436616a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical presentation of acute chest syndrome is similar whether due to infectious or non-infectious causes, thus antibiotics are usually prescribed to treat all episodes. Many different pathogens, including bacteria, have been implicated as causative agents of acute chest syndrome. There is no standardized approach to antibiotic therapy and treatment is likely to vary from country to country. Thus, there is a need to identify the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome.

Objectives

To determine whether an empirical antibiotic treatment approach (used alone or in combination): 1. is effective for acute chest syndrome compared to placebo or standard treatment; 2. is safe for acute chest syndrome compared to placebo or standard treatment; Further objectives are to determine whether there are important variations in efficacy and safety: 3. for different treatment regimens, 4. by participant age, or geographical location of the clinical trials.

Search Methods

We searched The Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched the LILACS database (1982 to 19 October 2012), African Index Medicus (1982 to 3 November 2012). and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal (19 October 2012). Date of most recent search of the Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 29 October 2012.

Selection Criteria

We searched for published or unpublished randomised controlled trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Each author intended to independently extract data and assess trial quality by standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies, but no eligible randomised controlled trials were identified.

Main Results

For this update, we were unable to find any randomised controlled trials on antibiotic treatment approaches for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.

Authors' Conclusions

This update was unable to identify randomised controlled trials on efficacy and safety of the antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome. Randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the optimum antibiotic treatment for this condition.

### National alliance of sickle cell centers consensus recommendations on sickle cell disease health maintenance: a consensus statement [^fd883635]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The most common inherited blood disorder in the world, sickle cell disease (SCD) is a known global health concern. While survival of children into adulthood has improved significantly over the last few decades in high-resource countries, substantial gaps in care standards and limited practice harmonization persist.

Objective

To provide up-to-date recommendations for preventive care and treatment of all people living with SCD and its related comorbidities.

Evidence Review

As part of the National Alliance of Sickle Cell Centers (NASCC), 41 pediatric and adult sickle cell disease experts developed consensus standards and recommendations based on available evidence and expert consensus garnered during an in-depth review of the literature. For these recommendations, there were 3 separate consensus panels (0–2 years, 2–18 years, and > 18 years]) held in 2022. The initial expert panels included representation from 41 NASCC-recognized SCD centers (during the first 2 votes) and the third and final vote in 2023 included representatives from 81 NASCC-recognized centers. The primary focus was on: (1) preventative care including screening recommendations, (2) management of acute complications, and (3) treatment options.

Findings

In this modified Delphi consensus statement, the experts developed consensus standards and recommendations for the clinical care of people living with SCD throughout the lifespan, as well as identified gaps in current evidence that need additional research. Standards and recommendations included routine screening and education, management of acute complications, as well as disease-modifying treatments such as hydroxyurea.

Conclusions and Relevance

People with SCD require coordinated and consistent care starting soon after birth in an SCD center and throughout their lives; SCD is a chronic condition with a highly heterogenous phenotype necessitating lifelong care through an SCD center in collaboration with clinicians in multiple areas of medicine including primary care. Future work should prioritize the management of timing of initiation and precision use of disease-modifying therapies, infection management and prevention, and discussion on transformative therapies.

### Pharmacological interventions for painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in adults [^013d343e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders of haemoglobin (Hb) structure in a person who has inherited two mutant globin genes (one from each parent), at least one of which is always the sickle mutation. It is estimated that between 5% and 7% of the world's population are carriers of the mutant Hb gene, and SCD is the most commonly inherited blood disorder. SCD is characterized by distorted sickle-shaped red blood cells. Manifestations of the disease are attributed to either haemolysis (premature red cell destruction) or vaso-occlusion (obstruction of blood flow, the most common manifestation). Shortened lifespans are attributable to serious comorbidities associated with the disease, including renal failure, acute cholecystitis, pulmonary hypertension, aplastic crisis, pulmonary embolus, stroke, acute chest syndrome, and sepsis. Vaso-occlusion can lead to an acute, painful crisis (sickle cell crisis, vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or vaso-occlusive episode). Pain is most often reported in the joints, extremities, back or chest, but it can occur anywhere and can last for several days or weeks. The bone and muscle pain experienced during a sickle cell crisis is both acute and recurrent. Key pharmacological treatments for VOC include opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics, and combinations of drugs. Non-pharmacological approaches, such as relaxation, hypnosis, heat, ice and acupuncture, have been used in conjunction to rehydrating the patient and reduce the sickling process.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of pharmacological interventions to treat acute painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in adults, in any setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase via Ovid and LILACS, from inception to September 2019. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and searched online clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, controlled, double-blind trials of pharmacological interventions, of any dose and by any route, compared to placebo or any active comparator, for the treatment (not prevention) of painful sickle cell VOC in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods. Our primary outcomes were participant-reported pain relief of 50%, or 30%, or greater; Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) very much improved, or much or very much improved. Our secondary outcomes included adverse events, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events. We assessed GRADE and created three 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included nine studies with data for 638 VOC events and 594 participants aged 17 to 42 years with SCD presenting to a hospital emergency department in a painful VOC. Three studies investigated a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) compared to placebo. One study compared an opioid with a placebo, two studies compared an opioid with an active comparator, two studies compared an anticoagulant with a placebo, and one study compared a combination of three drugs with a combination of four drugs. Risk of bias across the nine studies varied. Studies were primarily at an unclear risk of selection, performance, and detection bias. Studies were primarily at a high risk of bias for size with fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm; two studies had 50 to 199 participants per treatment arm (unclear risk). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) compared with placebo No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30% or greater. The efficacy was uncertain regarding PGIC very much improved, and PGIC much or very much improved (no difference; 1 study, 21 participants; very low-quality evidence). Very low-quality, uncertain results suggested similar rates of adverse events across both the NSAIDs group (16/45 adverse events, 1/56 serious adverse events, and 1/56 withdrawal due to adverse events) and the placebo group (19/45 adverse events, 2/56 serious adverse events, and 1/56 withdrawal due to adverse events). Opioids compared with placebo No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30%, PGIC, or adverse events (any adverse event, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events). Opioids compared with active comparator No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30% or greater. The results were uncertain regarding PGIC very much improved (33% of the opioids group versus 19% of the placebo group). No data were reported regarding PGIC much or very much improved. Very low-quality, uncertain results suggested similar rates of adverse events across both the opioids group (9/66 adverse events, and 0/66 serious adverse events) and the placebo group (7/64 adverse events, 0/66 serious adverse events). No data were reported regarding withdrawal due to adverse events. Quality of the evidence We downgraded the quality of the evidence by three levels to very low-quality because there are too few data to have confidence in results (e.g. too few participants per treatment arm). Where no data were reported for an outcome, we had no evidence to support or refute (quality of the evidence is unknown).

Authors' Conclusions

This review identified only nine studies, with insufficient data for all pharmacological interventions for analysis. The available evidence is very uncertain regarding the efficacy or harm from pharmacological interventions used to treat pain related to sickle cell VOC in adults. This area could benefit most from more high quality, certain evidence, as well as the establishment of suitable registries which record interventions and outcomes for this group of people.

Sickle cell disease pain definitions — Acute pain is defined as "pain that results in an unplanned visit to an acute care setting for treatment," with acute care settings including "ED, day hospital, infusion center, observation unit, acute pain center, or inpatient unit." The panel notes this scope choice because "this definition may not encompass all acute pain that is experienced by individuals, because acute pain is often managed at home." Chronic pain is defined as "reports of ongoing pain present on most days over the past 6 months in either a single location or multiple locations."

### Vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: current paradigm on pain management [^97f1ebd1]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment involves the use of non-opioid analgesics, opioid analgesics, and adjuvants – either singly or in combination – depending on the severity of pain. The basic approach remains the symptomatic treatment of pain with escalating doses of non-opioid and opioid analgesics. However, using non-opioid analgesics during an acute exacerbation of pain may also limit escalation of opioid doses. In addition, modifying the adhesiveness of sickle cells to inflamed endothelium may potentially reduce vaso-occlusive crisis. Nevertheless, careful assessment of painful episodes should precede and follow all the available options for manag ing this type of crisis. The choice, route, dose, and frequency of administration of opioids should depend on the patient's presentation. To achieve effective pain treatment, opioids can either be administered on a fixed schedule or by patient-controlled analgesia. Given the moderate-to-severe nature of the pain usually experienced in vaso-occlusive crisis, opioids form the bedrock of pharmacologic treatment. However, adult patients who receive opioids more frequently for pain exhibit more disruption of their lives, with reduced activity levels and more pessimistic mood. Despite the choice of opioids for acute and chronic pain in SCD, concerns about narcotic addiction continue to pose a barrier to more effective analgesia, although evidence points to lack of addiction. The step 2 analgesics (weak opioid ± non-opioid ± adjuvants) or step 3 analgesics (strong opioid ± non-opioid ± adjuvants) are, nonetheless, applicable in most cases of SCD pain. In benchmarking pain outcomes in children with SCD, results revealed three areas to focus on to achieve improvement: enhanced pain assessment and documentation using valid pain tools; more aggressive multimodal management for peak vaso-occlusive pain; and better education and support for pain management at home. Multimodal analgesia appears to be the prerequisite for effective pain management in SCD. One study on home management of sickle cell pain among pediatric patients suggests that pain relief was substantially better for analgesic combinations than for single analgesics, especially for moderate-to-severe pain. Furthermore, opioid tolerance may develop from frequent emergency department (ED) visits and may constitute one of the several barriers to effective pain management; addressing these barriers to pain management for patients in crisis in the emergency setting may improve the quality of the administered pain management. Several studies have documented the effectiveness of both unimodal and multimodal analgesia with or without adjuvants in crisis-related pains (Table 1).

Recommendation 2a — nonopioid pharmacological therapies for acute sickle cell disease (SCD) pain states that for adults and children with acute pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests a short course (5 to 7 days) of NSAIDs in addition to opioids for acute pain management (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects). Remarks specify that NSAIDs are defined broadly to include selective and nonselective COX inhibitors; that patient-specific assessment of harms, including renal, vascular, and gastrointestinal toxicity, anticoagulation requirements, and cardiovascular disease, will help identify patients who are appropriate for NSAID therapy and tailor the selection of the drug/class of NSAID; and that patients specifically at increased risk of renal toxicity need to be identified and, if comorbidities such as peptic ulcer disease, renal dysfunction, or full-dose anticoagulation are significant risk factors, the mild potential benefit may not outweigh the risk.

### Antibiotics for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease [^c33b82ea]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical presentation of acute chest syndrome is similar whether due to infectious or non-infectious causes, thus antibiotics are usually prescribed to treat all episodes. Many different bacteria have been implicated as causative agents of acute chest syndrome. There is no standardized approach to antibiotic therapy and treatment is likely to vary from country to country. Thus, there is a need to identify the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome.

Objectives

To determine whether an empirical antibiotic treatment approach (used either alone or in combination): (a) is effective in treating acute chest syndrome compared to placebo or standard treatment; (b) is safe in treating acute chest syndrome compared to placebo or standard treatment; (c) differs dependent on the regimen used in treating acute chest syndrome differ from each other with respect to efficacy and safety; and (d) varies between different age groups, regions or countries with respect to efficacy and safety.

Search Strategy

We searched The Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched the LILACS database (1982 to May 2006) and the website: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (May 2006). Date of most recent search of the Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: February 2007.

Selection Criteria

We searched for published or unpublished randomised controlled trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Each author intended to independently extract data and assess trial quality by standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies, but no eligible randomized controlled trials were identified.

Main Results

We were unable to find any randomised controlled trials on antibiotic treatment approaches for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.

Authors' Conclusions

We were unable to identify randomised controlled trials on efficacy and safety of the antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome. Randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the optimum antibiotic treatment for this condition.

Chronic transfusion therapy — chronic pain in sickle cell disease: The panel did not identify any direct evidence that addressed this question and concluded that indirect evidence was not applicable, and because of the absence of evidence for chronic pain, a recommendation for or against the use of chronic transfusion therapy could not be made. The harms and burden of chronic transfusion therapy for chronic pain are similar to those previously outlined when the therapy is used for other indications, and given the high prevalence and impact of chronic pain, investigations that address how chronic transfusion therapy affects chronic pain should be prioritized.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^5da5fc11]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease acute pain — continuous basal opioid infusion in addition to on-demand opioids with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has no direct evidence of benefit or harm in hospitalized individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Therefore, the panel concluded that the benefit of basal opioid infusion in addition to on-demand opioids as a treatment of acute SCD pain is largely unknown, and indirect evidence reviewed above suggests an increased risk of respiratory depression but was derived primarily from postoperative surgical patients who were likely opioid naive, making the data less relevant to SCD. Ultimately, because the risk for harm has not been studied in patients with SCD and no studies have investigated the benefit, a recommendation in either direction could not be made, and the panel has put forth a nonrecommendation for this question. The panel also noted no important uncertainty about patient values, with patients placing significant importance on pain relief and improved functioning with fewer negative adverse effects and risks for harm.

### Fluid replacement therapy for acute episodes of pain in people with sickle cell disease [^bd266e40]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Treating vaso-occlusive painful crises in people with sickle cell disease is complex and requires multiple interventions. Extra fluids are routinely given as adjunct treatment, regardless of the individual's state of hydration with the aim of slowing or stopping the sickling process and thereby alleviating pain. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To determine the optimal route, quantity and type of fluid replacement for people with sickle cell disease with acute painful crises.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also conducted searches of Embase (November 2007), LILACS, www. ClinicalTrials.gov (05 January 2010), and the WHO ICTRP (30 June 2017). Date of most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 16 February 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the administration of supplemental fluids adjunctive to analgesics by any route in people with any type of sickle cell disease during an acute painful episode, under medical supervision (inpatient, day care or community).

Data Collection and Analysis

No relevant trials have yet been identified.

Main Results

Sixteen trials were identified by the searches, all of which were not eligible for inclusion in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating vaso-occlusive crises is complex and requires multiple interventions. Extra fluids, generally oral or intravenous, are routinely administered during acute painful episodes to people with sickle cell disease regardless of the individual's state of hydration. Reports of their use during these acute painful episodes do not state the efficacy of any single route, type or quantity of fluid compared to another. However, there are no randomised controlled trials that have assessed the safety and efficacy of different routes, types or quantities of fluid. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing the efficacy and possible adverse effects of different routes, types and quantities of fluid administered to people with sickle cell disease during acute painful episodes.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) acute pain — non–emergency department (ED) SCD-specific hospital-based acute care facility definition, evidence, and recommendation: A non-ED treatment center is defined as "an SCD-specific hospital-based acute care facility (ie, day hospital, infusion center)," and "the key driver of this definition is hospital based to ensure access to higher levels of care if needed to minimize harms," with sites that "should have ready access to the main ED or other areas of the hospital with acute care expertise (eg, intensive care unit)." A systematic review "identified 9 studies" showing benefits including "decreased need for hospital admissions with a non-ED treatment center," "overall decrease in pain intensity with non-ED treatment center," "decreased time to first dose of opioid with a non-ED treatment center," and a "lower rate of ED visits within 48 hours from discharge from a non-ED treatment center," although "there were no studies identified that addressed many of the a priori-defined patient-centered outcomes, including HRQOL, satisfaction with care, and missed days of school or work." The panel "felt strongly that hospital-based acute care facilities were preferable and important (vs free-standing, off-site facilities)" and stated "avoiding ED visits is preferable when possible," but "there were only observational data and a lack of data derived from experimental designs, which led to the downgrading of the recommendation to conditional."

### Emergency medicine management of sickle cell disease complications: an evidence-based update [^b90b0d14]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States. Due to alterations in the structural conformation of hemoglobin molecules under deoxygenated conditions, patients with SCD are predisposed to numerous sequelae, many of which require acute intervention.

Objective

Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an evidence-based update regarding the diagnosis and management of SCD complications.

Discussion

SCD patients experience significant morbidity and mortality secondary to cerebrovascular accident, acute chest syndrome, acute vaso-occlusive pain crises, SCD-related multi-organ failure, cholecystitis, acute intrahepatic cholestasis, acute sickle hepatic crisis, acute hepatic sequestration, priapism, and renal disease. Emergency physicians must recognize acute manifestations of SCD in order to deliver timely management and determine patient disposition.

Conclusions

A comprehensive review of the emergency department management of acute SCD complications is provided. Comprehensive understanding of these aspects of SCD can assist physicians in expediting patient evaluation and treatment, thus decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with this hemoglobinopathy.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^9ddfebcb]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology sickle cell disease pain guidelines — scope and sources of evidence: the panel made new recommendations for chronic pain management including more extensive evaluation of nonopioid pharmacological therapy, nonpharmacological and integrative therapies, and a tailored approach to chronic opioid therapy that balances benefit and harms. The panel noted chronic transfusion for pain management is a widespread practice with potential risk, harm, and morbidity and identified the need to evaluate evidence and make a recommendation on its role in recurrent acute and chronic pain. The guideline development leveraged extensive indirect evidence from pain-related disorders other than sickle cell disease, including recommendations that used nonopioid pharmacological therapy such as SNRIs and TCAs and the use of regional anesthesia for acute pain. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clarified that its opioid prescribing guideline was not intended to apply to patients with sickle cell disease, and the guidelines put forth a patient-centered individualized approach for the use of chronic opioid therapy in sickle cell disease that balances benefits and harms.

### Management of acute sickle cell disease pain [^0a233a4f]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Pain is a common complication of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell pain can often be effectively managed by pediatricians in outpatient and hospital settings. Acute pain management should be initiated quickly. Patients need to be evaluated for sickle cell complications and other causes of pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids are the mainstay of pain treatment, but additional therapies include hydration, local pain control, muscle relaxants, and nonpharmacologic approaches. Healthy lifestyle habits and good behavioral and mental health are important for preventing and coping with sickle cell disease pain. Disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea, can help prevent sickle hemoglobin polymerization and acute pain episodes. Because sickle cell disease largely affects people who are racialized minorities in the United States, health-care providers need to be aware of how their own personal biases may affect care of these patients.

### Moving toward a multimodal analgesic regimen for acute sickle cell pain with non-opioid analgesic adjuncts: a narrative review [^5498934a]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy with potential life-threatening complications that affect millions of people worldwide. Severe and disabling acute pain, referred to as a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), is a fundamental symptom of the disease and the primary driver for acute care visits and hospitalizations. Despite the publication of guidelines for VOC management over the past decade, management of VOCs remains unsatisfactory for patients and providers.

Recent Findings

Acute SCD pain includes pain secondary to VOCs and other forms of acute pain. Distinguishing VOC from non-VOC pain may be challenging for both patients and clinicians. Further, although opioids have been the gold-standard for VOC pain management for decades, the current highest standard of care for all acute pain is a multimodal approach that is less dependent on opioids, and, instead incorporates analgesics and adjuvants from different mechanistic pathways. In this narrative review, we focus on a multimodal pharmacologic approach for acute SCD pain management and explore the evidence for existing non-opioid pharmacological adjuncts. Moreover, we present an explanatory model of pain, which is not only novel in its application to SCD pain but also captures the multidimensional nature of the SCD pain experience and supports the need for such a multimodal approach. This model also highlights opportunities for new investigative and therapeutic targets – both pharmacological and non-pharmacological.

Summary

Multimodal pain regimens that are less dependent on opioids are urgently needed to improve acute pain outcomes for individuals with SCD. The proposed explanatory model for SCD pain offers novel opportunities to improve acute pain management for SCD patients.

### The modern use of hydroxyurea for children with sickle cell anemia [^02aa4b78]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment with hydroxyurea

Indications

The natural history of SCA is well-documented as a lifelong, severe disease characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, recurrent acute complications, progressive multiorgan damage, and early mortality. While there is variation in disease expression, some of which can be explained by genetic modifiers (e.g. polymorphisms affecting HbF expression, α-thalassemia, and others), the great majority of patients suffer from recurrent acute clinical complications and almost all will die from consequences of their disease. Accordingly, the indication for treatment of SCA with hydroxyurea should be the disease itself, just as it is for other severe, life-threatening, but treatable chronic diseases.

The occurrence of disease manifestations, such as painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, or stroke, should not be a prerequisite for starting hydroxyurea therapy. Such overt complications represent only a fraction of the morbidity of SCA, and the best therapeutic opportunity is lost by waiting until the frequency and severity of these events prompt treatment. Chronic organ injury begins in the first few months of life and accumulates thereafter, even if a first "crisis" has not yet manifest clinically or has occurred only occasionally. Once progressive organ injury becomes clinically apparent, in the course of waiting for overt disease manifestations, crucial opportunities for prevention and protection have been lost. Treatment of SCA should not be predicated on the occurrence of an arbitrary number or type of overt clinical events. As an analogy, one does not wait to treat a patient with diabetes mellitus until the first occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis; rather, treatment is initiated before such events, when possible, to prevent or mitigate them and the host of other manifestations of chronic organ damage associated with diabetes. We know the natural history of this disease, and people with SCA should no longer be destined to live and experience that suffering.

National Alliance of Sickle Cell Centers sickle cell disease (SCD) health maintenance consensus — panel composition, process, and scope: As part of the National Alliance of Sickle Cell Centers (NASCC), a panel of 41 pediatric and adult SCD experts developed consensus standards and recommendations through 3 separate consensus panels (0–2 years, 2–18 years, and > 18 years) held in 2022, with initial expert panels representing 41 NASCC-recognized SCD centers during the first 2 votes and a third and final vote in 2023 that included representatives from 81 NASCC-recognized centers, focused on (1) preventative care including screening recommendations, (2) management of acute complications, and (3) treatment options. In this modified Delphi consensus statement, the experts developed consensus standards and recommendations for clinical care throughout the lifespan, including routine screening and education, management of acute complications, and disease-modifying treatments such as hydroxyurea.

### Acute complications of sickle cell disease in children [^8d6e6c03]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2001). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is a recessively inherited condition in which synthesis of haemoglobin is abnormal. The disease, which occurs mainly in people of African, African-Caribbean, Indian, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent, is characterised by chronic anaemia, susceptibility to infection, bouts of severe pain and organ dysfunction. While the life expectancy for patients has improved, from a median survival age of 14 years in the 1970s among those homozygous for the sickle haemoglobin gene to survival into the mid-40s, childhood remains a period of peak mortality and morbidity. Here, we discuss the acute complications of sickle cell disease in children, concentrating on the management of the acutely unwell child.

### Red cell exchange in sickle cell disease [^49de0de1]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

Red cell exchange transfusions remain an effective but possibly underutilized therapy in the acute and chronic treatment of sickle cell disease. In sickle cell disease, increased blood viscosity can cause complications when the hemoglobin exceeds 10 g/dL even if this is due to simple transfusion. Red cell exchange can provide needed oxygen carrying capacity while reducing the overall viscosity of blood. Acute red cell exchange is useful in acute infarctive stroke, in acute chest and the multi-organ failure syndromes, the right upper quadrant syndrome, and possibly priapism. Neither simple or exchange transfusions are likely to hasten resolution of an acute pain episode.

### An evidence-based approach to the treatment of adults with sickle cell disease [^7e70c37f]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

The application of evidence-based medicine to the management of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) is currently primarily driven by clinical expertise and patient preference, as there is a paucity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to guide decision-making. A summary of SCD management principles in the areas of health care maintenance, transfusion therapy, treatment and prevention of painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, stroke, renal disease, contraception and pregnancy, and priapism is predominantly based on the authors' interpretation of available observational studies as well as the opinions of experts in SCD. RCTs impacting current practices address use of hydroxyurea to prevent painful episodes and acute chest syndrome, intensity of pre-operative transfusion, transfusion during pregnancy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for proteinuria, but most issues in adult SCD care have not been rigorously studied and management may not be appropriately extrapolated from pediatric data. While challenging clinical problems need to be addressed by RCTs, there is also the need for development of practice guidelines using formal methodological strategies. This brief review is not a substitute for the process but provides a literature-based approach to making treatment decisions when caring for adults with SCD.

### Red cell transfusion and alloimmunization in sickle cell disease [^f2879327]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute chest syndrome

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is one of the most common complications of SCD and is a leading cause of hospitalization and death. ACS is defined as a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiograph in the presence of respiratory symptoms, hypoxia, chest pain, or fever. Episodes can be triggered by infection, fat embolism, atelectasis, and infarction. The clinical course and spectrum of the disease are variable. While studies defining standardized criteria to assess ACS severity are lacking, patients with significant hypoxia or rapidly declining hemoglobin are considered to have severe disease.

Simple transfusion provided early in the course of moderate ACS often prevents progression of the disease and the need for RCE. The ASH 2020 guidelines recognized the paucity of large-scale studies but suggest RCE over simple transfusion for patients with severe ACS, rapidly progressive ACS, or ACS in patients with high baseline hemoglobin.

Recurrent episodes of ACS can lead to chronic lung disease including pulmonary hypertension and fibrosis. Hydroxyurea is the primary treatment for prevention of recurrent ACS. Analysis of patients in the STOP trial showed a significantly decreased incidence of ACS in the chronic transfusion arm, and small studies suggest it may reduce frequency of ACS recurrence but not severity. Chronic transfusion therapy can be considered in patients with recurrent ACS when hydroxyurea is not well tolerated or when hydroxyurea is insufficient to prevent severe, recurrent ACS.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^f09061cb]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease pain management — interpretation of strong versus conditional recommendations is outlined for key stakeholders as follows: For patients under a strong recommendation, "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not," whereas under a conditional recommendation "A majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences." For clinicians under a strong recommendation, "Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences," while under a conditional recommendation clinicians should "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences." For policymakers, a strong recommendation means "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator," whereas a conditional recommendation means "Policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess if decision making is appropriate." For researchers, a strong recommendation indicates "The recommendation is supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation. On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence. In such instances, further research may provide important information that alters the recommendation," while a conditional recommendation indicates "The recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research. An evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determine the conditional (rather than strong) recommendation will help identify possible research gaps."

Sickle cell disease–specific hospital-based acute care facilities — Recommendation 4 states that for adults and children who develop acute pain episodes requiring hospital care, the guideline panel suggests using SCD-specific hospital-based acute care facilities (eg, day hospitals or ED-based observation units) over regular emergency department (ED) care to provide rapid, effective, and safe acute pain management, as a conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects (⊕⊕◯◯). Remarks add that this recommendation assumes readily available code team coverage, that more detailed cost analyses may be warranted and such facilities tend to be cost effective to the extent that they reduce ED visits and admissions although overall acute care utilization may increase, and that most evidence comes from complex SCD comprehensive care models in which > 1 intervention is likely driving improvement and continuity.

### Inhaled bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease [^68d242a2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchodilators are used to treat bronchial hyper-responsiveness in asthma. Bronchial hyper-responsiveness may be a component of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. Therefore, bronchodilators may be useful in the treatment of acute chest syndrome. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.

Objectives

The aim of the review is to determine whether the use of inhaled, short-acting bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome reduces morbidity and mortality in people with sickle cell disease and to assess whether this treatment causes adverse effects.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional searches were carried out on MEDLINE (1966 to 2004) and Embase (1981 to 2004) and ongoing trial registries (28 September 2022). Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 25 July 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials. Trials using quasi-randomisation methods will be included in future updates of this review if there is sufficient evidence that the treatment and control groups are similar at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

We found no trials investigating the use of bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.

Main Results

We found no trials investigating the use of bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.

Authors' Conclusions

If bronchial hyper-responsiveness is an important component of some episodes of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease, the use of inhaled bronchodilators may be indicated. There is need for a well-designed, adequately-powered randomised controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of the addition of inhaled bronchodilators to established therapies for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.

ASH Clinical Practice Guidelines on Sickle Cell Disease In 2016, the American Society of Hematology initiated an effort to develop clinical practice guidelines on Sickle Cell Disease. ASH formed a committee of medical experts, researchers and patients to review evidence and form recommendations on SCD. The recommendations address treatment of both adult and pediatric SCD. Available Guidelines
- Cardiopulmonary and Kidney Disease
- Transfusion Support
- Cerebrovascular Disease
- Management of Acute and Chronic Pain
- Stem Cell Transplantation. Health Supervision for Children with Sickle Cell Disease From the American Academy of Pediatrics, 2011. This statement provides pediatricians in primary care and subspecialty practice with an overview of the genetics, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of SCD. Specialized comprehensive medical care decreases morbidity and mortality during childhood.

The provision of comprehensive care is a time-intensive endeavor that includes ongoing patient and family education, periodic comprehensive evaluations and other disease-specific health maintenance services, psychosocial care, and genetic counseling. Timely and appropriate treatment of acute illness is critical, because life-threatening complications develop rapidly. It is essential that every child with SCD receive comprehensive care that is coordinated through a medical home with appropriate expertise.
- Penicillin prophylaxis prevents pneumococcal sepsis in children
- Pneumococcal vaccine prevents pneumococcal infection in children
- In surgical settings, simple transfusions to increase hemoglobin levels to 10 g/dL are as good as or safer than aggressive transfusions to reduce sickle hemoglobin levels to below 30 percent.
- Transfusions to maintain a hematocrit of more than 36 percent do not reduce complications of pregnancy
- Transfusions to reduce Hb S levels to below 30 percent prevent strokes in children with high central nervous system blood flow
- Hydroxyurea decreases crises in patients with severe sickle cell disease Read more about these practice guidelines ». Problem Oriented Clinical Guidelines From the Sickle Cell Information Center, 1991 These protocols are guidelines in use at the Sickle Cell Center at Grady Health System, and they are intended for use by heath care providers treating patients with sickle cell syndromes. These guidelines supplement to current texts in general medicine, surgery and pediatrics. These guidelines address more than 40 specific issues, such as abdominal pain, congestive heart failure, and infections.

ASH 2020 sickle cell disease (SCD) pain guideline — initiation of chronic opioid therapy (COT): It is good practice to deliver patient-centered education regarding the potential to develop chronic pain and the nonopioid pain treatment options that are outlined in recommendations 6, 7, and 8. For adults and children with SCD and emerging and/or recently developed chronic pain, the ASH guideline panel suggests against the initiation of COT unless pain is refractory to multiple other treatment modalities (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects). Remarks emphasize optimization of SCD management, that in those whose pain has been refractory to multiple other interventions, COT should be considered after risk stratification using a validated tool, documentation of failure criteria and a plan for opioid cessation before initiation, and that the lowest effective opioid dose should be prescribed. Additional safety notes include avoiding benzodiazepines, sedating medications, and alcohol; that patients on doses of > 120 mg of morphine milligram equivalents (MME) are at risk for hormonal alterations; and that doses > 100 mg of MME are associated with an increase in risk of overdose compared with doses < 20 mg of MME in other non-SCD pain populations. Providers should be aware that frequent episodic pain can lead to unintentional COT and should make efforts to reduce or eliminate scheduled opioid doses between acute episodic pain events, with documentation of goals of care in the medical record.

Importance

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening genetic disorder affecting nearly 100,000 individuals in the United States and is associated with many acute and chronic complications requiring immediate medical attention. Two disease-modifying therapies, hydroxyurea and long-term blood transfusions, are available but underused.

Objective

To support and expand the number of health professionals able and willing to provide care for persons with SCD.

Evidence Review

Databases of MEDLINE (including in-process and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, TOXLINE, and Scopus were searched using prespecified search terms and keywords to identify randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Literature searches of English-language publications from 1980 with updates through April 1, 2014, addressed key questions developed by the expert panel members and methodologists.

Findings

Strong recommendations for preventive services include daily oral prophylactic penicillin up to the age of 5 years, annual transcranial Doppler examinations from the ages of 2 to 16 years in those with sickle cell anemia, and long-term transfusion therapy to prevent stroke in those children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity (≥ 200 cm/s). Strong recommendations addressing acute complications include rapid initiation of opioids for treatment of severe pain associated with a vasoocclusive crisis, and use of incentive spirometry in patients hospitalized for a vasoocclusive crisis. Strong recommendations for chronic complications include use of analgesics and physical therapy for treatment of avascular necrosis, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for microalbuminuria in adults with SCD. Strong recommendations for children and adults with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy include referral to expert specialists for consideration of laser photocoagulation and for echocardiography to evaluate signs of pulmonary hypertension. Hydroxyurea therapy is strongly recommended for adults with 3 or more severe vasoocclusive crises during any 12-month period, with SCD pain or chronic anemia interfering with daily activities, or with severe or recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome. A recommendation of moderate strength suggests offering treatment with hydroxyurea without regard to the presence of symptoms for infants, children, and adolescents. In persons with sickle cell anemia, preoperative transfusion therapy to increase hemoglobin levels to 10 g/dL is strongly recommended with a moderate strength recommendation to maintain sickle hemoglobin levels of less than 30% prior to the next transfusion during long-term transfusion therapy. A strong recommendation to assess iron overload is accompanied by a moderate strength recommendation to begin iron chelation therapy when indicated.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hydroxyurea and transfusion therapy are strongly recommended for many individuals with SCD. Many other recommendations are based on quality of evidence that is less than high due to the paucity of clinical trials regarding screening, management, and monitoring for individuals with SCD.

### Incidence and risk factors of pain crisis after hematopoietic cell transplantation for sickle cell disease [^ef886040]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge that studies to date have been unable to clearly distinguish these painful episodes as pain crisis or as acute exacerbations of persistent chronic pain after HCT. In this study we report the pain episodes as pain crises, because they were reported as such to the CIBMTR. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the pain episodes in these patients were treated differently after HCT as compared with when they presented with pain crises before HCT. To our knowledge, no qualitative studies have been performed to understand the patient perspective on whether their pain was typical of acute pain crisis. Even such qualitative studies may not distinguish the pain of acute pain crisis from that of acute exacerbation of chronic pain, especially because a high proportion of adults with SCD have mixed-type chronic pain. Therefore, we recommend that it may be best to term these episodes as persistent pain after HCT without characterizing them as VOC but as pain crisis. That some proportion of patients continue to have pain crisis despite successful establishment of donor-derived erythropoiesis and elimination of sickling of red blood cells, suggests that other etiologies of pain in SCD may be contributing and may follow a different trajectory. We recommend that patients with SCD experiencing post-HCT pain crisis receive comprehensive evaluation and multidisciplinary management of their complex pain syndromes. We also recommend that future studies prospectively study the characteristics of pain, its treatment, and outcomes after HCT in granular detail to understand the nature and potential underlying mechanisms.
