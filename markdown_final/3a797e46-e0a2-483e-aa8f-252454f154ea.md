## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs/SSRIs) are used for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), including their efficacy, dosing strategies, safety, and how to apply guidelines and alternatives in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic context and why SRIs are mechanistically plausible. Then, I should verify the strength of efficacy evidence and quantify effect sizes. Next, I will compare continuous versus intermittent dosing regimens and reconcile conflicting data. After that, I need to review safety, tolerability, and discontinuation considerations. Finally, I will align with guidelines, consider alternatives for nonresponders, and outline a practical, patient-centered algorithm with monitoring and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanism. PMDD is defined by severe mood and physical symptoms confined to the luteal phase with rapid remission after menses; prospective daily ratings over at least two cycles are required to establish the diagnosis and distinguish it from premenstrual exacerbation of mood disorders, which is a different entity with different treatment implications [^117Am64w] [^114FMo2W]. Hold on, I should verify the mechanistic rationale for SRIs: PMDD is linked to altered serotonergic neurotransmission and neurosteroid sensitivity (notably to allopregnanolone), and SRIs show a faster onset in PMDD than in depression, consistent with a distinct pathophysiology and treatment response profile [^112WWYwJ] [^113fy92Z].

> Next, I should review the efficacy evidence and quantify benefits. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently show SRIs reduce premenstrual symptoms with moderate effect sizes. The 2024 Cochrane review reports a standardized mean difference around −0.57 for overall symptoms versus placebo, with response rates commonly in the 50–70% range across agents such as sertraline, fluoxetine, and paroxetine [^113Ued93] [^111TZLXF] [^113PaQmU]. Wait, let me verify onset: symptom improvement can begin within 48–72 hours in some studies, which is clinically meaningful for luteal-phase strategies, and FDA-labeled trials of sertraline demonstrate superiority over placebo with both continuous and luteal-phase dosing over three cycles [^11212o9H] [^114zk93G].

> I will now examine dosing strategies, but I need to reconcile conflicting data. Continuous daily dosing has long been standard and shows robust efficacy; the 2024 Cochrane review suggests continuous dosing may be modestly more effective than luteal-phase dosing, with SMDs around −0.69 vs −0.39, respectively [^113Ued93]. However, wait, let me verify head-to-head comparisons: randomized trials and meta-analyses directly comparing intermittent versus continuous dosing generally find no statistically significant differences in response, dropout, or symptom change, supporting the clinical acceptability of intermittent strategies, albeit with moderate-to-high risk of bias in some studies [^113cejK8] [^117RBkFW]. Hold on, I should also consider symptom-onset dosing: a large RCT of sertraline initiated at symptom onset showed mixed results on the primary scale but significant benefits on secondary measures and response rates, and abrupt cessation in that trial did not precipitate withdrawal symptoms, which is reassuring for short-course strategies [^113PaQmU] [^115Aoszu].

> Let me think about practical dosing specifics and titration. For sertraline, starting at 50 mg/day is reasonable; for continuous dosing, titration up to 150 mg/day is supported, whereas for luteal-phase dosing, titration up to 100 mg/day is typical, with a 3-day lead-in at 50 mg when increasing to 100 mg to mitigate side effects; symptom-onset dosing has been studied in the 50–100 mg range, typically stopping at menses onset [^114GMRvA] [^1173rqaF]. I should double-check other agents: fluoxetine 20 mg/day is effective in luteal-phase regimens, and paroxetine controlled-release 12.5–25 mg/day has supportive data for both continuous and luteal-phase use, aligning with FDA labeling for PMDD indications [^112SULbs] [^111Js4QB].

> Now, I need to ensure safety and tolerability are addressed transparently. Common adverse effects include nausea, insomnia or somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, sweating, dry mouth, and sexual dysfunction. These are dose-related and often transient, but they drive discontinuation in a meaningful minority, so counseling and dose adjustments are key [^113Ued93]. Wait, let me verify discontinuation concerns: abrupt cessation after short luteal-phase courses has not been associated with withdrawal in RCTs, and RCOG advises tapering when SSRIs are used continuously to mitigate withdrawal risk, which is a practical distinction to communicate to patients [^115uRmTz] [^112N8vZt]. I should confirm monitoring: screen for suicidality, bipolar disorder, and drug interactions before initiation, and reassess each cycle for efficacy and tolerability, adjusting dose or switching agents if needed [^115ipPdm].

> Next, I should review guideline alignment to anchor practice. ACOG recommends offering SSRIs as first-line for affective premenstrual symptoms, and AAFP similarly recommends SSRIs as first-line for PMS/PMDD. RCOG supports offering either continuous or luteal-phase SSRIs, with attention to adverse effects and patient preference [^112qDeSJ] [^114kv7B1] [^117RFsjd]. Hold on, I should verify the nuance: guidelines emphasize shared decision-making given similar efficacy across dosing strategies and the trade-offs between convenience, side effects, and withdrawal risk with continuous use [^113cejK8] [^117RFsjd] [^112N8vZt].

> I will now consider alternatives and adjuncts for partial or nonresponse. Combined oral contraceptives, particularly formulations with drospirenone and a shortened hormone-free interval, can improve premenstrual symptoms and are reasonable when contraception is desired, though benefits are modest and side effects can limit adherence [^113XcVwP]. But wait, what if symptoms are refractory? GnRH agonists with add-back therapy are effective for severe, treatment-resistant cases, yet menopausal side effects and bone health risks necessitate careful selection, time-limited use, and add-back planning; practical guidance exists to support implementation in non-gynecology settings [^111a1Jvh] [^1135PF4R]. I should also note that nonpharmacologic options like CBT, exercise, and calcium may help some patients, though effect sizes are generally smaller than with SRIs, and open-label placebo interventions have shown large symptom reductions in PMS, suggesting expectation and ritual may meaningfully modulate symptoms in select patients [^117Am64w] [^116zwTiV].

> Let me synthesize a practical, patient-centered algorithm and double-check it against the evidence. Start with prospective daily ratings to confirm PMDD and establish baseline severity. Initiate an SSRI such as sertraline 50 mg/day, choosing continuous dosing for severe or persistent symptoms or luteal-phase dosing for predictable, time-limited symptoms. Consider symptom-onset dosing for patients who can reliably identify onset, recognizing mixed primary outcomes but supportive secondary measures. Titrate every cycle based on response and tolerability to 100–150 mg for continuous or 50–100 mg for luteal-phase strategies. Reassess after 2–3 cycles and switch to another SSRI or SNRI (e.g., venlafaxine) if inadequate response. If two adequate SSRI/SNRI trials fail, consider ovulation suppression with a drospirenone-containing COC or refer for GnRH agonist with add-back. Throughout, counsel on side effects, discontinuation planning, and the possibility of relapse after cessation, which can occur within the first cycle off therapy [^117Am64w] [^112FXsjB] [^112qDeSJ] [^114bj4nQ] [^113XcVwP].

> Finally, I should confirm special situations and documentation needs. For adolescents, the same diagnostic principles apply and SSRIs can be effective when carefully monitored. For women planning pregnancy, discuss tapering and safer alternatives during conception and early gestation. And for those with comorbid mood disorders, distinguish PME from PMDD because treatments that target ovarian suppression or neurosteroid pathways in PMDD may not benefit PME, which often requires optimization of the underlying mood disorder treatment rather than intermittent SRI strategies [^116iH4ri] [^113CfKLY] [^114FMo2W]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: always re-evaluate the diagnosis if symptoms persist throughout the cycle or fail to respond to evidence-based therapy, as misclassification and comorbid conditions are common and alter management substantially [^117Am64w].

---

SSRIs are **first-line pharmacotherapy** for PMDD [^117Am64w], with **rapid onset** (within days) [^112jqnMa] and robust efficacy across mood, physical, and functional symptoms [^111wxhmQ]. Continuous dosing is **more effective than luteal-phase dosing** [^113Ued93], but both are superior to placebo [^111wxhmQ]; symptom-onset dosing is less effective than continuous or luteal-phase regimens [^notfound]. Common adverse effects include nausea, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction [^113Ued93]; **no significant withdrawal symptoms** have been observed with intermittent use [^113PaQmU] [^115uRmTz]. SSRIs are recommended by ACOG and RCOG as first-line therapy [^117RFsjd], with sertraline, fluoxetine, and paroxetine supported by strong evidence [^113Ued93] [^111Js4QB].

---

## Mechanism of action

SSRIs increase synaptic serotonin, which **rapidly improves mood, anxiety, and irritability** in PMDD [^112jqnMa]. Unlike depression, PMDD responds within days, consistent with a distinct neurobiology involving altered serotonergic neurotransmission and neurosteroid sensitivity (e.g. allopregnanolone) [^112WWYwJ] [^11212o9H].

---

## Clinical efficacy

SSRIs are **highly effective** for PMDD, with moderate-to-large effect sizes and rapid onset [^113Ued93] [^112jqnMa]:

- **Continuous dosing**: More effective than placebo; SMD ≈ −0.69 [^113Ued93].
- **Luteal-phase dosing**: Effective; SMD ≈ −0.39 [^113Ued93] [^111wxhmQ].
- **Symptom-onset dosing**: Less effective; limited evidence [^113PaQmU].

---

## Recommended dosing strategies

| **Dosing strategy** | **Description** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Continuous dosing | Daily throughout cycle | - Most effective [^113Ued93] <br/> - FDA-approved for sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine [^113WxCWn] |
| Luteal-phase dosing | Days 14–28 of cycle | - Effective [^111wxhmQ] <br/> - FDA-approved for sertraline, paroxetine [^112SmRXx] [^111Js4QB] |
| Symptom-onset dosing | Start at symptom onset | - Limited evidence [^113PaQmU] <br/> - Less effective than continuous/luteal-phase |

---

## Safety and tolerability

SSRIs are **generally well tolerated**; common adverse effects include:

- **Nausea**: OR 3.30 [^113Ued93]
- **Insomnia**: OR 1.99 [^113Ued93]
- **Sexual dysfunction**: OR 2.32 [^113Ued93]
- **Fatigue/somnolence**: OR 1.52 [^113Ued93]

Intermittent dosing is **not associated with significant withdrawal symptoms** [^113PaQmU] [^115uRmTz].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ACOG and RCOG recommend SSRIs as **first-line therapy** for PMDD [^112qDeSJ] [^117RFsjd], with sertraline, fluoxetine, and paroxetine supported by strong evidence [^113Ued93] [^111Js4QB].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Adverse effects**: Nausea, insomnia, sexual dysfunction may limit adherence [^113Ued93].
- **Individual response**: Variable; may require dose adjustments or agent switching [^114GMRvA].
- **Long-term safety**: Intermittent use likely reduces withdrawal risk, but long-term data are limited [^1114SCXu].

---

SSRIs are **first-line** for PMDD, with rapid, robust efficacy; continuous dosing is most effective, while luteal-phase dosing is effective and convenient. Intermittent use is not associated with withdrawal, and guidelines endorse SSRIs for PMDD management [^112qDeSJ] [^117RFsjd].

### Efficacy of intermittent, luteal phase sertraline treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^111TZLXF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a menstrually related disorder that intermittently causes disabling emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sertraline for premenstrual dysphoric disorder when treatment was limited to the luteal phase.

Methods

Two hundred eighty-one women who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition) criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder and who completed two prospective screening cycles and one single-blind placebo cycle were randomized to three cycles of double-blind, luteal phase treatment with either a placebo or sertraline in a flexible daily dose of 50–100 mg. Outcome measures included the Daily Record of Severity of Problems and the Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement scales.

Results

Luteal phase treatment with sertraline was significantly superior to the placebo, as demonstrated by end- point analysis of Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale scores (sertraline, 2.3 ± 1.1, versus placebo, 2.7 ± 1.1; P < .001), and cycle 3 Daily Record of Severity of Problems change scores (sertraline, 27.6 ± 26.8, versus placebo, 17.6 ± 23.3; P < .002). A significant difference was also noted in responder rates in favor of sertraline (50%) versus placebo (26%, P < .001) by cycle 1 (with responder defined as a Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale score of 1 or 2). Quality of life and functioning outcomes were also significantly improved. Intermittent luteal administration of sertraline was well tolerated, with only approximately 8% of patients on sertraline and less than 1% on placebo discontinuing because of adverse events.

Conclusion

Sertraline was significantly more effective than a placebo and was well tolerated as a treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder when administered intermittently during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.

### Current update of hormonal and psychotropic drug treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^114Buqb8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2002). Low credibility.

This review discusses the current status of diagnosis and treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), with an emphasis on studies that have been published in the medical literature during the 2001 to 2002 interval. Serotonergic antidepressants are effective for PMDD, and are currently considered the first-line treatment. Recent clinical trials have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, taken only during the symptomatic luteal phase, are also effective for PMDD. One study reported efficacy for a slow-release formulation of fluoxetine that was taken two times during the menstrual cycle. Oral contraceptives still lack definitive evidence of efficacy as a treatment for PMDD, although a new contraceptive formulation has appeared promising for the mood and behavioral symptoms of the disorder. The results of a meta-analysis of the published trials of progesterone and progestins further indicate that these hormones are not effective in the management of PMDD.

### Venlafaxine in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^114bj4nQ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of venlafaxine, a new-generation antidepressant that selectively inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Method

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, flexible-dose trial. After three screening cycles, including a single-blind placebo cycle, 164 women were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with venlafaxine (50–200 mg/day) or placebo for four menstrual cycles. Primary outcome measures were the total premenstrual symptom scores as assessed by a daily symptom report (DSR) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.

Results

Venlafaxine was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing PMDD symptoms as assessed by DSR scores (P < .001 for last observation carried forward and observed analyses). Sixty percent of venlafaxine versus 35% of placebo subjects improved > 50% (P = .003). Forty-three percent of venlafaxine subjects versus 25% of placebo subjects experienced symptom remission, defined as reduction of DSR scores to the postmenstrual level (P = .034). Venlafaxine treatment was significantly better than placebo for all statistically derived DSR factors (mood, function, pain, and physical symptoms). Improvement was relatively swift, with approximately 80% symptom reduction in the first treatment cycle. Mean venlafaxine doses ranged from 50 mg/day in the first treatment cycle to 130 mg/day in the fourth treatment cycle. Adverse events such as nausea, insomnia, and dizziness were mild and transient.

Conclusions

Venlafaxine is significantly more efficacious than placebo for PMDD treatment. Response to treatment can occur in the first treatment cycle, and venlafaxine is well tolerated. Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential of intermittent (luteal phase) dosing for this cyclic disorder and the efficacy of long-term maintenance treatment with venlafaxine.

### Intermittent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113cejK8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Intermittent (luteal phase) dosing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is one treatment strategy for premenstrual syndromes such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder. This avoids the risk of the antidepressant withdrawal syndrome associated with long-term continuous dosing.

Aims:

To compare intermittent dosing to continuous dosing in terms of efficacy and acceptability.

Methods:

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed and CINAHL for randomised trials of intermittent compared with continuous dosing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in premenstrual syndromes. We extracted response rates, dropout rates and changes in symptom scores. We used random effects meta-analyses to pool study-level data and calculated odds ratio for dichotomous data and standardised mean difference for continuous data. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020224176).

Results:

A total of 1841 references were identified, with eight studies being eligible for analysis, consisting of a total of 460 participants. All included studies provided response rates, six provided dropout rates and five provided symptom scores. There was no statistically significant differences between intermittent and continuous dosing in terms of response rate (odds ratio: 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.23–4.31, I² = 71%), dropout rate (odds ratio 1.26, 95% CI: 0.39–4.09, I² = 33%) or symptom change (standardised mean difference: 0.04, 95% CI: −0.27 to 0.35, I² = 39%). All studies had a moderate or high risk of bias.

Conclusion:

Since intermittent dosing avoids the potential for withdrawal symptoms, it should be considered more commonly in this patient population.

### Understanding and treating premenstrual dysphoric disorder: an update for the women's health practitioner [^112rWShv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Up to 7% of women report premenstrual symptoms severe enough to impair daily function, and are said to suffer from premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Although PMDD is predominately regarded as a biologically based condition, sociocultural factors, and particularly life stress, past sexual abuse, and cultural socialization, likely interact with hormonal changes. This integrative model has implications for etiology and treatment of PMDD.

### A preliminary study of luteal phase versus symptom-onset dosing with escitalopram for premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^115euuat]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This preliminary study compared the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram administered at symptom onset or throughout the luteal phase in premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Method

Twenty-seven women meeting DSM-IV criteria for PMDD were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to luteal phase (N = 13) or symptom-onset (N = 14) dosing of escitalopram (10–20 mg/day) for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Participants were enrolled from November 2002 to July 2003, and data collection was completed in December 2003. Symptoms were assessed using the 17-item Penn Daily Symptom Report (DSR), the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Sheehan Disability Scale. Scores were compared using repeated measures analysis of covariance and t statistics.

Results

Luteal phase and symptom-onset groups received escitalopram for a mean of 13.5 and 6.0 days, respectively (mean ± SD dose = 15.2 ± 5.1 mg/day at the third treatment cycle). Total premenstrual DSR scores significantly improved from baseline (p = .003), with a 57% decrease in the luteal phase group and a 51% decrease in the symptom-onset group. Clinical improvement (DSR score decrease ≥ 50% from baseline) was reported by 11 of 13 patients in the luteal phase group and 9 of 14 patients in the symptom-onset group. Symptom severity differentiated the response in the symptom-onset group, with those having more severe symptoms less likely to respond. Symptom severity did not differentiate treatment response to luteal phase dosing. Escitalopram was well tolerated. Adverse events were mild and transient, with only 2 patients discontinuing due to adverse events related to the medication.

Conclusion

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder improved significantly with either luteal phase or symptom-onset dosing of escitalopram. Women with more severe PMDD may respond better to luteal phase dosing than symptom-onset dosing.

### The impact of pharmacotherapy for premenstrual dysphoric disorder on sleep [^115zBST5]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) affects a subset of women of reproductive age, characterized by severe mood disturbances and physical symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Symptoms include mood swings, irritability, anxiety, fatigue, physical discomfort, and disruptions to sleep and circadian rhythms, such as altered melatonin secretion. Despite the prevalence of these symptoms, the impact of PMDD treatments on sleep and circadian markers, like melatonin, remains insufficiently understood. This review examines how dysregulated serotonin signaling, disrupted allopregnanolone activity (a neurosteroid derived from progesterone), and aberrant circadian rhythms contribute to PMDD. It also explores the effects of pharmacological treatments, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, on sleep and melatonin regulation, and how these factors influence treatment outcomes. Additionally, the use of hypnotics and sedatives to manage sleep disturbances in PMDD is considered, weighing their potential benefits and risks. A deeper understanding of the interaction between PMDD symptoms, sleep, and circadian rhythms is crucial for developing more effective treatments. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between symptom management, sleep patterns, and circadian function in PMDD, and to determine how these factors can be optimized to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women affected by the disorder.

### Oral contraceptives containing drospirenone for premenstrual syndrome [^113XcVwP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common problem. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Combined oral contraceptives (COC), which provide both progestin and oestrogen, have been examined for their ability to relieve premenstrual symptoms. A combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and a low oestrogen dose has been approved for treating PMDD in women who choose combined oral contraceptives for contraception.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of COCs containing drospirenone in women with PMS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trial register, CENTRAL (now containing output from two trials registers and CINAHL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, LILACS, Google Scholar, and Epistemonikos on 29 June 2022. We checked included studies' reference lists and contacted study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared COCs containing drospirenone with placebo or with another COC for treatment of women with PMS.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were effects on premenstrual symptoms that were prospectively recorded, and withdrawal due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes included effects on mood, adverse events, and response rate to study medications.

Main Results

We included five RCTs (858 women analysed, most diagnosed with PMDD). The evidence was very low to moderate quality; the main limitations were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious inconsistency and imprecision. COCs containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol (EE) versus placebo COCs containing drospirenone and EE may improve overall premenstrual symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.59 to -0.24; 2 RCTs, N = 514; I² = 64%; low-quality evidence); and functional impairment due to premenstrual symptoms in terms of productivity (mean difference (MD) -0.31, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.08; 2 RCTs, N = 432; I² = 47%; low-quality evidence), social activities (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.04; 2 RCTs, N = 432; I² = 53%; low-quality evidence), and relationships (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06; 2 RCTs, N = 432; I² = 45%; low-quality evidence). The effects from COCs containing drospirenone may be small to moderate. COCs containing drospirenone and EE may increase withdrawal from trials due to adverse effects (odds ratio (OR) 3.41, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.78; 4 RCT, N = 776; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). This suggests that if you assume the risk of withdrawal due to adverse effects from placebo is 3%, the risk from drospirenone plus EE will be between 6% and 16%. We are uncertain of the effect of drospirenone plus EE on premenstrual mood symptoms, when measured by validated tools that were not developed to assess premenstrual symptoms. COCs containing drospirenone may lead to more adverse effects in total (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.11; 3 RCT, N = 739; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). This suggests that if you assume the risk of having adverse effects from placebo is 28%, the risk from drospirenone plus EE will be between 40% and 54%. It probably leads to more breast pain, and may lead to more nausea, intermenstrual bleeding, and menstrual disorder. Its effect on nervousness, headache, asthenia, and pain is uncertain. There was no report of any rare but serious adverse effects, such as venous thromboembolism in any of the included studies. COCs containing drospirenone may improve response rate (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.40; 1 RCT, N = 449; I 2 not applicable; low-quality evidence). This suggests that if you assume the response rate from placebo is 36%, the risk from drospirenone plus EE will be between 39% and 58%. We did not identify any studies that compared COCs containing drospirenone with other COCs.

Authors' Conclusions

COCs containing drospirenone and EE may improve premenstrual symptoms that result in functional impairments in women with PMDD. The placebo also had a significant effect. COCs containing drospirenone and EE may lead to more adverse effects compared to placebo. We do not know whether it works after three cycles, helps women with less severe symptoms, or is better than other combined oral contraceptives that contain a different progestogen.

### Premenstrual exacerbations of mood disorders: findings and knowledge gaps [^112WWYwJ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

ALLO has been also implicated in the pathophysiology of PMDD. Together with progesterone, ALLO levels increase after ovulation, reaching its highest levels during the mid-luteal phase, while decreasing during the premenstrual phase. Hantsoo and Epperson propose that women with PMDD show suboptimal sensitivity to the GABA A R-enhancing effects of ALLO, thereby provoking premenstrual symptoms and, due to a poor GABA control over the HPA axis, increased subjective and physiological stress sensitivity. The efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of PMDD is thought to reflect their enhancement of ALLO biosynthesis from progesterone, thus stabilizing ALLO levels during the late luteal phase and preventing rapid progesterone withdrawal. Notably, the rapid action of SSRIs, their efficacy in intermittent treatment confined to the luteal phase, and the lower dosing required in PMDD imply different treatment mechanisms of SSRIs in PMDD and MDD. Another theory poses that due to increased sensitivity of the GABA A R to ALLO, ALLO levels during the luteal phase — in a sense of a paradox reaction — induce premenstrual negative mood in women with PMDD. However, blocking the progesterone production reduced premenstrual symptoms in PMDD but not in women with PME of depression [see below;].

In addition to premenstrual exacerbations of foremost depressed symptomatology, exacerbations of mainly (hypo-) manic symptoms are observed around ovulation in BD, which points to a further divergent pathophysiological mechanism in BD symptom exacerbation. Elevating E2 levels during the periovulatory phase upregulate the dopaminergic reward system, and nonclinical studies indicate increases in rewarding and risky behaviors. Similarly, high E2 levels and increased neuronal excitability may particularly trigger hypomanic and manic episodes during this phase.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Sertraline) [^111j2YNc]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) – The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of PMDD was established in two double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled flexible dose trials (Studies 1 and 2) conducted over 3 menstrual cycles. Patients in Study 1 met DSM-III-R criteria for Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), the clinical entity now referred to as Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) in DSM-IV. Patients in Study 2 met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. Study 1 utilized daily dosing throughout the study, while Study 2 utilized luteal phase dosing for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses. The mean duration of PMDD symptoms for these patients was approximately 10.5 years in both studies. Patients on oral contraceptives were excluded from these trials; therefore, the efficacy of sertraline in combination with oral contraceptives for the treatment of PMDD is unknown.

Efficacy was assessed with the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), a patient-rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria for PMDD as identified in the DSM-IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms. Other efficacy assessments included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), and the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scores.

### Luteal phase dosing with paroxetine controlled release (CR) in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^1172HeZD]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical trial evaluated luteal phase dosing with paroxetine controlled release (CR) (12.5 mg and 25 mg) in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Study Design

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm, fixed-dose study of luteal phase dosing with paroxetine CR in the treatment of PMDD. Three hundred seventy-three patients with PMDD were randomly assigned into the study. The primary measure of efficacy was the change from baseline in the mean luteal visual analogue scale (VAS)-Mood score. Secondary efficacy measures included disorder-specific evaluations, global assessments of disease severity, and assessments of functional impairment. Adverse events were recorded throughout the trial.

Results

Patients treated with either dose of paroxetine CR demonstrated significantly greater improvements on the primary efficacy measure (change from baseline in mean luteal phase VAS-Mood scores) and on the majority of secondary efficacy measures compared with patients randomly assigned to placebo.

Conclusion

For the treatment of PMDD, luteal phase dosing with 12.5 mg and 25 mg of paroxetine CR is effective and generally well tolerated.

### The menstrual cycle: an overlooked vital sign in psychiatry? [^11212o9H]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

The menstrual cycle: an overlooked vital sign in psychiatry?

Should the menstrual cycle phase be considered a 'vital sign' in psychiatry, as recommended for some other areas of medicine? We are living through a 'menstrual moment' when the long-neglected intersection of female's reproductive and mental health is now becoming an acceptable part of public discourse. This is a valuable opportunity to improve patient care. Here we summarise the associations between the menstrual cycle and psychiatric symptoms and highlight opportunities to harness this potentially modifiable risk factor in clinical practice. We share the lived experience of our author, SA, as a real-world example. Our key message is that we should be asking patients more about how their menstrual cycle affects their mental health and using this information to inform diagnosis and management.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is now an official diagnosis

PMDD is the archetypal menstrual cycle mood disorder that comprises affective, cognitive and somatic symptoms confined to the premenstrual phase of the cycle associated with significant distress or functional impairment. PMDD is a new diagnosis in the genitourinary chapter of the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Although official recognition has been recent, this is the culmination of decades of research. Diagnosis can be reliably made using prospective daily symptom rating scales over two menstrual cycles. In large epidemiological studies, the point prevalence has been estimated at 1.6% when strictly adhering to diagnostic criteria.

PMDD is thought to be caused by an altered sensitivity to normal cyclical changes in oestradiol and progesterone. Symptoms remit with either suppression of ovarian hormones or high steady levels. To this end, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends combined oral contraceptives be considered as a first-line pharmacological treatment for PMDD, supported by a network meta-analysis. What is less widely known is that the guidelines also recommend suppressing ovulation for 'premenstrual exacerbation of an underlying disorder', such as depression. The other first-line option for PMDD, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have a much faster onset of action in PMDD (within 48 hours) than in typical depression. Another difference in PMDD is that SSRIs are equally effective when given only during the premenstrual phase compared with continuous dosing. As with any medication, hormonal contraceptives and SSRIs have side effects and the decision to prescribe is a patient-centred risk–benefit discussion.

### Recurrence of symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder after the cessation of luteal-phase fluoxetine treatment [^112FXsjB]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to use the data from two clinical trials to evaluate premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptom severity after the discontinuation of fluoxetine treatment.

Study Design

A retrospective analysis of two clinical trials was performed. Patients were treated with fluoxetine or placebo for three cycles, with the use of several different dosing regimens, followed by single blind placebo treatment for one cycle. Assessments of relapse included the daily record of severity of problems, the Sheehan disability scale, the premenstrual tension scale-clinician rated, and the clinical global impressions-severity.

Results

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms significantly increased after fluoxetine discontinuation. The scores did not return to baseline; however, the fluoxetine group was no longer significantly superior to placebo.

Conclusion

The two trials demonstrate that, after three cycles of treatment, premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms recur within the first cycle after treatment discontinuation. The rapid recurrence of symptoms further supports the view of premenstrual dysphoric disorder as a clinical entity distinct from depression.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndrome [^111wxhmQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common cause of physical, psychological and social problems in women of reproductive age. The key characteristic of PMS is the timing of symptoms, which occur only during the two weeks leading up to menstruation (the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are increasingly used as first line therapy for PMS. SSRIs can be taken either in the luteal phase or else continuously (every day). SSRIs are generally considered to be effective for reducing premenstrual symptoms but they can cause adverse effects.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of SSRIs for treating premenstrual syndrome.

Search Methods

Electronic searches for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were undertaken in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL (February 2013). Where insufficient data were presented in a report, attempts were made to contact the original authors for further details.

Selection Criteria

Studies were considered in which women with a prospective diagnosis of PMS, PMDD or late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LPDD) were randomised to receive SSRIs or placebo for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies, assessed eligible studies for risk of bias, and extracted data on premenstrual symptoms and adverse effects. Studies were pooled using random-effects models. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for premenstrual symptom scores, using separate analyses for different types of continuous data (that is end scores and change scores). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. Analyses were stratified by type of drug administration (luteal or continuous) and by drug dose (low, medium, or high). We calculated the number of women who would need to be taking a moderate dose of SSRI in order to cause one additional adverse event (number needed to harm: NNH). The overall quality of the evidence for the main findings was assessed using the GRADE working group methods.

Main Results

Thirty-one RCTs were included in the review. They compared fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram and citalopram versus placebo. SSRIs reduced overall self-rated symptoms significantly more effectively than placebo. The effect size was moderate when studies reporting end scores were pooled (for moderate dose SSRIs: SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.84, nine studies, 1276 women; moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 58%), low quality evidence). The effect size was small when studies reporting change scores were pooled (for moderate dose SSRIs: SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.51, four studies, 657 women; low heterogeneity (I(2) = 29%), moderate quality evidence).SSRIs were effective for symptom relief whether taken only in the luteal phase or continuously, with no clear evidence of a difference in effectiveness between these modes of administration. However, few studies directly compared luteal and continuous regimens and more evidence is needed on this question. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were significantly more likely to occur in the SSRI group (moderate dose: OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.84 to 3.53, 15 studies, 2447 women; no heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%), moderate quality evidence). The most common side effects associated with a moderate dose of SSRIs were nausea (NNH = 7), asthenia or decreased energy (NNH = 9), somnolence (NNH = 13), fatigue (NNH = 14), decreased libido (NNH = 14) and sweating (NNH = 14). In secondary analyses, SSRIs were effective for treating specific types of symptoms (that is psychological, physical and functional symptoms, and irritability). Adverse effects were dose-related. The overall quality of the evidence was low to moderate, the main weakness in the included studies being poor reporting of methods. Heterogeneity was low or absent for most outcomes, though (as noted above) there was moderate heterogeneity for one of the primary analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

SSRIs are effective in reducing the symptoms of PMS, whether taken in the luteal phase only or continuously. Adverse effects are relatively frequent, the most common being nausea and asthenia. Adverse effects are dose-dependent.

### Intermittent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115CUuPi]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antidepressant withdrawal syndrome, particularly after cessation of long-term selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), has recently been recognised as a significant clinical issue in a position paper by the. The syndrome includes affective symptoms, impaired sleep, sexual dysfunction, disequilibrium, sensory symptoms, gastrointestinal upset and general somatic complaints. Although the incidence is disputed, it is understood to affect a substantial number of patients who are prescribed these medications long-term.

Anti depressants, such as SSRIs, are prescribed to approximately 7.3 million people in England (17% of the adult population). SSRIs may be prescribed for various conditions, including premenstrual syndromes (PMS;). Several approaches have been taken to define these syndromes, differing mainly with respect to severity of the symptoms required for a diagnosis.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), previously called late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LLPDD), is predominately based on psychological symptoms and affects approximately 1–6% of the female population of reproductive age. It is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5;) and International Classification of Diseases: 11th Revision (ICD-11;) by the presence of at least five (out of 11) stipulated symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The diagnosis requires symptoms to be severe enough to disrupt daily functioning and excludes exacerbation of another psychiatric disorder. PMS also requires subjective reports of dysfunction but is more equally focused on psychological and physical symptoms. The higher prevalence, estimated at 20–30% of women, is mainly due to the limited requirement of only one of six specified mood symptoms and one of four specified physical symptoms. Furthermore, it does not exclude exacerbation of another psychiatric disorder. There is substantial overlap between PMDD and PMS, with a minority of women with PMS also meeting criteria for PMDD.

### What's stopping Us? Using GnRH analogs with stable hormone addback in treatment-resistant premenstrual dysphoric disorder: practical guidelines and risk-benefit analysis for long-term therapy [^1135PF4R]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective: Despite the documented success of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa) for the treatment of treatment-resistant premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), many patients struggle to find providers who have sufficient knowledge of PMDD and its evidence-based treatments and/or who are comfortable treating PMDD after first-line treatment options have failed. Here, we discuss the barriers to initiating GnRHa for treatment-resistant premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and offer practical solutions to address these barriers for providers who encounter patients with treatment-resistant PMDD but may not have the necessary expertise or comfort with providing evidence-based treatments (ie, gynecologists, general psychiatrists). We have included supplementary materials including patient and provider handouts, screening tools, and treatment algorithms with the hope that this review may serve as a primer on PMDD and the use of GnRHa with hormonal addback as a treatment, as well as a guideline for clinicians delivering this treatment to patients in need.

Options: In addition to offering practical treatment guidelines for first and second lines of treatment for PMDD, this review offers an in-depth discussion of GnRHa for treatment-resistant PMDD.

Outcomes: The burden of illness in PMDD is estimated to be similar to that of other mood disorders, and those suffering from PMDD are at a high risk for suicide.

Evidence: We present a selective review of relevant clinical trials evidence supporting the use of GnRHa with addback hormones in treatment-resistant PMDD (the most recent evidence cited was published in 2021), highlighting the rationale for addback hormones and presenting the different possible hormonal addback approaches.

Values: The PMDD community has and continues to suffer from debilitating symptoms despite the known interventions. This article provides guidance for implementing GnRHa into practice among a broader scope of clinicians including general psychiatrists.

Benefits, Harms, and Costs: The primary benefit of implementing this guideline is that a broad range of clinicians beyond reproductive psychiatrists who encounter patients with PMDD will have a template for assessing and treating PMDD and implementing GnRHa treatment when first-line treatments fail. Harms are expected to be minimal; however, some patients may have side effects or adverse reactions to the treatment or may not respond as they had hoped. Costs of GnRHa can be high depending on insurance coverage. We provide information within the guideline to help navigate this barrier.

Recommendations: (1) Prospective symptom rating in evaluating for PMDD is necessary for diagnosis and evaluating treatment response. (2) SSRIs and oral contraceptives should be trialed as the first- and second-line treatments for PMDD. (3) When first- and second-line treatments have failed to yield symptom relief, the use of GnRHa with hormone addback should be considered. Risks and benefits of GnRHa should be weighed among clinicians and patients, and potential barriers to access should be discussed.

Validation: This article adds to the available systematic reviews on the effectiveness of GnRHa in the treatment of PMDD and Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecology's guidelines on the treatment of PMDD.

### Premenstrual dysphoric disorder: epidemiology and treatment [^112LkSCB]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Recently designated as a disorder in the DSM-5, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) presents an array of avenues for further research. PMDD's profile, characterized by cognitive-affective symptoms during the premenstruum, is unique from that of other affective disorders in its symptoms and cyclicity. Neurosteroids may be a key contributor to PMDD's clinical presentation and etiology, and represent a potential avenue for drug development. This review will present recent literature on potential contributors to PMDD's pathophysiology, including neurosteroids and stress, and explore potential treatment targets.

### Non-contraceptive oestrogen-containing preparations for controlling symptoms of premenstrual syndrome [^113gxvmQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a psychological and somatic disorder of unknown aetiology, with symptoms typically including irritability, depression, mood swings, bloating, breast tenderness and sleep disturbances. About 3% to 10% of women who experience these symptoms may also meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). PMS symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and reduce by the end of menstruation. PMS results from ovulation and may be due to ovarian steroid interactions relating to neurotransmitter dysfunction. Premenstrual disorders have a devastating effect on women, their families and their work. Several treatment options have been suggested for PMS, including pharmacological and surgical interventions. The treatments thought to be most effective tend to fall into one of two categories: suppressing ovulation or correcting a speculated neuroendocrine anomaly. Transdermal oestradiol by patch, gel or implant effectively stops ovulation and the cyclical hormonal changes which produce the cyclical symptoms. These preparations are normally used for hormone therapy and contain lower doses of oestrogen than found in oral contraceptive pills. A shortened seven-day course of a progestogen is required each month for endometrial protection but can reproduce premenstrual syndrome-type symptoms in these women.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of non-contraceptive oestrogen-containing preparations in the management of PMS.

Search Methods

On 14 March 2016, we searched the following databases: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Specialised Register; Cochrane Central Register of Studies (CRSO); MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; ClinicalTrials.gov; metaRegister of Controlled trials (mRCT); and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal. In addition, we checked the reference lists of articles retrieved.

Selection Criteria

We included published and unpublished randomized placebo or active controlled trials on the efficacy of the use of non-contraceptive oestrogen-containing preparations in the management of premenstrual syndrome in women of reproductive age with PMS diagnosed by at least two prospective cycles without current psychiatric disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data on premenstrual symptoms and adverse effects and entered data into Review Manager 5 software. Where possible, intention-to-treat or modified intention-to-treat analysis was used. Studies were pooled using a fixed-effect model, analysing cross-over trials as parallel trials. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for premenstrual symptom scores. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE working group methods.

Main Results

The search resulted in 524 potentially relevant articles. Five eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified (305 women). Trials using oral tablets, transdermal patches and implants were identified. No trial used gels. One small cross-over trial (11 women, effective sample size 22 women considering cross-over trials) compared oral luteal-phase oestrogen versus placebo. Data were very low quality and unsuitable for analysis, but study authors reported that the intervention was ineffective and might aggravate the symptoms of PMS. They also reported that there were no adverse events. Three studies compared continuous oestrogen with progestogen versus placebo (with or without progestogen). These trials were of reasonable quality, although with a high risk of attrition bias and an unclear risk of bias due to potential carry-over effects in two cross-over trials. Continuous oestrogen had a small to moderate positive effect on global symptom scores (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.10, P = 0.005, 3 RCTs, 158 women, effective sample size 267 women, I² = 63%, very low quality evidence). The evidence was too imprecise to determine if the groups differed in withdrawal rates due to adverse effects (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.58, P = 0.33, 3 RCTs, 196 women, effective sample size 284 women, I² = 0%, very low quality evidence). Similarly, the evidence was very imprecise in measures of specific adverse events, with large uncertainties around the true value of the relative risk. None of the studies reported on long-term risks such as endometrial cancer or breast cancer. One study compared patch dosage (100 vs 200 µg oestrogen, with progestogen in both arms) and had a high risk of performance bias, detection bias and attrition bias. The study did not find evidence that dosage affects global symptoms but there was much uncertainty around the effect estimate (SMD -1.55, 95% CI -8.88 to 5.78, P = 0.68, 1 RCT, 98 women, very low quality evidence). The evidence on rates of withdrawal for adverse events was too imprecise to draw any conclusions (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.46, P = 0.34, 1 RCT, 107 women, low-quality evidence). However, it appeared that the 100 µg dose might be associated with a lower overall risk of adverse events attributed to oestrogen (RR 0.51, 95% Cl 0.26 to 0.99, P = 0.05, 1 RCT, 107 women, very low quality evidence) with a large uncertainty around the effect estimate. The overall quality of the evidence for all comparisons was very low, mainly due to risk of bias (specifically attrition), imprecision, and statistical and clinical heterogeneity.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low quality evidence to support the effectiveness of continuous oestrogen (transdermal patches or subcutaneous implants) plus progestogen, with a small to moderate effect size. We found very low quality evidence from a study based on 11 women to suggest that luteal-phase oral unopposed oestrogen is probably ineffective and possibly detrimental for controlling the symptoms of PMS. A comparison between 200 µg and 100 µg doses of continuous oestrogen was inconclusive with regard to effectiveness, but suggested that the lower dose was less likely to cause side effects. Uncertainty remains regarding safety, as the identified studies were too small to provide definite answers. Moreover, no included trial addressed adverse effects that might occur beyond the typical trial duration of 2–8 months. This suggests the choice of oestrogen dose and mode of administration could be based on an individual woman's preference and modified according to the effectiveness and tolerability of the chosen regimen.

### Comparison of managed care charges among patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^111ywAcu]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the impact on managed care charges of selecting citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline as first-line pharmacotherapy for newly diagnosed premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Method

This retrospective study analyzed administrative claims data from 14 managed care plans in the United States. The study population was identified from an integrated outcomes database for the period Jan. 1, 1998, to Dec. 31, 1999. Patients aged 18 years or older, newly diagnosed with PMDD, and initiating therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) within 30 days of the diagnosis were eligible for analysis. To date, there is no specific ICD-9 diagnosis code for PMDD; thus, patients were required to have an ICD-9 diagnosis of premenstrual tension syndrome (ICD-9 625.4). Patients with documented previous psychiatric disorders/treatment were excluded. All inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy claims incurred by each patient during the study period were included in the analysis. PMDD-related treatment charges for the 6-month period following treatment initiation were compared using multivariate regression.

Results

A total of 1413 patients met the study criteria. Fluoxetine and sertraline were the most common agents selected as first-line therapy. After differences in age, managed care plan, pretreatment resource utilization, physician specialty, index prescription year, treatment charges, presence of mental health and nonmental health comorbid conditions, and changes in medication were controlled for, patients taking paroxetine and citalopram had significantly higher PMDD-related treatment charges than sertraline patients (paroxetine, p = .0430; citalopram, p = .0226). Fluoxetine patients also had higher treatment charges than sertraline patients, though statistical significance was not reached.

Conclusions

Sertraline, as first-line therapy for PMDD, was associated with lower PMDD-related treatment charges compared with other SSRIs during the first 6 months after treatment initiation.

### Luteal phase treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder improves symptoms that continue into the postmenstrual phase [^115uRmTz]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the proven efficacy of luteal phase medication dosing for women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), it is not known whether this approach adequately treats symptoms that linger into the first 2–3 days of the follicular phase, a time when up to one-third of women diagnosed with PMDD report residual symptoms. Furthermore, no previous study has explored whether abruptly stopping medication after 2 weeks of treatment is associated with discontinuation symptoms.

Methods

To evaluate the efficacy of luteal phase medication dosing, symptom data from the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) during first few days of menses were compared from two studies with similar designs but different treatment strategies. The first study used continuous dosing of sertraline, 50–150 mg/day, throughout the menstrual cycle, while the second study used intermittent dosing with sertraline, 50–100 mg/day in the 14–16 days prior to onset of menses. To investigate whether abruptly stopping pills led to discontinuation symptoms, DRSP data for the first 5 days after the onset of menses were analyzed in the second (intermittent dosing) study. Symptom scores were compared for subjects who took either sertraline or placebo premenstrually and ceased taking pills at the onset of menses.

Results

The baseline (pretreatment) to on-treatment effect sizes were similar for continuous vs. luteal phase dosing on the first day of menses (0.73 vs. 0.89), second day of menses (0.40 vs. 0.55), and third day of menses (0.42 vs. 0.44), respectively. Subjects who abruptly discontinued sertraline had fewer symptoms indicative of withdrawal at Day 3 (p < 0.01) and no difference during Days 4–5 compared to subjects abruptly discontinuing placebo.

Conclusion

Patients given active medication during the luteal phase demonstrate reductions in DRSP total scores into the first few days of menses regardless of whether active treatment was continuous throughout the menstrual cycle or was discontinued at the onset of menses. This analysis finds no support for discontinuation symptoms following abrupt cessation of sertraline after 2 weeks of treatment for two cycles.

### Intermittent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1114SCXu]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We found no differences between intermittent and continuous dosing of SSRIs for PMDD or severe PMS. This was the case for response rates, dropout rates and symptom reduction, over the short-term. These findings are of interest because intermittent dosing would mitigate against the risk of withdrawal symptoms that occur following long-term continuous use of SSRI medications.

### Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder: common questions and answers [^117Am64w]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Premenstrual syndrome is primarily diagnosed clinically, with consistent characteristic symptoms occurring in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and resolving during menstruation or within the week following it. For a premenstrual dysphoric disorder diagnosis, a patient's symptoms must substantially interfere with work, school, social activities, or relationships or cause significant distress. Patients should record symptoms for at least two cycles because symptoms can vary from cycle to cycle. A symptom-tracking diary or diagnostic instrument, such as the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (a validated prospective survey tool), can be used to identify the cyclic pattern of symptoms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are first-line treatment for premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, with rapid onset of improvement; however, adverse effects can limit their use. Cognitive behavior therapy, exercise, acupuncture or acupressure, and the herb Vitex agnus castus may be used to ameliorate premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms. Reassessment for another underlying cause of premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms should occur if symptoms are not controlled with medications or other interventions or persist throughout the month.

### Management of premenstrual disorders: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 7 [^111jYuVu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide recommendations for the management of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, collectively referred to as premenstrual disorders, based on assessment of the evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of available treatment options. An overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of premenstrual disorders also is included to provide readers with relevant background information and context for the clinical recommendations.

Target Population

Reproductive-aged adults and adolescents with premenstrual symptoms.

Methods

This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with a writing team consisting of two specialists in obstetrics and gynecology appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Gynecology and one external subject matter expert. ACOG medical librarians completed a comprehensive literature search for primary literature within Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies that moved forward to the full-text screening stage were assessed by two authors from the writing team based on standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

Recommendations

This Clinical Practice Guideline includes recommendations on the following evidence-based treatment options for premenstrual disorders, with an acknowledgement that many patients may benefit from a multimodal approach that combines several interventions: pharmacologic agents (hormonal and nonhormonal), psychological counseling, complementary and alternative treatments, exercise and nutritional therapies, patient education and self-help strategies, and surgical management. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are included to provide guidance when a formal recommendation could not be made because of inadequate or nonexistent evidence. Based on review of extrapolated data from adult populations and expert consensus, it was determined that the recommendations also apply to adolescents, with a few exceptions that are noted in the Clinical Practice Guideline.

To determine whether an article was relevant to our study, we used the following inclusion criteria: cross-sectional, longitudinal, and case–control studies that (a) included women with premenstrual symptoms, PMS, LLPDD, or PMDD and compared their history of suicidal attempts, ideation, or plans with control women without any premenstrual disturbance; or (b) included women who attempted suicide and women who did not attempt suicide and compared their experiences of premenstrual symptoms, PMS, LLPDD, or PMDD. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) studies without comparison to controls without premenstrual symptoms, PMS, LLPDD, or PMDD; (b) reviews and meta-analyses; (c) case reports; (d) randomized controlled trials; and (e) abstracts, presentations, and editorials.

Studies were assessed by two blinded raters (D.P. and B.W. A.), who independently determined if studies met inclusion criteria by reviewing title and abstracts initially and full-texts later. Hand searches were also conducted to identify any articles that were previously missed in the database searches. Any discrepancies were resolved by seeking a third opinion (T. A.C.) to reach consensus.

Data extraction

Two researchers (D.P. and K.K.) extracted data from all studies. A table was created to highlight the following aspects of each study: authorship, year, and country of publication, sample, study design, type of premenstrual disturbance assessed, assessment of suicidality (premenstrual symptoms, PMS, LLPDD, or PMDD), and main findings.

### Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) [^111a1Jvh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a psychological and somatic disorder affecting 20% to 30% of women of reproductive age. PMS results from ovulation: symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and remit by the end of menstruation. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS experienced by three to eight per cent of menstruating women. In this review, we use the term PMS to cover all core premenstrual disorders, including PMDD. The symptoms of all types are severe enough to affect daily functioning, interfering with work, school performance or interpersonal relationships. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues are a pharmacological treatment to suppress ovulation. They can be administered as GnRH-agonists or GnRH-antagonists, though currently, GnRH-antagonists are not generally used to treat PMS. Suppressing ovarian function induces a hypo-oestrogenic state that can cause menopausal side effects such as hot flushes and mood changes. Having menopausal side effects instead of PMS symptoms can be distressing and can confuse clinical management. Longer-term GnRH therapy carries the risk of osteoporosis. To counteract these adverse effects, oestrogen or progestogen can be added to the PMS treatment; this is known as 'add-back' therapy or simply 'add-back'. Add-back may reduce menopausal side effects, allowing GnRH therapy to be used for a longer period without reducing efficacy.

Objectives

To evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness and safety (adverse effects) of GnRH analogues (agonists or antagonists), with or without add-back, in the management of PMS.

Search Methods

A Cochrane Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trials registers on 29 May 2023. We also checked reference lists and contacted study authors and subject experts to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of GnRH analogues used in the management of PMS in women of reproductive age with PMS diagnosed by at least two prospective menstrual cycles and no current psychiatric disorder. Control conditions could be no treatment, placebo, another type of GnRH, another dosage of GnRH or add-back.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall severity of PMS symptoms (global symptoms), quality of life and adverse events.

Main Results

The review found 11 RCTs that analysed results from 275 women. The evidence is of very low to high certainty. The evidence is limited by serious imprecision due to low sample sizes and a high risk of bias related to blinding and attrition. Quality of life and long-term effects on bones were not reported in the studies. Most studies did not report on all our adverse events of interest; some did not report on any of them. We found no RCTs that evaluated GnRH antagonists. GnRH agonists (without add-back) versus placebo GnRH agonists (without add-back) improve global symptoms compared to placebo (SMD -1.23, 95% CI -1.76 to -0.71; 9 RCTs, 173 women, effective sample size 278; I² = 72%; high-certainty evidence). GnRH agonists may increase the risk of menopausal side effects compared to placebo (RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 4.48; 2 RCTs, 23 women, effective sample size 31; low-certainty evidence). If the risk of menopausal side effects with placebo is 21%, the risk with GnRH agonist without add-back would be between 18% and 96%. Seven RCTs reported on withdrawals from the study due to adverse events (though data extraction was not possible for one of these studies). Women using GnRH agonists have a higher risk of withdrawing due to adverse events than women using placebo (RR 4.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 16.36; 6 RCTs, 140 women, effective sample size 252; high-certainty evidence). If the risk of withdrawal from the study is 0.8% with placebo, the withdrawal risk with GnRH agonist without add-back would be between 0.8% and 13%. GnRH agonists (with add-back) versus placebo GnRH agonists with add-back may improve global symptoms compared to placebo (MD -3.89, 95% CI -6.19 to -1.59; 1 RCT, 31 women; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain of the effect on withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 2.86, 95% CI 0.12 to 66.44; 1 RCT, 41 women; very low-certainty evidence). Add-back versus placebo add-back during GnRH agonist treatment The evidence of add-back versus placebo during GnRH agonist treatment was too imprecise to decide if there was an effect on global symptoms. The analysis was stratified by type of add-back (tibolone or oestrogen/progesterone). One RCT investigated the effect of tibolone as add-back and found insufficient information to decide if there was an effect on global symptoms (SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.38; 1 RCT, 28 women; very low-certainty evidence). One RCT investigated the effect of oestrogen plus cyclical progestogen as add-back and found evidence that it may worsen global symptoms compared to placebo (SMD 0.90, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.63; 1 RCT, 32 women; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain of the effect of tibolone on withdrawal due to adverse events (RR not estimable; 1 RCT, 28 women; very low-certainty evidence), and of oestrogen plus cyclical progestogen (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.48; 1 RCT, 40 women; very low-certainty evidence). Add-back dose comparison (low dose versus standard dose) The evidence was too imprecise to determine if a lower add-back dose during GnRH agonist treatment affected global PMS symptoms (MD -11.90, 95% CI -28.51 to 4.71; 1 RCT, 15 women; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review found that GnRH agonists without add-back improved global symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. However, the induced menopausal side effects and potential complications preclude long-term use. We found insufficient evidence to suggest that side effects can be reduced by 'add-back' without decreasing the global efficacy of GnRH agonists. Further RCTs of GnRH agonists with add-back and long-term follow-up are therefore needed to provide firm conclusions about long-term use. Until data are available to confirm or refute the safety of this combination, GnRH agonists with or without add-back can be administered to provide a short-term break from PMS symptoms. Future studies should attempt to assess the risk of osteoporosis.

### Pretreatment pattern of symptom expression in premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^114Zh4Sq]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Use of intermittent dosing strategies for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) highlights the need for detailed empirical data on the onset, duration and pattern of symptom expression in women suffering from PMDD.

Method

Data were analyzed from 276 women who met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD and prospectively charted two menstrual cycles prior to commencing sertraline treatment. The presence and severity of PMDD symptoms were measured using the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP).

Results

The most frequent PMDD symptoms (moderate-to-severe for ≥ 3 days) included anger/irritability (76%), anxiety/tension (71%), tired/lethargic (58%), and mood swings (58%). Mean DRSP scores peaked at day -2 (2 days prior to the onset of menses), but the within-patient day of onset of PMDD-level symptoms was highly variable, differing from cycle-to-cycle by ≥ 4 days in 45% of women. Similarly, the within-patient duration of PMDD symptoms varied from cycle-to-cycle by 3 or more days in ≥ 50% of women. Depending on the criteria used, 1 day after the onset of menstruation, 34–46% of women continued to report moderate to severe symptoms.

Limitation

Women in this sample were recruited for participation in a treatment study, and the results may not generalize to women with PMDD in the community.

Conclusion

The results of this analysis found significant within-patient variability in the time-to-onset and offset of PMDD symptoms, as well as their duration. The temporal pattern and high degree of within-patient variability across menstrual cycles of PMDD symptoms may have treatment implications.

### Premenstrual exacerbations of mood disorders: findings and knowledge gaps [^113tXWSv]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

In general, comorbidity rates of PMDD in mood disorders may be overestimated. In particular, premenstrual depressive or (hypo-) manic breakthroughs or entrainments in affected women who are treatment-responsive during the other cycle phases should be correctly classified as PME, and not as comorbid PMDD, if the symptoms are part of the ongoing disorder.

With respect to underlying biological mechanisms, it is plausible that cyclical changes in sex hormones and their metabolites during the premenstrual phase, and also during the periovulatory phase in BD, affect the modulation of neurotransmitters and contribute to PME in mood disorders in vulnerable women. However, the complexity of implicated risk factors and underlying mechanisms has so far not been systematically explored. In particular, there is indication that the pathophysiology of PMDD and PME of depression do not completely overlap. Although ovarian suppression with OCs and GnRH agonists as well as ALLO inhibition appears to be effective in treating PMDD (but see footnote 1), studies do not support their efficacy for PME of depression. In particular, the hypothesized paradoxical reaction towards ALLO is probably specific for PMDD, whereas women with PME of depression might rather be susceptible for progesterone withdrawal during the premenstrual phase. The role of the GABAergic system is an increasing topic in BD research, but its role in the treatment of PME of BD has not yet been studied.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride (Paxil) [^111f3jKN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.4 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder

The effectiveness of PAXIL CR for the treatment of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) utilizing a continuous dosing regimen has been established in 2 placebo‑controlled trials in female patients ages 18 to 46 (Studies 8 and 9 [N = 672]). Patients in these trials met DSM‑IV criteria for PMDD. Of 1,030 patients including Study 10, who were treated with daily doses of PAXIL CR 12.5 or 25 mg/day, or placebo continuously throughout the menstrual cycle for a period of 3 menstrual cycles, the mean duration of the PMDD symptoms was approximately 11 ± 7 years. Patients on systemic hormonal contraceptives were excluded from these trials. Therefore, the efficacy of PAXIL CR in combination with systemic (including oral) hormonal contraceptives for the continuous daily treatment of PMDD is unknown.

The VAS score is a patient‑rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria of PMDD as identified in the DSM‑IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms associated with PMDD. In Studies 8 and 9, 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of PAXIL CR were statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to Month 3 on the luteal phase VAS score.

In an additional study employing luteal phase dosing (Study 11), patients (N = 366) were treated for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses with 12.5 or 25 mg/day of PAXIL CR or placebo for a period of 3 months. In this trial,12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of PAXIL CR, as luteal phase dosing, was statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to luteal phase VAS score at Month 3.

There is insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome in Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11.

### Efficacy of open-label placebos for premenstrual syndrome: a randomised controlled trial [^116zwTiV]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this randomised controlled trial, we found that OLP improved symptom intensity and interference considerably in women with moderate to severe PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder when provided with a treatment rationale. OLP provided twice a day for 6 weeks with treatment rationale showed a large and clinically meaningful reduction of symptom intensity and interference over time (ie, 79.3% and 82.5% reduction), stressing the importance of adequately providing the treatment rationale in OLP interventions. In addition, side-effects reported in both OLP groups were few and not serious. Regarding secondary outcomes, results for psychological and somatic symptom intensity were consistent with the results of the primary outcomes; adherence was considerably high (93.18%) and the dropout rate low (3.4%).

### Premenstrual daily fluoxetine for premenstrual dysphoric disorder: a placebo-controlled, clinical trial using computerized diaries [^112SULbs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate premenstrual daily dosing with fluoxetine for treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

Methods

After a two-cycle screening and one-cycle single-blind placebo period, 260 women were randomized to fluoxetine 10 mg, fluoxetine 20 mg, or placebo (dosed daily from 14 days before next expected menses through the first full day of bleeding) for three cycles. Women recorded premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms daily using a computerized version of the Daily Record of Severity of Problems.

Results

Premenstrual daily fluoxetine 20 mg demonstrated significant improvement in mean Daily Record of Severity of Problems luteal scores compared with placebo (P = .005); premenstrual daily fluoxetine 10 mg did not (P = .100). Daily Record of Severity of Problems total scores were statistically significantly improved by the first treatment cycle for both active treatment groups. However, only fluoxetine 20 mg remained statistically significantly superior to placebo throughout the active treatment phase of the trial. Both fluoxetine groups showed significant treatment advantage over placebo for mood-related symptoms (P < .05). Only premenstrual daily fluoxetine 20 mg showed significant treatment advantage over placebo for physical symptoms of breast tenderness (P < .001), bloating (P = .001), and joint/muscle pain (P = .037). Treatment was well tolerated; discontinuations due to adverse events did not differ among the three groups (P = .316).

Conclusion

Premenstrual daily dosing with fluoxetine effectively treats mood, physical, and social functioning symptoms associated with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Fluoxetine 20 mg appears to have comparable tolerability with, and better efficacy than, fluoxetine 10 mg.

### Luteal phase administration of paroxetine for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Canadian women [^113MZQ3B]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intermittent, luteal phase-only administration of paroxetine (10 mg and 20 mg) in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Method

In this multicenter trial, female outpatients (aged 18–45 years) from 4 Canadian health centers meeting DSM-IV criteria for PMDD were asked to perform daily ratings of their premenstrual symptoms for 2 consecutive menstrual cycles. Those displaying the symptoms of irritability and/or depressed mood in the luteal phases but not in the follicular phases of their menstrual cycles were randomly assigned to intermittent, luteal phase-only treatment with paroxetine 10 mg or 20 mg or placebo for 4 additional cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change from baseline at study endpoint on the visual analog scale irritability score. Treatment differences were tested using analysis of covariance ad hoc. Estimated treatment mean differences and their associated 95% confidence intervals were also calculated. Data were collected from May 1999 to November 2002.

Results

Ninety-nine patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. When compared with placebo, patients treated with paroxetine 20 mg attained a significant reduction in irritability (difference in median percent change: -23.9, 95% CI = -51.3 to -6.2, p = .014; difference in mean absolute change: -18.6, 95% CI = -32.5 to -4.6, p = .007). A statistically significant difference was not observed when the patients treated with the lower dose of paroxetine (10 mg) were compared with placebo. Treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected side effects.

Conclusions

Intermittent administration of paroxetine 20 mg significantly reduced irritability symptoms in patients with PMDD. These results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that PMDD may be treated effectively by luteal phase-only administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

### Fluoxetine in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^115JaVSc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the role of fluoxetine in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Data Sources

Search strategy included MEDLINE (1966-February 2002), Embase (1988-February 2002), HealthStar (1975-December 2000), Current Contents (1996-November 2001), and Copernic (November 2001). Search terms included fluoxetine, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, PMDD, late luteal-phase dysphoric disorder, and severe premenstrual syndrome.

Study Selection

English-language human studies were selected and evaluated based on quality of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Eight prospective trials (3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover; 3 double-blind, randomized, controlled; 2 open-label), 1 case series, and 1 meta-analysis were identified. Although 6 of the studies involved small sample sizes (n < 50), all found fluoxetine to be effective in the treatment of PMDD.

Conclusions

Despite limited data, fluoxetine 20 mg/d appears to be effective in the treatment of PMDD. However, adverse effects, particularly headaches and sexual dysfunction, are possible. Given the long half-life of fluoxetine and the short duration of PMDD symptoms per cycle, larger, well-designed clinical trials evaluating intermittent dosing for only 1 week or a few doses need to be performed.

Regarding medical management for premenstrual syndrome, more specifically with respect to SSRIs, RCOG 2017 guidelines recommend to discontinue SSRIs gradually if given on a continuous basis to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

### Intermittent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113mdLUa]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

SSRIs are a first-line treatment for both PMDD and severe PMS, with standardised mean differences (SMD) in the region of 0.65 (0.46–0.84) compared with placebo. In contrast to depression, where antidepressant treatment should be continued for 6 months following a first episode and 2 years following a recurrent episode, SSRIs for PMDD may be prescribed intermittently. This involves taking the medication daily during the second half of the cycle, known as the luteal phase. Such a dosing regimen eliminates the risk of long-term withdrawal syndrome by avoiding continuous daily use, while short-term withdrawal symptoms have not been found in randomised trials.

Although luteal phase dosing regimens are recommended as an option by guidelines, it is unclear how this compares with continuous dosing in terms of efficacy or acceptability. Indeed, there are some conflicting reports. A 2008 meta-analysis concluded that intermittent dosing was less effective than continuous. By contrast, the most recent Cochrane review in 2013 reported that the regimens were equally effective, with the caveat that further research was needed for confirmation. Both these analyses crucially included only placebo-controlled studies and therefore excluded trials that directly compared intermittent versus continuous dosing without a placebo-arm. To address this gap in the research to date, we aimed to do a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials comparing intermittent dosing of SSRIs with continuous dosing in PMDD or PMS, examining response rates, dropout rates and symptom reduction.

### Screening of patients for clinical trials of premenstrual syndrome / premenstrual dysphoric disorder: methodological issues [^113VpdZA]. Psychiatry Research (2006). Low credibility.

For many clinical trials patients are first screened by telephone for inclusion and exclusion criteria.

It is also questionable whether the eventually selected women actually represent the general population of women with these disorders.

### Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^112ifzPH]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Premenstrual disorders affect up to 12% of women. The subspecialties of psychiatry and gynecology have developed overlapping but distinct diagnoses that qualify as a premenstrual disorder; these include premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These conditions encompass psychological and physical symptoms that cause significant impairment during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, but resolve shortly after menstruation. Patientdirected prospective recording of symptoms is helpful to establish the cyclical nature of symptoms that differentiate premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder from other psychiatric and physical disorders. Physicians should tailor therapy to achieve the greatest functional improvement possible for their patients. Select serotonergic antidepressants are first-line treatments. They can be used continuously or only during the luteal phase. Oral contraceptives and calcium supplements may also be used. There is insufficient evidence to recommend treatment with vitamin D, herbal remedies, or acupuncture, but there are data to suggest benefit from cognitive behavior therapy.

### Intermittent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111tCUVL]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of intermittent dosing adds to the body of evidence that, in PMSs, SSRIs have a rapid onset of action. Symptom improvement with fluoxetine is seen within hours, with responsiveness peaking within 2 days. After two cycles of luteal treatment with fluoxetine, symptoms relapse immediately in the third cycle following withdrawal. These converging clinical data do not support a delayed mechanism of action of SSRIs, as has been argued for depression.

An alternative hypothesised mechanism of action in PMDD is through increasing the rate of conversion of the progesterone metabolite 5α-dihydroprogesterone to allopreganolone, a neuroactive steroid which modulates the GABA-A receptor. This is in keeping with the wider conceptualisation of PMDD as a condition with abnormal sensitivity to allopregnanolone.

Stigma associated with antidepressants can affect therapeutic adherence and outcome. The differences between the action of SSRIs in PMSs and depression may improve the perception of these medications among the PMDD community. Some women with PMDD report feeling 'dismissed' with antidepressants and are reluctant to trial medications that are not specific for PMDD. Emphasising that SSRIs do not act simply as antidepressants in this condition could improve the acceptability of this treatment option.

### Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^111vUBye]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Premenstrual syndrome is defined as recurrent moderate psychological and physical symptoms that occur during the luteal phase of menses and resolve with menstruation. It affects 20 to 32 percent of premenopausal women. Women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder experience affective or somatic symptoms that cause severe dysfunction in social or occupational realms. The disorder affects 3 to 8 percent of premenopausal women. Proposed etiologies include increased sensitivity to normal cycling levels of estrogen and progesterone, increased aldosterone and plasma renin activity, and neurotransmitter abnormalities, particularly serotonin. The Daily Record of Severity of Problems is one tool with which women may self-report the presence and severity of premenstrual symptoms that correlate with the criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., text revision. Symptom relief is the goal for treatment of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. There is limited evidence to support the use of calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B6 supplementation, and insufficient evidence to support cognitive behavior therapy. Serotonergic antidepressants (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine) are first-line pharmacologic therapy.

### Symptom-onset dosing of sertraline for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^113PaQmU]. JAMA Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are efficacious treatments for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) when given daily or for half of the menstrual cycle during the luteal phase. Preliminary studies suggest that SRI treatment can be shortened to the interval from symptom onset through the beginning of menses.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of symptom-onset dosing with the SRI sertraline hydrochloride for treatment of PMDD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multisite, parallel-group randomized clinical trial conducted September 1, 2007, to February 29, 2012, at 3 university medical centers. In all, 252 women with PMDD started treatment at symptom onset and continued until the first few days of menses for 6 menstrual cycles. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed February 28, 2014, through April 21, 2015.

Interventions

Placebo or sertraline hydrochloride, 50 to 100 mg/d, during the symptomatic interval.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Premenstrual Tension Scale (PMTS) score was the primary outcome measure (score range, 0–36; 36 indicates most severe score). Secondary outcome measures included the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician-Rated (IDS-C) (score range, 0–84; 84 indicates most severe score), Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) (total and subscale scores; higher scores indicate most severe problems), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scales (score range, 1–7; 7 indicates most severe symptoms and least improvement), and Michelson SSRI (Selective SRI) Withdrawal Symptoms Scale scores (range, 0–51; higher scores indicate more severe withdrawal symptoms).

Results

Among the participants, 125 with PMDD were randomized to sertraline, and 127 to placebo. At baseline the mean (SD) PMTS scores for sertaline and placebo were 22.3 (4.8) and 21.4 (4.5), respectively, which declined to 11.7 (6.8) and 12.0 (6.9), respectively; group mean difference, 1.88 (95% CI, 0.01–3.75; p = 0.06). The mean (SD) estimated difference in IDS-C scores between baseline (35.4 [10.7] for sertraline; 32.8 [10.4] for placebo) and the end point (15.3 [10.7] for sertraline; 17.8 [11.0] for placebo) favored the sertraline group by 5.14 (95% CI, 1.97–8.31) points (P = .02). Compared with the placebo group, those assigned to sertraline showed greater improvement on the total DRSP score (estimated mean difference, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.96–1.25] points; p = 0.02) and Anger/Irritability DRSP subscale score (1.22 [95% CI,1.05–1.41] points; P < .01) and were more likely to respond to treatment (77 of 115 patients [67.0%] for sertraline and 65 of 124 [52.4%] for placebo; χ21 = 5.23; p = 0.02). The mean (SD) number of symptomatic days before treatment diminished over time (sertraline, -0.7 [3.4] days; placebo, -1.0 [3.2] days), with no group differences in symptomatic days or the Michelson SSRI Withdrawal Symptoms Scale.

Conclusions and Relevance

Depending on the symptom scale, women with PMDD may or may not benefit from SRI treatment during the interval from the onset of premenstrual symptoms through the first few days of menses. Abrupt treatment cessation was not associated with discontinuation symptoms.

### Premenstrual exacerbations of mood disorders: findings and knowledge gaps [^114FMo2W]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

In contrast to premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), premenstrual exacerbations (PMEs) of ongoing mood disorders are understudied. The aim of this review is to describe diagnostic issues, epidemiology, underlying mechanisms, and treatment for PME in unipolar depression and bipolar disorder, and to discuss clinical and research implications.

Recent Findings

Community-based and clinical studies estimate that in women with mood disorders around 60% report PME, while some women with bipolar disorder also show symptom exacerbations around ovulation. In general, PME predicts a more severe illness course and an increased burden. While heightened sensitivity to fluctuations of sex hormone levels across the menstrual cycle appears to contribute to PME and PMDD, the overlap of their underlying biological mechanisms remains unclear. Beneficial treatments for PMDD show less or no efficacy in PME. Pharmacological treatments for PME in mood disorders predominantly seem to profit from adjustable augmentation of treatment dosages during the luteal phase for the underlying disorder. However, the evidence is sparse and mainly based on earlier small studies and case reports.

Summary

Previous research is mainly limited by the lack of a clear differentiation between PME and PMDD comorbidity with mood disorders. More systematic research with uniformly defined and prospectively assessed subgroups of PME in larger epidemiological and clinical samples is needed to receive reliable prevalence estimates and information on the clinical impact of PME of mood disorders, and to uncover underlying mechanisms. In addition, larger randomized controlled trials are warranted to identify efficacious pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments for affected women.

### Efficacy of open-label placebos for premenstrual syndrome: a randomised controlled trial [^112o1ra4]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

Administering OLPs with a treatment rationale to women with PMS can decrease symptom intensity and interference considerably in the absence of substantial side-effects and with full transparency. Considering our results as much as the individual and societal burden of PMS, OLP treatment could serve as an acceptable, efficacious, and safe intervention for PMS.

### Diagnosis and treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^112WgGBA]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

From 2 to 10 percent of women of reproductive age have severe distress and dysfunction caused by premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Current research implicates mechanisms of serotonin as relevant to etiology and treatment. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms of premenstrual syndrome may benefit from nonpharmacologic interventions such as education about the disorder, lifestyle changes, and nutritional adjustments. However, patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder and those who fail to respond to more conservative measures may also require pharmacologic management, typically beginning with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This drug class seems to reduce emotional, cognitive-behavioral, and physical symptoms, and improve psychosocial functioning. Serotoninergic antidepressants such as fluoxetine, citalopram, sertraline, and clomipramine are effective when used intermittently during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Treatment strategies specific to the luteal phase may reduce cost, long-term side effects, and risk of discontinuation syndrome. Patients who do not respond to a serotoninergic antidepressant may be treated with another selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Low-dose alprazolam, administered intermittently during the luteal phase, may be considered as a second-line treatment. A therapeutic trial with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist or danazol may be considered when other treatments are ineffective. However, the risk of serious side effects and the cost of these medications limit their use to short periods.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Initial Treatment Dosage for Adults

Major Depressive Disorder –Sertraline hydrochloride treatment should be administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily.

While a relationship between dose and effect has not been established for major depressive disorder, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD or social anxiety disorder, patients were dosed in a range of 50–200 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of this indication. Consequently, a dose of 50 mg, administered once daily, is recommended as the initial therapeutic dose. Patients not responding to a 50 mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 200 mg/day. Given the 24 hour elimination half-life of sertraline hydrochloride, dose changes should not occur at intervals of less than 1 week.

Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride treatment should be initiated with a dose of 50 mg/day, either daily throughout the menstrual cycle or limited to the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, depending on physician assessment.

While a relationship between dose and effect has not been established for PMDD, patients were dosed in the range of 50–150 mg/day with dose increases at the onset of each new menstrual cycle (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Patients not responding to a 50 mg/day dose may benefit from dose increases (at 50 mg increments/ menstrual cycle) up to 150 mg/day when dosing daily throughout the menstrual cycle, or 100 mg/day when dosing during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. If a 100 mg/day dose has been established with luteal phase dosing, a 50 mg/day titration step for three days should be utilized at the beginning of each luteal phase dosing period.

### Weekly luteal-phase dosing with enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg in premenstrual dysphoric disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^116QLhcW]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Because the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are limited to the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, the potential benefit of luteal-phase dosing has been hypothesized.

Objective

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg given once or twice during the luteal phase for the treatment of PMDD.

Methods

Study drug was given 14 and 7 days before expected menses during the luteal phase of 3 menstrual cycles. After a screening period and single-blind placebo lead-in period, eligible women were randomized to I of 3 treatment groups: enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg on both days (LPWDx2); placebo 14 days before menses and enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg 7 days before menses (LPWDx1); or placebo on both days (PLC). The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in mean luteal-phase scores on the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP). Secondary efficacy measures included scores on the Rating Scale for Premenstrual Tension Syndrome, Clinician-Rated (PMTS-C); the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity scale; and the Patient Global Impression (PGI)-Improvement scale. Quality of life was assessed using the Sheehan Disability Scale.

Results

Two hundred fifty-seven women were randomized to treatment. At the end of the study, the LPWDx2 group had statistically significant improvements in DRSP total, DRSP mood subtotal, DRSP social functioning subtotal, PMTS-C, CGI-Severity, PGI-Improvement, and Sheehan Disability Scale work and family life scores compared with LPWDx1 and PLC (each measure, P < 0.05). There was also a statistically significant improvement in the score on the social life section of the Sheehan Disability Scale with LPWDx2 compared with PLC (P = 0.037). Across all treatment groups, 5 patients discontinued due to nonserious adverse events. Rates of discontinuation for any reason did not differ between the 3 treatment groups.

Conclusion

The findings of this study support the efficacy and tolerability of enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg given twice during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle for the treatment of PMDD.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder: a meta-analysis [^117L8AvJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically review evidence of the treatment benefits of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for symptoms related to severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

Data Sources

We conducted electronic database searches of MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cinahl through March 2007, and hand-searched reference lists and pertinent journals.

Methods Of Study Selection

Studies included in the review were double-blind, randomized, controlled trials comparing an SSRI with placebo that reported a change in a validated score of premenstrual symptomatology. Studies had to report follow-up for any duration longer than one menstrual cycle among premenopausal women who met clinical diagnostic criteria for PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. From 2,132 citations identified, we pooled results from 29 studies (in 19 citations) using random-effects meta-analyses and present results as odds ratios (ORs).

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Our meta- analysis, which included 2,964 women, demonstrates that SSRIs are effective for treating PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (OR 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31–0.51). Intermittent dosing regimens were found to be less effective (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45–0.68) than continuous dosing regimens (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.18–0.42). No SSRI was demonstrably better than another. The choice of outcome measurement instrument was associated with effect size estimates. The overall effect size is smaller than reported previously.

Conclusion

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were found to be effective in treating premenstrual symptoms, with continuous dosing regimens favored for effectiveness.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride (Paxilcr) [^112iS6Je]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder

The effectiveness of PAXIL CR for the treatment of PMDD utilizing a continuous dosing regimen has been established in 2 placebo-controlled trials. Patients in these trials met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. In a pool of 1,030 patients, treated with daily doses of PAXIL CR 12.5 or 25 mg/day, or placebo the mean duration of the PMDD symptoms was approximately 11 ± 7 years. Patients on systemic hormonal contraceptives were excluded from these trials. Therefore, the efficacy of PAXIL CR in combination with systemic (including oral) hormonal contraceptives for the continuous daily treatment of PMDD is unknown. In both positive studies, patients (N = 672) were treated with 12.5 mg/day or 25 mg/day of PAXIL CR or placebo continuously throughout the menstrual cycle for a period of 3 menstrual cycles. The VAS-Total score is a patient-rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria of PMDD as identified in the DSM-IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms. 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of PAXIL CR were significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to the endpoint on the luteal phase VAS-Total score.

In a third study employing intermittent dosing, patients (N = 366) were treated for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses (luteal phase dosing, also known as intermittent dosing) with 12.5 mg/day or 25 mg/day of PAXIL CR or placebo for a period of 3 months. 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of PAXIL CR, as luteal phase dosing, was significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline luteal phase VAS total score.

There is insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome in these studies.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We included randomised trials in women with either PMDD or PMS which compared intermittent dosing of SSRIs with continuous dosing. Where multiple publications reported results from the same trial, the largest one with most complete data was included. We excluded non-randomised trials. We included studies of at least 2 months. We did not place restrictions based on language and used Google translate for reports that were not in English.

Participants were women diagnosed with PMS by prospective ratings of a validated scale (such as the daily symptoms report;) or PMDD diagnosed by DSM criteria. We excluded studies solely of women who self-report a diagnosis of PMS or PMDD, as this is known to be unreliable.

The intervention was a luteal phase dosing, including symptom onset dosing (where the SSRI is taken at first onset of premenstrual symptoms). We excluded semi-intermittent dosing (where the SSRI is given at a higher dose during the luteal phase compared with the follicular phase). The comparator was continuous dosing of an SSRI. We searched for any SSRI: citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline or zimelidine. We also searched for venlafaxine and duloxetine; although these are not traditionally classified as SSRIs, their mechanism of action is similar at lower doses.

The following databases were searched from inception until December 2020: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed and CINAHL. We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. References of previous reviews and included studies were searched. Two authors (T.J.R. and P.W.) screened study abstracts and retrieved potentially relevant full-texts for further examination. Disagreement was resolved by discussion with a third author (I.C.). For studies that were not available or reported insufficient data, we attempted to contact authors by email, with a follow-up request if necessary.

### Efficacy of open-label placebos for premenstrual syndrome: a randomised controlled trial [^112vVyHA]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Interestingly, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists advises practitioners 'to evaluate evidence carefully for PMS as there is a 36–43% placebo response', and women with PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder — a severe form of PMS, defined as a psychological disorder — show clinically relevant improvements at post-treatment with over 50% symptom change in the luteal phase when receiving placebos. Furthermore, studies report clinically meaningful symptom reductions in women with PMS/premenstrual dysphoric disorder receiving placebos, which outperformed tested medication, and with only patients of the placebo arm asking for treatment continuation. Substantial and persistent symptom reduction with placebo intake has also been reported over several MCs. Given the frequent and often substantial side-effects as well as the high discontinuation rates of first-line treatments for PMS, it is of clinical interest to harness placebo effects ethically in PMS.

Open-label placebos (OLP) — that is, placebos provided with full transparency — have been shown to have positive effects on a variety of complaints, including psychological and somatic conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, cancer-related fatigue, chronic low back pain, menopausal hot flushes, emotional distress, and sadness, with an overall effect size of 0.72 for OLP versus no treatment or treatment as usual. Thus, even though OLPs are openly administered, symptoms are improved in both non-clinical and clinical populations, and treatment expectations seem to play a crucial role. The provided treatment rationale has been discussed as a crucial component in eliciting OLP effects, but underlying mechanisms continue to be explored. Efficacy and safety of the OLP intervention are unclear for PMS, where an effective, safe, and acceptable alternative to first-line treatments is clearly warranted. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of a 6-week OLP intervention in women with moderate to severe PMS in comparison to treatment as usual for effects on symptom intensity and interference. To test additionally the impact of the OLP treatment rationale, we included one OLP intervention group with and one without a treatment rationale.

### Intermittent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117RBkFW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intermittent (luteal phase) dosing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is one treatment strategy for premenstrual syndromes such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder. This avoids the risk of the antidepressant withdrawal syndrome associated with long-term continuous dosing.

Aims

To compare intermittent dosing to continuous dosing in terms of efficacy and acceptability.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed and CINAHL for randomised trials of intermittent compared with continuous dosing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in premenstrual syndromes. We extracted response rates, dropout rates and changes in symptom scores. We used random effects meta-analyses to pool study-level data and calculated odds ratio for dichotomous data and standardised mean difference for continuous data. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020224176).

Results

A total of 1841 references were identified, with eight studies being eligible for analysis, consisting of a total of 460 participants. All included studies provided response rates, six provided dropout rates and five provided symptom scores. There was no statistically significant differences between intermittent and continuous dosing in terms of response rate (odds ratio: 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.23–4.31, I² = 71%), dropout rate (odds ratio 1.26, 95% CI: 0.39–4.09, I² = 33%) or symptom change (standardised mean difference: 0.04, 95% CI: -0.27 to 0.35, I² = 39%). All studies had a moderate or high risk of bias.

Conclusion

Since intermittent dosing avoids the potential for withdrawal symptoms, it should be considered more commonly in this patient population.

### Sertraline [^112SmRXx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.6 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder

The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of PMDD was established in two double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled flexible dose trials (Studies PMDD-1 and PMDD-2) conducted over 3 menstrual cycles in adult female patients. The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride for PMDD for more than 3 menstrual cycles has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials.

Patients in Study PMDD-1 met DSM-III-R criteria for Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), the clinical entity referred to as PMDD in DSM-IV. Patients in Study PMDD-2 met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. Study PMDD-1 utilized continuous daily dosing throughout the study, while Study PMDD-2 utilized luteal phase dosing (intermittent dosing) for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses. The mean duration of PMDD symptoms was approximately 10.5 years in both studies. Patients taking oral contraceptives were excluded from these trials; therefore, the efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in combination with oral contraceptives for the treatment of PMDD is unknown.

Efficacy was assessed with the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), a patient-rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria for PMDD as identified in the DSM-IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms. Other efficacy assessments included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17), and the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scores.

### Intermittent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115tKpqs]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

Two authors (T.J.R. and P.W.) extracted study-level data in duplicate with any disagreement discussed with a third author (I.C.). The following variables of interest were extracted from each study: study setting, sample size, mean age, diagnosis of interest, method of diagnosis, name of SSRI and dosage.

The two pre-specified primary outcome measures were response rate and dropout rate. The secondary outcome measure was SMD of symptom ratings. Response rate was defined using improvement on global scale (such as Clinical Global Impression Scale or as 50% reduction in symptoms using a continuous measure of symptoms score. Dropout rate was defined as participants leaving the trial early for any reason. For studies reporting symptom scores, the SMD was calculated between the intermittent and continuous dosing groups. Symptom end-scores were extracted in preference to change scores. Where means and standard deviations were not reported, we calculated an effect size based on reported sample size, test statistic and p values. We analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis and requested missing data from original study authors. We used Hedges' g as the effect size measure due to potential bias from small sample sizes.

The Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool (version 2) was used, independently by two authors (T.J.R. and P.W.), with disagreement resolved by a third author (I.C.).

All analyses were carried out using R version 3.6.3, using the 'meta' and 'metafor' packages, with the 'dmetar' package for Egger's tests. We used a random effects model to pool results across studies. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic. We pre-specified the following subgroup analyses if more than three studies were included: individual SSRI medication, SSRI dosage (low, medium or high), diagnosis for study inclusion (severe PMS or PMDD). Post hoc, where there was doubt about a study's suitability for inclusion or the data provided, we conducted sensitivity analyses by excluding that study. Small sample bias (publication bias) was assessed visually using funnel plots, with asymmetry quantified using Egger's test. We used the trim and fill method to correct for asymmetry where this was evident, providing an adjusted-effect size.

### Expert guidelines for the treatment of severe PMS, PMDD, and comorbidities: the role of SSRIs [^112KuQCx]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

The hallmark feature of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is the predictable, cyclic nature of symptoms or distinct on/offness that begins in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and remits shortly after the onset of menstruation. PMDD is distinguished from PMS by the severity of symptoms, predominance of mood symptoms, and role dysfunction, particularly in personal relationships and marital/family domains. Several treatment modalities are beneficial in PMDD and severe PMS, but the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have emerged as first-line therapy. The SSRIs can be administered continuously throughout the entire month, intermittently from ovulation to the onset of menstruation, or semi-intermittently with dosage increases during the late luteal phase. These guidelines present practical treatment algorithms for the use of SSRIs in women with pure PMDD or severe PMS, PMDD and underlying subsyndromal clinical features of mood or anxiety, or premenstrual exacerbation of a mood/anxiety disorder.

### Symptom-onset dosing of sertraline for the treatment of… [^115Aoszu]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine the efficacy of symptom-onset dosing with the SRI sertraline hydrochloride for treatment of PMDD. Design, Setting, and Participants A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multisite, parallel-group randomized clinical trial conducted September 1, 2007, to February 29, 2012, at 3 university medical centers. In all, 252 women with PMDD started treatment at symptom onset and continued until the first few days of menses for 6 menstrual cycles. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed February 28, 2014, through April 21, 2015. Depending on the symptom scale, women with PMDD may or may not benefit from SRI treatment during the interval from the onset of premenstrual symptoms through the first few days of menses. Abrupt treatment cessation was not associated with discontinuation symptoms. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00536198. Small studies show that SRI administration for only 1 week8, 14 or initiated at symptom onset is therapeutic.

14, 18–23 At present, to our knowledge, no large, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials have assessed the efficacy and response parameters of symptom-onset dosing of SRIs for PMDD. With this unique treatment format comes questions about feasibility and adverse events. Many women experience difficulty anticipating the onset of symptoms or attribute symptoms to environmental stressors rather than PMDD. 15 This response can complicate a woman's ability to determine the optimal time to commence treatment. In addition, a number of reports24–26 cite difficulties with abrupt cessation of SRI therapy and the emergence of a discontinuation syndrome. Intermittent treatment for PMDD, by definition, includes treatment that is abruptly stopped after a short interval. Thus, a clinical trial of an intermittent treatment would benefit from the evaluation of feasibility and the risk for discontinuation symptoms.

We used the Daily Record of Severity of Problems 28 to establish a diagnosis of PMDD prospectively. The DRSP consists of 21 items that reflect the 11 candidate symptoms for PMDD according to the DSM-IV29 and DSM-5. 30 Some symptoms are broken into several component items. Each item is scored from 1 to 6 points, with 6 indicating the most severe problems. In what is to our knowledge the first large placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of symptom-onset treatment with an SRI for PMDD, there were no significant differences in PMTS scores, the primary outcome.

### Efficacy of open-label placebos for premenstrual syndrome: a randomised controlled trial [^113UooVX]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is characterised by psychological and somatic symptoms, which prevail in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (MC), affecting on average 48% of women of reproductive age. Psychological symptoms include, among others, irritability, depressed mood, and mood swings; somatic symptoms encompass breast tenderness, bloating, and joint pain. Women with PMS are at an increased risk for suicidality, depression, eating disorders, and migraine. Interference with social, educational and vocational functioning is a core criterion of PMS, having an impact on the quality of life as early as adolescence. Additionally, women with PMS experience over three times more impairment of work productivity than women without PMS. Thus, PMS has detrimental consequences at an individual and economic level. Although the aetiology of PMS is not yet fully understood, inadequate responses to hormone fluctuation have been discussed. Accordingly, a multitude of PMS interventions exists. First-line therapies for PMS entail selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and hormonal agents (ie, oral contraceptives and danazol). Side-effects of these treatments are numerous and include dizziness, nausea, tremor (SSRIs), weight gain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and depression (danazol). Although SSRIs are described as the preferred treatment option by patients,69% of women with PMS discontinue SSRI intake due to adverse events. Consequently, it is critical to consider the safety profile when recommending PMS interventions in clinical practice. Psychosocial interventions are a further option to treat PMS, such as cognitive–behavioural interventions, but their efficacy is still evaluated as being unsatisfactory. While frequently prescribed or self-administered, inconsistent evidence is reported for complementary and alternative treatments, such as Vitex agnus-castus, vitamin supplements, or magnesium.

### Rapid response to fluoxetine in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^112jqnMa]. Depression and Anxiety (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) relieve irritability within days in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD); however, the effects on other affective symptoms in PMDD remain to be demonstrated.

Methods

We performed hourly ratings in women with PMDD to test the specificity of the therapeutic effects of SRIs and to determine whether the kinetics of these effects differ from those of the symptom offset accompanying menses. Twelve women with PMDD received fluoxetine (20 mg daily) during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Twelve other women with PMDD received no treatment. Outcome measures included a visual analogue scale completed hourly before and after either the start of SRIs or at menses-onset in the untreated women and the premenstrual tension syndrome (PMTS) scale completed daily. Data were analyzed by ANOVA-R.

Results

Hourly VAS scores significantly improved after SRI in irritability as well as sadness, anxiety, and mood swings. Compared with the symptomatic pretreatment baseline, PMTS scores significantly improved on the second day after the start of SRI (p < .01). An identical time course of symptom improvement occurred after both SRI and menses-onset.

Conclusion and Discussion

These data document that the rapid response to SRI was not limited to irritability. The similar kinetics in the remission of PMDD after SRIs and after menses-onset suggest both a phenotype reflecting the relative capacity to rapidly change affective state, and a possible therapeutic mechanism by which SRIs recruit this endogenous capacity to change state, normally expressed around menses-onset in women with PMDD.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride [^111Js4QB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.4 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder

The effectiveness of Paroxetine HCL CR for the treatment of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) utilizing a continuous dosing regimen has been established in 2 placebo‑controlled trials in female patients ages 18 to 46 (Studies 8 and 9 [N = 672]). Patients in these trials met DSM‑IV criteria for PMDD. Of 1,030 patients including Study 10, who were treated with daily doses of Paroxetine HCL CR 12.5 or 25 mg/day, or placebo continuously throughout the menstrual cycle for a period of 3 menstrual cycles, the mean duration of the PMDD symptoms was approximately 11 ± 7 years. Patients on systemic hormonal contraceptives were excluded from these trials. Therefore, the efficacy of Paroxetine HCL CR in combination with systemic (including oral) hormonal contraceptives for the continuous daily treatment of PMDD is unknown.

The VAS score is a patient‑rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria of PMDD as identified in the DSM‑IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms associated with PMDD. In Studies 8 and 9, 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of Paroxetine HCL CR were statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to Month 3 on the luteal phase VAS score.

In an additional study employing luteal phase dosing (Study 11), patients (N = 366) were treated for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses with 12.5 or 25 mg/day of Paroxetine HCL CR or placebo for a period of 3 months. In this trial,12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of Paroxetine HCL CR, as luteal phase dosing, was statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to luteal phase VAS score at Month 3.

### Management of premenstrual syndrome: green-top guideline no. 48 [^111mVznP]. BJOG (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for premenstrual syndrome, more specifically with respect to general principles, RCOG 2017 guidelines recommend to consider referring patients to a gynecologist when simple measures (such as combined oral contraceptives, vitamin B6, and SSRIs) have been explored and failed and when the severity of the PMS justifies gynecological intervention.

### Effects of metergoline on symptoms in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^116AmrLx]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors investigated the role of acute serotonergic modulation in the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

Method

Patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (whose symptoms had remitted during treatment with fluoxetine) and a group of unmedicated healthy comparison women received the serotonin receptor antagonist metergoline as part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study.

Results

The patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder experienced a return of symptoms 24 hours after treatment with metergoline but not diphenhydramine (active placebo). The comparison women experienced no changes in mood.

Conclusions

These data support the role of altered serotonergic transmission in the efficacy of SSRI treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

### Diagnosis and treatment of premenstrual dysphoria [^116cfRML]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Premenstrual dysphoria (PMD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome afflicting 5% to 10% of all fertile women. Cardinal symptoms — appearing regularly between ovulation and menstruation and disappearing within a few days after the onset of the bleeding — are depressed mood, tension, affect lability, and irritability. Of these symptoms, irritability is often the most prominent. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), but not nonserotonergic antidepressants, reduce the symptoms of PMD effectively. The onset of action of SRIs is much shorter when used for PMD than when used for depression, enabling women with PMD to restrict medication use to the luteal phase of the cycle (so-called intermittent treatment). The findings that SRIs are effective for PMD — and that sexual dysfunction is the most frequent side effect during long-term treatment — both lend support for the hypothesis that a major role for brain serotonin is to modulate sex steroid-driven behavior.

### Suicidal risk in women with premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1179SJg5]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Premenstrual symptoms affect up to 90% of menstruating women. While these symptoms are typically mild in nature, ∼30–40% of these women go on to experience premenstrual syndrome (PMS). This condition is characterized by moderate-to-severe physical, affective, and behavioral symptoms that occur within the luteal phase and remit once menstruation begins. Women with PMS may experience symptoms such as bloating, irritability, mood swings, social withdrawal, and poor concentration. Furthermore, ∼3–8% of women experience premenstrual symptoms of a greater clinical severity and are diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Similar to PMS, symptoms of PMDD present during the luteal phase and disappear after menstruation commences. However, in contrast to PMS, PMDD typically confers marked functional and social impairment, severely affecting quality of life and well-being. Previously referred to as Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (LLPDD; DSM-III), PMDD is now categorized as a depressive disorder in the DSM-5 5 and as a disease of the genitourinary system in the International Classification of Diseases update (ICD-11). Importantly, recent research has suggested that PMDD is the result of physiological shifts in reproductive hormones, and is associated with altered cellular processes and several neurobiological differences, such as abnormal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex functioning and executive control network connectivity.

### Management strategies for premenstrual syndrome / premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^113WxCWn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the current nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment options for symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Data Sources

Literature was obtained through searches of MEDLINE Ovid (1950-March week 3, 2008) and EMBASE Drugs and Pharmacology (all years), as well as a bibliographic review of articles identified by the searches. Key terms included premenstrual syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, PMS, PMDD, and treatment.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

All pertinent clinical trials, retrospective studies, and case reports in human subjects published in the English language were identified and evaluated for the safety and efficacy of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments of PMS/PMDD. Data from these studies and information from review articles were included in this review.

Data Synthesis

Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been proven safe and effective for the treatment of PMDD and are recommended as first-line agents when pharmacotherapy is warranted. Currently fluoxetine, controlled-release paroxetine, and sertraline are the only Food and Drug Administration-approved agents for this indication. Suppression of ovulation using hormonal therapies is an alternative approach to treating PMDD when SSRIs or second-line psychotropic agents are ineffective; however, adverse effects limit their use. Anxiolytics, spironolactone, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can be used as supportive care to relieve symptoms. Despite lack of specific evidence, lifestyle modifications and exercise are first-line recommendations for all women with PMS/PMDD and may be all that is needed to treat mild-to-moderate symptoms. Herbal and vitamin supplementation and complementary and alternative medicine have been evaluated for use in PMS/PMDD and have produced unclear or conflicting results. More controlled clinical trials are needed to determine their safety and efficacy and potential for drug interactions.

Conclusions

Healthcare providers need to be aware of the symptoms of PMS and PMDD and the treatment options available. Treatment selection should be based on individual patient symptoms, concomitant medical history, and need for contraception.

### Continuous or intermittent dosing with sertraline for patients with severe premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^112pJxDa]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors compared the efficacy and acceptability of continuous versus intermittent treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in women with severe premenstrual syndrome and determined the effects of postmenstrual symptom severity and depression history as covariates of the treatment response.

Method

Patients who met symptom criteria and reported impaired functioning after three screening cycles were randomly assigned to three cycles of double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment with continuous (full-cycle dosing) or intermittent (luteal-phase dosing) sertraline. The design was stratified for severity of postmenstrual symptoms and history of major depression. Flexible sertraline dose was 50–100 mg/day. Outcome measures were the Daily Symptom Rating Form score and patient global ratings of functioning.

Results

Both sertraline groups improved significantly more than the placebo group as assessed by total premenstrual Daily Symptom Rating Form scores for 3 treatment months. Daily Symptom Rating Form factors that were significantly more improved in the sertraline groups were mood and physical symptoms. Sertraline improvement occurred swiftly in the first month of treatment. Gradual placebo improvement was similar to sertraline in the third month. Subjects with higher postmenstrual symptoms before treatment remained more symptomatic regardless of the dosing regimen. A history of major depression was not associated with treatment response. More sertraline-treated subjects reported improved functioning in the domains of family relationships, social activities, and sexual activity.

Conclusions

Premenstrual dosing does not differ from continuous dosing with sertraline in premenstrual syndrome treatment. Higher levels of postmenstrual symptoms limit treatment response and are important to define in treatment of premenstrual syndrome.

### How does premenstrual dysphoric disorder relate to depression and anxiety disorders? [^113fy92Z]. Depression and Anxiety (2003). Low credibility.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe variant of premenstrual syndrome that afflicts approximately 5% of all women of fertile age. The hallmark of this condition is the surfacing of symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and the disappearance of symptoms shortly after the onset of menstruation. Whereas many researchers have emphasized the similarities between PMDD and anxiety disorders, and in particular panic disorder, others have suggested that PMDD should be regarded as a variant of depression. Supporting both these notions, the treatment of choice for PMDD, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), is also first line of treatment for depression and for most anxiety disorders. In this review, the relationship between PMDD on the one hand, and anxiety and depression on the other, is being discussed. Our conclusion is that PMDD is neither a variant of depression nor an anxiety disorder, but a distinct diagnostic entity, with irritability and affect lability rather than depressed mood or anxiety as most characteristic features. The clinical profile of SRIs when used for PMDD, including a short onset of action, suggests that this effect is mediated by other serotonergic synapses than the antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects of these drugs. Although we hence suggest that PMDD should be regarded as a distinct entity, it should be emphasized that this disorder does display intriguing similarities with other conditions, and in particular with panic disorder, which should be the subject of further studies. Also, the possibility that there are subtypes of PMDD more closely related to depression, or anxiety disorders, than the most common form of the syndrome, should not be excluded.

### SSRIs for premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^111GZaUn]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2002). Low credibility.

Around 2–10% of women have premenstrual symptoms that severely disrupt daily living. When such symptoms are dominated by severe disturbances of mood and behaviour, the condition has been named premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), is licensed in the UK for the treatment of PMDD. Here, we discuss the diagnosis of PMDD and the evidence for the efficacy of fluoxetine and other SSRIs in its treatment.

### Current management of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^114wGFxF]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

About 5% of women of reproductive age experience affective or physical premenstrual symptoms that markedly influence work, social activities, or relationships. Prospective charting of symptoms for at least two menstrual cycles is required to facilitate an accurate diagnosis of premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The optimal treatment plan begins with lifestyle modifications, followed by pharmacotherapy. Evidence from numerous controlled trials has clearly demonstrated that low-dose serotonin reuptake inhibitors, using intermittent or continuous administration, have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects. Modification of the menstrual cycle should be considered only after all other treatment options have failed.

### Low-dose sertraline in the treatment of moderate-to-severe premenstrual syndrome: efficacy of 3 dosing strategies [^114pPoc1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, but few studies have investigated the efficacy of SSRIs in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sertraline in the treatment of moderate-to-severe PMS using 3 different dosing strategies: luteal phase (2 cycles), followed by continuous dosing throughout the month (1 cycle), followed by dosing begun at the first onset of PMS symptoms, or "symptom-onset" dosing (1 cycle).

Method

314 women with PMS from 22 U.S. sites were randomly assigned to fixed-dose treatment with sertraline (25 or 50 mg/day) or placebo for 4 menstrual cycles after a single-blind, placebo lead-in cycle. Assessments included the Daily Symptom Report (DSR), the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness and -Improvement scales, the Patient Global Evaluation scale, the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, and the Social Adjustment Scale-Self Report.

Results

Intermittent luteal-phase dosing with low doses of sertraline (25 and 50 mg/day) produced significant improvement across 2 menstrual cycles, based on total DSR scores, compared with placebo. Continuous and symptom-onset dosing were also effective in treating PMS symptoms, particularly at the lower dose of 25 mg/day.

Conclusions

The results of the current study suggest that low doses of sertraline may be a safe, effective, and well-tolerated treatment for moderate-to-severe PMS.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndrome [^117TDHUr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Severe premenstrual syndrome affects between 3–5% of women of reproductive age. Such severe PMS is classified under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as premenstrual dysphoric disorder, PMDD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are increasingly being used as a front-line therapy for premenstrual syndrome (PMS). A systematic review was undertaken on the efficacy of SSRIs in the management of severe PMS/PMDD, to assess the evidence for this treatment option.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of SSRIs in reducing premenstrual syndrome symptoms in women diagnosed with severe premenstrual syndrome.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches for relevant randomised controlled trials of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group specialised register of controlled trials, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsychLit were undertaken. References were searched interactively to identify missed trials. Where insufficient data were presented original authors were contacted for further details.

Selection Criteria

All trials were considered in which women with a prospective diagnosis of PMS/ PMDD were randomised to receive SSRIs or placebo in a double blind trial for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome.

Data Collection and Analysis

31 randomised controlled trials were identified which reported the use of SSRIs in the management of PMS. 16 trials were excluded, 15 trials were included in the systematic review, and ten trials were included in the main analyses. The reviewers extracted the data independently and standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data.

Main Results

The primary analysis of reduction in overall symptomatology included data on 844 women with premenstrual syndrome. SSRIs were found to be highly effective in treating premenstrual symptoms. Secondary analysis showed that they were as effective in treating physical as well as behavioural symptoms. There was no significant difference between trials funded by pharmaceutical companies and those independently funded. Withdrawals due to side effects were 2.5 times more likely to occur in the treatment group, particularly at higher doses.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is now very good evidence to support the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the management of severe premenstrual syndrome.

### Intermittent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111Zhax6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

The search retrieved 1841 records, of which eight met the inclusion criteria, see Figure 1. The characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1. In total, 212 participants were randomised to intermittent SSRIs and 248 to continuous SSRIs. Five studies used the diagnosis of PMDD or LLPDD for inclusion, and three used severe PMS. Sertraline and citalopram were each used by three studies, while paroxetine was used by two. All included studies provided response rates, six provided dropout rates and five provided symptom scores.

Table 1.
Characteristics of included studies.

There was no statistically significant difference in response rates between intermittent and continuous dosing (odds ratio (OR): 1.0 (95% CI: 0.23–4.31)), see Figure 2. There was substantial statistical heterogeneity (I 2 = 71%). There were no statistically significant differences in response rates between intermittent and continuous dosing in the following subgroup analyses: five studies with PMDD as the inclusion diagnosis, three studies with severe PMS as the inclusion diagnosis and four studies with citalopram as the SSRI. Due to concerns about study design, it is questionable whether should be included. A sensitivity analysis conducted without this study showed no significant difference in response rates between groups. A funnel plot did not show asymmetry, and Egger's test was non-significant (p = 0.61).

n: number of responders; N: total number of participants in the group.

There was no statistically significant difference in dropout rates between groups (OR: 1.26 (95% CI: 0.39–4.09)), see Figure 3. Statistical heterogeneity was moderate (I 2 = 33%). There were no statistically significant differences in dropout rates in the two subgroup analyses: four studies with PMDD as the inclusion diagnosis, three studies with sertraline as the SSRI. Since 22 of 23 participants in the intermittent group dropped out, it is questionable whether should be included. A sensitivity analysis without this study did not affect the overall result, with no statistically significant differences in dropout rates between groups. A funnel plot did not show asymmetry, and Egger's test was non-significant (p = 0.91).

There was no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of change in symptoms scores, with an SMD of 0.04 (95% CI: −0.27 to 0.35), see Figure 4. There was moderate statistical heterogeneity, I² = 39%. In the subgroup of three studies with severe PMS as the inclusion diagnosis, there was no difference between groups. Excluding(whose data we took from a previous Cochrane review, again resulted in no difference between groups. There was asymmetry noted in the funnel plot, Egger's test was significant (p = 0.040), with two small studies, providing large effect sizes in favour of intermittent dosing. Using the trim and fill method, the adjusted SMD was −0.130 (95% CI: −0.487 to 0.227), indicating there was no significant difference between groups.

The Cochrane risk-of-bias assessments are summarised in Table 2. Notably, no study was assessed as being low risk of bias, four had some concerns and four had a high risk of bias (elaboration of these concerns are detailed in). Post hoc subgroup analyses of studies grouped by high bias or some concerns of bias are shown in, and none showed statistically significant differences between groups across outcomes.

### Premenstrual syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and beyond: a clinical primer for practitioners [^1169FaJZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The management of adverse premenstrual symptoms has presented a difficult challenge for clinicians. However, based on numerous well-designed research studies over the last decade, we now have diagnostic criteria for the severe form of the syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and a variety of evidence-based therapeutic strategies. This review presents a comprehensive, practical description of what the clinician needs to know to diagnose and treat adverse premenstrual symptoms at all levels of severity. Diagnostic criteria are described in detail, including a discussion of the distinction between premenstrual dysphoric disorder and premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The rationale for including prospective symptom calendars as a routine part of the diagnostic evaluation of severe symptoms is presented. The differential diagnosis of cyclic symptoms, including depression and anxiety disorders, menstrual migraine, and mastalgia, and an approach for the management of each of these problems are presented. A treatment approach is recommended that matches the treatment to the degree of problems the woman is experiencing. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the treatment of choice for severe symptoms, and most women with PMS/premenstrual dysphoric disorder will respond to intermittent, luteal phase-only therapy. Ovulation suppression should be reserved for women who do not respond to other forms of therapy. The role of oophorectomy is limited, and guidelines for its use are presented.

### The multifactorial aetiology and management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder with leuprorelin acetate [^116dvhDQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Up to 18% of women of reproductive age may experience symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or its more severe form, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). A plethora of symptoms have been described, but both are commonly associated with other mood-related disorders such as major depression causing significant life impairment. Originally known as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder in the DSM-III-R (American Psychiatric Association 1987), the syndrome was renamed PMDD in the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association 1994). Between 3% and 8% of women meet the diagnostic criteria for PMDD. Currently, there is no consensus on its aetiology although it is thought to be multifactorial. Biological, genetic, psychological, environmental and social factors have all been suggested. However, an altered sensitivity to the normal hormonal fluctuations that influence functioning of the central nervous system is thought most likely. PMDD is identified in the DSM-5 by the presence of at least five symptoms accompanied by significant psychosocial or functional impairment. During evaluation, it is recommended that clinicians confirm symptoms by prospective patient mood charting for at least two menstrual cycles. Management options include psychotropic agents, ovulation suppression and dietary modification. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered primary therapy for psychological symptoms. Ovulation suppression is another option with the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) or GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonists. Rarely symptoms warrant a bilateral oophorectomy and a 6-month trial of GnRH agonists prior to surgery may be prudent to determine its potential efficacy. The authors present the case of a multiparous woman in her mid-30s experiencing severe symptoms during the luteal phase of her menstrual cycle. A trial of the contraceptive pill and SSRIs were unsuccessful. Treatment with leuprorelin acetate (Prostap) improved her symptoms. She therefore elected to undergo a bilateral oophorectomy with resolution of her symptoms. She started hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This case demonstrates the multifactorial aetiology of PMDD and the challenges in its management. Women with PMDD suffer functional impairments comparable with other depressive disorders and yet PMDD and its impact remain under-recognised. As the psychological nature and consequences of PMDD often seem indistinguishable from symptoms of other mental health difficulties, this condition presents distinct diagnostic challenges for healthcare professionals. It is crucial to establish the correct diagnosis using clearly defined criteria because if it is left untreated, it can cause considerable impairment to the woman's quality of life.

### Intermittent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1165Xh7y]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found no differences between intermittent (luteal phase) and continuous dosing of SSRIs for PMDD or severe PMS in terms of response rates, dropout rates and changes in symptom scores. This finding was consistent across all pre-specified subgroup analyses and post hoc sensitivity analyses.

Although previous meta-analyses have concluded that intermittent dosing of SSRIs is more effective than placebo, this is the first analysis of intermittent compared with continuous SSRI dosing, taking all available evidence into account. Compared with the most recent Cochrane review, we were able to include an additional five studies examining response rates and an additional three studies examining symptoms scores. We thus add to the evidence-base that intermittent dosing is as effective as continuous dosing across a range of measures, in support of current guidelines.

Intermittent dosing could be an important treatment option for women who are concerned about long-term withdrawal effects of SSRIs. Since the SSRI is not taken continuously, there will be little or no homeostatic adaption of the serotonergic system to the medication, and therefore, limited risk of receptor downregulation which is thought to underlie SSRI withdrawal symptoms. Evidence from two randomised controlled trials suggests that there are no short-term withdrawal effects associated with intermittent dosing in the context of PMDD. Our results suggest that the choice of intermittent SSRI dosing would not result in less-effective control of symptoms or dropout from treatment.

### Intermittent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^112cgHbT]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test to detect asymmetry. However, given the total number of studies was less than 10 (the minimum number suggested by the Cochrane handbook), we had limited power to detect this particular bias. Significant asymmetry was found for studies reporting symptom changes. An adjusted effect size calculated through trim and fill did not find a difference between the dosing regimens for this outcome. If publication bias for the primary outcomes has gone undetected, small studies showing no differences between groups would be more likely to go unpublished, which would not change our overall results.

Finally, although we did not find statistically significant differences between the intermittent and continuous dosing regimens, this does not necessarily imply that clinically meaningful differences between the groups can be ruled out. There is a wide range of values included in the confidence intervals for the outcomes of response and dropout. Post hoc, using the two one-sided tests procedure to reject a smallest effect size of interest of d = 0.3, the regimes were equivalent only in the outcome of reducing symptoms.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndrome [^111LCrJr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

This is a substantive update of a previous review. Severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affects between 3% to 5% of women of reproductive age. Severe PMS is classified under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are increasingly used as front-line therapy for PMS. A systematic review was undertaken on the efficacy of SSRIs in the management of severe PMS, or PMDD, to assess the evidence for this treatment option.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of SSRIs in reducing premenstrual syndrome symptoms in women diagnosed with severe premenstrual syndrome.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches for relevant randomised controlled trials were undertaken in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and CINAHL (March 2008). Where insufficient data were presented in a report the original authors were contacted for further details.

Selection Criteria

All trials were considered in which women with a prospective diagnosis of PMS, PMDD or late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LPDD) were randomised to receive SSRIs or placebo for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome in a blinded trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Forty randomised controlled trials were identified which reported the use of SSRIs in the management of PMS. Fifty-six trials were excluded. The review authors extracted the data independently and estimated standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

Due to heterogeneity, analyses were subgrouped into change and absolute scores. The primary analysis of reduction in overall symptomatology included data on 2294 women with premenstrual syndrome. SSRIs were found to be highly effective in treating the premenstrual symptoms (SMD -0.53, 95% CI 0.68 to -0.39; P < 0.00001). Secondary analysis showed that they were effective in treating physical (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.22; P < 0.00001), functional (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.17; P < 0.00001), and behavioural symptoms (SMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.29; P < 0.00001). Luteal phase only and continuous administration were both effective and there was no influence of a placebo run-in period on reduction in symptoms. All SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and clomipramine) were effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms. Withdrawals due to side effects were twice as likely to occur in the treatment group (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.92; P < 0.00001).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence supports the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the management of severe premenstrual syndrome.

### Efficacy of open-label placebos for premenstrual syndrome: a randomised controlled trial [^115c2Yyu]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Results

In total, 672 women were assessed for eligibility (see figure 1). Overall, 150 women with moderate to severe PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder, aged between 18 and 45 years, were randomised to either OLP+ (n = 50), OLP– (n = 50), or TAU (n = 50); 145 women completed the trial (96.7%; OLP+ = 48, OLP– = 47, TAU = 50). Of the OLP+ group, two women dropped out, one due to lack of time, and one stopped responding; of the OLP– group, three women dropped out prematurely due to lack of information, intolerance of the OLPs, or pregnancy. Women were on average (± SD) 25.3 ± 5.7 years old, 79 women (52.7%) also fulfilled the criteria of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and 60 women (40%) reported medication intake at baseline. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the three groups were similar at baseline (see table 1).

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^113Ued93]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of physical, psychological and social symptoms in women of reproductive age, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe type of the syndrome, previously known as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LLPDD). Both syndromes cause symptoms during the two weeks leading up to menstruation (the luteal phase). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are increasingly used as a treatment for PMS and PMDD, either administered in the luteal phase or continuously. We undertook a systematic review to assess the evidence of the positive effects and the harms of SSRIs in the management of PMS and PMDD.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of SSRIs in treating women diagnosed with PMS and PMDD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in November 2023. We checked reference lists of relevant studies, searched trial registers and contacted experts in the field for any additional trials. This is an update of a review last published in 2013.

Selection Criteria

We considered studies in which women with a prospective diagnosis of PMS, PMDD or LLPDD were randomised to receive SSRIs or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We pooled data using a random-effects model. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for premenstrual symptom scores, using 'post-treatment' scores for continuous data. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes. We stratified analyses by type of administration (luteal phase or continuous). We calculated absolute risks and the number of women who would need to be taking SSRIs in order to cause one additional adverse event (i.e. the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH)). We rated the overall certainty of the evidence for the main findings using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 34 RCTs in the review. The studies compared SSRIs (i.e. fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram and citalopram) to placebo. SSRIs probably reduce overall self-rated premenstrual symptoms in women with PMS and PMDD (SMD -0.57, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.42; I² = 51%; 12 studies, 1742 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). SSRI treatment was probably more effective when administered continuously than when administered only in the luteal phase (P = 0.03 for subgroup difference; luteal phase group: SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.21; 6 studies, 687 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; continuous group: SMD -0.69, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.51; 7 studies, 1055 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The adverse effects associated with SSRIs were nausea (OR 3.30, 95% CI 2.58 to 4.21; I² = 0%; 18 studies, 3664 women), insomnia (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.63; I² = 0%; 18 studies, 3722 women), sexual dysfunction or decreased libido (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.57 to 3.42; I² = 0%; 14 studies, 2781 women), fatigue or sedation (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.20; I² = 0%; 10 studies, 1230 women), dizziness or vertigo (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.83; I² = 0%; 13 studies, 2633 women), tremor (OR 5.38, 95% CI 2.20 to 13.16; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 1352 women), somnolence and decreased concentration (OR 3.26, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.30; I² = 0%; 8 studies, 2050 women), sweating (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.47; I² = 0%; 10 studies, 2304 women), dry mouth (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.75 to 4.17; I² = 0%; 11 studies, 1753 women), asthenia or decreased energy (OR 3.28, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.98; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 1704 women), diarrhoea (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.08; I² = 0%; 12 studies, 2681 women), and constipation (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.09 to 5.26; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 1022 women). There was moderate-certainty evidence for all adverse effects other than somnolence/decreased concentration, which was low-certainty evidence. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was moderate. The main weakness was poor reporting of study methodology. Heterogeneity was low or absent for most outcomes, although there was moderate heterogeneity in the analysis of overall self-rated premenstrual symptoms. Based on the meta-analysis of response rate (the outcome with the most included studies), there was suspected publication bias. In total, 68% of the included studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. This stresses the importance of interpreting the review findings with caution.

Authors' Conclusions

SSRIs probably reduce premenstrual symptoms in women with PMS and PMDD and are probably more effective when taken continuously compared to luteal phase administration. SSRI treatment probably increases the risk of adverse events, with the most common being nausea, asthenia and somnolence.

### Suicidal risk in women with premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117AZz3n]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Implications for Clinical Practice and Future Directions

Currently, recommendations for women with PMS/PMDD include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, lifestyle modification, and vitamin and herbal supplements. The first-line intervention for PMDD is pharmacotherapy, specifically the administration of serotonin or serotonin- and norepinephrine-based antidepressants. In terms of psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been investigated through a systematic review by Lustyk et al. and the findings showed that CBT was less effective than pharmacotherapy in treating PMDD. While psychotherapy may be useful as adjunctive to pharmacotherapy, the importance of medical treatments for PMDD cannot be understated. Future research should explore multidimensional treatment approaches for individuals with severe premenstrual disturbances, whereby pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy can complement one another to potentially reduce suicidal risk.

### Efficacy of open-label placebos for premenstrual syndrome: a randomised controlled trial [^116uxHrL]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Study population

Trial participants were recruited between March 2018 and December 2020 from the general public, in gynaecologists' practices, and the gynaecological outpatient clinic in the University Hospital of Basel, with flyers and posters advertising 'a novel efficacy study of an integrative and side-effect free intervention against premenstrual strain'. Study recruitment started in March 2018. On 2 August 2018, the first participant was included and randomised, after the last screening procedure at the trial visit. Women between 18 and 45 years were eligible if they suffered from moderate to severe PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder, had a regular MC, and at least one functionally impairing psychological or somatic PMS symptom, warranting treatment. Medication could be continued and was recorded. PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder were assessed by prospective self-reports. Eligibility criteria are listed in the online supplemental appendix.

### Premenstrual dysphoric disorder in an adolescent female [^116iH4ri]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A severe cyclic constellation of affective symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is termed premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Case

A 17-yr-old female was referred for evaluation of behavior changes with her menses. Parents noted behavior changes, two to three days before the onset and lasting till the end of her menses. Menarche was at 13 years. Periods were regular, with normal flow and duration and no dysmenorrhea. Psychosocial history was unremarkable. There was no history of sexual activity or abuse. Her physical exam was unremarkable. With the working diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric syndrome she was asked to keep track of her menses on a menstrual calendar and her symptoms with a daily diary. She was treated with Fluoxetine 20 mg/day during the luteal phase of her menstrual cycle with complete resolution of her symptoms.

Comments

In PMDD the mood disturbance occurs during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (approximately 1 week before the onset of menstrual bleeding), remits after the onset of menses, and can be established by a prospective daily symptom log for two consecutive cycles. The symptoms are more severe than that of premenstrual syndrome, are associated with significant functional impairment and are cyclical. Symptoms were documented prospectively as starting a few days before her menstrual bleeding and remitting at the end of it. She responded to episodic use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This disorder needs to be better recognized, because it can be easily treated.

### Rational treatment choices for non-major depressions in primary care: an evidence-based review [^115SW3bC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This review synthesizes available evidence for managing clinically significant dysphoric symptoms encountered in primary care, when formal criteria for major depression or dysthymia are not met. Discussion is focused on premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and minor depression because of their significant prevalence in the primary care setting and the lack of clear practice guidelines for addressing each illness.

Design

English language literature from prior systematic reviews was supplemented by searching medline, embase, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality National Guideline Clearinghouse, and bibliographies of selected papers. Studies addressing the natural history or treatment of minor depression or PMDD were selected for review. Data were abstracted by 1 of 2 independent reviewers and studies were synthesized qualitatively.

Results

Five individual studies that compared antidepressant or psychological treatments to placebo in patients with minor depression suggest short-term improvements in depressive symptoms with paroxetine, problem-solving therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy, but not with amitryptiline. Modest benefits on mental health function were reported with paroxetine and with problem-solving therapy, but only in patients with severe functional impairment at baseline. Twenty-four controlled trials were identified that compared antidepressant or psychological treatments to placebo in patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Pooled results from a recent systematic review of 15 randomized controlled trials and one additional trial abstract provide strong evidence for a significantly greater improvement in physical and psychological symptoms with serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor medications when compared with placebo. Individual trials also suggest significantly greater improvements in symptom scores with venlafaxine, but not with tricyclic antidepressants.

Conclusions

The limited evidence base for minor depression provides only mixed support for a small to moderate benefit for few antidepressant medications and psychological treatments tested. For the treatment of severe psychological or physical symptoms causing functional impairment in patients with PMDD, sertraline and fluoxetine are clearly beneficial in carefully selected patients.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Zoloft) [^1173rqaF]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In Study PMDD-1, involving 251 randomized patients, (n = 125 on ZOLOFT and n = 126 on placebo), ZOLOFT treatment was initiated at 50 mg/day and administered daily throughout the menstrual cycle. In subsequent cycles, ZOLOFT was titrated in 50 mg increments at the beginning of each menstrual cycle up to a maximum of 150 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and tolerability. The mean dose for completers was 102 mg/day. ZOLOFT administered daily throughout the menstrual cycle was statistically significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline to endpoint on the DRSP total score, the HAMD-17 total score, and the CGI-S score, as well as the CGI-I score at endpoint.
In Study PMDD-2, involving 281 randomized patients, (n = 142 on ZOLOFT and n = 139 on placebo), ZOLOFT treatment was initiated at 50 mg/day in the late luteal phase (last 2 weeks) of each menstrual cycle and then discontinued at the onset of menses (intermittent dosing). In subsequent cycles, patients were dosed in the range of 50–100 mg/day in the luteal phase of each cycle, on the basis of clinical response and tolerability. Patients who received 100 mg/day started with 50 mg/day for the first 3 days of the cycle, then 100 mg/day for the remainder of the cycle. The mean ZOLOFT dose for completers was 74 mg/day. ZOLOFT administered in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle was statistically significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline to endpoint on the DRSP total score and the CGI-S score, as well as the CGI-I score at endpoint (Week 12).

There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome in these studies.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Zoloft) [^114vbqkV]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14.6	Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder

The effectiveness of ZOLOFT for the treatment of PMDD was established in two double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled flexible dose trials (Studies PMDD-1 and PMDD-2) conducted over 3 menstrual cycles in adult female patients. The effectiveness of ZOLOFT for PMDD for more than 3 menstrual cycles has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials.

Patients in Study PMDD-1 met DSM-III-R criteria for Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), the clinical entity referred to as PMDD in DSM-IV. Patients in Study PMDD-2 met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. Study PMDD-1 utilized continuous daily dosing throughout the study, while Study PMDD-2 utilized luteal phase dosing (intermittent dosing) for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses. The mean duration of PMDD symptoms was approximately 10.5 years in both studies. Patients taking oral contraceptives were excluded from these trials; therefore, the efficacy of ZOLOFT in combination with oral contraceptives for the treatment of PMDD is unknown.

Efficacy was assessed with the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), a patient-rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria for PMDD as identified in the DSM-IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms. Other efficacy assessments included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17), and the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scores.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Sertraline) [^1122X9mj]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response in adult patients with PTSD for up to 28 weeks following 24 weeks of open-label treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in adults.

The efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PMDD was established in 2 placebo-controlled trials of female adult outpatients treated for 3 menstrual cycles who met criteria for the DSM-IIIR/IV category of PMDD (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

The essential features of PMDD include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. These symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school or with usual social activities and relationships with others. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders that may be exacerbated by treatment with an antidepressant.

### Premenstrual disorders [^113wavU2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Premenstrual disorders include premenstrual syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and premenstrual worsening of another medical condition. While the underlying causes of these conditions continue to be explored, an aberrant response to hormonal fluctuations that occurs with the natural menstrual cycle and serotonin deficits have both been implicated. A careful medical history and daily symptom monitoring across 2 menstrual cycles is important in establishing a diagnosis. Many treatments have been evaluated for the management of premenstrual disorders. The most efficacious treatments for premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder include serotonin reuptake inhibitors and contraceptives with shortened to no hormone-free interval. Women who do not respond to these and other interventions may benefit from gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment.
