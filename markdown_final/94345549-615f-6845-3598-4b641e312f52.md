## Question

Do fungal infections like ringworm have a higher prevalence in smokers compared to non-smokers?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fungal infections like ringworm have a higher prevalence in smokers compared to non-smokers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precisely what "ringworm" represents clinically and biologically. Then, I should verify whether the provided evidence directly addresses ringworm prevalence by smoking status. Next, I will consider indirect mechanistic plausibility from smoking's effects on immunity and skin barriers. After that, I should review related fungal entities (e.g., onychomycosis, oral candidiasis) for signals that might inform risk. Finally, I will synthesize the strength of evidence and outline what would be needed to answer this definitively, while being careful not to over-extrapolate beyond the data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Ringworm, or tinea, is a superficial dermatophyte infection of skin, hair, or nails caused by Trichophyton, Microsporum, or Epidermophyton species; it is not invasive and is typically diagnosed clinically with KOH prep or culture, and it is very common globally, with estimates that up to 25% of people may have ringworm at some point in life, which underscores its public health relevance when thinking about risk factors [^115AT1vy] [^114gXDoK] [^114XDoqM].

> Wait, let me verify whether any of the supplied studies directly compare ringworm prevalence in smokers versus non-smokers. I need to check carefully for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies that quantify tinea incidence or prevalence by smoking status. Hold on, I should verify this twice: after reviewing the meta-analyses and observational studies provided, I do not find any that specifically evaluate ringworm prevalence or incidence by smoking status, which means there is no direct epidemiologic estimate in this packet to answer the question as posed.

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility, because even without direct data, smoking could theoretically increase susceptibility. Smoking impairs both innate and adaptive immunity, including epithelial barrier function, macrophage and dendritic cell activity, and T-cell responses, which could plausibly facilitate superficial fungal colonization and infection; this immunologic vulnerability is well described in respiratory contexts and is reasonable to extrapolate cautiously to skin and mucosa, though I should acknowledge this is indirect evidence [^111w4gaD] [^113cCjrk].

> Next, I should review related fungal entities for signals that might inform risk. Let me consider onychomycosis, which is a dermatophyte nail infection and thus biologically related to ringworm. The CDC notes onychomycosis is common, especially in older adults and people with diabetes, but the provided materials do not include smoking-specific prevalence comparisons, so I cannot infer a smoking association from this dataset even though diabetes is a recognized risk factor and smoking is common in diabetes populations [^114gXDoK]. I should also note that oral candidiasis is repeatedly linked to smoking in HIV and other contexts, reinforcing that smoking-related mucosal immunity changes can promote fungal overgrowth, but again, this is not ringworm and must not be conflated with dermatophyte skin disease [^116tE4m3] [^114EpNd7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought I saw a meta-analysis linking smoking to "fungal infections" that might include ringworm, but wait, I should double-check the scope of that meta-analysis. On review, the meta-analysis addresses invasive fungal disease (e.g., aspergillosis, cryptococcosis), not superficial dermatophytoses like ringworm, so it does not provide prevalence estimates for tinea by smoking status and cannot be used to answer this question directly, even though it supports a broader smoking–fungal risk signal in invasive disease contexts [^111ZKXcf].

> Let me synthesize the evidence quality. Direct evidence: absent in this packet. Indirect evidence: biologically plausible via smoking-induced immune and barrier dysfunction, with supportive but non-generalizable signals from oral candidiasis and invasive fungal disease literature. Overall, I should conclude that based on the provided references, there is no direct epidemiologic answer to whether ringworm prevalence is higher in smokers, even though mechanistic reasoning suggests it could be, which leaves this as an evidence gap rather than a confirmed association [^111w4gaD] [^113cCjrk] [^111ZKXcf].

> But wait, what if we are missing population-level dermatology data that separate smokers and non-smokers. I need to ensure I state the limitation clearly: the absence of direct comparisons in the supplied materials does not prove there is no association; it only means we cannot quantify it here. Ideally, we would need a large cohort or case-control study of tinea diagnoses with smoking exposure ascertainment, adjusted for confounders like age, diabetes, occupational exposures, and socioeconomic status, to answer this question definitively.

> In practical terms, I should confirm that clinicians still counsel on modifiable risks and recognize that smoking impairs immune defenses. Smoking cessation is prudent for many reasons, and while we cannot claim a proven increase in ringworm risk from this dataset, the general immunosuppressive effects of smoking provide a reasonable rationale to consider smoking as a potential contributor to susceptibility in patients with recurrent or severe superficial fungal infections, pending stronger epidemiologic data [^111w4gaD] [^113cCjrk].

---

I can't find direct evidence that smokers have a higher prevalence of ringworm (tinea) than non-smokers. However, smoking impairs both innate and adaptive immunity [^111w4gaD] and damages skin barriers, which could plausibly increase susceptibility to superficial fungal infections [^113bBbg8]. Indirect evidence links smoking to higher risks of other fungal infections (e.g. oral candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis) [^116tE4m3] [^111ZKXcf], but **no studies in the provided sources specifically quantify ringworm prevalence by smoking status**. Given this gap, I can't conclude a definitive association, but the biological rationale suggests a potential risk increase that warrants further study.

---

## Biological plausibility

Smoking has well-documented effects on the immune system and skin integrity, which could theoretically increase susceptibility to ringworm:

- **Immune suppression**: Smoking impairs both innate and adaptive immunity, reducing the body's ability to fight off infections, including fungal pathogens [^111w4gaD] [^113cCjrk].

- **Skin barrier dysfunction**: Smoking damages the skin barrier, making it easier for fungi to penetrate and establish infection [^113bBbg8].

- **Microenvironmental changes**: Smoking alters the skin's microenvironment, potentially favoring fungal growth and colonization [^116UZdA4].

---

## Indirect evidence linking smoking to fungal infections

While direct evidence specific to ringworm is lacking, several studies have demonstrated an association between smoking and other fungal infections:

- **Oral candidiasis**: Smoking is a recognized risk factor for oral candidiasis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as those with HIV [^116tE4m3] [^114EpNd7].

- **Invasive fungal infections**: Smoking has been associated with an increased risk of invasive fungal infections, including aspergillosis and cryptococcosis, particularly in immunocompromised populations [^111ZKXcf] [^111CWK1x].

- **Cannabis smoking**: Cannabis use has been linked to an increased risk of fungal infections, possibly due to immunosuppressive effects and exposure to fungal contaminants [^115imCFt] [^1153bVVY].

---

## Epidemiological evidence specific to ringworm

A comprehensive review of the provided literature reveals **no direct epidemiological studies** specifically investigating the association between smoking and ringworm prevalence. The available studies focus on other fungal infections or general immune effects of smoking, leaving a significant gap in the evidence base.

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Given the lack of direct evidence, clinicians should consider the following:

- **General infection risk**: Smoking increases susceptibility to various infections, and patients who smoke should be counseled on the potential risks, including possible increased susceptibility to fungal infections [^111w4gaD] [^113cCjrk].

- **Smoking cessation**: Encouraging smoking cessation is essential, as it improves overall immune function and reduces the risk of numerous infectious diseases [^113cCjrk] [^112QdyYG].

- **Further research**: There is a clear need for epidemiological studies specifically investigating the association between smoking and ringworm prevalence.

---

## Conclusion

There is **no direct evidence** in the provided literature that smokers have a higher prevalence of ringworm than non-smokers. However, given the known immunosuppressive effects of smoking and its association with other fungal infections, it is plausible that smoking could increase susceptibility to ringworm. Further research is needed to establish a definitive link.

### Smoking as a risk factor of invasive fungal disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ZKXcf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

To investigate the association between smoking and invasive fungal disease (IFD), we searched MEDLINE and Web of Science for studies published until September 2018. Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction. Relative risks (RRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. We included 25 studies (18 171 participants; 2527 IFD cases). The meta-analysis showed an increased risk of IFD in smokers (RR 1.41 [95% confidence interval 1.09–1.81]; P = 0.008). The risk of IFD was higher in retrospective than in prospective studies (RR 1.93 [1.28–2.92] vs. 1.02 [0.78–1.34]; P = 0.04), in studies with multivariate adjustment compared to studies with univariate analysis (RR 2.15 [1.27–3.64] vs. 1.15 [0.88–1.51]; P = 0.06), and in studies published after 2002 (RR 2.08 [1.37–3.15] vs. 0.95 [0.75–1.22]; P = 0.008); other subgroup characteristics did not significantly influence the association in metaregression. Smoking cessation strategies should be implemented, especially in patients who are already at risk for IFD.

### How cigarette smoke skews immune responses to promote infection, lung disease and cancer [^111w4gaD]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2009). Medium credibility.

A complex and multilayered immune defence system protects the host against harmful agents and maintains tissue homeostasis. Cigarette smoke exposure markedly impacts the immune system, compromising the host's ability to mount appropriate immune and inflammatory responses and contributing to smoking-related pathologies. These adverse effects on the immune system not only occur in active smokers, but also in those exposed to smoke passively in contaminated environments, and may persist for decades after exposure has ended.

### Cigarette smoking and mechanisms of susceptibility to infections of the respiratory tract and other organ systems [^113cCjrk]. The Journal of Infection (2013). Low credibility.

The predisposition of cigarette smokers for development of oral and respiratory infections caused by microbial pathogens is well recognised, with those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at particularly high risk. Smoking cigarettes has a suppressive effect on the protective functions of airway epithelium, alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells and adaptive immune mechanisms, in the setting of chronic systemic activation of neutrophils. Cigarette smoke also has a direct effect on microbial pathogens to promote the likelihood of infective disease, specifically promotion of microbial virulence and antibiotic resistance. In addition to interactions between smoking and HIV infection, a number of specific infections/clinical syndromes have been associated epidemiologically with cigarette smoking, including those of the upper and lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous and other organ systems. Smoking cessation benefits patients in many ways, including reduction of the risk of infectious disease.

Introduction

The advent of and increased access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV from a deadly disease to a chronic condition for many people living with HIV. With ART, people living with HIV can now have a near-normal life expectancy. However, unhealthy behaviours such as tobacco use threaten to undermine some of the gains that have been made. Smoking increases the risk of death among people living with HIV. A studyamong 924 HIV-positive women on ART in the USA reported an increased risk of death due to smoking with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.53 (95% CI 1.08–2.19). A prospective cohortof 17 995 HIV-positive individuals from Europe and North America receiving ART found a mortality rate ratio of 1.94 (95% CI 1.56–2.41) for smokers when compared with non–smokers. The average years of life lost by HIV-positive smokers compared with HIV-positive non-smokers have been estimated as 12.3 years, which is more than twice the number of years lost by HIV infection alone.

People living with HIV are more susceptible to tobacco-related illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and pulmonary disease when compared with those who are HIV-negative or with the general population. Furthermore, smoking among people living with HIV increases susceptibility to infections such as bacterial pneumonia, oral candidiasis, and tuberculosis. A case-control studyamong 279 ART-naive HIV-positive men in South Africa found that current smoking tripled the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.2; 95% CI 1.3–7.9, p = 0.01). Smoking also increases the risk of developing AIDS (HR 1.36; 95% CI 1.07–1.72) among people living with HIV. This increased susceptibility has been mainly attributed to biochemical mechanisms including the immunosuppressive effects of smoking and its negative impact on immune and virological response even when on ART. Behavioural mechanisms have also been suggested — for example, an association between smoking and non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy.

### Smoking and HIV: time for a change? [^114EpNd7]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

However, further studies are needed to investigate how long the risk of current smoking remains elevated after stopping before the benefits of cessation become manifest.

There is increasing evidence that smoking may also have a major direct impact on pulmonary vasculature and studies suggested that tobacco smoke causes a pulmonary vascular remodelling that resembles that occurring in patients with pulmonary hypertension, a rare but severe manifestation in the course of HIV disease, leading to right ventricular failure and, ultimately, death.

Smoking has also been demonstrated to be a significant risk factor for TB. Recent meta-analyses indicated that in the general population smokers are almost twice as likely to be infected with TB (relative risk (RR) around 1.5 for latent TB infection) and to progress to active disease (RR around 2.0 for TB disease).

The risk of developing TB is over 20 times greater in HIV-positive patients than among those who do not have HIV infection. If smoking increases the impact of TB in HIV-negative patients, its effect in HIV-positive patients may be significantly greater, with a deleterious synergistic interaction between smoking, HIV and TB.

HIV-positive patients who smoke have an increased risk of a variety of opportunistic infections, including oral and esophageal candidiasis. Some studies have also identified smoking as a risk factor for Pneumocystis pneumonia, even though this association has not been evidenced in the study by De et al.

A number of malignancies have also been associated with HIV infection. For example, HIV-positive patients are at increased risk for many cancers associated with human papillomavirus, including cancer of the cervix, anus, vulva, vagina, penis, oral cavity and pharynx. However, previous findings of an association between cigarette smoking and abnormal anal cytological abnormalities among both HIV-positive women and men, have not been more recently confirmed.

Lung cancer is the most important cause of non-AIDS-defining malignancy in HIV-positive patients. Although a number of studies have demonstrated that HIV infection is associated with a significantly increased risk for developing lung cancer, independently of smoking status, smoking may additionally increase lung cancer risk. For HIV-positive patients in the SMART study, the adjusted hazard ratio for lung cancer for current versus never smokers was 9.4.

HIV-positive patients may be at greater risk for metabolic bone disease, including osteopenia and osteoporosis. Smoking has been associated with an increased risk of loss of bone density, and is an independent risk factor for fractures among HIV-positive patients.

### Assessing secondhand smoke using biological markers [^112mbmvX]. Tobacco Control (2013). Low credibility.

Toenail nicotine and metabolites

Toenail nicotine concentration shows promise for SHSe assessment, as it reflects relatively long exposure periods: depending on the length of the clipping, the concentration can represent up to several months of past exposure (toenails grow at a rate of approximately 1 mm/month). In one study, toenail nicotine concentrations strongly predicted self-reported exposure, even after 20 years' storage at room temperature. Similar to hair samples, toenails can be collected easily and shipped without temperature restrictions.

Toenails are less directly exposed than hair to environmental nicotine, with concentrations only reflecting nicotine taken up from blood circulation by nails during growth. Slow toenail growth rates overcome day-to-day exposure variability and provide potentially more stable estimates of average exposure, which is critical to assessing long-term exposures. In one study, toenail nicotine concentrations were significantly correlated with reported tobacco smoking (r = 0.63). They are also predictive of high and low SHSe among non-smokers; in newborns, fingernails and toenails have been used to determine nicotine exposure in utero.

Population data on toenail biomarker concentrations are not available, and determining normative population concentrations is critical to relating these concentrations to disease risk and tobacco exposure. Given the low nicotine concentration per mg of toenail, collecting clippings from all 10 toenails is recommended. Age is inversely related to toenail nicotine concentrations in women, even after controlling for cigarette consumption and SHSe frequency, while nail fungus infection and nail polish do not appear to influence concentrations or exposure. No data exist on toenail nicotine concentrations relating to gender or race. Laboratory methods to analyse nicotine in toenail samples include high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) (LOD of 0.1 ng/mg toenail), or GC-MS (LOD range 0.025–0.01 ng/mg toenail).

Preventing recurrence of bacterial respiratory infections — Patients with HIV should receive pneumococcal (AI) and influenza vaccines (AI) as recommended; antibiotic chemoprophylaxis generally is not recommended specifically to prevent recurrences of bacterial respiratory infections because of the potential for development of drug-resistant microorganisms and drug toxicity (AI); smoking cessation reduces the risk of bacterial pneumonia (by approximately 27%), and patients who smoke tobacco should be encouraged to quit.

### Cannabis use and fungal infections in a commercially insured population, United States, 2016 [^115imCFt]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this large commercially insured population in the United States, cannabis use was associated with a higher prevalence of certain fungal infections. Although these infections were uncommon, they can result in substantial illness and even death, particularly in immunocompromised persons.

Several hypotheses could explain our findings. First, on the basis of immunocompromised status and hospitalizations, persons who used cannabis appeared to be sicker than persons who did not use cannabis and were therefore presumably at higher risk for fungal infections in general. Some persons who used cannabis might be using medical cannabis to help manage their underlying conditions. In this analysis, it was not possible to determine the source of infection, although contaminated cannabis has been previously implicated in aspergillosis, mucormycosis, and cryptococcal meningitis. We are not aware of any reports of blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, or coccidioidomycosis acquired from contaminated cannabis. However, a small risk likely exists; 1 histoplasmosis outbreak occurred in a cannabis field, and fomites, such as hay and vegetables, are involved in rare coccidioidomycosis cases. Another possible explanation is that smoking-induced structural and immunological lung damage confers increased susceptibility to infection, although the lung effects of cannabis might differ from those of tobacco. Confounding by tobacco smoking might be another explanation because tobacco use is typically more common among persons who use cannabis. Tobacco can also be contaminated with fungi, possibly to a lesser extent than cannabis.

Determinants of risk in tobacco dependence — The prevalence of cigarette smoking among U.S. adults remains unacceptably high, young people continue to experiment and become addicted, and there is a pronounced heterogeneity in tobacco use between demographic groups; an adaptation of the classic epidemiological triad of host, environment, and agent, linked by the vector, is used to study these disparities such that the cigarette is the agent, the host is the candidate (or current) smoker, the environment encompasses inputs promoting or opposing tobacco dependence, and the industry is a true vector.

### NKT cells: the smoking gun in fungal-induced asthma? [^112ni2pA]. Nature Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Aspergillus fumigatus is a fungus that is associated with a severe form of asthma, although the precise immunological basis for this disease is unclear. A new study in mice shows that natural killer T (NKT) cells are crucial for progression of A. fumigatus–induced asthma and also identifies a glycolipid antigen from this fungus that seems to drive this NKT cell–mediated inflammatory response (pages 1297–1304).

### Social determinants of health as drivers of fungal disease [^111CWK1x]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Substance use, crime, and incarceration

Substance use has been associated with a number of IFIs. Injection drug use (IDU) is a common cause of bacterial and, less frequently, fungal endocarditis. The latter is mainly caused by Candida spp. followed by Aspergillus spp. and rarely Histoplasma spp. or other endemic fungi, and mucormycosis. Cigarette smoking has been associated with an increased risk for coccidioidomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and cryptococcosis. Smoking marijuana has been linked to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, possibly due to Aspergillus -contaminated leaves from the Cannabis sativa plant. In one study, persons who use cannabis were 3.5 times more likely to develop an IFI compared to non-cannabis users. Electronic cigarette use or vaping has been associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis infectionand Candida albicans growth in the gingiva of the oral cavity.

Multiple studies have shown increased risk for coccidioidomycosis infection for incarcerated individuals in areas endemic for Coccidioides spp. such as in the Central Valley in California, as well as state prisons in other regions in California. Those who are incarcerated are more likely to be men and BIPOC individuals as Black or African American men between ages 20 to 34 have the highest rate of incarceration in the U.S. In addition, compared to the general population, incarcerated individuals are more likely to have high blood pressure, asthma, cancer, arthritis, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV, and hepatitis C infection.

### Indoor bacterial and fungal aerosols as predictors of lower respiratory tract infections among under-five children in ibadan, Nigeria [^114oaKXv]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The high microbial concentrations and diversity recorded in homes of under-five children with LRTI could be attributable to the high occupant density, reduced ventilation and high indoor RH. A modest positive correlation was recorded between indoor microbial exposure indices and indoor RH which was corroborated with previous reports by Frankel et al. who found that indoor RH correlated positively with indoor fungal exposure (r = 0.32, p = 0.002). Increased relative humidity contributes to microbial survival, and antigenic potential from fungi, and can better facilitate the direct-contact transfer of microorganisms. Even though the microbial concentrations and diversity in the current study was not significantly correlated with occupant density, a number of studies have established that occupancy is associated with increased microbial concentrations, and diversity and abundance of human-associated microbes in indoor environment. This incongruity is probably due to the nature of the environment where these studies were carried out.

Also, we observed that child characteristics such as history of LRTI, > 1 under five sibling and non-exclusive breastfeeding, and household characteristics such as house ownership, high occupant density, and use of dirty cooking fuels in the household were independently associated with LRTI risk among under-five children which are consistent with previous epidemiological studies. Environmental Tobacco smoking (ETS) was not found to be significantly associated with LRTI risk but was a potential risk factor. This is possibly because smoking is not encouraged in the environment where the current study was carried out, therefore only very few individuals reported their smoking status. Notably, even after adjusting for these important factors, all microbial exposure indices remained significantly linked to LRTI risk among under-five children.

The median age of subjects recorded in the current study suggests that most of the under-five children with LRTI were below 12 months of age. This is similar to the report by Ahmed et al. in their study to assess the risk factors for acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) among hospitalized children under-five in Northern Nigeria. They reported children between 2 to 12 months of age to have accounted for 56.0% of hospitalization due to ALRTI. Studies in other developing countries such as Ethiopia and Rwanda also showed similar findings. The preponderance of male sex among under-five children with LRTI observed in the current study is also similar to previous studies on LRTI among under-five children.

### Smoking and HIV: time for a change? [^115RByGd]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Smoking as a risk factor for AIDS- and non-AIDS diseases

With the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), which resulted in a reduction of AIDS -related diseases and deaths, serious non-AIDS diseases, including CV diseases, pulmonary diseases and cancers have become more common in HIV-positive patients. The prevalence of these co-morbidities is higher among HIV-positive patients than among individuals of the same age in the background population, suggesting a synergistic effect of underlying behavioral and pathological conditions.

Not unexpected, smoking may even further increase the risk for occurrence of these diseases (Table 1); for example, in the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs Study Group, the largest observational study of CV risk on HIV-positive on ART that demonstrated an association between the risk of MI and combination ART, particularly protease inhibitor therapy, it has been shown that the adjusted relative rate of MI per years of exposure to protease inhibitors was 1.16, compared to 2.83 for current smoking.

Table 1
Clinical conditions influenced by smoking in HIV-positive patients

More recently, in the Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) study, HIV-positive current smokers had a two-fold risk of major cardiovascular events as compared to non-smokers.

Respiratory complications of smoking include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory infections, such as bacterial pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), and HIV infection may increase susceptibility to both of these.

Cigarette smoking is a major trigger for COPD in the general population as well as in the HIV population, and studies of HIV-positive patients have identified a clear association between bacterial pneumonia and smoking, with an over two-fold risk of bacterial pneumonia in HIV-positive current smokers as compared to non-smokers.

In a research article published in BMC Medicine, Preeti De and colleagues conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies to assess whether smoking cessation reduces the incidence of both bacterial pneumonia and Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-positive patients. The authors provide evidence that HIV-positive current smokers are at increased risk for bacterial pneumonia than former smokers. Moreover, there is no evidence that HIV-positive former smokers were at higher risk than never smokers, indicating that smoking cessation reduces this risk. Thus, smoking cessation programs should be systematically integrated into HIV care.

### Can switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco products reduce consequences of pulmonary infection? [^113owr7b]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

While there are many forms of tobacco products, the smoking of combustible cigarettes is the most common form of tobacco consumption worldwide. Smoking cigarettes is a significant risk factor for the development of numerous diseases, including cancers, respiratory, cardiovascular, and oral diseases. Inhalation of cigarette smoke causes pulmonary inflammation and detrimental changes in the airway epithelium, resulting in lung damage. It has also been well-documented that smoking cigarettes suppresses and slows down pulmonary clearance of acute bacterial infections and exacerbates infection-induced lung inflammation and damage, enhancing susceptibility to respiratory infections. Evidence from the literature clearly supports smoking cessation as an efficient way to reduce the detrimental effects of cigarette smoke on pulmonary function and immunity to respiratory infections.

Although e-cigarettes are the most popular alternatives to combustible cigarettes, all major tobacco companies have recently introduced heated tobacco products (HTPs), also called heat-not-burn (HnB) products, to the global market. HTPs and e-cigarettes are different in the way that they deliver nicotine. E-cigarettes heat a nicotine solution while HTPs heat the tobacco. Since tobacco is not burnt in HTPs, the levels of emitted harmful and potentially harmful chemicals (including many respiratory toxicants) are significantly reduced compared to levels found in cigarette smoke. According to industry claims, HTPs were designed as potential harm-reducing products for adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes. Philip Morris International (PMI), the largest manufacturer of cigarettes, launched its HTP in 2016 under the IQOS brand name. IQOS is available in 73 markets worldwide. In the US, IQOS was authorized for marketing as a modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) on July 7, 2020 and is expected to be available on the US market in mid-2024. According to PMI estimates, as of February 9, 2023, 17.8 million adult smokers globally have already switched to its IQOS HTP and completely stopped smoking cigarettes.

### Smoking and the outcome of infection [^114Z1mSb]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Smoking has substantial local and systemic adverse effects on the immune system, respiratory tract and skin and soft tissues. Smokers are at increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, periodontitis, surgical infections, tuberculosis, influenza and meningococcal disease. The results of several studies indicate that smokers with periodontitis or tuberculosis suffer more severe disease. Data on the impact of smoking on sepsis and pneumonia are controversial and limited, and systematic data regarding the outcome of the majority of infections in smokers are scarce. Abundant data indicate that children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) suffer from more severe infections. However, information regarding the effects of ETS on the outcome of infections in adults is limited. Various aspects of the relation between smoking and the outcome of bacterial infection (e.g. potential dose-dependent effects and the interactions between smoking and other environmental factors that may affect the course of infectious diseases) remain to be established.

### The influence of cigarette smoking on viral infections: translating bench science to impact COPD pathogenesis and acute exacerbations of COPD clinically [^113bWnxU]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

COPD is a complex syndrome that poses a serious health threat to > 1.1 billion smokers worldwide. The stable disease is punctuated by episodes of acute exacerbation, which are predominantly the result of viral and bacterial infections. Despite their devastating health impact, mechanisms underlying disease exacerbations remain poorly understood. Mounting evidence suggests that cigarette smoke profoundly affects the immune system, compromising the host's ability to mount appropriate immune and inflammatory responses against microbial agents. This review highlights recent advances in our understanding of the impact of cigarette smoke on type 1 interferon and IL-1 signaling cascades. The immune defects caused by cigarette smoke on these two key pathways contribute to the seemingly contradictory nature of cigarette smoke as both a damaging and a proinflammatory factor as well as an immunosuppressive factor. Understanding the impact of cigarette smoke on the immune system may unravel novel targets for therapies that could affect acute exacerbations and COPD pathogenesis.

### Are indoor molds causing a new disease? [^115Nu4am]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Three mechanisms for disease caused by mold-infection, allergy, and toxicity-are established and well recognized by clinicians. In each case the corresponding diseases are specific to a particular fungus. The mechanisms involved include a recognized inflammatory pathology that leads to objective clinical evidence of disease. Recent widespread litigation has arisen out of an unproved assertion that exposure to indoor molds causes an ill-defined illness. This illness is characterized by the absence of objective evidence of disease and by the lack of a defined pathology. There is usually no specificity for the involved fungus purported to cause the illness. Those publications that claim such an illness are reviewed. They are found to lack scientific validity, often on the basis of faulty methodology and insufficient information. There is no coherent clinical description for the presumed illness. Recommendations are offered for published reports and studies to address this problem.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: influence of smoking cessation on incidence of pneumonia in HIV [^116nqAwa]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Life expectancy in patients with HIV has improved dramatically in the era of highly active antiretroviral treatments (HAART), which can prevent the decline in CD4 lymphocyte count and AIDS related morbidity and mortality. However, persons with HIV still face substantially increased health risks compared with the general population. Another threat to health is that the prevalence of cigarette smoking is high amongst people with HIV at around 50% to 70%. Given that many people smoke due to nicotine dependence rather than a desire to smoke and that highly cost-effective treatments for nicotine dependence are available, offering smoking cessation treatment to patients with HIV could be an important component of routine clinical care. Currently, smoking cessation support is not routine. The case for offering cessation treatment as part of HIV care rests upon evidence that smoking cessation leads to improved outcomes specific to this population.

Smoking is a risk factor for bacterial pneumonia in the absence of HIV and without evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, it is unclear whether the elevated risk due to smoking is ameliorated by smoking cessation. Many people in the general population who develop pneumonia do so without pre-existing conditions and therefore do not receive regular medical assessment and treatment. However, people with HIV undergo regular review with the prime aim of preventing opportunistic infection. Pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV, and is one of the most frequent AIDS defining illnesses. If smoking constitutes a risk factor for pneumonia among patients with HIV and if smoking cessation ameliorates that risk, then active management of smoking in people with HIV is supported. The best evidence of causality that smoking cessation ameliorates risk would come from randomized trials of smoking cessation support versus usual care where the outcomes included incidence of pneumonia. We identified no such trials. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies to assess whether smoking cessation reduces the incidence of both bacterial pneumonia and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) in patients with HIV infection, and looked for evidence of a dose-response relationship to support causality. Furthermore, we examined whether there was evidence that any risk from smoking or benefit from cessation was modified by the use of HAART or by CD4 count.

### Aspergillus spp. colonization in exhaled breath condensate of lung cancer patients from puglia region of Italy [^111bTaab]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lung airways are perpetually exposed to inhaled particulate materials that include pollens, viruses, bacterial and fungal spores. While many of these particles are innocuous, some spores have the potential to germinate and cause invasive lung diseases. A recent theory suggests that infections could also trigger lung cancerogenesis. This hypothesis has been formulated mainly for viruses, although it has been not excluded that also bacteria and fungi could be involved.

If it is possible that the infections could cause lung cancer, it is sure that the lungs of subjects with cancer are particularly susceptible to infection that significantly compromises the patient's prognosis. The spectrum of pulmonary infections depends on the underlying immunologic deficit or deficits, whereas fungal infections are common if neutropenia persists.

Lung cancer is also characterized by airways inflammation, that usually follows cigarette smoking which is likely to play a role in cancer transformation. The inflammatory status also further compromises host lungs, promoting tissue invasion and systemic dissemination of the infection.

### Coccidioidomycosis and COVID-19 Co-infection, United States, 2020 [^114rK4XK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

We review the interaction between coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and coccidioidomycosis, a respiratory infection caused by inhalation of Coccidioides fungal spores in dust. We examine risk for co-infection among construction and agricultural workers, incarcerated persons, Black and Latino populations, and persons living in high dust areas. We further identify common risk factors for co-infection, including older age, diabetes, immunosuppression, racial or ethnic minority status, and smoking. Because these diseases cause similar symptoms, the COVID-19 pandemic might exacerbate delays in coccidioidomycosis diagnosis, potentially interfering with prompt administration of antifungal therapies. Finally, we examine the clinical implications of co-infection, including severe COVID-19 and reactivation of latent coccidioidomycosis. Physicians should consider coccidioidomycosis as a possible diagnosis when treating patients with respiratory symptoms. Preventive measures such as wearing face masks might mitigate exposure to dust and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, thereby protecting against both infections.

### Smoking and HIV: time for a change? [^112ixYk7]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Cigarette smoking is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in the general population, and is a well-recognized risk factor for a variety of serious clinical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases and cancers. Smoking-related morbidity and mortality are of particular concern in patients with HIV infection, as the prevalence of current cigarette smoking is higher among HIV-positive patients than among the general population. In a study by De et al., it has been evidenced that smoking is a risk factor for bacterial pneumonia in HIV-positive patients and smoking cessation reduces this risk. HIV-positive patients who smoke have significantly increased mortality compared to those who have never smoked, indicating that smoking confers different mortality risk in HIV-positive as compared to HIV-negative patients, and lifestyle-related factors may pose a greater hazard to long-term survival of HIV-positive patients than those related to the HIV infection per se. The high prevalence of smoking among HIV population, the many health risks that can result from this behavior, and the proven efficacy of cessation interventions in HIV-positive patients should encourage HIV care providers to make smoking cessation a high priority.

### Cannabis use and fungal infections in a commercially insured population, United States, 2016 [^1153bVVY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Forty (0.08%) of 53,217 persons who used cannabis and 6,294 (0.03%) of 21,559,558 persons who did not use cannabis had a fungal infection (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% CI 1.9–3.5). After adjusting for age and immunocompromised status, the adjusted OR (aOR) was 3.5 (95% CI 2.6–4.8). Specifically, persons who use cannabis were more likely than persons who did not use cannabis to have mold infections (0.03% vs. 0.01%; OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.1–5.3, aOR 4.6, 95% CI 2.9–7.4) and other fungal infections (0.04% vs. 0.02%; OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4–3.3, aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.9–4.5).

Among patients with fungal infections, persons who used cannabis were significantly younger than persons who did not use cannabis (median age 41.5 years vs. 56.0 years; p < 0.001), more likely to be immunocompromised (43% vs. 21%; p < 0.001), more likely to be hospitalized on the fungal infection diagnosis date (40% vs. 13%; p < 0.001), and more likely to have tobacco use codes (40% vs. 9%; p < 0.001) (Table). Sixty percent (n = 24) of persons who used cannabis and had fungal infections had cannabis abuse or dependence codes, compared with 79% of persons who used cannabis and did not have fungal infections, and 48% (n = 19) of persons who used cannabis and had fungal infections had unspecified cannabis use codes, compared with 29% of persons who used cannabis and did not have fungal infections. Persons who used cannabis and had fungal infections and unspecified cannabis use codes were older (median age 52 years vs. 28 years) and more frequently immunocompromised (63% vs. 25%) than persons who used cannabis and had dependence codes.

Conclusion

Tobacco smoking confers a significant risk for severe COVID‐19 which leads to ICU necessity or death. However, it is unlikely the lung that mediates the risk. Rather, the great severity may more likely be a result of immune suppression by accumulated smoking.

HIV-associated bacterial pneumonia — risk modifiers and vaccination recommendations include that ART and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole used for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis have been associated with decreases in risk, whereas lower CD4+ T cell count and cigarette smoking increase risk; the prevalence of smoking is high with many smoking more than 1 pack per day; Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent etiology with increased bacteremia and mortality; and current guidelines recommend the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine, especially when CD4+ counts are greater than 200 cells/μl.

### Three cases of cutaneous blastomycosis in immunocompetent patients [^113g7gNH]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite taking days to weeks, microbiologic culture of specimens remains the standard for diagnosis. Direct microscopic visualization of organisms, that is, the characteristic yeast, in cytologic and histologic specimens is most commonly used for rapid blastomycosis diagnosis. However, fungal culture should be paired with histopathology to ensure accurate diagnosis, as seen in the second case.

When blastomycosis was diagnosed in the 2 teenage patients, immunodeficiency was suspected but later ruled out. Although Blastomycoses can infect immunocompetent individuals, it is more reported in immunocompromised individuals who experience increased severity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, especially when diagnosis is delayed. Our work highlights the need to entertain this diagnosis in immunocompetent patients with consistent pulmonary and cutaneous clinical findings.

The rise in blastomycosis among immunocompetent individuals is unclear, although cannabis use has been suggested as a factor. In addition to contamination by species like cryptococcus, mucor, and aspergillus, smoking-induced structural and immunological damage to the lungs increases susceptibility to infection. Vitamin A deficiency, as seen in Case 1, also weakens immunity, making individuals more prone to opportunistic fungal infections.

### The sputum microbiome is distinct between COPD and health, independent of smoking history [^117WUVvW]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

A limitation of this study is that the lung microbiome has been analysed from sputum samples which can be contaminated with the microbiome of the oropharynx. However, we emphasise that this effect will have been limited by sputum plug selection for the analysis. We did not perform longitudinal sampling to demonstrate reproducibility of the sputum microbiome over time in healthy participants. For COPD we have previously demonstrated that the sputum microbiome is comparable between time-points when sampling at their stable state. The effects on the microbiome of using sputum induction as the predominant sampling technique in the healthy control group are also not known, but it is noteworthy that the predominant bacterial constituents of our healthy microbiome are consistent with the respiratory microbiome detected by investigating BAL and bronchial samples reported in previous studies. This suggests that our observations are robust and representative of the bacterial composition of the lung microbiome. A major incentive to work with sputum is its compatibility with routine clinical practice as any findings are therefore more readily translated into established care pathways. In this study we have not characterized the viral and fungal communities, and this will be important to understand their role in health and disease.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society policy statement: disparities in respiratory health [^113mSUfk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Respiratory health disparities — risk factors and environmental exposures are detailed, emphasizing population differences: Outdoor air pollution is usually greater in urban areas and most strongly affects people who live and work near its sources, and racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to live in cities with poorer air quality and therefore experience a disparately larger impact. Indoor air pollution from smoky cooking fires is more common in rural areas and, along with ambient cigarette smoke, is a major factor contributing to respiratory illness in the world. Human immunodeficiency virus infection is a major risk factor for pulmonary disease; in the United States, racial and ethnic minorities, with the exception of Asian–Pacific Islanders, experience disproportionately higher rates of infection than whites, and men who have sex with men are also at higher risk. Environmental exposures and occupational hazards affect the lungs more than other organs and occur disproportionately in ethnic minorities and those with lower economic status, and persons using unhealthy substances are less likely to practice other healthy behaviors, such as having annual influenza vaccinations. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals have higher smoking rates than the average across the population.

### Bacterial and fungal microflora in surgically removed lung cancer samples [^111nzPar]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, with 1.35 million incident cases annually, and consists one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. In addition to cigarette smoking, the major lung cancer risk factor, recent studies underscore an etiologic role for chronic pulmonary infection in lung carcinogenesis, acting either independently or as a cofactor to tobacco smoke in increasing lung cancer risk. Experimental and clinical data correlate cancer development with the presence of certain pathogens, independently of chemotherapy-induced leucopenia. Indeed, mycoplasma is one of the most often observed pathogen in lung carcinomas, and it has been postulated that mycoplasma-infected cells have a higher ability to metastasize in vivo than non-mycoplasma-infected cells. Very similarly, the bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae, a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, has been implicated in lung carcinogenesis. Staphylococcus strains likewise have been observed in many cases of patients with lung cancer. Other studies have demonstrated the presence of colonies in respiratory tract in patients with cancer; Haemophilus influenza and Candida albicans have been found in patients with lower respiratory tract malignancies. Legionella pneymophila has been diagnosed in patients with cancer, as well as strains of Bacillus, Listeria, and Streptococcus.

Importantly, previous retrospective and prospective studies have relied on serologic characterization of chronic bacterial and fungal infections. To the best of our knowledge, the prevalence of bacterial and/or fungal infection in surgically extracted samples of patients with lung cancer has not been previously reported. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to determine the presence of bacterial and fungal microflora in surgically removed tissue samples of patients with lung cancer, by using PCR methods and special primers.

### Risk factors for cryptococcus gattii infection, British columbia, Canada [^113WgMMB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Three outdoor activities — chopping wood, pruning, and cleaning up branches — were protective against infection. The reason for this is not clear because these activities would potentially have exposed the person to C. gattii in trees. Ongoing low-level exposure possibly results in immunity, preventing symptomatic infection if the person is exposed to a higher dose. More likely, these more vigorous activities are undertaken by healthy persons and reflect a general state of wellness rather than a protective effect of these specific behaviors. In contrast, outdoor building repairs represented a risk factor for infection. This may have been due to the disturbance of rotting wood colonized with C. gattii. Environmental experiments in British Columbia have demonstrated substantially increased airborne concentrations of C. gattii when colonized trees are felled or chipped.

Population comparisons suggest that significantly more C. gattii– infected case-patients are current smokers. Because smoking compromises the protective barriers in airways, it has been linked to increased risk for many lung infections. A previous study of AIDS patients with C. neoformans infection, which identified smoking as a risk factor for disseminated disease, suggested that fungus may be inhaled along with smoke particulates and deposited in small airways. Air-sampling studies of C. gattii in British Columbia have found that the airborne propagule is sufficiently small to be deposited in the upper lung (i.e. from 3.3 μm to > 7 μm.

### NLRP3 inflammasome: a key player in the pathogenesis of life-style disorders [^116UZdA4]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Oral diseases

Oral diseases include a number of oral pathologies and medical conditions, such as periodontal disease, tooth loss, oral cancer, dental caries, and orodental trauma. Oral health is associated with the prevalence of other chronic diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, oral diseases are significantly associated with adverse behavioral factors, such as tobacco use and the consumption of sugary foods and beverages (Fig. 4). Complexes of bacterial species that secrete inflammatory cytokines cause periodontal infections. Initially, as a defense response, these cytokines help eliminate pathogenic microbes. However, excessive levels of inflammatory cytokines are contraindicated owing to the destruction of collagen, resorption of the alveolar bone, and loss of periodontal attachment. Chronic inflammatory conditions known as periodontitis affect the alveolar bone between the teeth and the surrounding connective tissue. These effects cause a gradual loss of the periodontium and the development of periodontal pockets and gingival recession. This cascade leads to tooth extraction. NLRP3 influences alveolar bone loss in ligature-induced periodontitis via osteoclast differentiation. MCC950, a specific NLRP3 inhibitor, suppresses alveolar bone loss by decreasing IL-1 activation and osteoclast differentiation in ligature-induced periodontitis. This finding supports the involvement of NLRP3 in periodontitis. Oropharyngeal candidiasis and oral leukoplakia are two main oral medical conditions that are increasingly prevalent in the smoking population and are implicated in the generation of a number of oxidizing agents, including ROS, in the oral cavity. Smoking can alter the oral microbiome environment, harming the structural integrity and function of the epithelial barrier of the mouth, which acts as the body's first line of protection against fungal infections. Treatment of liposaccharide-G–induced inflammatory cellular models with the natural antioxidant ascorbic acid reduced the activity of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1β. This finding demonstrated the role of antioxidants in the immunomodulation of inflammatory pathways. Smoking results in oxidative stress and an imbalance in the cellular redox state, which in turn indirectly suppresses the phagocytic activity initiated by the immune system and impacts chemotaxis, kinesis, and cell signaling. Consistent with the results of previous studies, Ye et al. demonstrated a connection between smoking and the suppression of Candida albicans -induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and proinflammatory cytokine production via Nrf2 signaling. In vitro studies revealed that Nrf2 not only inhibits the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-18) but also negatively regulates the expression levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 p20. These effects destabilize the antifungal defenses of the oral mucosa and induce oropharyngeal candidiasis and oral leukoplakia. Thus, Nrf2 is an important target protein that regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

### Is smoking tobacco an independent risk factor for HIV infection and progression to AIDS? A systemic review [^116Pk6NZ]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To systematically review the evidence of the relation between smoking tobacco and HIV seroconversion and progression to AIDS.

Methods

A systematic review was undertaken of studies to look at tobacco smoking as a risk factor for either HIV seroconversion or progression to AIDS.

Results

Six studies were identified with HIV seroconversion as an outcome measure. Five of these indicated that smoking tobacco was an independent risk factor after adjusting for important confounders with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.6 to 3.5. 10 studies were identified using progression to AIDS as an end point of which nine found no relation with tobacco smoking.

Conclusions

Tobacco smoking may be an independent risk factor for HIV infection although residual confounding is another possible explanation. Smoking did not appear to be related to progression to AIDS although this finding may not be true in developing countries or with the longer life expectancies seen with highly active antiretroviral therapy.

Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that environmental factors such as infections, smoking and vitamin D are associated with the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Some of these factors also play a role in the MS disease course. We are currently beginning to understand how environmental factors may impact immune function in MS on a cellular and molecular level. Here we review epidemiological, clinical and basic immunological studies on the environmental factors, viral and parasitic infections, smoking, and vitamin D and relate epidemiological findings with their likely pathophysiology in MS.

### Cannabis use and fungal infections in a commercially insured population, United States, 2016 [^113bR6aa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Our results could also reflect medical coding artifacts. In general, cannabis use is likely greatly underrepresented by ICD codes, supported by the finding that < 0.3% of our study population had cannabis use codes, whereas ≈9% of the US population reported using cannabis in the past month. Although ICD-10-CM codes cannot distinguish between medical and recreational cannabis use, the higher frequency of immunocompromising conditions and older age among persons who use cannabis and persons who used cannabis and had unspecified cannabis use codes suggests medical cannabis use among some of these patients. We were also unable to differentiate smoking cannabis from other modes of use (e.g. ingestion), which is relevant because smoking might lead to greater fungal exposure through inhalation. Injection drug use, which also might be more common among persons who use cannabis, is an emerging risk factor for some fungal infections, such as invasive candidiasis, although this mode of acquisition seems less likely for the fungal infections described here, which are typically acquired through inhalation. Another limitation is that we did not evaluate immunocompromised status associated with medications such as corticosteroids and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors.

The similar geographic distribution of fungal infections between persons who use cannabis and persons who did not use cannabis is notable because state laws vary substantially regarding medical and recreational use. There is more legalization overall in the western and northeastern United States.

Despite the limitations inherent in administrative data and our inability to infer causality between cannabis use and fungal infections, our study adds to emerging evidence about this association. This finding is consistent with a recommendation that solid organ transplant recipients avoid smoking cannabis. Patients with other immunocompromising conditions should be also aware of the possible link between cannabis smoking and fungal infections and might also consider avoiding this exposure. Physicians should remain aware of the possible link between fungal infections and cannabis use.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia in HIV — prevention of recurrence: Patients with HIV should receive pneumococcal (AI) and influenza vaccines (AII) as recommended. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis generally is not recommended specifically to prevent recurrences of bacterial respiratory infections because of the potential for development of drug-resistant microorganisms and drug toxicity (AI). Smoking cessation reduces the risk of bacterial pneumonia by approximately 27%, and patients who smoke tobacco should be encouraged to quit and provided with the appropriate tools and referrals whenever possible (AI). Likewise, patients with substance use disorders should be referred for appropriate counseling and services (AI). Likely the most important intervention for prevention of bacterial pneumonia (first episode or recurrence) is initiation and adherence to ART, which is beneficial even among those with high CD4 count at time of ART initiation, and thus prompt initiation or re-initiation of ART is recommended for all patients with HIV with bacterial pneumonia (AI).

### HIV and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: is it worse and why? [^115kDf2N]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

Smoking-related diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are of particular concern in the HIV-infected population. Smoking rates are high in this population, and long-term exposure to cigarette smoke in the setting of HIV infection may increase the number of complications seen. Before the era of combination antiretroviral therapy, HIV-infected persons were noted to have an accelerated form of COPD, with significant emphysematous disease seen in individuals less than 40 years old. Unlike many of the AIDS-defining opportunistic infections, HIV-associated COPD may be more common in the current era of HIV because it is frequently reported in patients without a history of AIDS-related pulmonary complications and because many aging HIV-infected individuals have had a longer exposure to smoking and HIV. In this review, we document the epidemiology of HIV-associated COPD before and after the institution of combination antiretroviral therapy, review data suggesting that COPD is accelerated in those with HIV, and discuss possible mechanisms of HIV-associated COPD, including an increased susceptibility to chronic, latent infections; an aberrant inflammatory response; altered oxidant-antioxidant balance; increased apoptosis associated with HIV; and the effects of antiretroviral therapy.

### Ringworm and fungal nail infections basics… [^115AT1vy]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Ringworm is a common fungal infection of hair, skin, or nails.
- Athlete's foot, jock itch, and most fungal nail infections are forms of ringworm.
- On the skin, it usually causes an itchy, red, ring-shaped rash.
- Nail infections may cause nails to change colors, become thick, and break easily. What it is Ringworm is a common fungal infection of the hair, skin, or nails. It gets its name because it causes a ring-shaped, itchy, red rash. Skin infections Skin infections are more common on certain parts of the body like on the foot or groin. Ringworm on feet is often referred to as athlete's foot. Ringworm on the groin is often called jock itch. Nail infections Ringworm is also a common type of fungal nail infection. It can cause nails to change colors, become thick, and break easily.

Although infections are much more common in toenails, fingernails can get infected. Causes Ringworm is caused by fungi. The scientific names for the most common fungi that cause ringworm are Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. Ringworm is very common and can be spread by:

- Skin-to-skin contact with people or animals with the infection
- Shared objects
- Shared surfaces. Risk factors include:

- Use of public showers or locker rooms without protective footwear
- Participating in contact sports like wrestling
- Wearing tight shoes and socks
- Excessive sweating
- Close contact with animals Anyone can get ringworm, but people who have weakened immune systems may be especially at risk for infection. They may also have problems fighting off a ringworm infection. Learn more about how to prevent ringworm.

Treatment The treatment for ringworm depends on its location on the body and how serious the infection is. Some forms of ringworm can be treated with non-prescription antifungal medications. However, other forms of ringworm need treatment with prescription antifungal medication.

### Evaluation of smoking as a modifying factor in chronic rhinosinusitis [^115jNhz3]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The negative association of smoking with the respiratory tract is well known; however, the association between smoking and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has not been well characterized.

Objective

To analyze whether active smoking was a risk factor for CRS development, smoking was associated with disease-specific quality of life, and smokers experience an increased symptom burden than nonsmokers.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This subanalysis of the Chronic Rhinosinusitis Epidemiology Study (CRES), a prospective, questionnaire-based case-control study conducted between October 2007 and September 2013 was conducted across 30 UK tertiary/secondary care sites. Participants were identified at ear, nose, and throat outpatient clinics and classified into CRS phenotypes as per European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2012 criteria. The overall response rate of those identified to take part in the study was 66%. A total of 1535 questionnaires were returned, with 1470 considered eligible for inclusion. Data analysis was conducted in January 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The CRES was designed to distinguish differences in socioeconomic status, geography, medical comorbidities, lifestyle, and quality of life between patients with CRS and healthy controls.

Results

A total of 1450 patients completed the smoking question, comprising 219 controls (15.1%; mean [SD] age, 47.3 [14.9] years; 143 women [68%]), 546 participants with CRS (37.7%; mean [SD] age, 51.8 [15.3] years; 259 women [53%]) without nasal polyps (CRSsNPs), and 685 participants (47.2%; mean [SD] age, 56.0 [14.5] years; 204 women [33%]) with CRS and nasal polyps/allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (CRSwNPs+). The mean age was similar, with a greater female preponderance in the control group and male in the CRSwNP group. The greatest number of active smokers was found among control participants (33 [15%]), with a lower rate of smokers in the patients with CRSwNPs+ (9.9%) and CRSsNPs (13.9%), respectively. We found a clinically significant difference in the mean difference in Sino-nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) scores between active smokers and nonsmokers for both CRS phenotypes (4.49, 12.25). In both CRS subgroups active smokers had significantly worse SNOT-22 scores than nonsmokers by a mean (SD) magnitude of 10 (18.99, 24.14) points. Nonsmokers also demonstrated a higher percentage of surgical procedures (1 or more), although this was not clinically or statistically different (0.34, 1.10).

Conclusions and Relevance

This questionnaire-based case-control study demonstrated a clinically significant symptom burden associated with active cigarette smoking, with worse SNOT-22 scores in the smoking cohort by a mean magnitude of 10 points. We could find no demonstrable evidence that smoking increases the likelihood of need for revision sinus surgery. Clinicians should encourage smoking cessation alongside general CRS medical management.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^113ejr9t]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) risk factors and environmental exposures — population and setting associations are summarized as follows: There are no consistent findings to suggest that male or female sex affects AD risk, but being of black race does appear to increase risk. A higher level of parental education is a risk factor for disease, but the effect of socioeconomic status is unclear; previous studies found a higher risk of AD in higher socioeconomic groups, but more recent studies failed to confirm these findings. Living in urban areas appears likely to increase the risk of AD, but studies attempting to identify causative environmental agents have not been conclusive. Daycare may influence the risk of AD development, but studies that offer better control for confounders are needed before additional conclusions can be made. The effect of exposure to pets is unclear, with conflicting data; two recent studies have shown that cat but not dog ownership enhanced the effect of filaggrin mutations in promoting the development of AD. While patients with AD are often sensitized to house dust mites, there is not strong evidence to show that dust mite avoidance strategies prevent AD. The most recent systematic review regarding early life microbial exposures found evidence that exposures to endotoxin, farm animals, and dogs may protect against AD. The consumption of unpasteurized milk and acquired helminth infections may also be protective, but are not recommended measures because of their potential associated health risks. No definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding early antibiotic exposure and the risk of AD. Although studies are inconsistent, personal and second hand/household smoking status do not appear to significantly affect AD development; however, smoking is detrimental to those with asthma and has many other negative health risks.

### Tobacco smoking and hand eczema-is there an association? [^114a8HVe]. Contact Dermatitis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous risk factors have been suggested for hand eczema. This systematic review evaluates the association between tobacco smoking and hand eczema.

Objective

To review the literature systematically on the association between smoking and hand eczema.

Methods

The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched up to 27 January 2015 for articles on the association between tobacco smoking and hand eczema, including human studies in English and German only. Experimental studies, studies on tobacco allergy, case reports, reviews and studies on second-hand smoking were excluded.

Results

Twenty articles were included. Among studies in occupational settings, three of seven found a statistically significant positive association between tobacco smoking and hand eczema prevalence rate, as did four of eight population-based studies. The association was stronger for studies in occupational settings than for population-based studies. No studies reported tobacco to be a clear protective factor for hand eczema. Two of five studies regarding severity found a positive association between smoking and hand eczema severity.

Conclusion

Overall, the data indicate that smoking may cause an increased frequency of hand eczema, particularly in high-risk occupations. However, data from studies controlling for other risk factors are conflicting, and few prospective studies are available. Studies controlling for other risk factors are needed, and information regarding the diagnosis of subclasses of hand eczema, as well as severity, may be important.

### Aspergillus fumigatus is responsible for inflammation in a murine model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [^1111qpNp]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents the third leading cause of death worldwide. The most important cause of COPD is environmental whereby cigarette smoking plays a critical role. Tobacco smoking-induced COPD corresponds to a chronic altered inflammatory response resulting in lung parenchyma destruction and emphysema development. Cigarette smoke (CS) contains numerous toxic products that alter various immunological functions. For example, there is a marked recruitment of alveolar macrophages but their phagocytic function and cytokine production are disrupted; likewise, the ability of epithelial cells to respond to infection is also altered. Conversely, abnormally activated immune cells secrete inflammatory mediators that will directly or indirectly breakdown lung structural architecture, impacting its physiological function.

COPD exacerbations, characterized by dyspnea and/or cough, are associated to cardio-vascular comorbidity and their frequency is associated with an accelerated lung function decline and high mortality rate. Exacerbations are primarily due to infections by bacteria, viruses, or fungi such as Aspergillus fumigatus.

A. fumigatus is a saprophytic airborne fungal pathogen, that may cause diseases such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), aspergilloma or chronic pulmonary aspergillosis in pathological lungs, and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in immunocompromised individuals.

An association between exposure to Aspergillus spores and symptoms associated with airway inflammation has been found. In COPD patients, Aspergillus is also found in a third of respiratory samples and A. fumigatus sensitization has been associated with frequent exacerbations, deterioration of lung function and poor clinical prognosis. Fungal colonization or infection has been reported to be associated with COPD exacerbations, but the role of fungal agents in the COPD pathogenesis as well as in exacerbations remains unclear and is still debated.

The objective of the present study was to investigate whether COPD could worsen after exposure to A. fumigatus spores (AFsp). To this end, mono- and co-cell culture models of both murine alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages, were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and/or CSE and AFsp to identify their role in inflammatory responses. We then established a mouse model of chronic cigarette smoke (CS) exposure with or without two spaced instillations of AFsp to investigate in vivo lung inflammation and tissue changes.

### Microglia and amyloid precursor protein coordinate control of transient Candida cerebritis with memory deficits [^114B5umd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Regardless of any possible link to AD, we have shown that transient fungemia in healthy mice has important physiological consequences, including alterations in working memory. Although transient after a single episode, it is conceivable that intermittent fungal showering of the vascular space and attendant low-grade fungal cerebritis that occurs over timeframes of years could eventually lead to permanent brain damage and lasting cognitive defects. More importantly, our findings suggest that resolution of low-grade CNS fungal infections through the use of antifungals and other means might preclude or even reverse attendant cognitive decline.

For long-term fungal bloodstream showering to occur, however, a peripheral site of chronic infection is also required. C. albicans and other Candida species comprise the normal microbial flora and such commensal organisms are unlikely to disseminate hematogenously. However, multiple common medical practices conspire to alter the normal fungal microbiome or the immune system, leading to pathological enlargement of the human fungal biomass, often at mucosal sites. Such practices include the overuse of antibiotics, corticosteroids, hygiene products that disrupt potentially protective mucosal biofilms, and proton pump inhibitors that neutralize candidacidal stomach acid. Consequently, the esophagus and more distal gastrointestinal tract may become highly colonized with Candida spp. a pathological condition that leads to systemic spread of the fungi, that in some cases leads to symptomatic fungal infections of the lung, liver, spleen, and kidneys. Our studies have shown that the CNS is also readily infected during low-grade candidemia, with important acute histologic and physiologic consequences.

The physiologic impact of chronic systemic fungal dissemination is not known, but the general importance of chronic organ inflammation due to unresolved infections and particulate, e.g. nanoparticulate carbon black derived from cigarette smoke, exposures is chronic inflammation and organ destruction that can be fatal if not checked. Thus, although a single low-grade challenge with C. albicans is quickly resolved and results in only transient physiologic derangement as shown here, the broader concern with chronic fungemia is diffuse end-organ injury, which in the CNS could include substantial neuronal loss and long-term, progressive cognitive impairment. Our findings thus support the creation of in vivo models that permit dissecting the impact of chronic candidemia on CNS integrity and function. Such models are likely to improve our understanding of chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as AD.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111n6Q4j]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Cessation of smoking and vaping and avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke — risks and clinical advice are as follows: Cigarette smoking has multiple deleterious effects in people with established asthma, in addition to its other well-known effects such as increased risk of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease; and, with exposure in pregnancy, increased risk of asthma and lower respiratory infections in children. In people with asthma (children and adults), exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increases the risk of hospitalization and poor asthma control; active smoking is associated with increased risk of poor asthma control, hospital admissions and, in some studies, death from asthma; increased rate of decline of lung function and may lead to COPD; and reduced the effectiveness of inhaled and oral corticosteroids. After smoking cessation, lung function improves and airway inflammation decreases, and reduction of environmental tobacco smoke exposure improves asthma control and reduces hospital admissions in adults and children. Use of e-cigarettes (vaping) is associated with an increased risk of asthma symptoms or diagnosis and with an increased risk of asthma exacerbations. Advice includes: At every visit, strongly encourage people with asthma who smoke to quit and provide access to counseling and, if available, to smoking cessation programs (Evidence A); strongly encourage people with asthma who vape to quit; strongly encourage people with asthma to avoid environmental smoke exposure (Evidence B); advise parents/caregivers of children with asthma not to smoke or vape and not to allow smoking or vaping in rooms or cars that their children use (Evidence A); and assess patients with a > 10 pack-year smoking history for COPD or for asthma+COPD, as additional treatment strategies may be required.

### Clinical overview of ringworm and fungal nail infections… [^114gXDoK]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Ringworm is a common epidermis infection caused by dermatophyte fungi.
- Ringworm spreads through skin contact among people and animals or by fomites.
- Onychomycosis occasionally leads to serious secondary bacterial infections, especially in people with diabetes.
- Use of diagnostics is recommended before prescribing antifungal treatment.
- Antimicrobial-resistant ringworm and onychomycosis are an emerging public health concern. Types The most common species of fungi that cause ringworm are Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. Ringworm is characterized by the part of the body affected. Skin infections Ringworm is often described by the site of the body affected. Examples include:

- Ringworm of the scalp
- Ringworm of the groin
- Ringworm on the feet.

Nail infections Onychomycosis is the term for fungal nail infections. It can be caused by ringworm or by infection with other types of fungi such as yeasts. Onychomycosis can affect the fingernails or toenails, but onychomycosis of the toenails is more common. How it spreads Symptoms usually start 4–14 days after exposure. Ringworm also sometimes spreads from one part of the body to another. Ringworm of the skin is spread through:

- Direct skin contact with people and animals who are infected.
- Sharing personal items.
- Contact with moist surfaces, like shower stall or locker room floors. Ringworm of the nail s usually spreads through a small cut in the skin around the nails. Infections on the foot or between toes are common with nail infections. Disease rates It is estimated that up to 25% of people in the world may experience ringworm at some point in their lifetime.

Onychomycosis is estimated to affect around 14% of the general population and is especially common in older adults. People with diabetes are at increased risk for fungal nail infections.

### Epidemiology of lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1178KULB]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Key factors associated with lung cancer risk (Table 1) emphasize that the single most important causal determinant of individual and population risk is active smoking of cigarettes and other tobacco products; individual risk increases with greater number of cigarettes smoked per day and greater number of years of smoking, and population prevalence of current smokers predicts lung cancer occurrence with a latency period of about 20 y. Other risk factors causally associated with lung cancer include secondhand smoke exposure, ionizing radiation (including radon), occupational exposures (eg, arsenic, chromium, nickel, asbestos, tar, and soot), and indoor and outdoor air pollution. Additional clinical risk indicators include older age, male sex (particularly among those of African American ancestry), family history of lung cancer, acquired lung disease (eg, COPD, TB, pneumoconioses, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and systemic sclerosis), occupational exposures (such as to silica dust), and HIV infection. Examples of associations with consistent evidence but causal role not presently established include fruit and vegetable intake (decreased risk), physical activity (decreased risk), and marijuana smoking (not associated with risk).

### Effects of smoking on non-AIDS-related morbidity in HIV-infected patients [^114yWQxd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Tobacco smoking has many adverse health consequences. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection smoke at very high rates, and many of the comorbidities associated with smoking in the general population are more prevalent in this population. It is likely that a combination of higher smoking rates along with an altered response to cigarette smoke throughout the body in persons with HIV infection leads to increased rates of the known conditions related to smoking. Several AIDS-defining conditions associated with smoking have been reviewed elsewhere. This review aims to summarize the data on non-AIDS-related health consequences of smoking in the HIV-infected population and explore evidence for the potential compounding effects on chronic systemic inflammation due to HIV infection and smoking.

### Update: interim guidance for health care providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected E-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury-United States, October 2019 [^111TurUP]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Medical treatment. Corticosteroids might be helpful in treating this injury. Several case reports describe improvement with corticosteroids, likely because of a blunting of the inflammatory response. In a series of patients in Illinois and Wisconsin, 92% of 50 patients received corticosteroids; the medical team documented in 65% of 46 patient notes that "respiratory improvement was due to the use of glucocorticoids". Among 140 cases reported nationally to CDC that received corticosteroids, 82% of patients improved (Table). However, the natural progression of this injury is not known, and it is possible that patients might recover without corticosteroids or by avoiding use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products. In some circumstances, it would be advisable to withhold corticosteroids while evaluating patients for infectious etiologies, such as fungal pneumonia, that might worsen with corticosteroid treatment. Nevertheless, because the diagnosis remains one of exclusion, aggressive empiric therapy with corticosteroids, antimicrobial, and antiviral therapy might be warranted for patients with severe illness. A range of corticosteroid doses, durations, and taper plans might be considered on a case-by-case basis. Whenever possible, decisions on the use of corticosteroids and dosing regimen should be made in consultation with a pulmonologist.

### Protecting children and adolescents from tobacco and nicotine [^111QRJPK]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Tobacco smoke/aerosol exposure harms children (Quality of Evidence: High) and remains common among people who do not smoke, with an estimated 1 in 4 people who do not smoke, or approximately 58 million individuals, still regularly exposed; among children, exposure prevalence disparities include non-Hispanic Black people 50.3%, less than a high school education 30.7%, living in poverty 47.9%, rental housing 38.6%, and living with someone who smoked inside the home 73.0%. Parents and caregivers with tobacco use disorder are important sources, and the home is the place where children are most exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS), with children in homes where smoking is allowed having higher levels of cotinine than those in homes where smoking is not allowed. The aerosol produced by e-cigarettes contains many of the same toxins identified as harmful to human health as identified in secondhand smoke, and based on this evidence, the Surgeon General's report recommended prohibiting e-cigarette use in enclosed areas to avoid probable harm because of secondhand and thirdhand aerosol exposure. Thirdhand smoke is the ultrafine particulate matter and residue left behind in indoor environments after tobacco combustion, with components including nicotine, tobacco-specific carcinogens, and other toxicants; the toxicants from e-cigarette devices are similar to toxicants in combusted tobacco. Children can absorb, ingest, and inhale these substances, and young children may have greater exposure because toddlers commonly explore by placing objects in their mouth; environmental data indicate tobacco-related carcinogens in house dust at levels sufficient to increase the risk of cancer, and hand nicotine exposure in children of parents who smoke is associated with increased risk of respiratory illnesses, with emerging evidence of thirdhand smoke exposure even among infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) despite hospital prohibitions.

### Bronchopulmonary dysplasia as a determinant of respiratory outcomes in adult life [^112FGtZz]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

Respiratory disease is unfortunately common in preterm infants with the archetype being bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD affects approximately 50,000 preterm infants in the U.S. annually with substantial morbidity and mortality related to its pathology (alveolar, airway, and pulmonary vasculature maldevelopment). Predicting the likelihood and severity of chronic respiratory disease in these children as they age is difficult and compounded by the lack of consistent phenotyping. Barriers to understanding the actual scope of this problem include few longitudinal studies, information limited by small retrospective studies and the ever-changing landscape of therapies in the NICU that affect long-term respiratory outcomes. Thus, the true burden of adult respiratory disease caused by premature birth is currently unknown. Nevertheless, limited data suggest that a substantial percentage of children with a history of BPD have long-term respiratory symptoms and persistent airflow obstruction associated with altered lung function trajectories into adult life. Small airway disease with variable bronchodilator responsiveness, is the most common manifestation of lung dysfunction in adults with a history of BPD. The etiology of this is unclear however, developmental dysanapsis may underlie the airflow obstruction in some adults with a history of BPD. This type of flow limitation resembles that of aging adults with chronic obstructive lung disease with no history of smoking. It is also unclear whether lung function abnormalities in people with a history of BPD are static or if these individuals with BPD have a more accelerated decline in lung function as they age compared to controls. While some of the more significant mediators of lung function, such as tobacco smoke and respiratory infections have been identified, more work is necessary to identify the best means of preserving lung function for individuals born prematurely throughout their lifespan.

### Protecting children and adolescents from tobacco and nicotine [^112gj7ef]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Tobacco smoke exposure — other respiratory infections in infants and children (quality of evidence: high) shows that secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure increases the risk of influenza, pneumonia, and acute respiratory illnesses, with evidence sufficient to infer a causal relationship; in those 2 years and younger, a meta-analysis reported increased risk of lower respiratory tract infection from smoking by any household member (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.40–1.69), paternal smoking (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.10–1.35), maternal prenatal smoking (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.45–1.73), and maternal postnatal smoking (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.11–1.38); a Vietnam survey of approximately 25 000 households with a child younger than 5 years found that having 1 or more household smokers was associated with hospitalization for pneumonia in the prior 12 months (aOR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.25–1.92); and among 117 children younger than 15 years hospitalized for influenza, SHS exposure was linked to greater ICU admission risk (aOR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.4–18.5) and longer length of stay (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2–2.3).

### About fungal diseases… [^111KaszP]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Common fungal diseases are ringworm, nail infections, and vaginal yeast infections.
- Some fungi in the environment cause pneumonias.
- Hospitalized patients can get severe, often deadly, fungal diseases like Candida aurisinfections and candidemia.
- Fungal diseases are often misdiagnosed which can delay appropriate antifungal treatment.
- Increasing antimicrobial resistance limits treatment options. Types Common infections Two common fungal infections are ringworm and vaginal yeast infections. Ringworm typically causes a ring-like rash and spreads easily between people and from pets to people. The same fungi that cause ringworm can cause jock itch, athlete's foot, and nail infections. Most women get a vaginal yeast infection at least once in their lives. Vaginal yeast infections are caused by overgrowth of a yeast called Candida in the vagina. Everyone has Candida in and on their body; it only causes symptoms when it grows out of control.

Environmental pneumonias Other types of fungal infections spread in the environment and can cause pneumonia. Three of these infections, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis spread in different parts of the United States. Infections are caused by breathing in fungal spores from soil or dust. Many people breathe in the spores without ever getting sick but some people develop severe illness. Mold infections Molds are a type of fungus that can live in indoor or outdoor environments. Two of the most common mold infections are mucormycosis and aspergillosis. These molds are everywhere and typically do not cause illness. However, people with weakened immune systems can get infected. There are different types of mucormycosis and aspergillosis, but lung infections are the most common.

HIV/AIDS-associated infections Some fungal infections are much more common among people living with HIV/AIDS. Two well-known fungal infections associated with HIV/AIDS in the United States are oral candidiasis and Pneumocystis pneumonia. Worldwide, cryptococcal meningitis and histoplasmosis are major causes of illness in people living with HIV.

### Demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with fungal infection risk, United States, 2019 [^113eNAiM]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Fungal Infections and Risk Conditions by Age

Fungal infection diagnosis rates among senior patients were 1.3 (95% CI 1.3–1.3) times that for adult patients. We noted moderate elevation in the rate of invasive aspergillosis diagnoses among senior patients, but noninvasive candidiasis was diagnosed more frequently (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.4–1.4) among senior than adult patients (Figure 10, panel A; Appendix Table 4). Fungal infections diagnosed less frequently in senior than adult patients included coccidioidomycosis (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.6–0.6), cryptococcosis (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.5–0.5), histoplasmosis (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7–0.8), mucormycosis (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5–0.6), and pneumocystosis (RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.4–0.4). Senior patients had > 1 fungal-associated risk condition diagnosed at 1.6 (95% CI 1.6–1.6) times the rate of adult patients (Figure 10, panel B). We also noted elevated rates of COPD (RR 2.4, 95% CI 2.4–2.4), myelodysplastic syndrome (RR 7.2, 95% CI 7.0–7.3), and pneumonia (RR 2.1, 95% CI 2.1–2.1) among senior patients compared with adult patients. Few senior patients had a cystic fibrosis diagnosis, and HIV (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.2–0.2) diagnoses also were lower than among adult patients.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: influence of smoking cessation on incidence of pneumonia in HIV [^114vDpg4]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Smoking is common in people infected with HIV but cessation support is not a routine part of clinical care. The aim was to assess whether smoking is a risk factor for pneumonia in people with HIV and whether smoking cessation ameliorates excess risk.

Methods

We performed MEDLINE and Embase database searches and included cohort or case-control studies conducted in adult patients infected with HIV extracting a hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR) that compared the incidence of bacterial pneumonia or pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP) between two smoking categories. Studies were appraised for quality and combined using inverse variance meta-analysis.

Results

Fourteen cohort and case-control studies were included. Assessment of outcome was good, but assessment of exposure status was poor. Current smokers were at higher risk of bacterial pneumonia than former smokers: HR 1.37 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 1.78). There was no evidence that former smokers were at higher risk than never smokers: HR 1.24 (95%CI: 0.96, 1.60). Current smokers were at higher risk of bacterial pneumonia than current non-smokers: HR of 1.73 (95%CI: 1.44, 2.06). There was no evidence that smoking increased the incidence of PCP. The HR for current versus non-smokers was 0.94 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.12), but from case-control studies the OR was 1.76 (95%CI: 1.25, 2.48) with heterogeneity. Confined to higher quality studies, the OR was 0.97 (95%CI: 0.81, 1.16). Residual confounding is possible, but available data suggest this is not an adequate explanation.

Conclusions

Smoking is a risk factor for bacterial pneumonia but not PCP and smoking cessation reduces this risk.

### Ringworm information for healthcare professionals… [^114XDoqM]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Ringworm Information for Healthcare Professionals Definition and sources of infection Ringworm, also called "tinea" or "dermatophytosis, " is a common infection of the epidermis caused by dermatophyte molds. People can acquire ringworm through direct skin contact with people and animals who are infected. People can also acquire ringworm by sharing personal items or through contact with surfaces found in moist areas. Ringworm can also spread from one part of the body to another. Diagnostic testing Potassium hydroxide preparation Clinicians can use a potassium hydroxide preparation of skin scrapings or nail clippings to confirm a diagnosis of ringworm. This test can provide rapid results, but the test's accuracy depends on clinician experience and technique. 2 Fungal culture Fungal culture can be used to diagnose ringworm.

Fungal culture is more specific than KOH stain, but results may take several weeks. 3, 4. Ultraviolet light Ultraviolet light can be useful for diagnosing ringworm caused by Microsporum canis and Microsporum audouinii. Although both species fluoresce blue-green under a Wood's lamp, these species are uncommon causes of ringworm infections in people. Treatment failure Most ringworm infections improve with antifungal treatment, but treatment failure may occur. Common reasons for treatment failure may include incorrect diagnosis and inadequate treatment. Clinicians should counsel patients on the importance of taking antifungal medications as prescribed.

### Recent tobacco smoking is associated with poor HIV medical outcomes among HIV-infected individuals in New York [^1132Xir5]. AIDS and Behavior (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable mortality in the United States. Between 2005 and 2009, roughly 480,000 deaths occurred each year due to cigarette smoking and/or exposure to tobacco smoke. Although the prevalence of smoking in the general population has decreased from 42% in 1965 to 18% in 2012, a high prevalence of smoking persists among people living with HIV (PLWH). Studies have reported smoking prevalence estimates for PLWH that are approximately two to three times greater than those for the general population, ranging from 40.5 to 74%.

In the era of widely available and effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals can approach that of individuals who are uninfected. Recent studies, however, have found that smoking may offset these increases in survival among PLWH. In a nationwide population-based cohort study of PLWH in Denmark, both AIDS-related and non-AIDS-related mortality rates were higher among smokers compared to non-smokers. Other studies with PLWH have demonstrated associations between smoking and an increased risk of health conditions including cancer, bacterial pneumonia, opportunistic infections, and cardiovascular disease. As the population of PLWH ages, it is increasingly important to understand how behaviors, such as smoking, impact HIV disease progression.

Smoking has also been linked with decreases in CD4 cell count. Feldman et al. observed that, after an initial increase in CD4 cell count and percentage among HIV-infected smokers, both values eventually decreased below the levels among HIV-infected non-smokers. However, several studies have found no significant relationship between smoking and CD4 cell count.

The few studies that have examined the effect of smoking on viral suppression have yielded similarly mixed results. In a cross-sectional study of 56 HIV-infected and uninfected women, Wojna et al. observed an association between current smoking and higher viral load. Feldman et al. also found that smokers had a lower chance of achieving a viral response (i.e. a decrease in HIV-1 RNA to ≤ 80 copies/mL), and had a greater chance of developing viral failure (i.e. an HIV-1 RNA increase to > 1000 copies/mL after an initial viral response), in a longitudinal cohort study of low-income women receiving ART. Miguez-Burbano found that viral responses to ART were attenuated in cigarette smokers. However, one study found no significant relationship between smoking and viral load.

### Epidemiology of lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112SWkTc]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology of lung cancer — risk factors, modeling, and biomarkers: Established environmental risk factors for lung cancer include smoking cigarettes and other tobacco products and exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke, occupational lung carcinogens, radiation, and indoor and outdoor air pollution. Cigarette smoking is the predominant cause of lung cancer and the leading worldwide cause of cancer death, and smoking prevalence in developing nations has increased, starting new lung cancer epidemics in these nations. Host risk indicators include a positive family history and acquired lung disease. Risk prediction models based on lung cancer risk factors have been developed, but further refinement is needed to provide clinically useful risk stratification, and promising biomarkers for lung cancer risk and early detection have been identified, but none are ready for broad clinical application. Almost all lung cancer deaths are caused by cigarette smoking, underscoring the need for ongoing efforts to tobacco control throughout the world, and further research is needed into the reasons underlying lung cancer disparities, the causes of lung cancer in never smokers, the potential role of HIV in lung carcinogenesis, and the development of biomarkers.

### Mucocutaneous complications of smoking cessation therapies [^1172z5gH]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite widespread knowledge of the morbidity and mortality associated with smoking, this addictive practice continues to be quite prevalent throughout the United States, as about one-fifth of the population smokes cigarettes. Because of the financial burden, and the significant psychosocial and health implications of smoking, many individuals are now attempting to quit, and often using some type of pharmacotherapy for assistance. Given that dermatologists will likely encounter patients using smoking cessation aids, it is important to be aware of their potential mucocutaneous adverse effects. We present a brief review of the dermatologic complications associated with smoking cessation therapies. Hopefully, this article will also remind dermatologists to encourage smoking cessation at every visit.

### Epidemiological, mycobacteriological, and clinical characteristics of smoking pulmonary tuberculosis patients, in lambarén é, Gabon: a cross-sectional study [^116ub5Mn]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Gabon carries a high burden of both tuberculosis (TB) and smoking. This study examines the disease characteristics of smoking pulmonary TB patients in Lambaréné. We interviewed adult pulmonary TB patients in Lambaréné, between March 2016 and April 2019. Clinical and biological patient characteristics were collected. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with smoking. The mean age of patients included was 31 years (± 13). The proportion of smokers in our study was 30% (89/295). Smoking was significantly associated with patient-related diagnostic delay (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 8.18; 95% CI = 3.67–19.56), a higher number of pulmonary TB signs and symptoms (AOR = 2.74; 95% CI = 1.18–6.73), and a higher sputum mycobacterial load (AOR = 3.18; 95% CI = 1.33–8.11). The prevalence of smoking among TB patients is high, and leading to aggravated disease as compared with controls. Our study findings suggest that smoking patients should be regularly screened for TB, to reduce diagnostic delay and TB transmission within community. Smoking cessation activities should be included in the national TB control program in Gabon.

### Projected effects of tobacco smoking on worldwide tuberculosis control: mathematical modelling analysis [^115kqD1C]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

Smoking has not, traditionally, been incorporated into mathematical models of tuberculosis, because risk factors with a very high impact at the individual level on tuberculosis prognosis have typically been the focus of such models. Although the relative risk of tuberculosis from smoking is lower at an individual level than from risk factors such as HIV, our model shows that the greater number of smokers worldwide can produce a large population attributable risk for tuberculosis. Tobacco smoking could substantially increase tuberculosis cases and deaths worldwide by 2050, and potentially delay major goals to control tuberculosis mortality by at least 20 years if current smoking trends continue. Aggressive tobacco control measures could avert millions of deaths from tuberculosis over the next four decades if these predictions are correct.

According to our model, the African, eastern Mediterranean, and South East Asian WHO regions would be expected to have the greatest increase in new tuberculosis cases attributable to smoking (African rates would rise owing to the high risk of tuberculosis infection, despite a low smoking prevalence). Our estimates also included new tuberculosis infections among smokers and secondary infections among non-smokers, which predicted tuberculosis cases would increase by 7% and deaths by 66%, compared with model predictions that do not account for the effect of smoking. If smoking trends were to increase worldwide in accordance with ongoing tobacco industry efforts, the model predicted cases and deaths from tuberculosis to increase beyond levels based on existing smoking trends, with the highest burdens in Africa, the eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and the western Pacific.

Aggressively lowering the prevalence of tobacco smoking could reduce smoking attributable deaths from tuberculosis by 27 million by 2050, under the optimistic setting of a 1% reduction in smoking rate per year (seen in some US states with successful tobacco control) to the point of eradication. The greatest tuberculosis related benefits from tobacco control were expected in Europe, the western Pacific, and South East Asia. Our model also accounted for smoking attributable deaths not related to tuberculosis (for example, lung cancer), hence the effect of tobacco on mortality was the added tuberculosis impact beyond that expected from other smoking related deaths.

### Abrocitinib (Cibinqo) [^116G9Zz9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Serious Infections

Patients treated with CIBINQO may be at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. The most frequent serious infections reported with CIBINQO were herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and pneumonia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

If a serious or opportunistic infection develops, discontinue CIBINQO and control the infection.

Reported infections from Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions:

Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test for latent TB before and during therapy; treat latent TB prior to use. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even patients with initial negative latent TB test.
Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.

Avoid use of CIBINQO in patients with an active, serious infection including localized infections. The risks and benefits of treatment with CIBINQO should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infections.

Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIBINQO, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Mortality

In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor comparing another JAK inhibitor to TNF blocker treatment, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed with the JAK inhibitor. CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Malignancies

Malignancies were reported in patients treated with CIBINQO. Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. In RA patients treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Effects of tobacco smoking on human corneal wound healing [^117EnpuG]. Cornea (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effect of tobacco smoking on healing of corneal abrasions and keratitis in humans.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with corneal abrasions and corneal ulcers from 1990 to 2010 at the Dean McGee Eye Institute was performed. The primary outcome measured was time from initial examination to epithelial closure; tobacco smoking was the primary exposure variable. Comorbidity variables were also examined as potential confounding factors. The data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Eighty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria for corneal abrasion and 52 for keratitis. The mean healing time was 4.8 days in nonsmokers and 5.9 days in smokers in the abrasion arm, and 15.5 days in nonsmokers and 39.4 days in smokers in the keratitis arm. After controlling for comorbidities, treatment, and demographic variables, the healing time in both arms was significantly delayed in smokers when compared with nonsmokers (P = 0.01 and P = 0.03, respectively). The comorbidities were also studied after adjusting for smoking. A statistically significant delay was seen with previous keratoplasty and steroid treatment for the abrasion arm. In the keratitis arm, neurotrophic corneas and fungal infections were associated with a delay in healing after correcting for smoking.

Conclusions

Epithelial healing is delayed by 1.1 days on average in smokers when compared with nonsmokers with corneal abrasions. Patients who had undergone a previous keratoplasty had delayed healing from corneal abrasions regardless of the smoking status. Epithelial healing is delayed by 23.9 days on average in patients with keratitis who report smoking. Neurotrophic corneas and fungal infections also had prolonged time to healing.

### Knowledge, attitudes and practices of general medical practitioners in developed countries regarding oral cancer: an integrative review [^113iKJ8W]. Family Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Domain 1: oral cancer knowledge

All 21 studies explored the knowledge of GPs about oral cancer risk. These studies assessed the level of information and awareness of participants regarding oral cancer risk factors, diagnosis and treatment strategies. Most studies indicated sound knowledge among GPs about oral cancer causative factors like smoking (88–99.4%) and tobacco use (87.6–99%). However, considerable variability in knowledge levels was noted among participants regarding other risk factors, including alcohol consumption (37–94.3%), viral infections (23–73.8%), old age (2.8–83%) and betel nut/quid chewing (0.8–50%). The uncertainty regarding alcohol as a risk factor for oral cancer was also evident in a qualitative study:

'Trauma, probably smoking, denture wear causing ulceration… I don't know about the alcohol factor, although I see no reason why it shouldn't be a factor as it affects your health in lots of other ways'. (p. 278)

Other oral cancer risk-related factors correctly identified by GPs included prior oral lesions (31.5%), trauma (43%), fungal infections (20%) and poor oral hygiene (20.7%). GPs were generally knowledgeable about squamous cell carcinoma being the most common type of oral cancer (60.9–80%) but were less sure about the most common sites for this cancer, such as floor of mouth (25.8–77%) and tongue (21.3–55%) or associated symptoms like ulceration (33.3–72%) and premalignant lesions (10–72%).

### Estimated worldwide mortality attributed to secondhand tobacco smoke exposure, 1990–2016 [^1139cYev]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Tobacco use is the number 1 preventable cause of death worldwide, contributing to 6 million deaths every year. However, the deleterious associations of tobacco smoking with health are not limited to those who smoke, but they also affect those in the vicinity who do not smoke, ie, those exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS). Compelling correlative evidence claims that exposure to SHS is responsible for the death of more than 880 000 individuals worldwide every year. Compared with children with no SHS exposure, children exposed to SHS are at an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, aural dysfunction, and the aggravation of asthma. Even a low-dose SHS exposure has been demonstrated to be associated with platelet activation and endothelial dysfunction and to be associated with deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system. Exposure to SHS has also been associated with more extensive coronary artery disease and a 20% to 30% increase in cardiovascular events compared with individuals with no exposure. A similar increase in lung cancer is reported among individuals exposed to SHS compared with those not exposed. It is also intriguing to review the beneficial associations of restricting SHS exposure. Globally, as much as a 15% lower rate of myocardial infarction was reported widely after the first year of enforcing smoking bans. Smoking bans in bars and restaurants have been introduced in most countries and have demonstrated health-related benefits. For instance, a smoking ban reduced admissions for asthmatic emergencies among children by 11 000 annually in Scotland alone. Although it is widely believed that SHS is associated with extensive harm and the number of individuals who smoke by country and globally has been reported alongside the number of individuals who have died of SHS exposure, the scale of the consequences of smoking on those who do not smoke has not been developed.

The aim of the current study was to better understand the scale of the harm caused by SHS to those who do not smoke on a global scale and in different regions. For this purpose, we calculated the SHS index (SHSI), which measures the number of individuals who smoke associated with the death of 1 individual who does not. We also calculated the pack-year index (PYI), which measures the number of pack-years of smoking associated with the death of 1 individual who does not smoke.

### Risk factors for cryptococcus gattii infection, British columbia, Canada [^113kBAXF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Although most cases of C. gattii infection do occur in otherwise healthy persons, our findings suggest that infection is associated with immunosuppressive states induced by oral corticosteroid use and invasive cancers as well as with weakened pulmonary function resulting from previous lung infections and smoking (Table 3). Despite HIV infection being rare among C. gattii– infected case-patients, it also occurred more frequently in infected persons than in the general population. Recent evidence indicates that C. gattii is now spreading in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Physician awareness of risk factors should assist with diagnosis of this serious but treatable infection in areas where the disease is emerging.

### The effect of smoking on COVID-19 severity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113mVp1w]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, in the largest meta‐analysis available amongst peer‐reviewed literature, we report that both current smoking and a smoking history significantly increased COVID‐19 severity, whilst smoking history also significantly increased mortality risk. Due to problems with potential misclassification of current smokers among included studies, the analysis likely underestimates the likelihood of severity in this patient population. As the COVID‐19 pandemic continues to burden societies worldwide, our analysis suggests that smoking represents one of the most immediately modifiable risk factors to reduce the substantial morbidity associated with the disease. In light of this finding, governments, policymakers, and other key stakeholders must ensure that appropriate measures are taken to support and maintain smoking cessation to protect vulnerable populations and reduce the strain placed on healthcare systems working at full capacity during this global crisis.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^117MgdF1]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — suggestive features distinguishing COPD from common mimics are listed as follows. COPD presents with symptoms slowly progressive and a history of tobacco smoking or other risk factors. Asthma shows variable airflow obstruction with symptoms that vary widely from day to day, symptoms worse at night/early morning, allergy, rhinitis, and/or eczema also present, often occurs in children, and family history of asthma. Congestive heart failure is suggested by chest X-ray showing a dilated heart and pulmonary edema, and pulmonary function tests indicating volume restriction, not airflow obstruction. Bronchiectasis features large volumes of purulent sputum, is commonly associated with bacterial infection, and chest X-ray/HRCT shows bronchial dilation. Tuberculosis can have onset at all ages, chest X-ray shows lung infiltrate, microbiological confirmation, and high local prevalence of tuberculosis. Obliterative bronchiolitis can occur in children, is seen after lung or bone marrow transplantation, and HRCT on expiration shows hypodense areas. Diffuse panbronchiolitis is predominantly seen in patients of Asian descent; most patients are male and nonsmokers; almost all have chronic sinusitis; and chest X-ray & HRCT show diffuse small centrilobular nodular opacities & hyperinflation. These features are characteristic but not mandatory; for example, a person who has never smoked may develop COPD, especially in LMICs where other risk factors may be more important than cigarette smoking.

General disorders and administration site conditions

Sixty-two studies reported general disorders and administration site AEs including fatigue, distal paresis of arm, pain (general, chest), altered general functioning, general deterioration, deteriorated clinical condition, declining performance status, worsened interference with activities of daily living, inactivity, postural dizziness, physiological side effects, hypothermia, weakness, fever, chills, asthenia, oedema, injection site reaction, local irritation, unsteady feet, unpleasant sensations (related to inhaling cannabis smoke) and gait disturbance.

Hepatobiliary disorders

Three studies reported hepatobiliary AEs. A case–control study of immunotherapy in cancer documented one case of hepatitis (CTCAE grade ≥ 2) in each group comprising of cannabis users (n = 1, 1.5%) and non-users (n = 1, 3%). The authors noted that they were classified as immune-related AEs even though relation to immunotherapy was not completely defined. An open-label extension study to investigate the long-term safety and tolerability of CBP in terminal cancer-related pain refractory to strong opioid analgesics reported one case of hepatobiliary disorder in each group using balanced THC/CBD oromucosal spray (n = 1, 3%) and THC oromucosal spray (n = 1, 25%). There was no information on whether the events were serious, or treatment-related. Increased rates of hepatotoxicity leading to liver injury from CBD-drug interactions were observed in a cross-sectional survey (see "Drug Interactions" section). Studies that reported abnormal liver investigations are also listed in the " Investigations " section.

Immune system disorders

Immune-related AEs (CTCAE grade ≥ 2) were reported in a case–control study where CBP was used by its participants during immunotherapy. Specific details of these AEs were not disclosed.

Infections and infestations

Twelve studies reported infections and infestations that included thrush, UTI, pneumonia, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, oral candidiasis, fungal infection (chest, disseminated), disseminated Fusarium infection, Campylobacter gastroenteritis and lower respiratory tract infection. CBD is the most common constituent observed to be associated with infections.

### Inhibition of IFN-gamma-dependent antiviral airway epithelial defense by cigarette smoke [^113qTJ8N]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A growing body of evidence indicates that cigarette smoke exposure increases susceptibility to viral (and bacterial) respiratory infection. It is well established that infants and children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke have an increased incidence and/or severity of otitis media and lower respiratory illness including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis compared to those not exposed. Women passively exposed to cigarette smoke are at increased risk for more frequent common colds of longer duration. Similarly, individuals that actively smoke cigarettes have an increased incidence and longer duration of respiratory infection. Clinical upper respiratory infection is more common in smokers after controlled exposure to respiratory viruses. It has also been reported that healthy army recruits that smoke cigarettes had a higher attack rate and more severe infection during an H1N1 influenza epidemic. Thus, available information indicates that cigarette smoke increases the incidence, duration, and/or severity of respiratory viral infection. However, mechanisms responsible for the effects of cigarette smoke on lung defense are incompletely understood.

A central feature of the host response to viral infection in the airway is activation of epithelial cell genes that are important in innate and adaptive immunity by a potent group of mediators called interferons. Type II interferon (IFN) or IFN-γ is produced mainly by T cells and natural killer cells, and mediates host cell effects by binding to a specific receptor complex linked to a Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling cascade. Activation of the type II interferon-driven pathway is triggered by engagement and multimerization of the IFN-γ-receptor (IFNGR) by IFN-γ, phosphorylation of IFNGR1-associated Jak1 and IFNGR2-associated Jak2 tyrosine kinases, and then phosphorylation of IFNGR1. Phosphorylation of the IFNGR1 chain of the IFN-γ receptor results in recruitment, phosphorylation, and subsequent release of Stat1 from the receptor. Activated Stat1 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and binds IFN-γ-activated sequence (GAS) elements in IFN-γ-inducible genes where it works in concert with adjacent transcription factors (e.g. Sp1) and coactivators (e.g. CBP/p300) to increase gene transcription. IFN-γ-induced genes promote antiviral mechanisms that include leukocyte recruitment, antigen processing and presentation, cell proliferation and apoptosis, and antiviral state establishment.

### Risk factors for cryptococcus gattii infection, British columbia, Canada [^1155ay1q]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, to ensure that asymptomatic C. gattii –infected patients were not included as controls, we required controls to have had chest radiographs showing no abnormalities. A selection bias may have been introduced, which could have reduced the likelihood of showing significant differences among variables, such as smoking, that might be associated with having a radiograph taken, leading to more conservative estimates or an inability to detect true differences in exposures between case-patients and controls. Similarly, the small sample size of the case–control study may have limited its power to detect significant exposures. Therefore, when possible, population comparisons were also performed to validate case–control findings.

In addition, risk factors for both analyses were collected by self-report, which may have been inaccurate. Also, the case–control analysis examined risk factor information in the 3 months before disease onset. Subsequent research has shown that the incubation period for this disease is typically longer. This long incubation period may have affected the study's ability to accurately detect behavioral and environmental risk factors; medical risk factors were unaffected because these were reported as "ever diagnosed with". Despite a case definition specifically designed to exclude case-patients infected with C. neoformans, some misclassification may have occurred, given that only 50% of infections in case-patients included in the case–control study and 57% of infections in case-patients included in population comparisons could be confirmed by laboratory typing.
