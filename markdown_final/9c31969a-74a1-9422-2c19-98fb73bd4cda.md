## Question

What are the most common signs of malnutrition in children?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common signs of malnutrition in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how malnutrition is defined and classified in children. Then, I should verify which clinical signs are most prevalent across different forms of undernutrition. Next, I will prioritize the signs by frequency and clinical importance, distinguishing universal from context-specific findings. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable list and note key caveats and exceptions, anchoring to WHO/UNICEF definitions and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope so I don't miss anything. Malnutrition in children includes undernutrition (stunting, wasting, underweight), micronutrient deficiencies, and overnutrition; here, the question is about signs of undernutrition, which WHO/UNICEF define using anthropometric deficits and clinical features, with stunting as chronic linear growth failure, wasting as acute thinness, and severe acute malnutrition (SAM) as WHZ < −3 SD, MUAC < 115 mm, or bilateral pitting edema, the latter indicating edematous malnutrition (kwashiorkor or marasmic-kwashiorkor) [^9e49f265] [^dec23f19] [^19618a4e].

> Wait, let me verify the most common and specific clinical sign. Bilateral pitting edema of nutritional origin is the hallmark of edematous SAM and is highly specific; it can mask wasting, so a child may look "plump" yet be severely malnourished, and its presence mandates inpatient management per WHO protocols, which underscores its clinical salience and frequency in SAM presentations in many settings [^7b7129db] [^a2ba48b3] [^c98a4935].

> I will now examine wasting signs, since nonedematous SAM is common. Visible severe wasting, with marked loss of subcutaneous fat and muscle, is a classic and frequent sign; MUAC < 115 mm is a simple, reliable screening tool that correlates with mortality risk and is often used in community programs, and it performs at least as well as WHZ for predicting poor outcomes in many cohorts, which supports its clinical relevance and frequency of use in practice [^dec23f19] [^eb310770] [^e8207aa5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stunting being a "sign" in the same sense. Stunting reflects chronic undernutrition and is typically identified by height-for-age z score < −2 SD rather than a single acute clinical sign; while not a bedside sign per se, it is a common manifestation of malnutrition in children and signals cumulative deficits with long-term consequences, so I should include it as a frequent and important phenotype even if it is anthropometric rather than a single observable sign [^9e49f265] [^19618a4e].

> Next, I should review micronutrient-related signs that are commonly seen. Pallor from iron deficiency anemia is frequent and clinically meaningful; in pneumonia cohorts, even mild to moderate pallor independently predicts mortality, and in settings without labs, pallor serves as a practical marker of anemia risk, reinforcing its importance as a common sign of malnutrition-related hematologic compromise [^884905de].

> Let me consider dermatologic and hair changes that clinicians often notice. Skin changes such as flaky paint dermatitis, hyperpigmented or desquamating plaques, and hair changes including depigmentation (flag sign) are classic for kwashiorkor and, while not universal, are relatively common in edematous SAM and help distinguish it from nonedematous wasting; these features reflect protein–energy deficiency with concurrent micronutrient deficits and are useful bedside clues when edema is present [^a2ba48b3] [^c98a4935].

> I need to check for other frequent but less specific signs. Apathy, irritability, and reduced activity are common behavioral manifestations in severe malnutrition, reflecting metabolic derangements and central nervous system involvement; these nonspecific neurobehavioral signs often accompany severe wasting or edematous malnutrition and should prompt urgent evaluation and treatment [^a2ba48b3] [^19618a4e].

> But wait, what if the child has concurrent illness that obscures signs. Infections are both a cause and consequence of malnutrition, and in febrile children, standard IMCI clinical signs alone can miss SAM; algorithms incorporating MUAC and WHZ identify more cases and are associated with better outcomes than clinical signs alone, highlighting why relying on appearance can underrecognize malnutrition in real-world settings [^9e369d93].

> Let me synthesize and prioritize the most common signs while keeping clinical context in mind. The most common and specific sign of severe acute malnutrition is bilateral pitting edema, which immediately flags edematous SAM; visible severe wasting and MUAC < 115 mm are the most frequent markers of nonedematous SAM; pallor indicating anemia is a common and prognostically important sign across severities; stunting is a frequent chronic manifestation identified anthropometrically; and dermatologic and hair changes, along with apathy or irritability, are common supportive clinical features in edematous disease, particularly in children aged 6–59 months in low-resource settings [^7b7129db] [^dec23f19] [^884905de] [^9e49f265] [^a2ba48b3].

> I should double-check that I've addressed the caveat about "most common" varying by context. In high-resource settings, micronutrient deficiencies like iron deficiency anemia and vitamin D deficiency may be the predominant presentation of malnutrition in otherwise growing children, whereas in low-resource settings, acute and chronic protein–energy malnutrition with stunting, wasting, and edema are more prevalent; thus, the "most common signs" depend on geography, age, and underlying disease burden, even though the core clinical syndromes remain consistent [^804c8a3f] [^19618a4e].

The most common signs of malnutrition in children are **growth faltering** (failure to thrive) [^d20cbaf0] with poor weight gain or weight loss, **stunting** (low height-for-age) [^9e49f265], and **wasting** (low weight-for-height or MUAC < 12.5 cm) [^dec23f19]. Additional frequent findings include **edema** (especially bilateral pitting edema of the feet/legs) [^7b7129db], pallor from anemia, fatigue, and recurrent infections [^875e8585]. Micronutrient deficiencies may present with specific signs such as **angular cheilitis, hair changes, or skin rashes** [^a2ba48b3] [^bf633af5]. Early recognition of these signs is essential for timely intervention and improved outcomes [^c2750a74].

---

## Anthropometric indicators

Anthropometric measurements are the **primary tools** for identifying malnutrition in children [^e2017d7d]:

- **Stunting**: Height-for-age z-score < −2 SD indicates chronic undernutrition and impaired growth [^9e49f265].
- **Wasting**: Weight-for-height z-score < −2 SD or MUAC < 12.5 cm indicates acute malnutrition [^dec23f19].
- **Underweight**: Weight-for-age z-score < −2 SD reflects both acute and chronic malnutrition [^1f150131].

---

## Clinical signs and symptoms

Several **clinical signs** are commonly observed in malnourished children:

- **Growth faltering**: Poor weight gain or weight loss, often the earliest sign of malnutrition [^d20cbaf0].
- **Edema**: Bilateral pitting edema, especially in the feet and legs, is characteristic of kwashiorkor [^7b7129db].
- **Pallor**: Indicates anemia, commonly due to iron deficiency [^884905de].
- **Fatigue and lethargy**: Resulting from inadequate energy intake and micronutrient deficiencies [^notfound].
- **Recurrent infections**: Due to impaired immune function [^24103725].

---

## Micronutrient deficiency signs

Micronutrient deficiencies often present with **specific clinical features**:

| **Micronutrient** | **Clinical signs** |
|-|-|
| Iron | - Pallor <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Spoon nails (koilonychia) [^notfound] |
| Vitamin A | - Night blindness <br/> - Bitot spots <br/> - Xerophthalmia [^notfound] |
| Vitamin D | - Rickets <br/> - Bone deformities <br/> - Delayed tooth eruption [^notfound] |
| Zinc | - Dermatitis <br/> - Hair loss <br/> - Impaired wound healing [^notfound] |
| Vitamin C | - Scurvy <br/> - Bleeding gums <br/> - Petechiae [^notfound] |

---

## Behavioral and developmental indicators

Malnutrition significantly affects **child development**, causing:

- **Delayed developmental milestones**: Motor, cognitive, and language delays [^notfound].
- **Behavioral changes**: Irritability, apathy, and reduced social interaction [^notfound].
- **Poor school performance**: Linked to chronic undernutrition and stunting [^95be25e1].

---

## Conclusion

The most common signs of malnutrition in children include growth faltering, stunting, wasting, edema, pallor, fatigue, and recurrent infections. Micronutrient deficiencies present with specific clinical features, and malnutrition significantly impairs **child development**. Early identification and intervention are critical to address these signs and improve **child health outcomes** [^c2750a74].

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to summarize commonly encountered nutritional deficiencies in children and their implications. Considering data suggesting that the majority of children with the United States consume unhealthy diets, the growing interest in the consumption of limiting diets, as well as the insidious clinical presentation of nutritional deficiencies, this is a timely and highly relevant review.

Recent Findings

The underlying socioeconomic and medical circumstances that predispose to nutritional deficiencies in the Western world are covered. The high index of suspicion required to recognize nutritional deficiencies and the limitations of available testing are also discussed. Finally, the need for the development of accurate nutritional biomarkers is presented as a future research priority.

Summary

Nutritional deficiencies are not uncommon, even in high resource countries. Clinicians should remain vigilant and include nutritional deficiencies in the differential diagnoses of patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms.

Severe malnutrition

By Severe Malnutrition we mean (Table 2):

Table 2
Severe malnutrition definition

Benefits of this term include the following.

Focus on severe adverse outcomes

An important clinical maxim is to 'treat the patient, not the numbers'. The ultimate aim of any intervention is to ensure children not only survive but thrive. Severe in our framework refers to clinically important severe adverse outcomes: mortality, morbidity, impaired development. To capture true programme impact, these should be measured wherever possible (since some interventions might improve anthropometry but not mortality; others improve nutrition but not anthropometry). The framework also highlights underlying clinical causes because acute/chronic illness and anthropometric deficits are intimately related: deficits are associated with increased risk of and impaired response to illnesses; illness can exacerbate anthropometric deficit.

Inclusivity (including of long-term consequences)

Different manifestations of malnutrition are more-common or less-common/important in different settings but details are mainly relevant to technical audiences. While widely understood to mean undernutrition, we acknowledge that malnutrition is also used to describe overweight. Severe overweight is widely recognised as obesity so our using 'severe malnutrition' does not risk misunderstanding. It does create opportunities to highlight long term consequences of undernutrition: speaking about mal rather than under nutrition is a reminder that early-life undernutrition increases susceptibility to the harmful effects of adult overweight, especially elevated non-communicable non-communicable disease.

Increased linkages and synergies between different nutrition-related programmes

Working towards common mortality/morbidity goals could facilitate interprogramme linkages and more efficient resource utilisation.

'Severe malnutrition' also provides bridging language supporting recent research on relationships between different malnutrition manifestations:

Wasting predisposes to stunting — 'chronic' terminology under-recognises the role of acute insults.
Wasting is common in children with low birth weight and disabilityand many wasted children are stunted — 'acute' terminology is usually erroneous.
Children with concurrent wasting/stunting are at particularly high risk of death — programmes should be integrated.

Since all forms of malnutrition are fundamentally social problems of poverty and inequity, our terminology also emphasises the importance of tackling these common determinants.

### Predicting the risk of mortality during hospitalization in sick severely malnourished children using daily evaluation of key clinical warning signs [^6dffe7bb]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Undernutrition accounts for 45% of deaths in children under 5 years of age globally. Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is the most life-threatening form of undernutrition and is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as either a weight-for-height Z score (WHZ) < -3 or a mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 11.5 cm, or the presence of bilateral pitting edema. SAM is a multi-factorial condition arising from the interplay between food insecurity, poverty, and acute or chronic disease, and despite its name, often does not occur acutely. Children with complicated SAM (i.e. with medical complications, usually serious infections) require hospital admission to manage life-threatening conditions in addition to nutritional rehabilitation. The WHO has standardized management guidelines for children with complicated SAM. However, inpatient case-fatality rates for children with SAM remain unacceptably high at 10–25% in African. Apart from factors inherent to low-resource settings, the high mortality is related to poor understanding of the pathophysiology and weakly evidence-based treatment protocol.

### The impact of childhood malnutrition on mortality from pneumonia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^885ff0a1]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia is a leading cause of child hospitalisations and deaths globally. There were an estimated 808 000 child pneumonia deaths in 2017, mainly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Malnutrition increases the frequency and severity of common childhood infections such as pneumonia, delays recovery and increases risk of death. Childhood malnutrition remains widespread, with an estimated 6.7% of children under 5 globally suffering from wasting and 22.0% stunted. Pneumonia may present differently in malnourished children with less overt signs of respiratory distress, which results in underdiagnosis and suboptimal management. Acute infections reciprocally worsen nutritional status through higher catabolism, anorexia and nutrient loss, contributing to a worsening cycle of infections and malnutrition. While there has been substantial progress in reducing pneumonia morbidity and mortality since the year 2000, there have been smaller improvements in linear growth and reductions in wasting and low birth weight over this time.

Previous studies have found that children with both moderate and severe malnutrition have a higher risk of death from pneumonia. Improving child nutrition is, therefore, a key aspect of the global strategy to reduce pneumonia deaths.

Quantifying the deleterious effects of malnutrition and pneumonia can inform ongoing strategies and health programmes aimed at reducing child mortality. We aimed to quantify the risk of death from pneumonia in children with different grades of malnutrition severity. We also aimed to estimate the proportion of child pneumonia deaths attributable to moderate and severe malnutrition.

### Pediatric sarcopenia: a paradigm in the overall definition of malnutrition in children? [^2ab1bdc1]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Malnutrition is a common complication in children with chronic diseases. Sarcopenia is one component of malnutrition, characterized by reduced skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and muscle function. The presence of sarcopenia is associated with adverse outcomes in children. Although there is growing research interest in sarcopenia, no review has been done on this novel concept in pediatrics. The purpose of this review was to explore current evidence in sarcopenia with and without obesity and to evaluate the knowledge gaps in the assessment of childhood sarcopenia.

Methods

A total of 12 articles retrieved from PubMed or Web of Science databases were included.

Results

Limited studies have elucidated sarcopenia in pediatrics. Challenges in sarcopenia assessment include heterogeneity in definition and absence of standardized body composition methods used to measure SMM and muscle function tests. There is a lack of age-specific and gender-specific normative data for SMM, particularly in young children and infants. None of the studies incorporated muscle function assessment, causing potential bias and misclassification of sarcopenia. The research in childhood sarcopenia is also hampered by low study quality, limited number of outcomes-based research, and lack of longitudinal data.

Conclusion

Consensus needs to be reached in methodological approaches in sarcopenia diagnosis, body composition measurements, and age-appropriate muscle function tests in pediatrics. Careful considerations on growth, neurocognitive status, and factors influencing development in various clinical populations are warranted. Early identification of sarcopenia is crucial to enable targeted treatment and prevention to be carried out across the pediatric clinical populations.

### Management of severe acute malnutrition in children [^7b7129db]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is defined as a weight-for-height measurement of 70% or less below the median, or three SD or more below the mean National Centre for Health Statistics reference values, the presence of bilateral pitting oedema of nutritional origin, or a mid-upper-arm circumference of less than 110 mm in children age 1–5 years. 13 million children under age 5 years have SAM, and the disorder is associated with 1 million to 2 million preventable child deaths each year. Despite this global importance, child-survival programmes have ignored SAM, and WHO does not recognise the term "acute malnutrition". Inpatient treatment is resource intensive and requires many skilled and motivated staff. Where SAM is common, the number of cases exceeds available inpatient capacity, which limits the effect of treatment; case-fatality rates are 20–30% and coverage is commonly under 10%. Programmes of community-based therapeutic care substantially reduce case-fatality rates and increase coverage rates. These programmes use new, ready-to-use, therapeutic foods and are designed to increase access to services, reduce opportunity costs, encourage early presentation and compliance, and thereby increase coverage and recovery rates. In community-based therapeutic care, all patients with SAM without complications are treated as outpatients. This approach promises to be a successful and cost-effective treatment strategy.

Clarity and familiarity

Both 'severe' and 'malnutrition' are widely understood terms and are easily translatable into most languages worldwide. 'Severe malnutrition' also has historical track-record, having been used alongside older case definitions with different growth references and classifications predating table 1. Children admitted to today's malnutrition programmes differ to those in years past, but common characteristics are increased mortality/health risks compared with those without anthropometric deficit.

Keeping technical arguments internal

As in any field, some issues are novel and/or contested for example.

Use of weight-for-age to identify concurrent wasting/stunting.
Mid-upper arm circumference versus weight-for-height to identify children for therapeutic feeding.
Recent focus on 'wasting' terminology neglects kwashiorkor.

An overarching term provides stability and prevents important technical arguments giving the impression to those outside the sector that experts do not agree on other core issues.

Flexibility for programmes to use locally appropriate admission criteria

Guided by local mortality/morbidity data, individual countries could be freer to set context-specific programme admission criteria for 'severe malnutrition'.

In some settings, even mild/moderate anthropometric deficits are associated with excess mortality: integrated programmes treating both severe and moderate wasting as a continuum are hence important.
In other settings, mortality associated with anthropometric deficit is lower - costs of therapeutic/supplementary foods may not justify their benefits.

For most technical purposes, quantifying and monitoring global trends and comparisons, current metrics focusing on table 1 terminology remain valid. However, discussions are needed on measuring risk; moving beyond the acute/chronic malnutrition dichotomy; feasibility of improved metricsand calculating a single global estimate of the burden of severe malnutrition.

### Severe childhood malnutrition [^19618a4e]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

The main forms of childhood malnutrition occur predominantly in children < 5 years of age living in low-income and middle-income countries and include stunting, wasting and kwashiorkor, of which severe wasting and kwashiorkor are commonly referred to as severe acute malnutrition. Here, we use the term 'severe malnutrition' to describe these conditions to better reflect the contributions of chronic poverty, poor living conditions with pervasive deficits in sanitation and hygiene, a high prevalence of infectious diseases and environmental insults, food insecurity, poor maternal and fetal nutritional status and suboptimal nutritional intake in infancy and early childhood. Children with severe malnutrition have an increased risk of serious illness and death, primarily from acute infectious diseases. International growth standards are used for the diagnosis of severe malnutrition and provide therapeutic end points. The early detection of severe wasting and kwashiorkor and outpatient therapy for these conditions using ready-to-use therapeutic foods form the cornerstone of modern therapy, and only a small percentage of children require inpatient care. However, the normalization of physiological and metabolic functions in children with malnutrition is challenging, and children remain at high risk of relapse and death. Further research is urgently needed to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of severe malnutrition, especially the mechanisms causing kwashiorkor, and to develop new interventions for prevention and treatment.

### Should a single growth standard be used to judge the nutritional status of children under age 5 y globally? Debate consensus [^80d42b86]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

The participants in this debate agreed that: 1) target-based advocacy is required for ensuring countries' engagement and political commitments toward reducing child malnutrition, and the tools used for monitoring progress should be accurate and pose no risk of harmful consequences; and 2) physical growth is not the only dimension of nutritional status to be monitored in clinical and public health practice; anthropometry is thus only one of the diagnostic indicators of nutritional status. Key disagreements included methodological approaches for developing a single growth standard to evaluate nutritional status globally; the relative utility of universal and contextual growth standards for clinical practice and public health; the balance of benefits, harms, and acceptability among stakeholders; and their use as a screening or a definitive tool in individual and public health nutrition. Noteworthy agreements for research priorities included comparison of benefits and harms of using universal compared with contextual growth standards/references and different stakeholders' perception of expectations from and utility of growth standards.

### Defining pediatric malnutrition: a paradigm shift toward etiology-related definitions [^59de1b47]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Lack of a uniform definition is responsible for underrecognition of the prevalence of malnutrition and its impact on outcomes in children. A pediatric malnutrition definitions workgroup reviewed existing pediatric age group English-language literature from 1955 to 2011, for relevant references related to 5 domains of the definition of malnutrition that were a priori identified: anthropometric parameters, growth, chronicity of malnutrition, etiology and pathogenesis, and developmental/ functional outcomes. Based on available evidence and an iterative process to arrive at multidisciplinary consensus in the group, these domains were included in the overall construct of a new definition. Pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) is defined as an imbalance between nutrient requirements and intake that results in cumulative deficits of energy, protein, or micronutrients that may negatively affect growth, development, and other relevant outcomes. A summary of the literature is presented and a new classification scheme is proposed that incorporates chronicity, etiology, mechanisms of nutrient imbalance, severity of malnutrition, and its impact on outcomes. Based on its etiology, malnutrition is either illness related (secondary to 1 or more diseases/injury) or non-illness related, (caused by environmental/behavioral factors), or both. Future research must focus on the relationship between inflammation and illness-related malnutrition. We anticipate that the definition of malnutrition will continue to evolve with improved understanding of the processes that lead to and complicate the treatment of this condition. A uniform definition should permit future research to focus on the impact of pediatric malnutrition on functional outcomes and help solidify the scientific basis for evidence-based nutrition practices.

### 'Severe malnutrition': thinking deeply, communicating simply [^8a6d9e07]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Defining malnutrition: limitations of current terminology

Defining a problem is vital for effective action/evaluation. Assessing both individual and population nutritional status typically involves anthropometry. Measurements (eg, weight) are interpreted through indices (eg, weight-for-age) in comparison with reference populations (eg, WHO Growth Standards, a 'gold standard' describing how healthy children should grow). Current terminology is summarised below.

Often neglected is the full definition of malnutrition: 'Any condition in which deficiency, excess or imbalance of energy, protein or other nutrients… adversely affects body function and/or clinical outcome'. Problems consequently arise.

Undue focus on body size

Being severely small (short or thin) alone is unimportant. What matters is the associated risk of severe adverse outcome (eg, death/disease/developmental delay). Simplicity makes anthropometry useful for epidemiological and clinical case-definitions. Often forgotten is that it is an indirect measure, akin to a proxy measure, an indicator of an underlying problem, analogous to spots in measles or fever in malaria. Better measures of nutritional status such as body composition are available, but are costly and difficult to do in most field settings. Anthropometry is valuable but has imperfect:

Sensitivity: current global metrics focus on population extremes, with terms in table 1 often used interchangeably. Not differentiating stat e from process identifies most children with malnutrition but misses those with 'normal' anthropometry who are deteriorating and are smaller than they would be in a resource-rich environment and therefore at risk of adverse outcomes (false negative). Thus, true malnutrition-associated burden of disease is underestimated. Neglecting process also risks undue focus on treatment rather than prevention since actions may not occur until a child deteriorates below threshold values.

Table 1
Case definitions and anthropometric indicators in global health policy/practice

Specificity: some children are constitutionally small but have no functional/clinical impairment or increased risk (false positive). In others, the underlying problem is not lack of food but another issue (eg, repeated infection, chronic inflammation and disability). Feeding may temporarily increase weight, but relapse follows if the underlying cause is not addressed.

### The impact of malnutrition on childhood infections [^875e8585]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Worldwide, 5.6 million children die before their fifth birthday each year, with 80% of these deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Almost half of these deaths occur in children with malnutrition. Strong epidemiological evidence suggests this is because of an elevated susceptibility to life-threatening infections amongst malnourished children. However, such studies do not disentangle the complex mechanisms underlying malnutrition, involving not only lack of nutrients, but also other risk factors such as exposure to pathogens, lack of access to healthcare and poverty. This review focusses on undernutrition among children in low and middle-income countries, with a focus on diarrhoea and pneumonia, the commonest childhood life-threatening infections worldwide. We discuss what is meant by the term 'malnutrition'; how recent studies are informing our understanding of mechanisms linking anthropometric status and environment with susceptibility to life-threatening infections; and discuss implications and future research.

### A practical approach to identifying pediatric disease-associated undernutrition: a position statement from the ESPGHAN special interest group on clinical malnutrition [^111499d2]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Disease-associated undernutrition (DAU) is still common in hospitalized children and is generally accepted to be associated with adverse effects on disease outcomes; hence making proper identification and assessment essential in the management of the sick child. There are however several barriers to routine screening, assessment, and treatment of sick children with poor nutritional status or DAU, including limited resources, lack of nutritional awareness, and lack of agreed nutrition policies. We recommend all pediatric facilities to 1) implement procedures for identification of children with (risk of) DAU, including nutritional screening, criteria for further assessment to establish diagnosis of DAU, and follow-up, 2) assess weight and height in all children asa minimum, and 3) have the opportunity for children at risk to be assessed by a hospital dietitian. An updated descriptive definition of pediatric DAU is proposed as "Undernutrition is a condition resulting from imbalanced nutrition or abnormal utilization of nutrients which causes clinically meaningful adverse effects on tissue function and/or body size/composition with subsequent impact on health outcomes". To facilitate comparison of undernutrition data, it is advised that in addition to commonly used criteria for undernutrition such as z score < -2 for weight-for-age, weight-for-length, or body mass index < -2, an unintentional decline of > 1inthese z scores over time should be considered as an indicator requiring further assessment to establish DAU diagnosis. Since the etiology of DAU is multifactorial, clinical evaluation and anthropometry should ideally be complemented by measurements of body composition, assessment of nutritional intake, requirements, and losses, and considering disease specific factors.

### Immune dysfunction as a cause and consequence of malnutrition [^24103725]. Trends in Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Malnutrition as an Immunodeficiency Syndrome

Malnutrition, which encompasses both under- and overnutrition, is responsible for an enormous health burden globally,(Box 1). Although broadly defined as impaired nutrient assimilation, malnutrition does not simply arise from inadequate food intake. Obesity can develop independently of poor diet and persist despite switching to a healthy diet, and stunting prevalence is only modestly reduced by intensive feeding interventions. Despite manifesting as distinct physical defects, several observations implicate shared etiological pathways in under- and overnutrition: early-life undernutrition increases the risk of obesity in later life; altered metabolism, chronic inflammation, and gut dysfunction (enteropathy), are features of both conditions; and excess energy and macronutrient intake is often coincident with micronutrient deficiencies in overweight individuals. There is a growing appreciation that malnutrition is complex, reflecting a suite of overlapping comorbidities that are poorly understood. Characterizing pathogenesis across the spectrum of malnutrition is essential to underpin novel therapeutic approaches to support international goals to improve nutrition, health, and well-being.

Undernourished children principally die of common infections, implying that mortality is related to underlying immunodeficiency, even in mild forms of undernutrition. Infections are more common and more severe in people with obesity. Defects in both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system have been consistently demonstrated in undernourished children (Box 2). In this review we explore the hypothesis that immune dysfunction is both a cause and consequence of malnutrition, and summarize key recent evidence from experimental animal models, human cohorts, and in vitro studies. We regard malnutrition as a syndrome in which multiple underlying processes are the cause of elevated mortality and morbidity(Box 1); immune dysfunction is involved in many of these pathways and is therefore a key driver of the vicious cycle that leads to clinical malnutrition (Figure 1). Our focus is childhood undernutrition in developing countries, where the greatest burden of mortality is concentrated, but we also identify relevant studies of overnutrition. Throughout the review we highlight research gaps that need to be addressed in future studies and speculate on the potential for immune-targeted therapies to reduce morbidity and mortality in undernourished children.

### Tackling the triple threats of childhood malnutrition [^d7e003f5]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The term 'double burden of malnutrition' is usually interpreted in terms of the physical status of children: stunted and wasted children on the one hand and overweight/obese children on the other. There is a third category of malnutrition that can occur at either end of the anthropometric spectrum or, indeed, in children whose physical size may be close to ideal. This third type is most commonly articulated with the phrase 'hidden hunger' and is often illustrated by micronutrient deficiencies; thus, we refer to it here as 'undernutrition'. As understanding of such issues advances, we realise that there is a myriad of factors that may be influencing a child's road to nutritional health. In this BMC Medicine article collection we consider these influences and the impact they have, such as: the state of the child's environment; the effect this has on their risk of, and responses to, infection and on their gut; the consequences of poor nutrition on cognition and brain development; the key drivers of the obesity epidemic across the globe; and how undernourishment can affect a child's body composition. This collection showcases recent advances in the field, but likewise highlights ongoing challenges in the battle to achieve adequate nutrition for children across the globe.

In this BMC Medicine article collection we consider these influences and the impact they have, such as: the state of the child's environment; the effect this has on their risk of, and responses to, infection and on their gut; the consequences of poor nutrition on cognition and brain development; the key drivers of the obesity epidemic across the globe; and how undernourishment can affect a child's body composition. This collection showcases recent advances in the field, but likewise highlights ongoing challenges in the battle to achieve adequate nutrition for children across the globe.

Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric malnutrition indicators — consensus recommendations state "We recommend that the following list of indicators be used when assessing and diagnosing pediatric malnutrition". Indicators recommended to identify pediatric malnutrition are described as "typically continuous rather than discrete variables" and require that "clinical expertise and sound clinical judgment must be exercised" during assessment; the listed indicators "can reproducibly identify undernutrition", "can quantify the severity of undernutrition", and "can be used to monitor changes in nutritional status", and the "recommended list of indicators to be assessed may change over time" as evidence or technology evolves.

### The impact of malnutrition on childhood infections [^e8207aa5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

WHAT IS MALNUTRITION?

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines malnutrition as deficiency, excess or imbalance in a person's intake of energy and/or specific nutrients in relation to their requirements.

Assessing malnutrition and risks of life-threatening infection

Energy and/or specific nutrient intake, requirements and expenditure are very rarely directly assessed. Instead, practice and research are based on anthropometric measures compared with a reference population. Wasting (thinness) is defined by weight-for-height/length (WHZ) among children under 5 years old, and BMI for age among 5–19-year olds. Stunting (linear growth impairment) is defined using height (or length)-for-age (HAZ).

Recently, there has been increased focus on the use of the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). MUAC is less affected by hydration status and generally it has better predictive value for subsequent mortality than WHZ. However, cut offs to define malnutrition by MUAC based on its relationship with infectious disease or mortality outcomes had only been validated and used amongst children aged 6–59 months. Amongst infants (n = 2882) under 6 months old admitted to hospital in Kenya, MUAC was better at discriminating risk of subsequent inpatient death than WHZ. A subset of these infants (n = 1405), were followed for 1 year after discharge; MUAC similarly had superior predictive value over WHZ. Similarly, amongst school-aged children and adolescents discharged from a rural hospital in Kenya (n = 1741) and amongst cohort of children over 5 years old with HIV infection in Uganda and Zimbabwe (n = 685), MUAC discriminated mortality risk at least as well as BMI-for-age. This may result from MUAC directly measuring nutritional stores of protein (muscle) and fat whereas length is subject to significant measurement error among young infant.

Pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) indicators — recommended indicators to diagnose pediatric undernutrition are a work in progress. Clinicians should expect to see an evolution of these recommendations as data regarding their use are systematically collected, analyzed, and disseminated to relevant stakeholders. Periodic review and revision of the recommendations will ensure that the health of the public is optimized and that utilization of healthcare resources proceeds with maximum efficiency.

### Malnutrition: from mother to child [^fe469df8]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

Malnutrition in children, defined as a child who is more than 2 standard deviations below the norm for height- or weight-for-age, is a pervasive, population-wide problem in low- and middle-income countries. Malnutrition is associated with increased infant mortality and delayed neurocognitive development. A recent pooled analysis of more than 30 longitudinal cohort studies demonstrated that the conditions mothers lived in during pregnancy, and their access to adequate nutrition, was a major factor in the subsequent growth and health of their children. We review here this analysis and the hypothesis that interventions to address childhood malnutrition need to start before birth and continue throughout the critical first 1,000 days of life.

### Global child nutrition [^4851ba22]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Under-five years of age is a critical period for child growth and psychomotor development with lifelong influence. Nutritional status assessment by anthropometry indicates millions of children at extreme vulnerability. Characterization of wasting as moderate or severe determines morbidity and mortality risk and therapeutic interventions. Stunting has distinct adverse sequelae and is more difficult to ameliorate. Causal mechanisms of malnutrition are complex but essential components have been identified and guide preventive and therapeutic interventions. Micronutrient deficiencies also remain a public health problem. Steep declines in global nutrition funding for programs, research, and multisectoral capacities are expected to reverse decades long gains.

### Should a single growth standard be used to judge the nutritional status of children under age 5 y globally? Debate consensus [^0b987e0f]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Points of Agreement

Key points of agreement are summarized in Box 1. The need for target-based advocacy for countries' engagement and political commitments toward the reduction of child malnutrition across the globe is indisputable. Advocacy needs to be balanced, taking into consideration countries' priorities, available resources, and contexts. Further, the tools used for monitoring progress should be accurate and not lead to any risk of harmful consequences. It is also agreed that physical growth is not the only dimension of nutritional status to be monitored in clinical and public health practice; anthropometry is thus only one of the diagnostic indicators of nutritional status. When evaluating children in clinical settings, the entire spectrum of anthropometry needs to be considered, namely, stature-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-stature or BMI-for-age, and head circumference-for-age. Moreover, both authors agree that, for global monitoring of public health, there are standard definitions of the different indicators such as stunting, wasting, and overweight. However, to avoid misinterpretation and prevent misuse in routine clinical and public health settings, appropriate usage and implications of all growth-related indicators needs to be understood by all stakeholders.

### Consensus statement of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics / American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition: indicators recommended for the identification and documentation of pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) [^40b64fb5]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Indicators of pediatric undernutrition — standardization and gaps state that a standardized approach to recognition and diagnosis, particularly in the pediatric population older than 60 months, is lacking, and assessment of nutritional status in high-risk children in the United States is sporadic and inconsistent among facilities. A true measure of the impact of pediatric undernutrition on overall health is difficult to obtain, and the National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs does not currently include assessment of food/nutrition services provided. Attributes of indicators recommended for inclusion are that they are evidence informed and consensus derived, are universally available and validated, can be applied inexpensively in multiple settings, and can be properly used with minimal training.

### Clinical outcome of febrile Tanzanian children with severe malnutrition using anthropometry in comparison to clinical signs [^9e369d93]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Children with malnutrition compared with those without are at higher risk of infection, with more severe outcomes. How clinicians assess nutritional risk factors in febrile children in primary care varies. We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of febrile children with severe malnutrition enrolled in a randomized, controlled trial in primary care centers in Tanzania. The clinical outcome of children with severe malnutrition defined by anthropometric measures and clinical signs was compared between two electronic clinical diagnostic algorithms: ePOCT, which uses weight-for-age and mid-upper arm circumference to identify and manage severe malnutrition, and ALMANACH, which uses the clinical signs of edema of both feet and visible severe wasting. Those identified as having severe malnutrition by the algorithms in each arm were prescribed antibiotics and referred to the hospital. From December 2014 to February 2016, 106 febrile children were enrolled and randomized in the parent study, and met the criteria to be included in the present analysis. ePOCT identified 56/57 children with severe malnutrition using anthropometric measures, whereas ALMANACH identified 2/49 children with severe malnutrition using clinical signs. The proportion of clinical failure, defined as the development of severe symptoms by day 7 or persisting symptoms at day 7 (per-protocol), was 1.8% (1/56) in the ePOCT arm versus 16.7% (8/48) in the Algorithm for the MANagement of Childhood illnesses arm (risk difference -14.9%, 95% CI -26.0%, -3.8%; risk ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.01, 0.83). Using anthropometric measures to identify and manage febrile children with severe malnutrition may have resulted in better clinical outcomes than by using clinical signs alone.

Call to action: next steps — implementation and review of indicators are encouraged. This consensus statement represents a starting point in the effort to standardize a diagnostic approach to the identification and documentation of pediatric undernutrition, and it is important that clinicians caring for pediatric patients use the recommended diagnostic indicators to identify and document nutritional status in children and adolescents. It is also imperative that clinicians make every effort to obtain and enter numerical data into searchable fields in the electronic medical record, and members of the healthcare team should come together to determine strategies for implementation compatible with their own institution's policies and practices. The indicators recommended in this consensus statement should be reviewed and revised at regular intervals to reflect validation data that offer evidence of efficacy.

- a complete blood count,
- a blood pH,
- serum electrolytes,
- blood urea nitrogen and creatinine,
- a urinalysis and urine culture, and
- an examination of the stool for reducing substances, pH, occult blood, and ova and parasites. More extensive testing for malabsorption, endocrine disorders, occult infection, malignancy, and cardiac, pulmonary, or renal abnormalities should be done only in the presence of historical or physical examination evidence of these diagnoses.

This provocative commentary critically examines historic definitions for adult malnutrition syndromes as they apply to developed countries with modern healthcare. To stimulate further discussion, the authors propose an updated approach that incorporates current understanding of the systemic inflammatory response to help guide assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. An appreciation of a continuum of inflammatory response in relation to malnutrition syndromes is described. This discussion serves to highlight a research agenda to address deficiencies in diagnostics, biomarkers, and therapeutics of inflammation in relation to malnutrition.

Nutrition surveillance and continuity of care — follow-up frequency guidance emphasizes individualization. It will be difficult to standardize follow-up surveillance intervals because of the great variation in severity of growth failure, nutritional habits, coexisting morbidities, chronic disease(s), social situations, and so on, and, optimally, follow-up intervals for pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition), like any other medical condition, should be individualized.

### Daily co-trimoxazole prophylaxis to prevent mortality in children with complicated severe acute malnutrition: a multicentre, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial [^e36cdfcb]. The Lancet: Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) contributes to 1 million childhood deaths annually worldwide and its treatment is a key target for reducing childhood mortality. Infectious disease is thought to be the main mediator of mortality in children with SAM. A short course of oral antibiotics given to children with uncomplicated SAM treated as outpatients reduced mortality and treatment failure in Malawi. However, a short course of antibiotics had no effect on these outcomes in Niger, although it did markedly reduce admission to hospital and improve early weight gain.

Children with SAM who have signs of infection or present with one or more Integrated Management of Childhood Illness danger signs, or do not pass an appetite test are classified as having complicated SAM, and WHO recommends that they should be initially treated in hospital — empirical antibiotics, treatment of specific medical conditions, and specialised therapeutic feeding are given. Once complications have resolved and appetite returns, children continue therapeutic feeding as outpatients.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Children who are admitted to hospital with complicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) are at greatly increased risk of mortality from common infections, including for a long period after discharge. Results from several randomised clinical trials in Africa have shown that daily co-trimoxazole reduces long-term all-cause mortality and readmissions to hospital among children who are susceptible to serious infections because of HIV. There is also evidence that antimicrobials improve growth. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis in children without HIV being treated for complicated SAM. We searched PubMed for randomised trials without date or language restrictions using the MeSH terms "child", "malnutrition", "mortality", "clinical trials as topic", "anti-infective agents", or "anti-bacterial agents". We identified two clinical trials of short-course antibiotic treatment in children with uncomplicated SAM treated as outpatients, but no previous clinical trials of longer-term antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent mortality in children with complicated SAM after stabilisation. Generally, adequate evidence for the effectiveness of most interventions in children with SAM was absent or inconclusive.

### Consensus statement of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics / American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition: indicators recommended for the identification and documentation of pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) [^aa0b5b52]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Definition of pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) — terminology clarifies that A.S.P.E.N. has defined pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) as "an imbalance between nutrient requirement and intake, resulting in cumulative deficits of energy, protein, or micronutrients that may negatively affect growth, development and other relevant outcomes", and notes that pediatric undernutrition may be related to illness, adverse environmental or behavioral factors, injury, congenital anomalies, and so on. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) states that although malnutrition is a broad term, commonly used as an alternative to undernutrition, it technically also encompasses overnutrition; people are considered to be malnourished (undernourished) if their diet does not provide adequate energy and protein for growth and development or if they are unable to fully utilize the food/nutrients due to illness, and children are also classified as malnourished (overnourished) if they consume too much energy; although obesity is a form of malnutrition, a discussion of overnutrition is not the purpose of this article.

Adolescent eating disorders and undernutrition — prevalence and detection indicate that these behaviors are most common among teenage girls, with an estimated 0.5% of adolescents suffering with anorexia nervosa, another 1%–2% meeting a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa, and up to 14% of adolescents having "partial syndromes or eating disorder not otherwise specified" and already having signs and symptoms of malnutrition. Adolescents often try to hide aberrant eating behaviors, laboratory parameters often remain normal for a period of time after aberrant eating behaviors have begun, and the RDN may be the first provider to recognize the symptoms or the first provider contacted by the patient or caregivers.

### Phase II trial of isotonic fluid resuscitation in Kenyan children with severe malnutrition and hypovolaemia [^1cb747c3]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Severe malnutrition is a common cause of admission to hospital in young children in Africa and outcome remains poor. The World Health Organization (WHO) 10-step treatment has improved case fatality, in some settings, to under 5%[-], however, in African hospitals implementation of the same guideline has achieved poorer results with numerous reports of unacceptably high case fatality rates. At our hospital on the Kenyan coast, we have recently reported that mortality rates in children with severe malnutrition, treated in accordance with WHO guidelines, were 20%. Thirty percent of the fatalities occurred within 48 hours of admission and many had signs suggestive of hypovolaemic shock including children with severe dehydrating diarrhoea.

WHO malnutrition guidelines advocate strict avoidance of intravenous fluids and restrict the use of fluid resuscitation to children with advanced features of shock. Fluid resuscitation is recommended only if all of the following parameters are present- a weak, fast pulse, cold peripheries, a capillary refilling time (CRT) of > 3 seconds plus signs of impaired consciousness (WHO malnutrition shock criteria). Ordinarily, these features would be considered by paediatric life-support providers as constituting a very advanced state of shock, when outcome is generally poor. For children fulfilling these criteria, preferential use of low-volume hypotonic fluids (0.45% sodium content) is recommended since it is commonly considered that malnourished children are at increased risk of developing congestive heart failure and sodium and water overload. There is substantial debate over best treatment with scientific rationale advanced to justify this highly promoted WHO guideline, but what is clear is that the evidence base is weak and unsupported by the relevant physiological studies or clinical trials.

Pediatric malnutrition global burden — Pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) is estimated to contribute to approximately 45% of all child deaths globally. Approximately 20 million children less than 5 years of age worldwide are severely undernourished, leaving them extremely vulnerable to illness and premature death. Poverty, famine, and war are primary contributors to global malnutrition and limit food distribution and access, even when food is available for consumption.

### New WHO guideline on the prevention and management of acute malnutrition in infants and young children: remaining challenges [^c2750a74]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

The updated WHO guidelines have the potential to dramatically curb the incidence of acute malnutrition and provide comprehensive community-based nutrition care. However, it is essential that the implementation of these guidelines is done thoughtfully and intentionally with full financial and administrative support from local Ministries of Health and implementing partners. These general guidelines not cause clinicians to lose sight of the necessity to individualise care to each child and family, which is essential for the management and prevention of acute malnutrition and which includes a need to act quickly on risk factors and early onset of growth faltering long prior to the diagnosis of MAM and SAM.

### Appropriateness of clinical severity classification of new WHO childhood pneumonia guidance: a multi-hospital, retrospective, cohort study [^884905de]. The Lancet: Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

WHO guidelines recognise severe malnutrition defined by WHZ or mid-upper-arm circumference as a risk factor for mortality, warranting inpatient care when present in association with pneumonia. The use of WAZ is no longer recommended as a screening approach to identify severe acute malnutrition. We observed a high prevalence of low to very low WAZ (almost 20% of the study population), even after exclusion of cases of severe acute malnutrition were identified by the admitting clinician on the basis of mid upper-arm-circumference, WHZ, visible severe wasting, or oedema due to kwashiorkor. Children with non-severe pneumonia and WAZ less than −3 SD and without severe acute malnutrition had a risk of death almost three times higher than patients with non-severe pneumonia. Increased risk of death among children with poor nutritional status is widely thought to be linked to deficiencies in immune function. Consistent with our findings, a systematic reviewof children with pneumonia and malnutrition (defined by use of WAZ or WHZ) reported invariably high risks of death for both moderate or severe forms of malnutrition in all 16 studies included.

The presence of pallor, even when classified as mild or moderate, was also strongly associated with mortality across all our analyses. Severe pallor is commonly used as a clinical marker for anaemia in settings where laboratory diagnostics are unavailable, with sensitivity and specificity above 80% for children with packed cell volumes less than 15%. Anaemia is a common presenting feature in sub-Saharan African children, manifesting acutely in conditions such as malaria and chronically because of inadequate nutritional iron intake or helminthic infestation. Severe anaemia has been associated with increased mortality in previous studies of children with pneumonia;, our study presents new evidence showing risk for mild forms.

These findings have important implications for the WHO policy advocating for outpatient treatment for all but the children with a small set of clinical signs that define severe pneumonia. Although severe pallor would generally warrant admission to hospital, the existing recommendations for case management do not consider very low WAZ or mild to moderate pallor as important risk factors. Thus 1272 (11%) of 12 025 children defined as having non-severe pneumonia in this study with either of these two risk factors would be expected to be managed at home.

### Growth faltering and failure to thrive in children [^d20cbaf0]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Growth faltering, previously known as failure to thrive, is a broad term describing children who do not reach their expected weight, length, or body mass index for age. Growth is assessed with standardized World Health Organization charts for children younger than two years and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention charts for children two years and older. Traditional criteria for growth faltering can be imprecise and difficult to track over time; therefore, use of anthropometric z scores are now recommended. These scores can be calculated with a single set of measurements to assess malnutrition severity. Inadequate caloric intake, the most common cause of growth faltering, is identified with a detailed feeding history and physical examination. Diagnostic testing is reserved for those who have severe malnutrition or symptoms concerning for high-risk conditions, or if initial treatment fails. In older children or those with comorbidities, it is important to screen for underlying eating disorders (e.g., avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia). Growth faltering can usually be managed by the primary care physician. If comorbid disease is identified, a multidisciplinary team (e.g., nutritionist, psychologist, pediatric subspecialists) may be beneficial. Failure to recognize and treat growth faltering in the first two years of life may result in decreased adult height and cognitive potential.

### The use of different international references to assess child anthropometric status in a Malaysian population [^b0b87101]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Regardless, consensus on a single international reference is required to allow for accurate comparison of child malnutrition burden across studies worldwide. Among younger children, the WHO 2006 standards are suitable for this use. For older children, our results and other published data are less conclusive about the superiority of any one international reference. Apart from initial consensus on a single reference at present, longitudinal research examining adverse outcomes in adulthood is needed to assess the comparative predictive utility of these references among older children in diverse populations. Given the recognition that measurement of optimal growth and development of prescriptive universal standards may be logistically highly difficult for older children, such research is essential to inform the identification of the most suitable reference to effectively monitor malnutrition, or to clearly establish the potential need for improved references for this age group.

Importantly, the clinical diagnosis of malnutrition in a child should take into account other relevant factors additional to anthropometry, such as body composition, other signs of clinical undernutrition, or potential genetic syndromes. Similarly, high-level decisions to adopt a particular reference should be based on consultation with appropriate clinical, public health, and other experts, keeping in mind both setting-specific aspects and the general issues considered here.

Despite standardization and training of staff in this study, the potential for measurement error remains because instruments were not calibrated during the survey. This may have some implications in terms of misclassification of anthropometry but is not expected to affect the relative differences and measures of agreement between references. Moreover, although patterns observed here were similar to previous evidence, our exact findings may not be fully generalizable to other populations. Nonetheless, our findings highlight the need for a better-informed, harmonized approach to assessing anthropometric status among older children across populations.

To conclude, we observed notable differences between 3 international BMI references in the classification of child underweight, overweight, and obesity, and subsequent estimates of prevalence. Our results indicate the need for the universal use of at least 1 reference to ensure comparability across populations, and for further longitudinal studies to assess the comparative ability of both international and local references to predict the future risk of cardiometabolic and other outcomes. Clearer consensus on the use of anthropometric references to measure malnutrition will be important to inform and guide global initiatives which drive national policy, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

### New WHO guideline on the prevention and management of acute malnutrition in infants and young children: remaining challenges [^6e7bd90b]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Wasting and nutritional oedema, often referred to together as 'acute malnutrition', are life-threatening nutritional disorders that affect infants and young children under 5 years. Over the last 25 years, significant advances have been made in managing acute malnutrition, including improving inpatient protocols for severely ill children and expanding opportunities for management beyond the inpatient setting to community-based programmes for children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). More recent advances have included the incorporation of front-line workers into national and regional systems to detect and treat acute malnutrition; and greater recognition of the dynamic nature of growth faltering and weight loss, including relapse after treatment for SAM.

Despite these technical and clinical advances, global progress to eliminate acute malnutrition has been slow. In 2022, around 6.8% of all children under 5 years old (45 million children) experienced wasting, short of the global 2025 target of 5%. Against this background, the WHO released new, updated guidelines on the management of wasting and nutritional oedema on 20 November 2023. The current version is a much-needed update and major expansion from the last edition published in 2013. Areas of expansion include guidelines for supportive care of infants with risk factors for poor growth and development, integrated care of both caregivers and children, management of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), and continuity care after inpatient discharge.

With the introduction of these new guidelines, a group of global health practitioners and child nutrition experts met to review the guidelines critically, with a particular emphasis on social paediatrics and child rights. Our primary goal was to offer insights into the challenges of implementing these directives, drawing from our varied experiences in lower-resourced settings around the world. Each team member conducted a thorough review of the guidelines and contributed key talking points, which were subsequently synthesised.

The most important policy implication of the new guidelines is the inclusion of Good Practice Statements — plain language and sensible summaries of high-impact interventions and approaches. Many of these Good Practice Statements push for more timely, comprehensive approaches, with a particular focus on the onset of acute malnutrition. These guidelines provide Ministries of Health and other stakeholders, including clinician organisations, civil society and advocacy organisations, with the evidence they need to allocate resources to social programmes upstream rather than focusing exclusively on the acute phase of malnutrition.

Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

United States pediatric undernutrition — epidemiology and risk context notes that the current prevalence of U.S. children who experience acute or chronic undernutrition is unknown, but undernutrition in the United States is most frequently observed in hospitalized acute and/or chronically ill children and in U.S. children with special healthcare needs. It is estimated that approximately 17% of U.S. children and adolescents between 2 and 19 years of age are obese, and other data sets estimate that 1 in 10 U.S. households with children struggle with food insecurity. Older studies suggest that up to 25% of all hospitalized children experienced acute protein-energy malnutrition and approximately 27% of children in the community experience chronic food insecurity. Children and youth with special healthcare needs should be routinely screened for malnutrition in primary care settings.

### Kwashiorkor in the United States… [^a2ba48b3]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

On physical examination, she was an irritable edematous infant. Her height, head circumference, and weight were significantly decreased for her age. She had diffuse, fine, reddish brown scale over her abdomen in a reticulated pattern. Crusting and superficial erosions were noted in the diaper area. Her lower extremities had extensive desquamation and edema. Patient 5. Diffuse fine scale in a reticulated pattern over the abdomen. Patient 5. Crusting and superficial erosions in the diaper area. Patient 5. Extensive edema and desquamation over the lower extremities. Edema can mask decreased muscle mass and subcutaneous fat, making growth failure less evident. Half of the cases were the result of a deliberate deviation from a standard diet because of a perceived intolerance of formula or milk. The subsequent replacement diets were all deficient in protein.

Two patients had significant financial and social stresses directly contributing to the development of kwashiorkor. Three patients developed kwashiorkor as a result of parental nutritional ignorance. Other contributing factors included poor feeding skills, secondary ileitis, and suspected milk protein allergies. The duration of symptoms ranged from 2 weeks to 5 months. Comment Williams1 formally characterized kwashiorkor in 1953 from more than 20 years of observations of children in Africa. In African children, clinical features include edema, fatty liver changes, apathy, irritability, growth failure, depigmentation of the hair, a dermatosis, a low-protein diet, and the onset of symptoms in the second or third year of life. The clinical findings of our 12 cases were consistent with those found in previous reports.

The most common physical examination sign was a rash, although this may reflect a referral bias in our series since all of these cases were diagnosed by pediatric dermatologists. The dermatoses ranged from erythematous or hyperpigmented desquamating plaques, most prominent in the flexures and diaper area, to the classic flaky paint dermatitis that, when present, is pathognomonic for kwashiorkor. In these latter 2 patients, it may be impossible to exclude zinc deficiency as a contributing factor, but the presence of edema and hypoalbuminemia make it likely that protein malnutrition was the primary problem.

Pediatric malnutrition, a prominent marker of societal and global health inequalities, poses a significant threat to children's health, brain development, and broader societal progress. Malnutrition remains an important problem in both low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs).

WHO defines malnutrition as including undernutrition (stunting and wasting), overweight, and micronutrient deficiencies. The subtypes of malnutrition that can be identified through growth monitoring are undernutrition (stunting and wasting) and overweight. Stunting, which results from chronic undernutrition in early childhood, is associated with poor cognitive and academic outcomes in school-aged children and with an increased risk of chronic disease and lower economic productivity in adulthood. At the other end of the malnutrition spectrum, overweight in childhood is also associated with chronic diseases that lead to premature mortality in adulthood.

### Developing the 2023 WHO guideline on wasting and nutritional oedema in infants and children: key reflections on processes and methods [^f84013e1]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

WHO standards and methods for guideline development

The 2023 WHO guideline on wasting and nutritional oedema was prepared in accordance with WHO's standards and methods for guideline development underpinned by collaborative and transparent decision-making. These best practice standards and methods include the use of high-quality systematic reviews, diverse representation in GDGs, disclosure and management of competing interests and the use of Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).GRADE is an explicit, systematic approach for assessing the certainty of evidence when conducting systematic reviews, and for translating evidence into recommendations, where the latter is supported by the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework. These frameworks help guideline development panels use evidence in a structured and transparent way to inform decisions when developing recommendations. The frameworks make explicit the domains used to assess interventions or options, the judgements made and the research evidence and additional considerations used to inform judgements. As one of WHO's normative products, a guideline and the recommendations it contains have clear definitions (box 1).

Box 1
What is a WHO guideline?

A WHO guideline is an information product developed by WHO containing one or more recommendations for clinical practice or public health policy.

A recommendation: is a clear, actionable statement.

This tells the intended end-user of the guideline what he or she can or should do in specific situations to achieve the best health outcomes possible, individually or collectively. This offers a choice among different interventions or measures having an anticipated positive impact on health and implications for the use of resources. This helps the user of the guideline to make informed decisions on whether to undertake specific interventions, clinical tests or public health measures and on where and when to do so. This helps the user to select and prioritise across a range of potential interventions.

Guideline development at WHO encompasses clear processes across three broad stages related to (1) planning and organisation, (2) development and (3) publishing and updating of guidelines, outlined in figure 1. Detailed guidance is provided on all elements of the process across the stages that should be done and who should be involved. Some elements of the three stages are iterative and require returning to preceding elements or looking ahead to anticipate, plan and make pragmatic but transparent and justified decisions to move processes forward. Details around the methods and approaches used for all stages of developing the 2023 WHO guideline on wasting and nutritional oedema are provided in the published guideline, which contains 21 recommendations and 12 good practice statements.

### Consensus statement of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics / American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition: indicators recommended for the identification and documentation of pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) [^31c1df14]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Consensus statement purpose and scope — indicators for pediatric undernutrition state that the purpose of this consensus statement is to identify a basic set of indicators that can be used to diagnose and document undernutrition in the pediatric population ages 1 month to 18 years, and the indicators are intended for use in multiple settings (eg, acute, ambulatory care/outpatient, residential care). However, identifying criteria for use in screening for nutritional risk is not the purpose of this paper, and the diagnosis and documentation of undernutrition in neonates, the recognition and documentation of micronutrient deficits in the pediatric population, and strategies to address micronutrient deficits are beyond the scope of this statement; the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric obesity (overnutrition) are also not addressed in this statement.

### Hunger and malnutrition in the 21st century [^1f150131]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Characterising the problem

A recent report for the World Committee on Food Security argued that "malnutrition in all its forms — not only hunger, but also micronutrient deficiencies, as well as overweight and obesity — is… a critical challenge not only in the developing but also in the developed countries. Resolving malnutrition requires a better understanding of the determinants and processes that influence diets". Malnutrition ranges from extreme hunger and undernutrition to obesity (box 1). Furthermore, malnutrition is found in all countries, irrespective of their economic development, where people lack high quality diets. Thus, solutions to hunger and to all forms of malnutrition need to focus on ensuring an adequate supply of food, but equally, on the quality of diets.

Box 1
Terms and definitions

Hunger is characterised in many ways. It encompasses individual sensations and household behavioural responses, food scarcity (actual or feared) and national food balance sheets that focus on supply of energy (kilocalories) in any country in relation to a minimum threshold of need. The food balance sheet approach is the only standard of measurement used globally. It is based on data collated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This organisation has replaced its previous use of the word "hunger" in describing this metric with the phrase "chronic undernourishment". This today is defined as "a person's inability to acquire enough food to meet daily minimum dietary energy requirements during 1 year"
Malnutrition — An all inclusive term that represents all manifestations of poor nutrition. It can mean any or all forms of undernutrition, overweight, and obesity
Undernutrition — Refers to any form of nutritional deficiency, particularly those manifest in maternal underweight, child stunting, child wasting, or micronutrient deficiencies. It does not include reference to overweight and obesity
Maternal underweight — A body mass index (BMI) of < 18.5 among women of reproductive age. This typically reflects chronic energy deficiency coupled with a lack of other key macronutrients or micronutrients, ill health, or energy expenditure higher than consumption. A prevalence > 20% indicates a serious public health problem
Child stunting — Height for age ≤ −2 standard deviations of the median for children aged 6–59 months, according to World Health Organization child growth standards
Child wasting — Weight for height ≤ −2 standard deviations of the median for children aged 6–59 months, according to WHO child growth standards
Micronutrient deficiencies — A lack of various key vitamins and minerals leads to a range of symptoms that are of global concern. These include anaemia due to iron deficiency and risk of child mortality associated with clinical vitamin A deficiency. Such deficiencies are measured in several ways, including biomarkers (assessed using blood, serum, urine, etc), clinical manifestations, or proxy measures of diet quality
Overweight and obesity — For non-pregnant adults, a BMI ≥ 25 represents being overweight. The threshold for obesity is a BMI ≥ 30. Child obesity is of increasing concern and was included in the latest global nutrition goals for 2030 ("no increase in childhood obesity")

Primary indicators when a single data point is available — pediatric malnutrition classification uses z score thresholds across anthropometrics. Under the columns "Mild Malnutrition", "Moderate Malnutrition", and "Severe Malnutrition", weight-for-height z score is −1 to −1.9 z score, −2 to −2.9 z score, and −3 or greater z score, respectively; BMI-for-age z score is −1 to −1.9 z score, −2 to −2.9 z score, and −3 or greater z score, respectively; and length/height-for-age z score provides "No data" for mild and moderate, with severe specified as −3 z score (BMI, body mass index).

### Consensus statement of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics / American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition: indicators recommended for the identification and documentation of pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) [^0d6fb212]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric malnutrition — weight gain velocity — defines growth velocity as the rate of change in weight or length/height over time, with length for children under 24 months of age and height for children greater than 24 months of age reflecting nutritional status over a prolonged period. A negative z score can be used to determine pediatric malnutrition when only a single data point is available, and over time, declines in z scores for length/height can also be used to determine undernutrition. Very low weight velocity and weight loss have been noted to be "independently and more closely related to mortality than other indicators of malnutrition, such as BMI for age", and with ongoing adequate nutrient intake, the child recovers and "catch-up growth" with greater than normal rates of weight gain velocity results.

### Should a single growth standard be used to judge the nutritional status of children under age 5 y globally? Debate consensus [^b918b025]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

BOX 1
Points of agreement

- Target-based advocacy is important for ensuring political commitment and monitoring progress of policies and their implementation for improving the welfare and nutrition of children aged < 5 y, particularly the marginalized. Advocacy needs to be balanced, taking into consideration countries' priorities, available resources, and contexts. The tools used for monitoring progress should be accurate and not lead to any risk of harmful consequences.
- Different dimensions of physical growth in children aged < 5 y are used in monitoring tools in clinical and public health practice, including for the evaluation of nutritional status. These dimensions are not necessarily correlated in the same way across different contexts. A similarity in linear-growth (stature-for-age) among different populations does not automatically imply corresponding equivalence in other dimensions such as weight-for-stature, weight-for-age, or head circumference. When evaluating children in clinical settings, the entire spectrum of anthropometry needs to be considered.
- Physical growth is not the only dimension of nutritional status to be monitored in clinical and public health practice; anthropometry is thus only one of the diagnostic indicators of nutritional status.
- For global monitoring of public health, there are standard definitions of the different indicators, such as stunting, wasting, and overweight. However, to avoid misinterpretation and prevent misuse in routine clinical and public health settings, appropriate usage and implications of all growth-related indicators needs to be understood by all stakeholders.

Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Growth parameters — measurement and monitoring describe that "Growth is the primary outcome measure of nutritional status in children" and "Growth should be monitored at regular intervals throughout childhood and adolescence and should also be measured every time a child presents, in any healthcare setting, for preventive, acute, or chronic care". In children "less than 36 months of age, measures of growth include length-for-age, weight-for-age, head circumference-for-age, and weight-for-length", while in children ages "2–20 years" measures include "standing height-for-age, weight-for-age, and body mass index (BMI)-for-age". Anthropometric measures are "typically expressed and reported in comparison with population data", traditionally "expressed as percentiles", but "a percentile does not reveal the actual degree of deviation from population norms" and "will always be positive because the bell-shaped curve, statistically, has an infinite tail on both sides".

JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult malnutrition — assessment incorporation into clinical care states that, if malnutrition is suspected in ambulatory care, the physician, ideally with a qualified nutrition professional, should assess the characteristics, and that a plan to address observed nutrition deficits should be developed and implemented with the characteristics monitored at frequent intervals followed by plan revision until nutrition status is optimized; discharge care plans should include monitoring at office or clinic visits. Incorporation into practice emphasizes using history and clinical diagnosis because the chief complaint and past medical history can be helpful in raising suspicion for increased risk of malnutrition and the presence or absence of inflammation, and using physical examination to reveal diagnostic characteristics such as weight loss or gain, fluid retention, and loss of muscle or fat, and to identify clinical signs of inflammation including fever or hypothermia and nonspecific signs such as tachycardia and hyperglycemia.

### Stunting is not a synonym of malnutrition [^f89c0289]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

WHO documents characterize stunting as, "… impaired growth and development that children experience from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation". The equation of stunting with malnutrition is common. This contrasts with historic and modern observations indicating that growth in height is largely independent of the extent and nature of the diet.

Subjects

We measured 1716 Indonesian children, aged 6.0–13.2 years, from urban Kupang/West-Timor and rural Soe/West-Timor, urban Ubud/Bali, and rural Marbau/North Sumatra. We clinically assessed signs of malnutrition and skin infections.

Results

There was no relevant correlation between nutritional status (indicated by skinfold thickness) and height SDS (hSDS). In total 53% of boys, and 46% girls in rural Soe were stunted, with no meaningful association between mean of triceps and subscapular skinfolds (x̅SF) and height. Skinfold thickness was close to German values. Shortest and tallest children did not differ relevantly in skinfold thickness. The same applied for the association between hSDS and mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) using linear mixed effects models with both fixed and random effects. In total 35.6% boys and 29.2% girls in urban Ubud were overweight; 21.4% boys and 12.4% girls obese, but with mean hSDS = -0.3, still short. Relevant associations between hSDS and x̅SF and MUAC were only found among the overweight urban children confirming that growth is accelerated in overweight and obese children. There were no visible clinical signs of malnutrition or chronic infection in the stunted children.

Conclusion

The present data seriously question the concept of stunting as prima facie evidence of malnutrition and chronic infection.

### Should a single growth standard be used to judge the nutritional status of children under age 5 years globally: yes [^f9f8548b]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Main Argument (Borghi)

Childhood nutritional status serves as a lens through which nations and communities identify missed opportunities to improve health and wellbeing across the life cycle as well as economic development and other related sectors. Although it is well known that the greatest benefits result from improving nutrition in the early stages of life, the so-called "window of opportunity", a life-course perspective to improving nutrition is also needed, targeting older children and adolescents beyond infants and young children. Countries should be provided appropriate tools to assess their children's nutritional status to identify and tackle the causes of malnutrition, thus improving health and wellbeing across the entire life cycle. Having such tools based on optimal growth patterns depicted by children living under nearly ideal environmental conditions and given appropriate feeding is essential to ensure that all children, regardless of their place of birth, achieve their full growth potential. The WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) proved this is possible when children from 6 different sites showed they grow linearly strikingly similarly.

In 2012, the World Health Assembly endorsed the comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant, and young child nutrition to guide and encourage countries toward improving their population's nutritional status. The plan included 6 targets to be achieved by 2025, 3 of them related to child malnutrition, namely stunting, wasting, and overweight. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Target 2.2 to eliminate all forms of malnutrition incorporated the 2025 global nutrition targets and included in its accountability framework the 3 child malnutrition targets. The SDG agenda was accepted by all countries and is applicable to all, considering different national realities, capacities, and levels of development and respecting national policies and priorities.

The child malnutrition indicators for tracking countries' progress toward the agreed-upon targets are based on standard definitions of nutritional status against the widely adopted and used WHO Child Growth Standards.

Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF pediatric undernutrition — definitions and thresholds specify that in children ages 6–60 months, severe acute undernutrition is defined as very low weight-for-height (less than −3 standard deviations [SD] [z scores] of the median WHO growth standards), by visible severe wasting (mid-upper arm circumference [MUAC] ≤ 115 mm), or by the presence of nutritional edema; chronic undernutrition (stunting) is defined as height-for-age (or length-for-age) less than −2 SD (z score) of the median of the NCHS/WHO international reference. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) defines chronic conditions as those that have lasted for 3 months or longer. Stunting is identified as a well-established indicator of chronic malnutrition; length-for-age is recommended for children ≤ 2 years of age, and children in the age range of 0–4 years have the best potential outcomes from comprehensive assessment for malnutrition.

Pediatric malnutrition classification — historical percentage-of-ideal-body-weight schemes and current z score approach are outlined as follows: historically, pediatric malnutrition related to undernutrition has been classified as a percentage of ideal body weight, with the Gomez Classification and the Waterlow Criteria defining mild, moderate, and severe malnutrition as 76%–90%, 61%–75%, and < 60% and 80%–89%, 70%–79%, and < 70%, respectively. In the past, definitions also included decreases in 2 centile channels or faltering growth as weight below the fifth percentile, whereas the use of z score, decline in z score, and negative z score to identify and document pediatric malnutrition/undernutrition is now recommended.

Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Mid–upper arm circumference (MUAC) in pediatric malnutrition — MUAC should be measured when assessing the nutritional status of pediatric patients and can be used as an independent anthropometric assessment tool in determining malnutrition in children 6–59 months of age compared with WHO standards; percentile guidelines are available for ages 1–79 years. MUAC has been correlated to body mass index (BMI) in children and adults and has shown to be more sensitive to changes in muscle and fat mass than BMI in adults. MUAC measurements should be part of the full anthropometric assessment in all patients and are particularly important when weight may be affected by lower extremity edema, ascites, or steroids; when serial z scores are unavailable, serial MUAC measurements can be used to monitor changes in body composition. MUAC has been indicated as a more sensitive prognostic indicator of mortality than weight-for-height parameters in malnourished pediatric patients, and it is advisable to have trained individuals consistently perform measurements for long-term comparison.

Adult malnutrition — considerations in clinical settings notes that each diagnostic characteristic may sometimes be seen in patients for whom malnutrition is not necessarily an appropriate diagnosis, and describes that people with severe acute illness or severe trauma often experience extreme metabolic stress with a massive inflammatory response that limits the effectiveness of nutrition interventions and can contribute to the rapid development of malnutrition such that many critically ill patients already are or may be at significant risk early in the hospital course, and the resultant malnutrition often blunts the effectiveness of medical therapies prescribed. In this context, inability to eat, repeated or extended cessation of feeding regimens, frequent interruptions in oral or enteral nutrition therapies, and unintended weight change may be parameters of particular significance, and frequent, intensive monitoring of the critically ill patient to determine the actual level of nutrients provided is needed; the clinician should also recognize that the degree of inflammatory response often changes as illness acuity changes.

### Lay health workers in primary and community health care for maternal and child health: identification and treatment of wasting in children [^dec23f19]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Description of the condition

Wasting, stunting, and being underweight are the three subforms of child undernutrition. According to WHO, wasting (or acute malnutrition) refers to a child who is too thin for his or her height, stunting to a child who is too short for his or her age, and underweight to a child who is too thin for his or her age (WHO 2021).

Wasting in children aged five years or younger may be categorised as moderate or severe according to clinical measures. These measures include the deviation of their weight‐for‐height from the mean of the WHO Child Growth Standards (weight‐for‐height Z‐score; WHZ), the mid‐upper arm circumference (MUAC), and the presence of bilateral oedema (UNICEF 2009; see Table 3).

1
Diagnostic criteria and classification of wasting for children aged five years or under

Wasting in children is the life‐threatening result of poor nutrient intake, disease, or both. Children suffering from wasting have weakened immunity, are susceptible to long‐term developmental delays, and face an increased risk of death, particularly when wasting is severe. These children require urgent feeding, treatment, and care to survive.

When efforts to prevent malnutrition fall short, early detection and treatment of children with wasting and other life‐threatening forms of malnutrition are critical to saving their lives and putting them on the path to healthy growth and development. Children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) are currently treated with special therapeutic foods, most commonly ready‐to‐use therapeutic food (RUTF) or F75 and F100 milk‐based diets (Schoonees 2019).

In 2019, 47.0 million children aged five years or under were wasted, of whom 14.3 million were severely wasted. More than 90% of all wasted children lived in low‐ or lower‐middle‐income countries. More specifically, more than two‐thirds (69%) of all wasted children aged five years or under lived in Asia (69%), and more than one‐quarter (27%) lived in Africa (UNICEF 2020).

### Radiological insights into pediatric undernutrition: early detection, complications, and a structured evaluation approach [^14816591]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite a decade of significant growth in economic conditions of South Asian countries, people continue to suffer from the pervading problem of malnutrition. High prevalence of child undernutrition despite unprecedented economic growth in these nations have a multifactorial etiology including fetal malnutrition and status of women, inadequate feeding practices in infant and young child, poor household sanitation and untargeted health schemes. The diagnosis and management of malnutrition and its various complications require a multidisciplinary approach and radiologists have a potentially important, albeit currently underutilized, role in early detection, identifying the other clinical mimics such as endocrinal and genetic disorders, and detection of key complications. In this review, we apprise the radiological aspects of PEM and micro-nutritional deficiency and their complications. We also provide a comprehensive structured evaluation scheme for evaluation of a suspected malnourished child.

### Effectiveness of three commonly used transition phase diets in the inpatient management of children with severe acute malnutrition: a pilot randomized controlled trial in Malawi [^6fb770f4]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) affects an estimated 20 million children worldwide and results in high mortality rates of up to half a million child deaths under the age of five annually. SAM is defined by a weight-for-height Z-score greater than three below the mean (based on the 2006 WHO growth standards), a mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of less than 115 mm or by the presence of nutritional edema. Severe acute malnutrition differs from severe chronic malnutrition, which manifests as stunting. Severely malnourished children without complications are currently treated as outpatients in community-based management (CMAM) programmes using specially formulated ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF). However, children with complicated SAM (i.e. SAM plus the presence of 'danger signs' such as fever, absent appetite, pneumonia, dehydration, severe edema) require inpatient treatment. Therapeutic feeding for these children involves three phases. In the stabilization phase, life-threatening problems are treated, the child is metabolically stabilized and a low-protein milk-based formula diet, 'F-75', is provided. Once appetite is regained, feeds are being finished and edema has started to resolve, the child will be gradually transitioned to a diet with a higher protein and energy content. In this transition phase three nutritional strategies are commonly used: F100, RUTF or RUTF supplemented with F75. The patient will enter the last stage of nutritional rehabilitation, the rehabilitation phase, when the child finishes all transition phase feeds and is clinically stable. Mortality can reach up to 30% for complicated SAM and often occurs within the first 48 h after admission to a nutritional rehabilitation unit, i.e. during the stabilization phase. Nevertheless, mortality is still substantial later during admission and even after discharge.

JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Academy) and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) recommend that a standardized set of diagnostic characteristics be used to identify and document adult malnutrition in routine clinical practice. An etiologically based diagnostic nomenclature that incorporates a current understanding of the role of the inflammatory response on malnutrition's incidence, progression, and resolution is proposed. Universal use of a single set of diagnostic characteristics will facilitate malnutrition's recognition, contribute to more valid estimates of its prevalence and incidence, guide interventions, and influence expected outcomes. This standardized approach will also help to more accurately predict the human and financial burdens and costs associated with malnutrition's prevention and treatment and further ensure the provision of high-quality, cost-effective nutrition care.

### Body composition of children with moderate and severe undernutrition and after treatment: a narrative review [^c58fafba]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite substantial progress in prevention and treatment, child undernutrition remains a major global health challenge and still contributes to around half of all deaths in children under 5 years of age. Greater understanding of how undernutrition affects different body components might enable the development of clinical and public health interventions that are more effective in promoting survival and long-term quality of life, through reversing tissue deficits and their functional consequences.

Until recently, undernourished children were usually assessed using simple anthropometric measurements, which provided global assessments of nutritional status. This approach built on conceptual advances made in the 1970s, when the pioneering nutritionist John Waterlow proposed a distinction between 'chronically' and 'acutely' undernourished children, based on measurements of height or weight. Subsequently, this evolved into the routine practice of categorising children as either 'stunted' (defined as having an inadequate height for age z-score, HAZ), or 'wasted' (defined as having an inadequate weight for height z-score, WHZ, or mid-upper arm circumference, MUAC). This approach can be further adapted to differentiate between moderate underweight-for-height, versus severe underweight-for-height, or wasting.

### Nutritional deficiencies during normal growth [^804c8a3f]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Nutritional deficiencies have always been a major consideration in pediatrics. Although the classic forms of many of the well-documented nutritional deficiencies are memorized during training as a physician, nutritional deficiencies that can occur in otherwise asymptomatic normally growing children are often overlooked. The two most common deficiencies seen in children who are growing normally are iron and vitamin D deficiencies. These deficiencies are surprisingly common and can have a significant impact on the overall health of a child. This article reviews these nutritional deficiencies and other less commonly seen deficiencies in children who are otherwise growing normally.

Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) criteria — age scope and cutoffs for undernutrition are specified: classification of undernutrition using MUAC measures was suggested in children between the ages of 6 and 60 months. Children who are severely malnourished are defined as those with measurements < 11.5 cm; moderately malnourished as those with measurements between 11.5 and 12.4 cm, and at risk of malnutrition as those with measurements between 12.5 and 13.4 cm. An analysis by WHO and UNICEF showed that children with a weight-for-height z score less than −3 SD were at a 9-fold greater risk of death than children with a z score of −1 SD.

### Consensus statement of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics / American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition: indicators recommended for the identification and documentation of pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) [^162e5cbe]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric malnutrition assessment — growth charts and z scores — emphasizes that growth measurements that cross z score lines indicate possible risk, and children who are growing and developing normally will be on or between −1 and 1 z scores. For reference standards, the CDC recommends that the WHO comparative data charts be used for U.S. children from birth to 2 years of age and that the CDC comparative data charts be used for ages 2–20 years, noting that growth charts are not intended for use as a sole diagnostic instrument but contribute to the formation of an overall clinical impression.

### Infants and children 6–59 months of age with severe wasting and / or nutritional oedema: evidence gaps identified during WHO guideline development [^731248f1]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

The way forward

The 2023 WHO guideline comes at a critical juncture with the risk of severe wasting and nutritional oedema increasing particularly in regions experiencing conflict, food insecurity and economic instability. This guideline promotes evidence-informed care that can be scaled and integrated into broader systems, ensuring that vulnerable children receive life-saving support even as global conditions remain unpredictable or worsen.

However, despite presenting recommendations based on the best available evidence, significant evidence gaps remain. Standardised research protocols with a clearly defined set of core outcomes could help to generate data that can be pooled to provide higher certainty evidence that will impact the development of future guidelines, ensuring that recommendations are based on relevant, comparable evidence. These core outcomes, when integrated into research and clinical practice workflows, will allow for harmonisation of outcome assessments across different contexts.

Additionally, there is an ethical imperative to definitively answer fundamental questions about dosage, efficacy and adverse effects of current treatment protocols as failure to do so could result in ineffective or harmful treatment, misused resources and inequity in care. Future randomised controlled trials with proper ethical oversight could be used to test different dosages or treatment regimens and implement adaptive trial designs that respond to findings in real time and reduce participant risks.

This guideline calls researchers to address evidence gaps, focus on operational feasibility and promote contextualised research. Funders are urged to invest in implementation research and priority areas identified by the WHO, and policy-makers are encouraged to strengthen health systems and build equity and access. It is therefore critical for researchers, practitioners, decision-makers and funders to align on key knowledge priorities to provide the evidence that will help ensure better short-term, medium-term and long-term outcomes for infants and children 6–59 months of age with severe wasting and/or nutritional oedema.

### GLIM criteria for the diagnosis of malnutrition: a consensus report from the global clinical nutrition community [^37d1fdbf]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This initiative aims to build a global consensus around core diagnostic criteria for malnutrition in adults in clinical settings.

Methods

The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) was convened by several of the major global clinical nutrition societies. Empirical consensus was reached through a series of face-to-face meetings, telephone conferences, and e-mail communications.

Results

A 2-step approach for the malnutrition diagnosis was selected, that is, first screening to identify at risk status by the use of any validated screening tool, and second, assessment for diagnosis and grading the severity of malnutrition. The malnutrition criteria for consideration were retrieved from existing approaches for screening and assessment. Potential criteria were subjected to a ballot among GLIM participants that selected 3 phenotypic criteria (non-volitional weight loss, low body mass index, and reduced muscle mass) and 2 etiologic criteria (reduced food intake or assimilation, and inflammation or disease burden). To diagnose malnutrition at least 1 phenotypic criterion and 1 etiologic criterion should be present. Phenotypic metrics for grading severity are proposed. It is recommended that the etiologic criteria be used to guide intervention and anticipated outcomes. The recommended approach supports classification of malnutrition into four etiology-related diagnosis categories.

Conclusions

A consensus scheme for diagnosing malnutrition in adults in clinical settings on a global scale is proposed. Next steps are to secure endorsements from leading nutrition professional societies, to identify overlaps with syndromes like cachexia and sarcopenia, and to promote dissemination, validation studies, and feedback. The construct should be re-considered every 3–5 years.

### Risk factors for mortality and effect of correct fluid prescription in children with diarrhoea and dehydration without severe acute malnutrition admitted to Kenyan hospitals: an observational, association study [^8746e5b1]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A studyusing the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative's methodology recently identified risk factors for diarrhoeal deaths as a research priority. This study investigated clinical features associated with mortality and whether, for early deaths, associations are modified by prescribed fluid therapy in accordance with WHO and Kenyan guidance in children with both diarrhoea and dehydration. We used routinely collected data from 13 first-level referral hospitals in Kenya involved in a collaborative effort to improve availability of routine data on admitted children and the management of common conditions. We excluded children who had severe acute malnutrition, a known major risk factor for mortality with specific fluid management guidance, and children younger than 30 days or older than 5 years because no standard rehydration guidelines exist for those ages. We did not have microbial cultures of stool or blood but malaria testing is done consistently by these hospitals in their own laboratories.

In our study of 8562 children admitted with both diarrhoea and dehydration, we found that most (> 80%) had at least one additional diagnosis (comorbidity). We also note that diarrhoea not accompanied by clinically diagnosed dehydration is a common symptom in a range of diseases. Among participants with diarrhoea and dehydration (representing 16% of all admissions and associated with 28% of all death), respiratory signs, circulatory impairment, pallor, neurological signs and symptoms, prolonged diarrhoea, age younger than 1 year, and female sex were associated with increased risk of in-hospital death. Our findings are consistent with studies that have shown impaired consciousness, convulsions, signs of pneumonia, anaemia, weak pulse volume, longer duration of preadmission illness, and persistent diarrhoea, as risk factors for mortality in children with diarrhoea. Respiratory signs might in fact be indicative of pneumonia comorbidity. Female sex and younger age (< 1 year), which were significantly associated with mortality in this study, have also been found to be risk factors in other studies. Our study did not investigate reasons for higher mortality in female participants than in male participants; some of the reasons suggested include social inequality and gender bias, but whether these factors are also important in Kenya is unclear.

### Child undernutrition in Kenya: trend analyses from 1993 to 2008–09 [^05ad2424]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide, about 2.2 million children die annually, with poor nutritional status as an underlying cause. Global statistics for surviving undernourished children indicate that approximately 171 million children are chronically undernourished (stunted), 60 million are acutely undernourished (wasted), and 100 million are underweight. Undernutrition is not only linked to child mortality but also to poor functional development of the child. Undernourished children are highly susceptible to common childhood ailments like diarrhea, respiratory infections and worm infestations. Recurrence of such ailments falters a child's physical, behavioral, motor and cognitive development, and also compromises her/his health and functioning in adulthood. Combatting child undernutrition is obviously crucial, and its complexity makes it hard to tackle. It results not only from macronutrient deficiencies (protein, fat and carbohydrate) but also from micronutrient deficiencies (trace minerals and vitamins), among which zinc deficiency is particularly deleterious to children's normal growth. Therefore, different aspects of food deprivation (quantity, quality and food group diversity) lead to different manifestations of undernutrition (wasting, stunting and underweight). Consequently, child undernutrition is a multidimensional problem that defies simple solutions. There is a fundamental need to better understand the public health dimensions of the problem, to provide a foundation for precisely targeted interventions in local contexts.

### The impact of growth monitoring and promotion on health indicators in children under five years of age in low-and middle-income countries [^448f18dd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Undernutrition in the critical first 1000 days of life is the most common form of childhood malnutrition, and a significant problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The effects of undernutrition in children aged under five years are wide-ranging and include increased susceptibility to and severity of infections; impaired physical and cognitive development, which diminishes school and work performance later in life; and death. Growth monitoring and promotion (GMP) is a complex intervention that comprises regular measurement and charting of growth combined with promotion activities. Policymakers, particularly in international aid agencies, have differing and changeable interpretations and perceptions of the purpose of GMP. The effectiveness of GMP as an approach to preventing malnutrition remains a subject of debate, particularly regarding the added value of growth monitoring compared with promotion alone.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of child growth monitoring and promotion for identifying and addressing faltering growth, improving infant and child feeding practices, and promoting contact with and use of health services in children under five years of age in low- and middle-income countries.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 3 November 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and controlled before-after studies that compared GMP with standard care or nutrition education alone in non-hospitalised children aged under five years.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods to conduct a narrative synthesis. Our primary outcomes were anthropometric indicators, infant and child feeding practices, and health service usage. Secondary outcomes were frequency and severity of childhood illnesses, and mortality. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each primary outcome.

Main Results

We included six studies reported in eight publications. We grouped the findings according to intervention. Community-based growth monitoring and promotion (without supplementary feeding) versus standard care We are unsure if GMP compared to standard care improves infant and child feeding practices, as measured at 24 months by the proportion of infants who have fluids other than breast milk introduced early (49.7% versus 70.5%; 1 study; 4296 observations; very low-certainty evidence). We are unsure if GMP improves health service usage, as measured at 24 months by the proportion of children who receive vitamin A (72.5% versus 62.9%; 1 study; 4296 observations; very low-certainty evidence) and the proportion of children who receive deworming (29.2% versus 14.6%; 1 study; 4296 observations; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported selected anthropometric indicators (weight-for-age z-score or height-for-age z-score) at 12 or 24 months, infant and child feeding practices at 12 months, or health service usage at 12 months. Community-based growth monitoring and promotion (with supplementary feeding) versus standard care Two studies (with 569 participants) reported the mean weight-for-age z-score at 12 months, providing very low-certainty evidence: in one study, there was little or no difference between GMP and standard care (mean difference (MD) -0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.19 to 0.06); in the other study, mean weight-for-age z-score worsened in both groups, but we were unable to calculate a relative effect. GMP versus standard care may make little to no difference to the mean height-for-age z-score at 12 months (MD -0.15, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.04; 1 study, 337 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two studies (with 564 participants) reported a range of outcome measures related to infant and child feeding practices at 12 months, showing little or no difference between the groups (very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported health service usage at 12 or 24 months, feeding practices at 24 months, or selected anthropometric indicators at 24 months.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited uncertain evidence on the effectiveness of GMP for identifying and addressing faltering growth, improving infant and child feeding practices, and promoting contact with and use of health services in children aged under five years in LMICs. Future studies should explore the reasons for the apparent limited impact of GMP on key child health indicators. Reporting of GMP interventions and important outcomes must be transparent and consistent.

### Diverging pathways: exploring the interplay between hospital readmission and postdischarge mortality in paediatric sepsis in low-income settings [^ee337ec4]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

The most starkly observed divergence in effect estimates between readmission and postdischarge death was related to anthropometry, most especially MUAC. Malnutrition has been repeatedly shown to be a key driver for postdischarge mortality, and thus it can be inferred that these children also experience high rates of recurrent illness. Likely, this is because children with malnutrition are also socially vulnerable, and thus their health-seeking patterns diverge compared with non-malnourished children. We have previously shown that low MUAC is also associated with at-home deaths, as compared with deaths during a subsequent readmission. It is also possible that among those most malnourished, the signs and symptoms of severe recurrent illness may be subtle, further reducing the probability of caregivers seeking care. Our study also showed the same divergence in HIV-positive cohort. As financial constraints such as affordability and modes of transportation were the most common barriers to seeking care, being HIV positive can result in poverty, leading to less ability to pay for healthcare. Furthermore, malnutrition and HIV often serve as comorbidities resulting in high death rates in the community. In addition to WHO's recommended community-based nutritional rehabilitation for malnourished children, enhanced convalescent care is needed to improve outcomes and aid recovery in this vulnerable population.

### Should a single growth standard be used to judge the nutritional status of children under age 5 years globally: yes [^c4578242]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Childhood nutritional status serves as a lens through which nations and communities identify missed opportunities to improve health and wellbeing across the life cycle, as well as economic development and other related sectors. Countries have committed to the global nutrition targets endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2012, which were included in the Sustainable Development Goals framework under the target to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030. The child malnutrition indicators for tracking countries' progress toward the agreed-upon targets are based on standard definitions of nutritional status against the widely adopted and used World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards. The standards were based on a sample of healthy breastfed infants and young children from diverse ethnic backgrounds and cultural settings as part of the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study. The WHO Child Growth Standards developed represent the best description of physiological growth for children aged < 5 y. The standards depict normal early childhood growth under optimal environmental conditions and can be used to assess children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and type of feeding.

### Guidance for systematic integration of undernutrition in attributing cause of death in children [^848f71e1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The rationale for these recommendations is as follows. Severe wasting is considered a medical emergency, is a well-established risk factor for child death, and is associated with extreme immunological, metabolic, and other physiological derangements. Under this extreme pathophysiological context, it would be unusual for severe wasting to not be part of the causal chain of events leading to death when present. In rare instances — such as sudden severe injury — severe wasting may not be an underlying cause of fatality. However, the extreme pathophysiology in severe wasting renders little capacity to tolerate and recover from any other insult, including infection, dehydration, and/or injury. Hence, in such circumstances, severe wasting should still be recorded as a contributing condition in part 2 of the death certificate.

The panel also considered scenarios whereby severe wasting status could be due to volume depletion as opposed to nutritional insufficiency (eg, if a child met severe wasting criteria based on low WLZ score but had a normal MUAC). Low WLZ score alone is a mortality risk factor even without low MUAC (and vice versa). However, in addition to nutritional insufficiency, dehydration (secondary to diarrhea or vomiting) and other causes of volume depletion (blood loss), can cause reductions in weight-for-length, albeit transiently.

The panel discussed the possibility of recommending recalculating WLZ scores in conditions that can cause volume depletion, such as to account for a potential 10% weight loss. The panel decided this was too hypothetical to make concrete recommendations at this time and noted that such a "correction factor" would only result in a category shift from severe to moderate wasting "at best". However, the panel agreed that research is needed to determine the proportion of recalculated WLZ scores that would shift from below −3 to −3 or greater (in children without low MUAC) when potential volume loss is considered.

### Screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children [^9fa85b09]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Target condition being diagnosed

Tuberculosis is a communicable disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M tuberculosis). A small fraction of people with tuberculosis infection initially develops active tuberculosis (tuberculosis disease). More commonly, initial infection leads to latent tuberculosis infection, which has the potential to become active tuberculosis throughout a person's lifetime, especially during states of immunosuppression such as HIV infection and malnutrition. M tuberculosis is transmitted from person to person through the air and, therefore, most commonly causes disease in the lungs, referred to as pulmonary tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can, however, occur in any organ or tissue outside of the lungs (referred to as extrapulmonary tuberculosis), with lymph node tuberculosis as the most common form and tuberculous meningitis as the most severe form of extrapulmonary disease. As the most common form of active tuberculosis is lung disease, most screening studies in adults and children evaluate tests and strategies for pulmonary tuberculosis and verify tuberculosis using respiratory specimens. In this review, the target condition is pulmonary tuberculosis.

Signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis include fever, cough, night sweats, weight loss or poor weight gain, visible neck mass, and decreased activity. However, pulmonary tuberculosis symptoms in children, especially those under five years of age, tend to be less specific because they often overlap with other common paediatric conditions such as pneumonia, HIV‐associated lung disease, and malnutrition (Jaganath 2012; Oliwa 2015). Compared to adults, children are much more likely to progress from latent tuberculosis infection to tuberculosis disease. Further, among those progressing to disease, younger children are more likely to experience severe manifestations (Marais 2004; Perez‐Velez 2012).

Microbiological confirmation of pulmonary tuberculosis in children is complicated by two main factors. First, younger children are not able to voluntarily expectorate sputum, which is the standard specimen used for microbiological detection of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults. Therefore, specimens from young children traditionally are collected from more invasive methods such as gastric aspiration and sputum induction (Graham 2015). Second, lung cavities with high bacillary load as seen in pulmonary tuberculosis in adults are uncommon in children, especially in young children under 10 years of age. The number of bacilli causing disease in children tends to be low and the 'paucibacillary' nature of their disease compromises diagnostic yield (Dunn 2016).

### Survey of international pediatric nutritional supportive care practices: a report from the pediatric study group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) [^0b71400c]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Malnutrition is common in children with cancer. While multiple validated malnutrition screens exist, there is no universal, standardized approach to screen or diagnose malnutrition. The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) Pediatric Study Group is focused on oncologic supportive care for children and young adults. This subgroup designed and administered a pilot study to characterize global malnutrition screening, diagnosis, and treatment practices for pediatric patients with cancer after identifying variations in malnutrition practice patterns within its members.

Methods

A novel, exploratory survey was iteratively developed and distributed in early 2020 to 45 MASCC Pediatric Study Group members. The survey included multiple questions with standard patient presentations and nutritional scenarios, and the respondents selected the answer that best reflected the care patients would receive at their institution.

Results

A validated screening tool to assess for malnutrition was routinely used by 15 of 26 respondents (58%). No single validated screen was used by more than 24% of responders, and 11 of 26 (42%) reported not having a standard malnutrition treatment screen. When the same patient was presented with the survey using different malnutrition indicators, patient care plans varied greatly. This was particularly true for z-scores compared to weight percentiles.

Conclusions

Development of consensus recommendations for screening practices, preferred malnutrition indicators, and treatment guidelines could help reduce the underdiagnosis of malnutrition and subsequent variation in its management and ought to be a focus of the global pediatric cancer supportive care community.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^cd027eef]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — probiotics and zinc recommendations — Probiotic preparations may be offered to reduce the symptom severity and duration in immunocompetent adults and children with infectious or antimicrobial-associated diarrhea (weak, moderate), and specific recommendations regarding selection of organism(s), route, and dosage may be found through literature and manufacturer guidance. Oral zinc supplementation reduces the duration of diarrhea in children 6 months to 5 years of age who reside in countries with a high prevalence of zinc deficiency or who have signs of malnutrition (strong, moderate). Meta-analyses report probiotics reduced mean duration of diarrhea by 25 hours (95% confidence interval, 16–34 hours), reduced the risk of diarrhea with a duration > 4 days, and reduced stool frequency on the second day of symptoms, with overall greater efficacy when a viral etiology is identified; most trials report decreased duration and stool frequency, and no adverse events have been directly attributable in healthy recipients, though bacteremia or fungemia has occurred in critically ill or immunocompromised people. For zinc, a meta-analysis of 24 RCTs found oral zinc shortened acute diarrhea in children 6 months to 5 years by 10 hours, with 27 hours reduction among children with signs of malnutrition; the effect on hospitalization and death could not be measured, treatment of persistent diarrhea was shortened by about 16 hours, vomiting was noted to be more common with zinc, and an RCT evaluating a 14-day course in US outpatients and inpatients aged 6 months to 6 years is ongoing.

### Nutritional deficiencies and associated pathologies present unique challenges of diagnosing paediatric inflammatory bowel disease in sub-saharan Africa [^2cf706e5]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Trends, challenges and nutritional deficiencies in paediatric IBD in sub-Saharan Africa

Globally, paediatric IBD is on the rise. About 10% of IBD is diagnosed in children < 16 years. The clinical course of paediatric onset IBD is characterised by a greater disease burden compared with adult-onset IBD. For example, very-early onset IBD in children < 6 years have a greater dominant colonic damage and disease extension whereas in older children the ileocolonic disease is more frequent. Similar to the adult literature, fewer studies have been done in sub-Saharan Africa. Cape Town, S. Africa reported that children and adolescents ≤ 18 years at diagnosis represent 9.7% of 3278 cases of the IBD Africa Registry which is consistent with Western countries. Apart from S. Africa, Nigeria is the only other country with reported paediatric IBD cases.

Diagnosing IBD in African children presents a considerable challenge. Atypical forms of IBD and underlying pathologies such as chronic diarrhoea, iron deficiency anaemia, malnutrition and failure to thrive because of chronic enteric infections, parasites, intestinal tuberculosis and environmental enteropathy are pervasive clinical problems. Deciphering these common intestinal maladies and underlying malnutrition from IBD presents an enormous challenge for clinicians including clinical dietitians. For example, enteric pathogenic infections in children synergistically result in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and hyperactive immune response, both of which are hallmarks of IBD. In addition, children with IBD often present with disease-related malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and protein-energy malnutrition at diagnosis during active disease and remission. Specifically, iron, zinc, B vitamins, fat-soluble vitamins and protein-energy deficiencies are most common. These are also common nutritional deficiencies in children living in low- and middle-income countries and are of particular concern in sub-Saharan Africa where an estimated 216 million children suffer from stunting and malnutrition. Malnutrition can exacerbate IBD severity, impair intestinal wound healing and alter treatment response. For example, deficiencies in vitamin D, iron and zinc which are critical nutrients for intestinal homeostasis and immune function can impair these processes in IBD. Similarly, protein-energy malnutrition which leads to stunting and growth failure are also frequently observed in malnourished children with IBD. On the other hand, the chronic inflammation and ensuing tissue damage caused by IBD may precipitate malabsorption and increased nutrient loss creating a vicious cycle. Whether preexisting and persistent intergenerational malnutrition is a mechanistic cause or consequence of IBD in sub-Saharan African children or leads to new atypical subtypes remains to be experimentally explored.

### Consensus statement of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics / American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition: indicators recommended for the identification and documentation of pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) [^ebfa5261]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Handgrip strength and proxy anthropometrics — limitations and alternatives are noted: mild, moderate, and severe deficit ranges as measured by handgrip strength have not been established; thus, handgrip strength can help to identify the presence of malnutrition but not to quantify the degree of the deficit. In selected diseases or conditions, physical anomalies or patient frailty may limit the clinician's ability to obtain the typical anthropometric measurements used to assess growth, and a number of alternate measurements have been used in such instances to estimate weight and length.

### Adult starvation and disease-related malnutrition: a proposal for etiology-based diagnosis in the clinical practice setting from the international consensus guideline committee [^f018bd55]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Multiple definitions for malnutrition syndromes are found in the literature resulting in confusion. Recent evidence suggests that varying degrees of acute or chronic inflammation are key contributing factors in the pathophysiology of malnutrition that is associated with disease or injury.

Methods

An International Guideline Committee was constituted to develop a consensus approach to defining malnutrition syndromes for adults in the clinical setting. Consensus was achieved through a series of meetings held at the A.S.P.E.N. and ESPEN Congresses.

Results

It was agreed that an etiology-based approach that incorporates a current understanding of inflammatory response would be most appropriate. The Committee proposes the following nomenclature for nutrition diagnosis in adults in the clinical practice setting. "Starvation-related malnutrition", when there is chronic starvation without inflammation, "chronic disease-related malnutrition", when inflammation is chronic and of mild to moderate degree, and "acute disease or injury-related malnutrition", when inflammation is acute and of severe degree.

Conclusions

This commentary is intended to present a simple etiology-based construct for the diagnosis of adult malnutrition in the clinical setting. Development of associated laboratory, functional, food intake, and body weight criteria and their application to routine clinical practice will require validation.

### The prognostic value of dipstick urinalysis in children admitted to hospital with severe malnutrition [^e9af0cc6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Children with severe malnutrition (SAM) present to hospital with an array of complications, resulting in high mortality despite adherence to WHO guidelines. Diagnostic resources in developing countries are limited and bedside tests could help identify high-risk children. Dipstick urinalysis is a bedside screening test for urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs are common in SAM and can lead to secondary invasive bacterial sepsis. Very few studies have examined the usefulness of dipstick screening of urine specimens in SAM and none has explored its prognostic value.

Patients and Methods

A 2-year prospective study on children admitted in Kilifi District Hospital, Kenya, with SAM. Freshly voided, clean catch urine samples were tested using Multistix reagent test strips. Positive samples were sent for culture.

Results

Of the 667 children admitted, 498 children (75%) provided urine samples; of these, 119 (24%) were positive for either leucocyte esterase (LE) or nitrites. Culture-proven UTI was detected in 28 children (6% overall). All isolates were coliforms and were > 50% were resistant to cotrimoxazole and gentamicin. There was no difference in severity signs between those with positive dipstick and those without. Case fatality was higher among children with a positive dipstick (29% vs 12%). Presence of a positive dipstick was a strong predictor of mortality (adjusted HR 2.5).

Conclusions

A urine dipstick positive for either LE or nitrites is a useful predictor of death in children admitted with SAM. Prospective studies to determine the role of untreated UTI in these deaths are needed before any treatment recommendations can be made.

### Clinical and biochemical markers of risk in uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition [^fc4d65d0]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Use of mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) as a single screening tool for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) assumes that children with a low weight-for-height z score (WHZ) and normal MUAC have lower risks of morbidity and mortality. However, the pathophysiology and functional severity associated with different anthropometric phenotypes of SAM have never been well characterized. We compared clinical characteristics, biochemical features, and health and nutrition histories of nonedematous children with SAM who had (1) low WHZ only, (2) both low WHZ and low MUAC, or (3) low MUAC only.

Methods

In Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, and Liberia, we conducted a multicentric cohort study in uncomplicated, nonedematous children with SAM and low MUAC only (n = 161), low WHZ only (n = 138), or a combination of low MUAC and low WHZ (n = 152). Alongside routine anthropometric measurements, we collected a wide range of critical indicators of clinical and nutritional status and viability; these included serum leptin, an adipocytokine negatively associated with mortality risk in SAM.

Results

Median leptin levels at diagnosis were lower in children with low WHZ only (215.8 pg/mL; P < .001) and in those with combined WHZ and MUAC deficits (180.1 pg/mL; P < .001) than in children with low MUAC only (331.50 pg/mL). The same pattern emerged on a wide range of clinical indicators, including signs of severe wasting, dehydration, serum ferritin levels, and caretaker-reported health deterioration, and was replicated across study sites.

Conclusions

Illustrative of the likely heterogeneous functional severity of the different anthropometric phenotypes of SAM, our results confirm the need to retain low WHZ as an independent diagnostic criterion.

### Omitting edema measurement: how much acute malnutrition are we missing? [^b8d061c3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute malnutrition is a major public health issue in low-income countries. It includes both wasting and edematous malnutrition, but the terms wasting and acute malnutrition are often used interchangeably. Little is known about the burden of edematous malnutrition, and few large-scale surveys measure it.

Objective

Most acute malnutrition might be captured by the measurement of wasting alone, but this is unknown. This article aims to fill this gap.

Design

This article presents a secondary data analysis of 852 nutrition cross-sectional survey data sets of children aged 6–59 mo. The data sets assembled included surveys from East, West, South, and Central Africa; the Caribbean; and Asia. The overlap between edematous malnutrition and wasting was assessed, and the impact of including/excluding edema on acute malnutrition prevalence estimates was evaluated.

Results

The prevalence of edematous malnutrition varied from 0% to 32.9%, and children were more likely to have bilateral edema in Central and South Africa (OR: 4; 95% CI: 2.8, 5.6). A large proportion of children with edematous malnutrition were not wasted [62% and 66% based on midupper arm circumference (MUAC) and weight-for-height (WFH), respectively], and most were not severely wasted (83% and 86% based on MUAC and WFH, respectively). When wasting and global acute malnutrition prevalence estimates as well as severe wasting and severe acute malnutrition prevalence estimates overall were compared, the differences between estimates were small (median of 0.0% and mean of 0.3% based on WFH and MUAC for global estimates and slightly higher median of 0.1% and mean of 0.4% based on MUAC and WFH, respectively, for the severe forms), but the picture was different at the regional level.

Conclusions

The terms acute malnutrition and wasting should not be used interchangeably. The omission of the measurement of edema can have important repercussions, especially at the nutrition program level.

Caveats

Notwithstanding the fact that lower (or higher) anthropometric values will identify an undersized (or oversized) individual regardless of the cause, the most prevalent nomenclature for undersized children, especially among policy stakeholders, is "undernourished". Using the WHO-MGRS standard, childhood "undernutrition" in populations is conventionally measured by 3 anthropometric indices: underweight (weight-for-age < −2 SD), stunted (length/height-for-age < −2 SD), and wasted (weight-for-length/height < −2 SD). Whereas a wasted child is considered to have acute undernutrition, stunting represents a longer-lasting nutritional deprivation, and underweight is a composite measure of these two indices. Paradoxically, the WHO-MGRS standards neither quantified biomarkers nor nutrient intakes to accurately determine the nutritional status. Contingent upon the enrolment conditions, these children were simply presumed to be similar, optimally (neither under- nor over-) nourished, and with "strikingly similar" growth curves that were subsequently pooled.

However, this claim of "striking similarity" in growth is questionable. Only stature was evaluated for assessing population differences. Pooling was considered appropriate if differences between the mean and individual sites ranged within ± 0.5 SD, which is an arbitrary statistical judgment. With stringent selection criteria and negligible measurement error, linear growth among sites should be nearly identical or, from an interventional perspective, with a maximal window of 0.2 SD, which assumes significance at the population level. In low resource settings, the typical improvement in linear growth with nutritional interventions, if any, is 0.1 SD to 0.2 SD. Among the urban poor in India, even a composite intervention package of health, nutrition, WaSH, and psychosocial care extending from preconception to early childhood recorded a maximal length gain of 0.46 SD. Thus, a margin of 0.5 SD is too high to judge the similarity of linear growth among selected populations that have no growth constraint. In WHO-MGRS, in 54 comparisons with pooled mean (9 ages at 6 sites), linear growth differences were > 0.2 SD in 37% and > 0.3 SD in 19%. Further, differences between individual sites, instead of from the pooled mean, are a more accurate indicator of variability between countries. At 2 to 4 years, in comparison to Brazil, the differences ranged from 0.31 to 0.62 SD for India and 0.63 to 0.73 SD for Oman.

### Edematous severe acute malnutrition is characterized by hypomethylation of DNA [^c98a4935]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Annually, severe acute malnutrition (SAM) directly contributes to nearly one million deaths of children under age 5 globally, and indirectly to millions more. Despite concordant micro- and macro-nutrient deficiencies, SAM classically presents as one of two phenotypically distinct forms — edematous SAM (ESAM), which includes the syndromes of kwashiorkor and marasmic-kwashiorkor, and nonedematous SAM (NESAM) or marasmus. NESAM is typically characterized by weight loss and wasting, while ESAM is defined by the presence of bilateral, pitting edema and usually has more overt, and often more severe, multiorgan dysfunction, including hepatic, hematopoietic, and gastrointestinal impairment, alongside skin and hair abnormalities –.

Given that ESAM accounts for 50–70% of SAM cases in some developing countries, and has different clinical outcomes relative to NESAM, considerable interest remains in gaining a better understanding of the underlying molecular pathophysiology. The divergent SAM phenotypes are not fully explained by environmental, dietary, or infectious factors. despite a substantial catalog of disparate studies describing biochemical and physiological differences between the two forms –, including recent reports of quantitative shifts in microbiota. These observations, however, are subject to reverse causation and provide an incomplete picture of the broad pathophysiological dysfunction that is the hallmark of ESAM. Moreover, despite differences in pathophysiology and clinical outcome, the treatment of SAM has remained largely unchanged and is the same regardless of form –. Although public health strategies that address food security remain important to SAM, such strategies are notoriously difficult to implement and are susceptible to volatility in climate and society. A better understanding of the underlying molecular pathophysiology of ESAM could provide additional therapeutic insights that could be used to further improve outcomes and prevent development of the condition.

### Consensus statement of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics / American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition: indicators recommended for the identification and documentation of pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) [^8a33306e]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Handgrip strength in pediatric nutrition assessment — handgrip strength is a simple noninvasive measurement used to measure baseline functional status and track progress, obtained with a handheld dynamometer that measures maximum isometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles. In hospitalized settings it has been shown to predict postoperative complications, length of hospital admission, readmission, likelihood of returning to previous home setting, and mortality. Because muscle function reacts earlier to nutritional changes than muscle mass, handgrip strength may be a more atraumatic measurement of response than traditional biochemical or anthropometric measures in children ages 6 years and older; in hospitalized pediatric inpatients it has been used as a simple noninvasive test of functional capacity at admission for surgery, and BMI z scores correlated with admission handgrip strength measurement.

### Consensus statement: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition: characteristics recommended for the identification and documentation of adult malnutrition (undernutrition) [^0f5ab5db]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult malnutrition (undernutrition) consensus recommendations — The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Academy) and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) recommend that a standardized set of diagnostic characteristics be used to identify and document adult malnutrition in routine clinical practice, and an etiologically based diagnostic nomenclature that incorporates a current understanding of the role of the inflammatory response is proposed; universal use of a single set of diagnostic characteristics is stated to facilitate recognition, produce more valid prevalence and incidence estimates, guide interventions, and influence expected outcomes. Malnutrition is described as a nutrition imbalance, with adult malnutrition treated as synonymous with adult undernutrition, which occurs along a continuum of inadequate intake and/or increased requirements, impaired absorption, altered transport, and altered nutrient utilization; even overweight or obese adults with severe acute illness or major trauma are noted to be at risk and may benefit from intensive nutrition intervention. The organizations do not propose any specific inflammatory markers for diagnostic purposes at this time, and malnutrition is noted as a contributor to increased morbidity and mortality, decreased function and quality of life, and increased frequency and length of hospital stay.
