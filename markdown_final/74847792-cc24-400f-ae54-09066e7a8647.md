## Question

verical nail ridges

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about vertical (longitudinal) nail ridges, including their definition, pathophysiology, etiologies, diagnostic approach, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and confirming what "vertical ridges" mean in nail pathology. Then, I should verify the underlying pathophysiology and matrix anatomy that explain longitudinal ridging. Next, I will categorize etiologies into physiologic, inflammatory, traumatic/mechanical, infectious, neoplastic, systemic/genetic, and medication-related causes. After that, I need to outline a practical diagnostic approach, including history, exam, dermoscopy, and when to biopsy or clip. Finally, I will consider management strategies tailored to etiology and prognosis, and I should double-check areas where the original trace was uncertain or incomplete to ensure accuracy and completeness.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so we don't talk past each other: "vertical ridges" in clinical nail terminology are longitudinal ridges that run from proximal to distal along the nail plate, often termed onychorrhexis when they reflect brittleness and longitudinal splitting, and trachyonychia when there is diffuse roughness with ridging across multiple nails. I should confirm that these terms are used consistently in the literature and that longitudinal ridging is indeed a surface texture irregularity rather than a color change or attachment disorder.

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology. Longitudinal ridging arises from disturbances in nail matrix keratinization and plate formation. Proximal matrix involvement tends to produce superficial irregularities like pitting, whereas distal matrix involvement produces deeper ridging or splitting, so the location and chronicity of matrix insult correlate with the clinical pattern. Hold on, I should verify that this anatomic mapping is supported by matrix-focused reviews and teaching sources before proceeding [^116QpXfB].

> Next, I will categorize etiologies, but let me think about prevalence and clinical weighting so I don't overcall rare entities. Physiologic or age-related ridging is common in older adults and often benign. Inflammatory dermatoses such as lichen planus, psoriasis, and alopecia areata frequently produce longitudinal ridging. Mechanical or traumatic causes include habit-tic deformity, median canaliform dystrophy, and post-traumatic ridging. Infections like onychomycosis can alter plate texture. Neoplasms such as onychomatricoma or onychocytic matricoma can cause localized ridging. Systemic and genetic conditions including nail-patella syndrome, pachyonychia congenita, and chronic GVHD can manifest with ridging. And medications such as retinoids or dupilumab have been associated with ridging and other dystrophic changes. I should double-check representative examples in each category to ensure balance and accuracy [^113R4JXf] [^113HzSh5] [^1122bwp6] [^1117p6sq] [^111DU1Aa] [^112dVcoD] [^117Bij32] [^1157TjEs] [^116ohNX7] [^111BiV8v] [^115zPb2n].

> Wait, let me verify inflammatory causes more closely because they are frequent and sometimes overlooked. Nail lichen planus commonly presents with longitudinal ridging and can progress to dorsal pterygium or anonychia if untreated; psoriasis frequently shows longitudinal ridges even when not captured by NAPSI, and pediatric psoriasis cohorts demonstrate ridging in a majority; alopecia areata and atopic dermatitis can also produce trachyonychia with ridging; I should confirm that these associations are supported by both clinical series and reviews before concluding [^113HzSh5] [^1122bwp6] [^113zL8NX] [^112J9Aa6].

> I will now examine traumatic and mechanical etiologies, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without distinguishing overlapping entities. Habit-tic deformity typically shows parallel transverse ridges emanating from the proximal nail fold and responds to barrier strategies; median canaliform dystrophy of Heller presents with a paramedian longitudinal split and fir-tree transverse ridges, often on thumbnails; digital myxoid cysts from DIP osteoarthritis can compress the matrix and cause longitudinal grooves; I should confirm that these mechanical patterns are well-described and that management implications differ accordingly [^1117p6sq] [^111DU1Aa] [^112X7oNo].

> Let me consider infectious causes next, and I need to ensure I don't conflate color change with texture. Onychomycosis can distort the nail plate and produce ridging alongside thickening, subungual hyperkeratosis, and onycholysis; sampling technique matters for diagnosis, with proximal drilling improving culture yield; I should confirm that fungal disease is a recognized cause of ridging and that sampling guidance aligns with best practices [^112GXTZM] [^111Vooyd].

> But wait, what if the ridging is focal and progressive, suggesting a tumor. Onychomatricoma and onychocytic matricoma can produce localized longitudinal ridging, pachyonychia, and white dots or clods; dermoscopic and histopathologic features help distinguish them, and nail clippings can show diagnostic tunnels or cavities; I should double-check that these onychogenic tumors are established causes of localized ridging and that biopsy indications are clear when suspicion persists [^117Bij32] [^113Zykic].

> Next, I should review systemic and genetic conditions so I don't miss syndromic clues. Nail-patella syndrome features dystrophic nails with ridging and triangular lunulae and is highly penetrant for nail changes; pachyonychia congenita causes nail thickening and ridging from childhood; chronic GVHD can produce ridging, brittleness, and pterygium; I need to ensure I note the extracutaneous features that prompt genetic or systemic evaluation [^1157TjEs] [^116ohNX7] [^111BiV8v].

> I should confirm medication associations as well, because iatrogenic causes are often underrecognized. Systemic retinoids have long been linked to nail fragility and ridging; dupilumab has case-level evidence of inducing longitudinal ridging and other dystrophic changes that improve with continued therapy in some patients; I need to check that these reports are representative and counsel on temporal relationships and reversibility [^111DU1Aa] [^115zPb2n] [^113vyMj3].

> Now, I will outline the diagnostic approach, and I need to ensure it is practical and evidence-aligned. Start with a careful history of onset, trauma, habits, systemic symptoms, medications, and family history. On exam, document distribution, symmetry, associated features such as pterygium, onycholysis, or color change. Dermoscopy can help distinguish inflammatory from neoplastic patterns and guide biopsy decisions. When inflammatory disease is suspected, nail clippings can support psoriasis and exclude onychomycosis. Biopsy is indicated for persistent localized ridging with atypical features, suspected tumors, or progressive dystrophy. I should double-check that these steps align with primary care and dermatology guidance [^113R4JXf] [^113pNyob] [^1122b638] [^113zL8NX].

> Hold on, I should verify when to biopsy versus when to observe. Localized longitudinal ridging with erythronychia or atypical features warrants consideration of onychopapilloma or other nail bed tumors and may require biopsy. Dermoscopic irregular longitudinal lines or pigment patterns that are asymmetric, variegated, or extend to periungual skin raise concern for melanoma and should prompt biopsy. Conversely, diffuse age-related ridging without other abnormalities can be observed with reassurance [^116Ax2DK] [^1122b638] [^113R4JXf].

> Management should be tailored to etiology, and I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. For physiologic ridging, reassurance and gentle nail care suffice. For inflammatory disease, intralesional or systemic corticosteroids, retinoids, or disease-specific therapies may be indicated. For habit-tic deformity, barrier methods such as cyanoacrylate at the proximal nail fold can normalize growth. For suspected onychomycosis, confirm with KOH/culture and treat with antifungals. For tumors, excision or appropriate surgical management is key. For systemic or genetic conditions, coordinate care and counsel on prognosis. I should confirm that these strategies are supported by case series, reviews, and guidelines where available [^1117p6sq] [^113HzSh5] [^114ER7WZ] [^117Bij32] [^1157TjEs].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "vertical ridges" might imply transverse Beau's lines, but that would be incorrect. Beau's lines are transverse depressions from transient matrix arrest, whereas vertical/longitudinal ridges reflect chronic matrix or plate abnormalities, so I should correct that misinterpretation explicitly to avoid confusion in counseling and workup [^113R4JXf] [^1146uEUm].

> In summary, longitudinal nail ridges reflect matrix dysfunction and have a broad differential spanning physiologic aging, inflammatory dermatoses, mechanical trauma, infection, neoplasia, systemic and genetic disease, and medications. A structured history and exam, judicious use of dermoscopy, selective nail clippings, and targeted biopsy when indicated allow accurate diagnosis and etiology-specific management. I should double-check that this synthesis integrates the cited evidence and remains clinically actionable across settings [^113R4JXf] [^113HzSh5] [^1122bwp6] [^1117p6sq] [^112dVcoD] [^117Bij32] [^1157TjEs] [^115zPb2n].

Vertical nail ridges, also known as longitudinal ridging or onychorrhexis, are common and usually benign — especially with aging [^114nj2ce] — but can also signal systemic or local disease. They reflect **matrix dysfunction** [^111hCfYV] from aging, trauma, or inflammation, and are often seen in psoriasis, lichen planus, alopecia areata, and nutritional deficiencies (iron, zinc, B12) [^1122bwp6] [^113HzSh5]. Persistent, severe, or new-onset ridges warrant evaluation for underlying causes; management focuses on trauma avoidance, moisturizers, and treating the cause, with biopsy reserved for atypical or progressive cases [^113R4JXf].

---

## Clinical features

Vertical nail ridges appear as **parallel longitudinal striations** along the nail plate, ranging from fine to coarse and sometimes with splitting or brittleness (onychorrhexis) [^114nj2ce]. They are most often bilateral and symmetric, and may involve multiple nails [^112bRDE3].

---

## Pathophysiology

Vertical ridges reflect **matrix dysfunction** [^111hCfYV] that disrupts normal keratinization and plate formation. The matrix produces the nail plate; proximal matrix disease causes superficial irregularities (pitting, brittleness), whereas distal matrix disease causes longitudinal ridging or splitting [^116QpXfB].

## Common causes

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Physiological | Aging (most common), genetic predisposition [^114nj2ce] [^114nzERt] |
| Inflammatory | - Psoriasis <br/> - Lichen planus <br/> - Alopecia areata <br/> - Atopic dermatitis [^1122bwp6] [^113HzSh5] [^112J9Aa6] |
| Traumatic | - Repetitive microtrauma <br/> - Habit-tic deformity <br/> - Median canaliform dystrophy [^1117p6sq] [^111DU1Aa] |
| Nutritional | - Iron deficiency <br/> - Zinc deficiency <br/> - Vitamin B12 deficiency [^notfound] |
| Systemic | - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Osteoarthritis <br/> - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Thyroid disorders [^112X7oNo] [^113y7Ery] |
| Medications | - Retinoids <br/> - Chemotherapy <br/> - Dupilumab [^111DU1Aa] [^115zPb2n] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Most cases are diagnosed clinically; **evaluation should include**:

- **History**: onset, duration, trauma, systemic symptoms, medications, nutrition [^111DU1Aa].
- **Exam**: nail surface, ridges, splitting, color, periungual changes [^114nj2ce].
- **Tests**: consider CBC, iron studies, thyroid function, renal/hepatic panels if systemic disease suspected [^1146WK54].
- **Biopsy**: for atypical, progressive, or suspected inflammatory/neoplastic disease [^113jQBZG].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Transverse ridges (Beau's lines)**: systemic illness or acute stressor [^114nj2ce].
- **Nail pitting**: psoriasis, alopecia areata [^114AhmnK].
- **Onycholysis**: psoriasis, onychomycosis, trauma [^112JUNdZ].
- **Melanonychia**: melanocyte activation vs. melanoma [^113R4JXf].

---

## Management

Management targets the **cause** and symptom relief:

- **General care**: avoid trauma, gentle nail care, moisturizers, biotin supplements [^notfound].
- **Treat underlying disease**: psoriasis, lichen planus, nutritional deficiencies, systemic conditions [^113HzSh5] [^111jcHBD].
- **Specific therapies**: corticosteroids, retinoids, antifungals, immunosuppressives as indicated [^113HzSh5] [^114ER7WZ].
- **Cosmetic**: ridge fillers, nail hardeners, professional manicure [^114eVcQS].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **cause** and adherence; physiologic ridges persist but are benign, whereas inflammatory or systemic ridges improve with disease control. Persistent or severe ridges may cause cosmetic concern or functional impairment [^116VxtsB].

---

Vertical nail ridges are common and usually benign, but can indicate systemic or local disease. Accurate diagnosis and targeted management — including trauma avoidance, moisturizers, and treatment of underlying causes — are key; **biopsy is reserved for atypical or progressive cases** [^113pNyob].

### Double little toenails: report of 4 familial cases [^116obaFk]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

Double little toenails, or inherited accessory nail of the fifth toe, are a rare onychodysplasia with variable genetic expression. Nevertheless, few cases of this condition in family members are reported in the literature. Here, we describe this nail defect observed in 4 female members of a family.

A 26-year-old woman was evaluated for 2 hyperkeratotic prominences located on the lateral fifth toe surfaces of the main nail (Fig 1 A and B). These accessory nails had arisen and grown at the same rate as the normal nail. This condition was causing slight pain during walking, and the patient also expressed concern about a cosmetic disfigurement. Her 34-year-old sister (Fig 1 C and D) and her 54-year-old mother have had the same abnormality since childhood. The 6-year-old girl, who was the proband's niece, has had this deformity since aged 3 years. The family was composed of 20 members in 3 generations (Fig 2, A).

### Nail diseases related to nail cosmetics [^114rNSbK]. Dermatologic Clinics (2006). Low credibility.

The use of nail care products and procedures to beautify and groom the nails is extremely common. Unfortunately, when improperly used, nail cosmetics can lead to nail diseases, such as paronychia, onycholysis, and brittle nails. Understanding the pathophysiology behind these conditions is an essential step toward better treatment and future prevention allowing patients to enjoy nail adornments while maintaining healthy nails.

### Nail disorders as clues to systemic disease [^117X4ifp]. Clinics in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Disorders of the nail unit can provide important clues to underlying systemic diseases. Onychodystrophy or nail abnormalities include altered nail color, shape, or texture with morphology and growth patterns often related to local anatomic factors such as edema, vascular supply, and neurologic innervation. Associated pain or loss-of-function can also affect daily activities. Because nail changes may be due to a range of systemic diseases, the authors provide a systems-based broad overview of the common nail findings in patients with internal disease.

### Clear cell syringofibroadenoma (of mascaro) of the nail [^1172B5J6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Eccrine syringofibroadenoma (ESFA) is a rare disorder. We report the first case of ESFA of the nail apparatus, which presented as a yellow longitudinal onycholytic band of the left fourth finger over an intermittently painful subungual filamentous tumour. Histological examination showed features of ESFA with a digitate pattern of papillomatosis due to the specialized physiological longitudinal arrangement of the ridges in the nail bed. In addition, we describe a new feature of colloidal iron-positive clear cells. In our case, the presence of two types of cells with a central ductal differentiation and a significant amount of mucopolysaccharides in clear cells could suggest differentiation towards both the ductal and the secretory portion of the eccrine gland.

### Visualization of asymmetric wetting ridges on soft solids with X-ray microscopy [^116Xz8bw]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

One of the most questionable issues in wetting is the force balance that includes the vertical component of liquid surface tension. On soft solids, the vertical component leads to a microscopic protrusion of the contact line, that is, a 'wetting ridge'. The wetting principle determining the tip geometry of the ridge is at the heart of the issues over the past half century. Here we reveal a universal wetting principle from the ridge tips directly visualized with high spatio-temporal resolution of X-ray microscopy. We find that the cusp of the ridge is bent with an asymmetric tip, whose geometry is invariant during ridge growth or by surface softness. This singular asymmetry is deduced by linking the macroscopic and microscopic contact angles to Young and Neuman laws, respectively. Our finding shows that this dual-scale approach would be contributable to a general framework in elastowetting, and give hints to issues in cell-substrate interaction and elasto-capillary problems.

### Intra-operative onychoscopy of subungual epidermoid inclusions [^114JRKAY]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Discussion

SEI were first described in 1959 in toe nails by Samman. Later, Lewin reported several examples of SEI in surgical and postmortem specimens of normally appearing or clubbed nails. Apart from their possible relation to trauma and a reported association with finger clubbing, little is known about their etiology. In Lewin's review of 90 consecutive autopsies, epidermoid inclusions were found in all eight cases of nail clubbing and also in many normal nails (the exact number was not reported).

Another case series of eight cases reported the subungual hyperkeratosis with shortened and dystrophic nail plate as the most striking clinical feature. A history of trauma was reported by 4 patients. The thumb and the great toe were most commonly involved (7 out of 8 patients). Onycholysis was observed in one case. After a 2‐year follow‐up most of the lesions remained unchanged.

No pathognomonic clinical alternations exist; the nail may look normal or be thickened, dystrophic, ridged or yellow and the nail bed may appear hyperkeratotic. The differential diagnosis includes onychomycosis, squamous cell carcinoma, glomus tumor, subungual melanoma, and other tumors of the nail matrix.

A full‐thickness nail‐bed biopsy is required to make the diagnosis because SEI are microscopic rather than macroscopic. Histopathology shows hyperplasia of the nail bed and small epithelial inclusions, sometimes solid but mostly with central keratinization of the onycholemmal type without a granular layer. Secondary calcification is common. The relationship of calcified onycholemmal cysts to the subungual calcification in elderly persons is not yet clear. Sometimes, the onycholemmal cysts are seen to derive from the elongated rete ridges of the nail bed epithelium. Once the diagnosis has been made, no further treatment is needed. No treatment is curative and simply making the diagnosis prevents inappropriate treatments and relieves anxiety over possible malignancies.

### Congenital malalignment of the great toenail and onychomadesis in monozygotic twins [^1146uEUm]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Most nail pathologies are slow healing and can be complicated to treat. Beau lines occur when the matrix ceases to produce nail keratin and the nail moves distally, resulting in depressions or breaks in the integrity of the nail plate. Complete shedding of the nail occurs when the nail plate distal to the Beau line separates from the nail bed (Fig 2).

Fig 2
Deep sulci and complete matrix arrest were associated with onychomadesis.

Onychomadesis of various causes is related to the arrest of nail matrix growth (Table I). In CMGT, lateral displacement of the nail apparatus causes recurrent, shearing microtrauma to the nail matrix that would not occur in properly aligned toenails. As such, CMGT increases the risk of various forms of nail dystrophy, including paronychia, retronychia, onycholysis, onychogryphosis, and onychocryptosis. We report that the identical genetically determined malalignment of the 4 toenails in the twins that was associated with weight gain and activities of daily living during pubescence, increases the strain on the nail matrix causing recurrent arrest of the matrical growth. This results in horizontal nail depressions (Beau lines) and, ultimately, onychomadesis.

Table I
The causes of onychomadesis and their relationship with temporary stunting of nail matrix growth

Efforts to prevent onychomadesis include minimization of trauma, treatment of any underlying systemic disease, and discontinuation of inciting medications such as chemotherapy. In CMGT, the shearing forces produced with normal ambulation probably cannot be prevented by measures such as avoiding ill-fitted shoes and choosing shoes with a wide toe box. Despite this, careful attention to properly sized and fitted footwear is mandatory to reduce the risk of secondary complications. Surgical options include removal and reimplantation of the nail matrix. In adults with recurrent onychomadesis and onychogryphosis, complete phenol nail matrixectomy may be required. Generally, surgical options become a priority only when patients become symptomatic with recurrent infection and painful onychocryptosis.

This rare case shows a clear association between CMGT and onychomadesis. The extended period of the necessary treatment window and the imperfect nature of the available preventive treatment make it difficult to establish whether the patients will benefit from our suggestions.

### Nail abnormalities [^113pNyob]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for psoriasis, more specifically with respect to assessment of nails, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain nail clippings for evaluation when inflammatory disorders of the nail plate, such as nail psoriasis or infection, are suspected.

### Violaceous lunula with pigmented longitudinal ridge [^114zRAnn]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

A 73-year-old man presented with a 20-year history of a cracked, painful nail. The nail had been exquisitely sensitive to touch and cold temperatures. He denied systemic symptoms and personal history was only remarkable for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) on the left temple. Examination demonstrated a 5 mm, reddish-to-purple, triangular macule at the lunula, and a pigmented longitudinal ridge extending proximally from the distal nail plate edge (Fig 1).

Punch biopsy of the nail matrix showed dermal proliferation of monomorphous, round, pink-blue cells surrounding delicate vascular spaces (Fig 2, A-C; varying magnifications). Immunohistochemistry (not shown) demonstrated diffuse, strong reactivity for smooth muscle actin (SMA) with focal/patchy positivity for desmin; AE1/AE3 (cytokeratin) was negative.

### Double little toenails: report of 4 familial cases [^114cPNTe]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The double little toenail was first described more than 50 years ago. This defect occurs at birth or in childhood, and rarely in adulthood. It is congenital or acquired, with sporadic appearance. Histologically, it is similar to nail tissue with a matrix and nail bed, adjacent to the primary toenail. This disorder appears hereditary and it can be observed in both sexes but prevails in the female sex. In the family we discuss, the nail disorder has an autosomal dominant trait. Clinically, the double little toenail develops adjacent to and partly overlapping the plate of the leading nail. The nail, apparently divided into 2 parts by an intermediate furrow, is visible. Congenital double little toenail shows a symmetry in both locations on the fifth toes, although one-fourth of these abnormal nails show a more marked picture on 1 side, as in 2 of our patients. A Y-shaped radiologic alteration of the distal phalanx was occasionally detected; this feature is similar to a hexadactyly. Indeed, a macronychia of the fifth toe with accessory double nail was observed as polydactyly. A case of double nail developing on the middle finger was recently described.

Double little toenail must be distinguished from the ectopic nail, acquired split nail, cutaneous horn, and nail fibrokeratoma. Ectopic nails of the feet are unusual. The morphology of the newly formed nails shows close similarities with the ectopic nail but differs from this for the site and heredity. The classification of ectopic nailincludes nail with accessory finger or polydactyly, dorsal and double nail, and a small nail located near the healthy toenail. The latter type includes the double little toenail. Onychoheterotopia is adjacent to but detached from the primary nail, unlike inherited double little toenail, in which the nail is attached to the primary nail. Similarities between the double little toenail and the ectopic nail are as follows: they arise spontaneously or after a trauma, they grow more slowly than usual, and they can recur after incomplete avulsion. The double little toenail shows a matrix and a horizontal-parallel growth pattern. The ectopic nail is equipped with a matrix in the center or the back, with a horizontal-vertical growth pattern and a distal or inverted orientation. Scanning electron microscopy is used for analyzing the ectopic nail, identifying the morphologic aspects, and distinguishing from other periungual epithelial neoformations of the foot.

Regarding surgical interventions for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to nail debridement, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to do not perform nail debridement alone as a treatment in patients with onychomycosis. Consider performing mechanical intervention to remove the dermatophytomas within the nail plate or bed.

### Nail changes in acro-osteolysis: a case report and review of the literature [^114y7XUo]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pubmed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for case reports using combinations of the title/abstract key words acro-osteolysis, acroosteolysis, and phalangeal osteolysis.

Main causes of acro-osteolysis derived from various proposed classifications are presented in Tables I and II. We found no cases of acro-osteolysis associated with lichen planus. However, 2 cases remarkably similar to ours have been reported in Cape Town. This finding suggests the possibility of a locally prevalent variant of acro-osteolysis. Our case also shares similarities with a more severely affected 9-year-old Saudi boy found to have a homozygous LMNA missense mutation.

Table I
Primary acro-osteolysis

Table II
Secondary acro-osteolysis

Nail pathology is widely reported in acro-osteolysis. Brachyonychia refers to short, broad, flat nails, and is the most commonly reported nail change. The term racquet nail is synonymous but implies associated deformity of the bone and soft tissue. Other reports include anonychia, atrophy, transverse ridging, discoloration, thickening of the nail plate, hyperkeratosis of the cuticles, pincer nails pitting, and onycholysis. Longitudinal ridging is evident in some published photographs. Although pterygium formation is commonly associated with nail lichen planus and scleroderma, we did not find other published reports of pterygia in acro-osteolysis.

We suggest that nail changes may provide a useful diagnostic clue to underlying bone resorption. Although the pterygium formation in our case was unique, findings of brachyonychia with or without associated nail changes should alert the clinician to the possibility of acro-osteolysis. Correlation of nail changes to etiologic subtype could assist with future classifications of this rare and poorly understood condition.

### Diagnosis using nail matrix [^111hCfYV]. Dermatologic Clinics (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosing nail matrix diseases requires knowledge of the nail matrix function and anatomy. This allows recognition of the clinical manifestations and assessment of potential surgical risk. Nail signs depend on the location within the matrix (proximal or distal) and the intensity, duration, and extent of the insult. Proximal matrix involvement includes nail surface irregularities (longitudinal lines, transverse lines, roughness of the nail surface, pitting, and superficial brittleness), whereas distal matrix insult induces longitudinal or transverse chromonychia. Clinical signs are described and their main causes are listed to enable readers to diagnose matrix disease from the nail's clinical features.

### Nail involvement in epidermolysis bullosa [^116tDS87]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

Nail abnormalities are a common feature in most subtypes of epidermolysis bullosa (EB), and they recently have been included among the criteria for scoring EB severity. Trauma undoubtedly contributes to the development of nail dystrophy, and for this reason the great toenails often are affected more severely. The nail abnormalities may be the first or the only symptom of EB. Nail abnormalities observed in EB are not specific or pathognomonic, as they result from nail bed and matrix scarring. The spectrum of clinical severity is large, and nail abnormalities may cause severe disability or just be a mild cosmetic problem. This article reviews the nail abnormalities observed in EB.

### At-home technique for debridement of nail plate thickening [^111JR7vN]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Nail plate thickening presents a common clinical challenge across a broad range of onychodystrophies, impacting patient quality of life and causing discomfort. Current treatment options, including topical urea 40% cream and surgical interventions, often yield unsatisfactory outcomes, are invasive, or costly. An at-home nail drill offers a promising alternative as a noninvasive, cost-effective solution for nail thickening.

### Nail abnormalities: clues to systemic disease… [^114nj2ce]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

A disruption of the distal matrix may cause problems with the deeper layers, resulting in ridging or splitting. A transient problem causing growth disturbance may lead to the formation of transverse lines across the nail plate, as in Mees', Muehrcke's, and Beau's lines. Changes in the configuration of the capillaries in the proximal nail bed are responsible for some of the alterations that occur in patients with connective tissue disorders, while abnormalities in the periosteal vessels contribute to clubbing.
2. In patients with Mees' lines, the nail bed is normal, but the nail itself is microscopically fragmented, probably because of the disruption of normal growth at the nail matrix during the insult. The width of the lines varies and, because the defect is in the nail itself, the line moves distally with time. Thus, the timing of the insult can be determined by measuring the distance of the lines from the cuticle.

Pairs of transverse white lines that extend all the way across the nail are called Muehrcke's lines. The lines represent an abnormality of the vascular nail bed and disappear while the nail is depressed and blood is squeezed from the vessels beneath the nail. Because the lesion is in the nail bed, it does not move with nail growth. Longitudinal striations are accentuated ridges in the nail surface that can occur as a normal part of the aging process. If nails become thin and lusterless, the condition may be referred to as trachyonychia; when all of the nails are affected, the condition is called 20-nail dystrophy. In this situation, associated conditions, including alopecia areata, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and lichen planus, must be considered. 18 Trachyonychia also may be seen in patients with vitiligo.
19. Nail Bed and Vascular Changes Splinter hemorrhages are longitudinal thin lines, red or brown in color, that occur beneath the nail plate.

They are visible when capillaries within the epidermal ridges leak. While splinter hemorrhages may denote benign problems such as local trauma, psoriasis, or localized fungal infection, they are a classic finding in patients with endocarditis. In patients with Terry's nails, most of the nail plate turns white with the appearance of ground glass, and the lunula is obliterated.

### Diagnosis and management of nail pigmentations [^1133mhYy]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Longitudinal pigmentation of the nail is very common. The differential diagnosis varies from subungual hematoma, to a fungal infection, to a melanocytic lesion (lentigo, nevus melanoma, etc.) to others. Often, dermatologists do not feel at ease with these pathologies and management is often not clear. In many cases, a biopsy is not helpful because an inadequate technique was chosen. The use of noninvasive techniques such as dermoscopy has been described to be useful for the preoperative evaluation and the management decision. Using these technique, one will be able to reduce the number of unnecessary surgeries and to choose the most adequate biopsy technique. In this article, we will review the management, including diagnosis as well as differential diagnosis of nail pigmentations and propose a new algorithm for the non invasive diagnosis of nail pigmentation.

### Diagnosis and management of nail pigmentations [^115wMEJg]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, nail discoloration can be caused by yellow nail syndrome, atopic dermatitis, paronychia, psoriasis, onycholysis, primary lymphedema, diabetes, melanoma, pachydermoperiostosis, lentiginosis, lichen striatus, Mee lines, leuconychia, blue nails and graft-versus-host disease. In addition, nail discoloration can be caused by medications such as fluorouracil, hydroquinone, docetaxel, daunorubicin, zidovudine, doxycycline monohydrate, imatinib, hydroxyurea, epirubicin, nivolumab and capecitabine.

### Genetic hair and nail disorders [^112hk3CA]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Hair and nails are skin appendages that share with other ectodermal tissues a common developmental pathway. Inherited disorders affecting these two structures therefore very often involve other epithelial components and present with multiple anomalies, generating both physical and psychological distress among patients and their families. The present review briefly describes major recent advances in our understanding of hair and nail genodermatoses.

### Middle-aged female with blue nails and graying skin [^111poaFx]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is typically seen with histology?
A. Deposition of brown and black granules in the dermis
B. Hyperpigmentation of basal cell layer and pigment-laden macrophages in the dermis
C. Increased melanin deposit in the epidermis
D. More melanocytes than expected
E. Normal histology

Answers:
A. Deposition of brown and black granules in the dermis – Correct. Argyria shows a spared epidermis, helping distinguish it from other pigmentation disorders. The dermis will show many small brown or black granules along eccrine glands, elastic fibers, capillary walls, and nerves.
B. Hyperpigmentation of basal cell layer and pigment-laden macrophages in the dermis – Incorrect. Medications frequently cause hyperpigmentation and lead to these histological changes. Argyria does not cause epidermal changes and would show silver granules.
C. Increased melanin deposit in the epidermis – Incorrect. In addition to argyria's pigmentation being secondary to the photoactivation and metal reduction of silver, there is support of silver causing stimulation of melanin production. However, this is not the stereotypical histopathology of argyria.
D. More melanocytes than expected – Incorrect. Despite the evidence to support increased melanin production, there is no evidence of increased melanocytes in argyria.
E. Normal histology – Incorrect. A biopsy usually is sufficient to make the diagnosis of argyria due to characteristic changes. If clinical suspicion is high despite a negative biopsy, rebiopsy or using the noninvasive energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy, the gold standard, can be used.

### Retronychia: proximal ingrowing of the nail plate [^117WUXy3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Proximal nail fold inflammation can be caused by many diseases and has not previously been recognized as a result of posterior embedding of the nail. We describe a new pattern of ingrowth that we have termed retronychia ("retro" — Latin for backwards; "onychia" — Greek for nail). The term describes a combination of proximal nail plate ingrowth into the proximal nail fold which is associated with multiple generations of nail plate misaligned beneath the proximal nail.

Objective

To describe a new pattern of nail ingrowth which causes a specific form of proximal nail fold paronychia.

Methods

Collective cases were reported to a European Nail Society expert group.

Results

Persistent proximal nail fold inflammation can result from an episode of trauma that disturbs longitudinal nail growth and results in reverse embedding of the nail plate. This can cause pain, inflammation, and granulation tissue formation, and is typically relieved by avulsion and antiinflammatory treatment.

Limitations

We cannot demonstrate causality between the proposed precipitants and the clinical features.

Conclusion

Retroncyhia represents proximal ingrowth of the nail that occurs when the nail embeds backwards into the proximal nail fold. Nail plate avulsion with supplementary medical management is curative.

### Fingernail psoriasis reconsidered: a case-control study [^1122bwp6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Literature concerning clinical signs and frequency of nail psoriasis is incomplete. Recent studies focus only on signs included in the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI).

Objective

We sought to describe clinical characteristics of fingernail psoriasis in comparison with healthy controls.

Methods

We collected data on 49 patients with fingernail psoriasis who visited our outpatient department and 49 control subjects, through questionnaires and clinical examination. The disease severity was measured by the NAPSI.

Results

Mean NAPSI score in patients and control subjects was 26.6 and 3.6, respectively. Most items included in the NAPSI were specific for nail psoriasis. Onycholysis and splinter hemorrhages were most frequently observed. Leukonychia was more frequent in control subjects. Longitudinal ridges and Beau lines are not included in the NAPSI but are significantly more frequently seen in patients than in control subjects.

Limitations

Limited sample size was a limitation.

Conclusion

The NAPSI was able to discriminate patients with fingernail psoriasis from healthy control subjects. Onycholysis and splinter hemorrhages were the most prevalent fingernail changes in psoriatic patients. Leukonychia was more frequently observed in control subjects, which raises the question of whether leukonychia should remain in the NAPSI. On the other hand, longitudinal ridges and Beau lines occurred more frequently in psoriasis but are not included in the NAPSI.

### Mutation of WIF1: a potential novel cause of a nail-patella-like disorder [^116pNd2U]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Nail-Patella syndrome is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder primarily affecting skeletal and connective tissues. Primary features of the syndrome include dysplasia of the nails, knees, and elbows. Nails are typically hypoplastic, absent, or dystrophic. Patellae are often small or irregularly shaped. Elbow abnormalities include dysplasia of the radial head and hypoplasia of the lateral epicondyle and capitellum. Joints may swell, dislocate, display hypermobility, or display early degenerative arthritis. Iliac horns are observed radiologically in approximately 70% of cases. Other features include renal dysfunction and, less frequently, glaucoma. Renal dysfunction is observed in approximately 40% of cases, with end-stage renal diseases occurring in approximately 5% of cases. Glaucoma is observed more frequently and at a younger age in this population. The overall presentation can vary widely from one affected individual to another, with various manifestations ranging from severe to totally absent on a case-by-case basis. Nail changes are the most constant feature of Nail-Patella syndrome and are observed in approximately 98% of cases. The incidence of Nail-Patella syndrome is thought to be 1 in 50,000.

### Successful treatment of median canaliform nail dystrophy with topical tazarotene foam [^111DU1Aa]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Median canaliform nail dystrophy (MCND) is an uncommon nail disorder that typically affects the thumbnails and is characterized by transverse ridges radiating from a paramedian canal or split in the nail plate, bearing resemblance to a fir tree. Its etiology is unknown although it is thought to be caused by temporary defects in the nail matrix leading to dyskeratosis. It may also be caused by trauma to the nail plate or nail bed, subungual tumors, or medications such as oral retinoids. Treatment of MCND is challenging, as there are no therapies demonstrating consistent efficacy. Here, we present a case of MCND that dramatically improved with daily application of topical tazarotene 0.1% foam.

### Violaceous lunula with pigmented longitudinal ridge [^117Uw8Y2]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely underlying diagnosis?
A. Squamous cell carcinoma
B. Glomus tumor
C. Leiomyoma
D. Spiradenoma of the nail bed
E. Subungual exostosis

Answers:
A. Squamous cell carcinoma – Incorrect. SCC is the most common primary malignant neoplasm of the subungual region, mostly found in middle-aged Caucasian men. Its presence for 20 years without growth, extension, or malignant spread makes this less likely; however, one should always perform biopsy if suspicious. Histology reveals keratin pearls and nests of pleomorphic epithelial cells with abundant cytoplasm extending from the dermis to the epidermis.
B. Glomus tumor – Correct. Glomus tumors are benign vascular hamartomas common to the hand, but their small size may lead to a delay in diagnosis. Classic symptoms include a triad of cold hypersensitivity, undulating pain, and a well-defined pain site; longitudinal ridging, as seen here, may be infrequently associated with glomus tumors.
C. Leiomyoma – Incorrect. Subungual leiomyoma is exceedingly rare, presenting in the 20's and 30's. Histopathology includes avascular, well-demarcated, fascicular, dermal proliferations of spindle cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and cigar-shaped nuclei. IHC usuallydemonstrates strong positivity for both SMA and desmin.
D. Spiradenoma of the nail bed – Incorrect. Histopathology will present with well-demarcated, small, dark, peripheral cells and larger, pale, central cells arranged in trabeculae and tubules, with lymphocytes and stromal myxomatous changes. IHC may be positive for SMA, but not desmin in tumor-associated myoepithelial cells. CK7, CK8, and CK18 positivity are more consistent here.
E. Subungual exostosis – Incorrect. Over 50% of cases present before 18 years of age, with toe involvement 80% of the time. Clinical features include a firm nodule that slowly grows over weeks to months. This patient did not report a growing nodule. Histology includes fibrocartilaginous tissue with a trabecular stalk.

### Congenital malalignment of the great toenail: spontaneous regression rate and limiting factors for surgical outcome [^111Mbj3h]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital malalignment of the great toenails (CMGTN) is an underreported nail dystrophy often misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated. Surgery can be performed but data concerning age, technique, and results are limited.

Objective

To summarize the clinical presentation, patient characteristics, treatment options (surgery vs wait-and-see) and evolution of CMGTN as well as identifying the limiting factors for spontaneous evolution and surgery, based on a severity score that the authors developed.

Materials and Methods

Records of 60 patients were retrieved from their department's database over an 11-year period (2009–2020). Assessment was evaluated by 3 nail expert dermatologists and self-evaluation.

Results

A total of 60 patients and 94 nails were included. Nail plate deviation, nail bed epithelialization, transverse ridges, and pachyonychia were the most frequent clinical signs. Surgery was performed on 33 nails, and 61 were followed up. Self-evaluation revealed better or completely healed nails in both groups. Severity score was significantly lower (p < .0001) after surgery but was not improved in the wait-and-see group. No relation could be found between age of diagnosis, age at surgery, and score evolution.

Conclusion

Surgery is effective and provides excellent cosmetic results, no matter the age or severity of the condition. Surgical approach should not only be reserved for young patients and severe cases.

### Visualization of asymmetric wetting ridges on soft solids with X-ray microscopy [^117VcTQf]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

One of the most questionable issues in wetting is the force balance that includes the vertical component of liquid surface tension. On soft solids, the vertical component leads to a microscopic protrusion of the contact line, that is, a 'wetting ridge'. The wetting principle determining the tip geometry of the ridge is at the heart of the issues over the past half century. Here we reveal a universal wetting principle from the ridge tips directly visualized with high spatio-temporal resolution of X-ray microscopy. We find that the cusp of the ridge is bent with an asymmetric tip, whose geometry is invariant during ridge growth or by surface softness. This singular asymmetry is deduced by linking the macroscopic and microscopic contact angles to Young and Neuman laws, respectively. Our finding shows that this dual-scale approach would be contributable to a general framework in elastowetting, and give hints to issues in cell-substrate interaction and elasto-capillary problems.

### Common nail disorders [^112JUNdZ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Brittle nail, simple chronic paronychia, and onycholysis represent three of the most prevalent nail disorders. Brittle nails are characterized by increased fragility of the nail plate due to damage to the nail matrix or changes to nail plate cohesion, caused by internal and/or external factors. Simple chronic paronychia represents an inflammatory process of the lateral and/or proximal nail folds of the fingernails or toenails often preceded by damage to the cuticle. Onycholysis describes the detachment of the nail plate from its nail bed, often attributable to dermatologic conditions, infections, drug therapy, or trauma.

### Nail abnormalities [^113R4JXf]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Nail abnormalities occur in all age groups but are more prevalent in older adults. Nail disorders account for 10% of dermatologic disorders. Nail abnormalities can be categorized as surface texture irregularities, color changes, defects of nail plate attachment/nail shedding, tumors, or a combination of these. Brittle nails affect up to 20% of the population but are most prominent in older women and on fingernails. Different patterns of brittle nails can be seen in the same patient or can coexist in the same nail. Beau lines are transverse grooves caused by decreased keratinocyte activity in the proximal nail matrix. Nail pitting is due to abnormal keratinization in the proximal nail matrix. More than one-half of patients with psoriasis will have some nail involvement, and pitted nails are just one manifestation of nail psoriasis. Color changes may appear in the nail plate, nail bed, or nail matrix. In the nail unit, melanocytes are located only in the nail matrix. Brown-black nail changes are known as melanonychia and are caused by melanocyte activation or proliferation. Melanoma typically presents as longitudinal brown-black nail lines, but in approximately 30% of cases, it may present as a nail mass. Abnormal growth in the nail unit should raise concern for benign or malignant tumors, including the most common malignant tumor, squamous cell carcinoma. Nail clippings, ultrasonography, dermoscopy, and biopsy are useful for the diagnosis of nail abnormalities. Dermoscopy can assist in triaging lesions and differentiating those that can be safely observed from those that should be biopsied.

### Koilonychia secondary to Raynaud's phenomenon: a rare co-occurrence [^1146WK54]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of koilonychia is often clinical, requiring a complete history, review of systems, and physical examination. While some causes of koilonychia are idiopathic, the workup of the disease should include iron concentration studies, complete blood counts, and when an autoimmune disease is suspected, inflammatory markers and autoimmune disease antibodies in order to identify and manage underlying causes of koilonychia. Onychomycosis and inflammatory skin diseases (eg, psoriasis, alopecia areata, lichen planus) should also be considered. Because the concavity of nails may be difficult to detect by visual inspection, the water-drop test, whereby a few drops of water are placed on the patient's nail, may facilitate the diagnosis of koilonychia. If the water droplets pool on the nail plate without sliding off, the concave shape of the nails is verified.

As Raynaud's phenomenon affects an estimated 11% of middle-aged women and 8% of middle-aged men, clinicians should be aware that koilonychia may be a potentially reversible manifestation of Raynaud's phenomenon. This case serves as an important reminder that nail changes are often manifestations of systemic disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology of koilonychia, but this case suggests that diminished digital blood flow to the nail matrix may be contributory. With proper detection and treatment, koilonychia secondary to Raynaud's phenomenon can be managed successfully.

### Witkop Tooth and nail syndrome: a report of three cases in a family [^112N6VaF]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Witkop tooth and nail syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia manifested by hypodontia and nail dysplasia. Tooth shape may vary, and conical and narrow crowns are common. Mandibular incisors, second molars, and maxillary canines are the most frequently missing teeth. Nail dysplasia affects the fingernails and especially the toenails and is often more severe in childhood. Nails may be spoon-shaped, ridged, slow-growing, and easily broken. We examined an Eastern Mediterranean family in which three siblings (two girls, one boy) had this syndrome. The severity of finger and toenail anomalies varied. The children's mother had no Witkop-related abnormalities, but their father was reported to have dental and nail anomalies. Early intervention is recommended to manage orofacial disfigurement and avoid negative social consequences for these children.

### Local and systemic nail plate abnormalities: a clinical review [^112pKEYW]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Nail disorders are often difficult to recognize and diagnose because of the subtlety of their presentation and their shared overlapping features that are common to several conditions. Experientially, this is further complicated by the fact that specific training on diagnosis of nail pathologies varies substantially across most residency programs and for a majority of medical and surgical specialties. To distinguish these presentations from true, potentially deleterious nail disorders, clinicians should have familiarity with the most commonly occurring nail pathologies and their associations, and use a systematic approach when examining or evaluating alterations in the nails. In the present study, we review the most common clinical disorders affecting the nail apparatus.

### Onychodystrophy associated with dupilumab therapy for atopic dermatitis [^113vyMj3]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A woman in her 60s with a history of severe AD for more than 40 years was started on dupilumab therapy. Prior to starting dupilumab, she had extensive involvement of eczematous plaques on the head, neck, chest, back, legs, and arms, including the hands. There was mild nail involvement, with chronic paronychia of the bilateral thumbnails. Three months after starting dupilumab, she reported dramatic improvement of her eczematous plaques in addition to new severe nail changes.

On physical examination of the bilateral thumbnails, there was hyperkeratosis of the nail bed and hyponychium, scaling of the lateral nail folds and eponychium with loss of adhesion of the cuticle to the nail plate, and bilateral distal and lateral onycholysis. The remaining fingernails and toenails had no changes. On the right thumbnail, koilonychia, onychorrhexis, and irregular longitudinal nail plate fracturing were observed. The left nail plate exhibited multiple horizontal depressions consistent with Beau's lines, a proximal median longitudinal groove, and a mid-nail transverse split (Fig 1, A). Fungal culture from the nail plate and periungual skin was negative. Based on discussions in a private group chat on a social media platform composed of patients with AD who were taking dupilumab, she reported that other patients also had similar nail findings. Despite the nail changes, she continued therapy with 300 mg of dupilumab every 14 days, given the improvement of her AD. Three months later, her nails had dramatically improved, with residual longitudinal ridging, improving distal nail dystrophy, and less prominent horizontal ridging (Fig 1, B). At her follow-up visit 15 months since starting dupilumab for AD, her nails had significant improvement, with very mild changes, including chronic paronychia with transverse ridges, longitudinal ridging, and nail pits (Fig 1, C).

### Cronkhite-Canada syndrome: an atypical presentation with subungual hyperkeratosis [^112GXTZM]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Onychodystrophy is the characteristic nail change associated with CCS. Anecdotally, it was secondary to nutritional deficiencies. Contrary to previous beliefs, recent studies suggested that chronic inflammation of the nail matrix may be a major contributor. Chuamanochan et al demonstrated hypergranulosis of the stratum granulosum and lymphocyte infiltration from a nail matrix biopsy of a patient with CCS, suggesting that nail changes in CCS resulted from systemic inflammation rather than nutritional deficiencies. However, other systemic inflammatory diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus did not manifest nail changes indicative of nail structure inflammation. Consequently, the pathological mechanism behind these nail changes has yet to be fully elucidated.

In our case, onychodystrophy and subungual hyperkeratosis were noted, representing the pathology of the nail matrix and nail bed, respectively. Vitamin A deficiency may contribute to onychodystrophy; however, hypoalbuminemia, the most common nutritional deficiency found in CCS, has never been reported as causing these nail findings. It is unlikely that nutritional deficiencies could explain nail changes.

Subungual hyperkeratosis results from nail bed inflammation and is commonly observed in psoriasis and onychomycosis. In our patient, psoriasis was ruled out due to the absence of characteristic nails, cutaneous plaques, or joint symptoms. Onychomycosis which involves all nails often occurs in an immunocompromised host. C parapsilosis infection usually presents with chronic paronychia, transverse grooves and ridges, and hyperkeratosis of the nail plate. Furthermore, her nails improved with systemic corticosteroid treatment. This data discount a fungal infection as a cause of her subungual hyperkeratosis. No nutritional deficiencies have yet to be linked to subungual hyperkeratosis. Thus, we believe that the subungual hyperkeratosis was associated with inflammation in the nail bed.

### Onychocytic matricoma: a clinical, dermoscopic, and pathological analysis of 14 cases [^117Bij32]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, our series of OCM is the largest published series to date. In our series, there was no sex predilection. The patients were typically middle-aged to older adults with most lesions occurring on the fingers. Several clinical features simulated onychomatricoma, including localized (monodactylous) longitudinal pachyonychia obscuring the lunula, transverse overcurvature, longitudinal ridges, filiform hemorrhages, and white dots. However, some clinical features were indistinguishable from subungual squamous carcinoma, such as unparalleled lesion edges, red–purple blood clods, and a free-edge nail wall–like pattern without pitting simulating subungual keratosis. Indeed, such a diagnosis was proposed in the 7 cases of the dermatopathology consultation file of one of the authors (C.P.). When OCM presents as longitudinal melanonychia, the main differential diagnosis is subungual melanoma. In these clinically misleading scenarios, the diagnosis of an onychogenic tumor can be confirmed by nail clipping criteria as a thickening of the nail plate with multiple tunnels, ruling out a subungual malignant tumor, which is characterized by a thin nail plate with thick subungual keratosis.– However, resolution of the differential diagnosis between the 3 onychogenic tumors of the nail unit with thickening of the nail plate and small cavities in nail clippings, that is, pitting variant of onychomatricoma, OCM, and onychocytic carcinoma,– requires biopsy or excision of the tumor.

### Clinical features and nail clippings in 52 children with psoriasis [^113zL8NX]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Nail clipping, the act of cutting the distal portion of a nail for microscopic analysis, can complement the diagnosis of skin diseases with nail involvement, such as psoriasis. This study aimed to describe histopathologic findings on 81 nails from 52 children and adolescents with skin psoriasis and to determine whether these changes correlated with the severity of skin and nail involvement.

Methods

Children with psoriasis were enrolled in this cross-sectional study to obtain Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) scores. The most altered nails were processed using periodic acid-Schiff with diastase staining.

Results

Fifty-two patients with a median age of 10.5 years were included. The median Nail Psoriasis Severity Index score of the 20 nails from these patients was 17 (range 3–80). The most common findings were pitting (94.2%), leukonychia (73.0%), and longitudinal ridges (63.5%). Eighty-one nail fragments were collected by clipping. Neutrophils were found in 6 samples (7.6%) and serous lakes in 15 (19%). Median nail plate thickness was 0.3 mm (range 0.1–0.63 mm). Patients whose nails had neutrophils had a higher median PASI score (6.1 vs 2.0, P = 0.03). Patients whose nails had serous lakes had higher median PASI (5.3 vs 1.9, P = 0.008) and NAPSI (median 45.0 vs 18.0, P = 0.006) scores.

Conclusion

There seems to be a correlation between some microscopic nail features in children with psoriasis and their PASI and NAPSI scores, so nail clippings from children with suspected psoriasis may help with diagnosis, especially in the presence of neutrophils, and in excluding onychomycosis.

### Nail plate split of the fifth toenail [^1141iBCc]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 59-year-old man with a history of verruca vulgaris on his hands presented for evaluation of left fifth toe pain. On examination, there was a wide fifth toenail with longitudinal nail plate split. This was bilateral, but more prominent and symptomatic on the left, with the split occurring approximately one-third of the distance from the lateral edge of the nail plate (Fig 1). He noted that this had been unchanged for decades. He denied previous significant trauma or surgery to his left fifth toenail but had discomfort with shoes. To his knowledge, there was no family history of similar findings.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Double (accessory) fifth toenail
B. Subungual exostosis
C. Periungual fibroma
D. Subungual verruca
E. Onychophosis

### Evaluation of nail abnormalities… [^116QpXfB]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 1 illustrates normal nail anatomy. The nail matrix, located at the proximal nail bed, creates the hard keratinous nail plate. The distal nail matrix is responsible for laying down the deeper layers of the nail plate, whereas the proximal nail matrix creates the superficial layers. Therefore, the nail problem will reflect the location of nail matrix disruption. Disruption of the proximal nail matrix may lead to superficial nail pitting, whereas interruption of the distal nail matrix may cause deeper nail ridging. The nail is bound to the underlying skin proximally by the eponychium, distally by the anterior ligament and the distal nail fold, and on the sides by the lateral nail folds. LONGITUDINAL MELANONYCHIA Vertical nail bands must be differentiated from subungual melanomas, which account for 50 percent of melanomas in persons with dark skin.

ONYCHOMYCOSIS Onychomycosis encompasses fungal, yeast, and nondermatophytic mold infections of the nail, and predominantly occurs in the distal and lateral portion of the toenails. CLUBBING Clubbing involves thickening of the nail bed's soft tissue, particularly in the proximal end. KOILONYCHIA MEES LINES Mees lines are transverse white lines that may extend the complete width of the nail plate. The lines can occur on a single digit or multiple digits. Mees lines migrate toward the distal end of the nail plate over time because the abnormality is in the nail plate and not the nail bed. The differential diagnosis for Mees lines is narrow, and it is thought to be caused primarily by arsenic poisoning. 1 Other heavy metal poisonings and renal failure also may result in Mees lines. 11 The timing of the poisoning can be estimated based on the rate of nail plate growth.

1.

MUEHRCKE LINES Muehrcke lines are pairs of transverse white lines caused by localized pathology within the nail bed. Because they originate in the nail bed and not the nail plate, the lines do not migrate distally as the nail grows. The nail bed has abnormal vascular architecture that can be visualized microscopically. 1 The lines disappear when pressure is applied to the nail plate because the abnormal blood supply is compressed. If the lines are caused by hypoalbuminemia, the nail findings improve as the underlying condition improves. 12.

### Clinical pathologic correlations for diagnosis and treatment of nail disorders [^113jQBZG]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Clinicopathologic correlation is crucial to the correct diagnosis of disorders of the nail unit. This chapter will explore four common clinical scenarios and how pathology can help differentiate between their various etiologies. These include: dark spot on the nail plate (melanin versus heme), subungual hyperkeratosis (onychomycosis versus psoriasis), longitudinal melanonychia (benign versus malignant), and verrucous papule (verruca versus squamous cell carcinoma). Consideration must be given to both when to perform a biopsy and the location of the biopsy site, which must be based on an understanding of the origin of the changes. An overarching principle is that lesions within the same differential diagnosis may be present concomitantly, such as malignant melanoma of the nail unit associated with hemorrhage. Therefore, even with a biopsy-proven diagnosis, the clinician must always monitor lesions of the nail unit for appropriate response to treatment and consider an additional biopsy for recalcitrant lesions.

### Leukonychia: what can white nails tell Us? [^111jcHBD]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Sometimes, the circumstances in which total apparent leukonychia appears can easily be explained by changes of the nail bed. For example, by nail bed edema in lymphoedema, paleness of the nail bed in severe anemia, and cicatricial changes after total skin electron beam irradiation therapy. Among the other culprits, selenium deficiency has been reported several times. It has been assumed that selenium deficiency may be responsible for apparent leukonychia in vegetarians in selenium-deficient areas, patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis, long-term parenteral nutrition, weight loss, phenylketonuria, malabsorption disorders, and human immunodeficiency virus. Remarkably, selenium deficiency has also been attributed to true leukonychia in Crohn's disease where selenium supplementation was able to induce complete regression.

Partial/total pseudo-leukonychia can be instead caused by onychomycosis, especially proximal subungual, but also by onycholysis. In these instances, scraping is not possible, and differentiation from true leukonychia can be difficult.

### Leukonychia: what can white nails tell Us? [^113y7Ery]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

In 'half-and-half nails', there is a reddish-brown distal band, and this was believed to be due to melanin pigmentation within the distal plate. Leyden and Wood suggested that the renal decompensation may account for the stimulation of matrix melanocytes and subsequent pigment formation and deposition. This position within the nail plate is remarkable because the distal band does not grow out, but remains at the distal site of the nail. Bencini et al. instead regarded the nail color change as part of the diffuse skin hyperpigmentation observed in patients with chronic renal failure and attributed to the poorly dialyzable, high tissue level of β-melanin-stimulating hormone. This finding appears strange because Leyden and Wood did not find melanocytes in the nail bed near the reddish-brown band, and the number of melanocytes in the nail bed is now known to be much lower than in the nail matrix. The proximal part appears white because the nail plate may have a looser attachment to the nail bed in this area. In Terry's nails, there is also reddish-brown distal band that is narrower compared with half-and-half nails. It has been suggested to be an area of telangiectasia, but this has never been confirmed and telangiectasias are not visible at dermoscopy. Other hypotheses have been advanced, such as an abnormal ratio of estrogen to androgens or an abnormal steroid metabolism. However, there are embryological and anatomical reasons to suspect that the proximal and distal nail beds have two separate blood supplies: we speculate that the telangiectasias causing Terry's nails may be related to the underlying mechanism that produces the other vascular changes noted.

In pseudoleukonychia, the transparency of the normal nail plate is impaired by an external factor that destroys the normal tight attachment of the nail plate onychocytes. The upper layers of the nail plate start to scale, resulting in the reflection of light. This form is differentiated from other causes of leukonychia, as the white powdery material can be easily scraped from the affected plate.

### Nail size and appearance following nail fusion plasty of thumb duplication [^114bqsuC]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate nail appearance after nail fusion plasty to treat thumb duplication.

Methods

A modified form of nail fusion plasty was performed on 17 reconstructed thumbs of 16 children with thumb duplications, commencing in January 2010. We assessed nail width and nail, lunular, and nail fold deformities using the Wang-Gao scoring system. All 17 thumbs were evaluated over an average of 32 months (range, 12–48 months) of follow-up.

Results

One patient with bilateral thumb deformities was excluded. The width ratios of 15 reconstructed nails (compared with those of the contralateral thumbs) were 82–118% (average, 97%). Nine thumbs exhibited nail ridges or gaps; the average ridge/gap score was 1.23 (maximum, 2). Six thumbs exhibited lunular deformities; the average score was 1.58 (maximum, 2). Another six thumbs evidenced nail fold deformities; the average score was 1.64 (maximum, 2). Only one thumb exhibited nail dehiscence. Two thumbs had no nail deformity. The final assessments were excellent in 14 cases, good in 2 cases, and fair in 1 case.

Conclusions

We could not significantly reduce the deformity rate of the nail plate, nail fold, or lunula using our new technique, but the deformities were much less marked than previously. Nail fusion plasty usefully enlarges the nail and pulp in patients with hypoplastically duplicated thumbs.

Although dermoscopy reflects the anatomy, skin anatomy is different on facial and acral skin as well as in the nail unit. Malignant patterns on acral sites include the parallel ridge pattern and irregular diffuse pigmentation, whose presence should lead to a biopsy. Malignant patterns on the face include features of follicular invasion (signet-ring images, annular granular images, and rhomboidal structures) and atypical vessels. Malignant patterns on the nail unit include the micro-Hutchinson sign and irregular longitudinal lines.

### An irregular black patch on the nail plate [^111P5zp2]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Nevus of the nail matrix — Incorrect. Nevi of the nail matrix are a common cause of longitudinal melanonychia in children and are characterized by uniform nests of cytologically banal melanocytes. Nevi tend to present with homogenous brown to black longitudinal bands. On dermoscopy, small dark granules less than 0.1 mm in diameter may be visualized and represent intracellular melanin inclusions.
B. Fungal melanonychia — Correct. Fungal melanonychia is a rare nail infection caused by fungal organisms that produce melanin pigment, most commonly Trichophyton rubrum and Scytalidium dimidiatum. The dystrophic nail changes, onycholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis, and yellowish discoloration of the involved nail (and nearby nails) point to the clinical possibility of fungal infection. Additionally, the lack of trauma and the nonlongitudinal clinical appearance further support this diagnosis.
C. Subungual melanoma — Incorrect. Subungual melanoma is an important cause of melanonychia, with concerning features that include presentation in the fifth to seventh decade of life, sudden onset or widening of irregular brown-black longitudinal bands, and pigment extension to the lateral or proximal nail fold (Hutchinson sign).
D. Trauma-related nail plate hemorrhage — Incorrect. Nail plate hemorrhage is a common finding and often presents with red to maroon discoloration. Patients often report a history of trauma, anticoagulant use, or both. The diagnosis can be confirmed with nail plate clipping.
E. Exogenous pigment — Incorrect. Exogenous pigment includes that from tobacco, dirt, potassium permanganate, tar, iodine, and silver nitrate. These substances may cause a brown to black pigmentation of the nails and can often be easily scratched off. These features are lacking in the presented case.

### Review of nail lichen planus: epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment [^113HzSh5]. Dermatologic Clinics (2021). Medium credibility.

Nail lichen planus is an inflammatory disorder of the nails with potential for significant cosmetic disfigurement and functional impairment. Nail manifestations may be isolated or appear concurrently with other forms of lichen planus. Longitudinal ridging is the most common clinical finding, but progressive disease may result in irreversible scarring (dorsal pterygium) or permanent nail loss (anonychia). Data on treatment are limited to retrospective studies and case reports. The mainstays of treatment are intralesional and intramuscular corticosteroid injections and oral retinoids. There is a need for randomized controlled trials on nail lichen planus to more rigorously assess efficacy and outcomes.

### Nail cosmetics: a dermatological perspective [^114eVcQS]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Nail cosmetics are used by millions worldwide and the variety of products available is expanding. They are relatively safe, but complications can occur, and patients experiencing complications may present to dermatologists. The physical processes can cause nail thinning and onycholysis, poor technique can promote infection, and consumers may develop allergic contact dermatitis. Ultraviolet nail lamps are widely used for curing gel nails, but their use is unregulated and they are readily accessible in salons or for home use. There is concern about potential carcinogenesis; however, the risk is negligible and can be further reduced with the use of sunscreen. Despite the potential complications, nail cosmetics may be a useful adjunct in treating nail disorders. Familiarity with the procedures will enable the dermatologist to recognize problems and advise on safe use.

### Comparative study of nail sampling techniques in onychomycosis [^111Vooyd]. The Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common problem. Obtaining accurate laboratory test results before treatment is important in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to compare results of curettage and drilling techniques of nail sampling in the diagnosis of onychomycosis, and to establish the best technique and location of sampling. We evaluated 60 patients suffering from distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis and lateral subungual onychomycosis using curettage and vertical and horizontal drilling sampling techniques from three different sites of the infected nail. KOH examination and fungal culture were used for detection and identification of fungal infection. At each sample site, the horizontal drilling technique has a better culture sensitivity than curettage. Trichophyton rubrum was by far the most common pathogen detected by both techniques from all sampling sites. The drilling technique was found to be statistically better than curettage at each site of sampling, furthermore vertical drilling from the proximal part of the affected nail was found to be the best procedure for nail sampling. With each technique we found that the culture sensitivity improved as the location of the sample was more proximal. More types of pathogens were detected in samples taken by both methods from proximal parts of the affected nails.

The diagnosis of pediatric nail populations is complicated because a large proportion of pediatric nail presentations involve parents bringing in their children with questions regarding nail appearance rather than the plain presentation of a disease or functional problem. Parents are concerned whether the nails are normal, if they are uncomfortable for the baby or child, if the nails will affect walking or other future function, or if the changes are of wider significance and suggest more sinister medical problems than are yet apparent. To address these concerns, the clinician needs a good grasp of what is normal.

### Genetics of human isolated hereditary nail disorders [^114nzERt]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Human hereditary nail disorders constitute a rare and heterogeneous group of ectodermal dysplasias. They occur as isolated and/or syndromic ectodermal conditions where other ectodermal appendages are also involved, and can occur associated with skeletal dysplasia. 'Nail disorder, nonsyndromic congenital' (OMIM; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) is subclassified into 10 different types. The underlying genes identified thus far are expressed in the nail bed and play important roles in nail development and morphogenesis. Here, we review the current literature on nail disorders and present a coherent review on the genetics of nail disorders. This review will pave the way to identifying putative genes and pathways involved in nail development and morphogenesis.

Nail abnormalities can arise in conjunction with or as a result of systematic pathologies. These pathologies include single-organ diseases, multisystemic diseases, and drug-induced insults. Clinical signs associated with these conditions include dyschromias, vascular alterations, periungual tissue changes, textural dystrophies, contour alterations, and growth-rate alterations. The associated systemic pathologies may affect any part of the nail apparatus, including the nail matrix, the nail plate, the nail bed, the underlying vasculature, and the periungual tissues. The anatomical location and extent of damage determine the clinically manifested anomaly.

### Nail changes and association of osteoarthritis in digital myxoid cyst [^112X7oNo]. Dermatologic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Digital myxoid cyst is relatively common on the digits. Nail changes and osteoarthritis are usually associated with this pathogenesis.

Objective

The objective was to clarify this relationship and its significance by analyzing the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic data.

Methods and Materials

Fifty-one patients with digital myxoid cysts were diagnosed and analyzed during a 5-year period.

Results

Thirty-eight (74.5%) of 51 patients showed radiologic evidence of primary interphalangeal joint osteoarthritis in the affected digits. Among the 39 cysts removed surgically and examined pathologically, 28 were myxomatous and 11 were ganglion. Different clinical manifestations of nail change, including longitudinal grooves (20 cases), concave canaliform dystrophy (9 cases), "washboard" transverse lines (5 cases), and longitudinal grooves with beaded ridges (1 case) were found.

Conclusion

Osteoarthritis of the adjacent terminal joint is an important factor involved in forming digital myxoid cysts. Of the two cyst types, ganglion cysts are related to osteoarthritis more often than myxomatous cysts. Nail changes, secondary to matrix damage, are reliable clinical signs of underlying cyst formation. Understanding the pathogenesis of the digital myxoid cyst in relation to osteoarthritis and nail deformity helps inform the care of these patients.

### Onychomycosis in clinical practice: factors contributing to recurrence [^112dVcoD]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The treatment of onychomycosis has improved in recent years and many patients can now expect a complete and lasting cure. However, for up to 25% of patients, persistent disease remains a problem, thus presenting a particular challenge to the clinician. For these patients, it is obviously important to ensure that a correct diagnosis of onychomycosis has been made, as misdiagnosis will inevitably jeopardize the perception of therapeutic effectiveness. Although onychomycosis accounts for about 50% of all nail diseases seen by physicians, nonfungal causes of similar symptoms include repeated trauma, psoriasis, lichen planus, local tumours vascular disorders and inflammatory diseases. Predisposing factors that contribute to a poor response to topical and/or oral therapy include the presence of a very thick nail, extensive involvement of the entire nail unit, lateral nail disease and yellow spikes. However, poor penetration of systemic agents to the centre of infection, or the inability of topical agents to diffuse between the surface of the nail plate and the active disease below, probably contributes to this. Other factors contributing to recurrence may be related to the patient's family history, occupation, lifestyle or underlying physiology. In addition, patients with concomitant disease (e.g. peripheral vascular disease, diabetes) or patients who are immunosuppressed (e.g. those with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) are more susceptible to onychomycosis. In the elderly, the prevalence of onychomycosis may be as high as 60%, and increases with age; in this population, physical trauma plays a major role in precipitating recurrence, especially in patients with faulty biomechanics due to underlying arthritis and bone abnormalities. It is also possible that recurrence in some cases is due to early termination of treatment or use of an inappropriate dose, and these possibilities should be eliminated before further investigations are undertaken. There is good evidence to suggest that a combination of oral and topical therapies, when given at the same time, yield excellent clinical outcomes, although there remains a need for more effective topical agents with greater nail penetration and more effective oral antifungal agents.

### Inexpensive solution for habit-tic deformity… [^1117p6sq]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Findings for both patients included dystrophy of the median aspect of both thumbnails, primarily consisting of somewhat parallel transverse ridges extending from the proximal nail fold to the distal aspect of the nail plate. These patients also demonstrated an apparent lack of cuticle and slight widening of the cuticular sulcus on the thumbnails. Patients typically confirm a long duration of this condition and frequently have no explanation or insight as to its origin. Patients are usually affected on 1 or both thumbnails. The condition is usually acquired in adulthood and felt to be related to a repetitive nervous habit of picking or pushing the cuticle of the thumbnail back. The presentation may vary, but typically the nail has a several-millimeter-wide longitudinal defect in the midline nail plate composed of small transverse, somewhat parallel, ridges leading laterally outward. The changes often arise from a somewhat hyperkeratotic proximal nail fold.

Personal observation in multiple patients has also revealed a widened space between the proximal nail fold and the nail plate with an absent cuticle. Some will distinguish this from median nail dystrophy of Heller, 2–4 but it is difficult in some patients to do so. Classically, median nail dystrophy of Heller manifests as a longitudinal split or canal with a characteristic fir-tree pattern of the transverse ridges. Some authors2–4 consider this a subset of habit-tic deformity. Solution After discussing the relationship to habitual external trauma with the patients, a trial of cyanoacrylate adhesive was suggested to be placed at the proximal nail fold to provide a sustainable barrier to trauma and to artificially recreate the absent cuticle.

Patients were allowed to procure any available products in this category that would achieve the desired effect and were advised to apply the product 1 to 2 times weekly to maintain buildup at the cuticular sulcus. On average, about 1 application per week was required. After 3 to 6 months of use, a predictable progressive normalization of the nail unit was noted in both patients up to the point of having a completely normal nail. Patient 1 demonstrates almost complete normalization of the nail plate and improved proximal nail fold, as typically seen after the interventional therapeutic trial described herein. Comment.

### Leukonychia: what can white nails tell Us? [^114Py9N7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Classification

In 1896, Unna classified leukonychia into three morphologic presentations: total, striate (transversal and longitudinal), and punctate. A fourth presentation was added few years later, which Weber called leukonychia partialis for nails that were incompletely white. Besides the morphological classification, leukonychia can be divided into three anatomical types: true leukonychia due to intrinsic matrix and plate abnormalities, apparent leukonychia, which occurs when the pathology involves subungual tissues, and pseudo-leukonychia describing whiteness of the superficial (dorsal or ventral) nail plate. While the morphological types are obvious, the anatomical types need simple tests to be differentiated: in true leukonychia, being the abnormality within the plate, there is no fading of the color with its pressure and the same is for pseudoleukonychia, which is due to external factors responsible for superficial nail plate scaling. Apparent leukonychia instead, being an abnormality of the nail bed, fades with pressure because pressure results in a temporary reduction of nail bed edema and then better visibility of nail bed vessels. The last test is the moving of the white color with nail plate growth: it moves distally with the plate growth in true and pseudoleukonychia, but it stays there in apparent leukonychia.

All forms can be temporary or permanent, monodactylous or polydactylous. Obviously, monodactylous leukonychia most likely is caused by local factors involving that digit, while polydactylous indicates a systemic factor.

### Leukonychia: what can white nails tell Us? [^115mRfS4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology

Newton's theorem states that a surface appears white when it reflects all the radiation of visible light. The nail plate surface in true leukonychia looks white because it reflects visible light in a diffuse way preventing the visualization of the underlying vascularized nail bed. This is due to an abnormal distal matrix keratinization, resulting in persistent and odd-appearing parakeratosis with disorganized large and globular onychocytes with perinuclear vacuolization and keratohyaline granules in intermediate and ventral nail plates. Under the electron microscope, the keratin fibers are also dissociated, fragmented, and irregularly aligned. Parakeratosis can be induced by numerous factors damaging the distal nail matrix. Once the trigger stops or is removed (when feasible), the white color starts to grow out. The white color in apparent leukonychia is instead the result of blood vessel compression of the nail bed. Histologically, the white area is considered to be caused by chronic anemia secondary to increased wall thickness of capillaries, by modification of subungual keratin, or by overgrowth of connective tissue between the nail and the bone with the reduction of blood in the subpapillary plexus. Localized or general edema of the nail bed is one of the possible factors that induces compression and constriction of subungual vasculature and affects the organization of the collagen fibers of the nail bed. The role of edema is also suggested by a higher prevalence of apparent leukonychia in the involved limb in unilateral lymphoedema. Once the causative factor is eliminated, resolution starts distally and moves proximally, the opposite from what happens in true leukonychia. This is explained by the assumption that the capillary filling of the nail bed runs from distal to proximal. The capillary blood pressure may be slightly higher distally (close to the afferent arterioles) than proximally (close to the efferent venules). In the case of a reduction in the nail bed edema, distally, this resistance can be overcome easier because of the slightly higher capillary blood pressure and this results in the disappearance of the whitish area first.

### Longitudinal ridges imparted by high-speed granular flow mechanisms in martian landslides [^1176sr15]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The presence of longitudinal ridges documented in long runout landslides across our solar system is commonly associated with the existence of a basal layer of ice. However, their development, the link between their occurrence and the emplacement mechanisms of long runout landslides, and the necessity of a basal ice layer remain poorly understood. Here, we analyse the morphometry of longitudinal ridges of a martian landslide and show that the wavelength of the ridges is 2–3 times the average thickness of the landslide deposit, a unique scaling relationship previously reported in ice-free rapid granular flow experiments. We recognize en-echelon features that we interpret as kinematic indicators, congruent with experimentally-measured transverse velocity gradient. We suggest that longitudinal ridges should not be considered as unequivocal evidence for presence of ice, rather as inevitable features of rapid granular sliding material, that originate from a mechanical instability once a kinematic threshold is surpassed.

### Trachyonychia: case report and review of the literature [^112J9Aa6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Trachyonychia is the term used to describe nail plate roughness, pitting, and ridging that may affect 1 to 20 nails. Alopecia areata, psoriasis, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, ichthyosis vulgaris, as well as other skin conditions have been associated with trachyonychia, but the causal relationship is often challenging to demonstrate histologically. Clinical evidence of these cutaneous disorders in conjunction with a nail matrix biopsy may help elucidate an etiology of trachyonychia, but many cases often remain idiopathic. Nail biopsy findings may match skin histology, but more commonly show spongiotic or nonspecific changes. We present an interesting case of a female with progressive development of trachyonychia in all 20 nails coinciding with a new diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

### The onychomatricoma: additional histologic criteria and immunohistochemical study [^113Zykic]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2002). Low credibility.

Onychomatricoma (OM) is a tumor of the nail matrix typified histologically by multiple distal fibroepithelial projections and a thick keratogenous zone forming multiple V-shaped invaginations at the level of epithelial ridges, with the formation of a thick nail plate. In its proximal portion, the thickness of the nail looks like a spur originating from the ventral part of the nail plate. In its distal part, beyond the lunula, the nail plate is globally thickened and filled with cavities containing serous fluid. Often, however, the pathologist is not provided with the nail plate. The diagnosis then rests on the presence of a fibroepithelial tumor. In this article the histologic criteria of OM without nail plate are refined and OM is characterized immunohistochemically using three tumors fixed in liquid nitrogen and examined separately from the nail plate. On longitudinal section OM without nail plate appears as a unique pedunculated fibroepithelial tumor i.e., the multiple distal epithelial digitations arranged along a transversal plane are not seen. The feature is reminiscent of fibrokeratoma. When OM is visualized in longitudinal section, 3 main criteria differentiate OM from fibrokeratoma: the presence of epithelial-lined invaginations around optical cavities, a stroma organized in 2 layers, and the absence of horny corn. Patterns of expression of cytokeratins and integrins in OM are identical to that observed in the normal nail matrix. Involucrin finds expression from the basal layer through to the top of the epithelium, where it is more marked and where transglutaminase 1 is restricted. Merkel cells detected by CK 20 are increased in number and sometimes disposed in clusters. The fibrous component of OM is composed of 2 layers: a superficial stroma made of numerous fines fibrils of collagen IV intermingled with collagen I, and deep stroma made principally of collagen I. Antibody AE13, specific to trichocytic keratins Ha 1–4, represent a good potential marker of OM. Its V-shaped expression in epithelium ridges offers early identification of the keratogenous zone of OM, on tumors separated from their nail plates and limited to their fibroepithelial components.

### Simultaneous occurrence of idiopathic trachyonychia in dizygotic twins [^115AgaQM]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Trachyonychia (or twenty-nail dystrophy) is an uncommon chronic disorder manifesting as thin, flattened, brittle nails with excessive longitudinal ridging and loss of luster creating a "sandpaper-like" texture that most commonly presents spontaneously in childhood as an isolated phenomenon; however, it has been historically associated with numerous dermatoses. Rarely, trachyonychia has been reported to occur in families, suggesting a potential hereditary predisposition. We report trachyonychia occurring simultaneously in dizygotic twins, further supporting a possible underlying genetic basis of this idiopathic nail disorder.

2.3 The Definition ofSubtypes

Typical nail lichen planus (NLP) is the most common subtype, clinically characterized by thinning of the nail plate accompanied by longitudinal ridging and splitting, which may be associated with or without pterygium (Figure 1A). Twenty‐nail dystrophy (trachyonychia) presents as a uniform roughness of all nails due to excessive longitudinal ridging, differing from typical NLP by its consistent nail surface involvement and the lack of pterygium (Figure 1B, C). Idiopathic nail atrophy is defined by progressive atrophy affecting multiple nails, with or without nail plate loss or pterygium. Unlike the gradual evolution of typical NLP with pterygium, idiopathic atrophy often shows a more abrupt onset, widespread scarring, and nail loss either from matrix destruction or extensive atrophy, irrespective of pterygium formation (Figure 1D, E).

2.4 Nail Biopsy and Histopathology

Longitudinal nail biopsies were performed under digital nerve block using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine. The most serious nail was selected, and a longitudinal biopsy was obtained after partial or complete nail plate avulsion, including the proximal nail fold, matrix, bed, and hyponychium. Specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and stained with H&E. Histopathology consistent with NLP typically shows hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, elongation of rete ridges, a band of lymphocytes in the upper dermis and dermoepidermal junction, and necrosis of basal layer cells in the proximal nail fold, similar to cutaneous LP (Figure 2). As NLP progresses to late stages, histopathology typically reveals nonspecific findings such as matrix disappearance, epithelial scarring, and diminished inflammatory activity.

FIGURE 2
Histopathological findings from longitudinal nail biopsies in nail lichen planus. Longitudinal nail biopsy from a 68‐year‐old woman with NLP demonstrates key histopathological features, including hyperkeratosis, hypergranulosis, and focal lichenoid inflammation involving the dorsal nail fold, ventral nail fold, and nail matrix. Notably, destruction and loss of the keratogenous zone within the matrix are observed, reflecting advanced matrix involvement(HE, 50X).

### Leukonychia: what can white nails tell Us? [^113BQipZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Longitudinal Leukonychia

Longitudinal true leukonychia is caused by alterations of a section of the matrix, resulting in focal parakeratosis and disorganization of keratin filaments, which, if present for a long time, results in a longitudinal white band. It is a typical sign of Darier's disease where it is associated with longitudinal erythronychia (candy cane nails) (Fig. 9). The white lines correspond to epithelial hyperplasia of the matrix and the red lines represent thin nails due to matrix disease. Longitudinal true leukonychia without red lines can also be, even if less frequent, a sign of other genodermatoses, including Hailey-Hailey disease, and tuberous sclerosis complex. Other nail disorders presenting with linear true leukonychia include onychomatricoma (Fig. 10), onychocytic matricoma, and nail matrix lichen planus. A longitudinal band in the great toenail has been associated with chronic trauma in hallux valgus deformity.

Fig. 9
In Darier disease, longitudinal true leukonychia is associated with erythronychia (candy cane nails)

Fig. 10
Longitudinal true leukonychia in onychomatricoma

Longitudinal apparent leukonychia is also mostly present in one isolated digit. It is often seen in disorders that present with linear erythronychia, in which erythronychia is the result of increased vascularization and leukonychia, the result of decreased vascularization (some nail tumors for example, including longitudinal subungual acanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma). Apparent leukonychia is also a presenting sign of onychopapilloma, a benign nail bed tumor where leukonychia is due to metaplasia of the nail bed epithelium with a mount of horny cells causing altered light refraction and fibrosis of the nail bed stroma.

Longitudinal pseudo-leukonychia can be instead caused by onychomycosis. The infection may be recognizable as irregular dense longitudinal white or yellowish bands (spikes).

### Management of nail bed lacerations… [^11589baG]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

to the editor: I read with keen interest the fine review by Drs. Wang and Johnson, entitled "Fingertip Injuries". This dogma regarding subungual hematomas and management of nail bed lacerations is a standard and widely disseminated notion that has been in orthopedic literature for years. However, there is no substantive proof for the technique's effectiveness or efficacy in preventing post-traumatic "ridged nail, " "split-nail" deformity, an irregular nail surface, or failure of the nail plate to adhere to the nail bed. Although this issue is controversial and textbook recommendations are mixed, 2, 3 some evidenced-based data show that primary repair of nail bed lacerations is probably not necessary. If the nail plate is partially avulsed but is firmly attached to the nail matrix, exploring the nail bed is difficult and probably unwarranted.

4 Even in the presence of significant subungual hematoma, with or without tuft fracture, the nail need not be routinely removed to search for nail bed laceration, as long as the nail is adherent and disruption of the surrounding tissue is minimal. 5 A good cosmetic and functional outcome can be expected. In a small, prospective study, Roser and Gellman 6 compared outcomes of two groups of patients with fingertip injuries; one group was managed with surgery, and the other was managed without surgery. The first group consisted of 26 consecutive patients, aged eight months to 15 years, with crush injuries resulting in subungual hematomas involving more than 25 percent of the nail bed, with an intact nail and nail margin, who underwent operative repair under digital block.

The second group included 26 consecutive patients, aged six months to 20 years, with 27 similar finger injuries managed nonoperatively, with either trephination or observation without evacuation of the hematoma. Mean follow-up exceeded two years in both groups. In the operative group in this study. 6 75 percent of patients had subungual hematomas in excess of 75 percent and tuft fractures were present in 12 cases. In the nonoperative group, one third of the patients had subungual hematomas in excess of 75 percent and tuft fractures were present in 11 cases. Transient abnormalities were noted in three of the 26 nails in the operative group, and one additional nail exhibited insignificant cosmetic abnormality.

### Longitudinal ridges imparted by high-speed granular flow mechanisms in martian landslides [^112wKUEX]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Landslide deposit thickness error estimation

We traced profiles transversal and longitudinal to the valley floor, adjacent to the central and east areas of the study (Supplementary Fig. 3). This set of transects (yellow lines), in the specific their linear fits (burgundy lines), is compared with a mirror set of transects traced in the correspondence of the landslide deposit (blue lines) so to assess the plausibility of the overall elevations of our reconstructed bottom surface, and to provide an error estimation of the average thickness that we provide in the paper.

As the floor of Valles Marineris gently dips towards east (in the figure, from left to right), the higher elevations of the blue lines 1 and 2 are plausible. However, we are also expecting a random natural roughness of the valley floor at various scales so that also blue lines 3 and 4 appear plausible, as their maximum offset (blue line 3) is ~80 m, which is within a reasonable magnitude of topographic variation (as seen in profile 1, Supplementary Fig. 3).

We use these profiles to evaluate the errors on the deposit thickness, and we do so by accounting for the standard deviation of the elevation in the topographic profiles (Supplementary Table 4). To do so, we use the topographic profiles that we traced in the valley floor, adjacent to the central and east areas of study (yellow lines). As the topographic profiles that we traced for the morphometric analysis are parallel to neither transversal nor longitudinal direction, we determine the final error taking into account the propagation of error along these two axes (Eq. (1)), that is combining standard deviation for yellow lines 1 and 2 to obtain the error in the central area of study (c) and yellow lines 3 and 4 for the error in the east area of study (d), represented as error bars in Fig. 2b of the main text:

### Tissue engineering for vertical ridge reconstruction [^112ymtgS]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

This article provides an overview of basic tissue engineering principles as they are applied to vertical ridge defects and reconstructive techniques for these types of deficiencies. Presented are multiple clinical cases ranging from office-based dentoalveolar procedures to the more complex reconstruction of postresection mandibular defects. Several different types of regenerative tissue constructs are presented; either used alone or in combination with traditional reconstructive techniques and procedures, such as maxillary sinus augmentation, Le Fort I osteotomy, and microvascular free tissue transfer. The goal is to also familiarize the reconstructive surgeon to potential future strategies in vertical alveolar ridge augmentation.

### An irregular black patch on the nail plate [^115W32kJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What are key dermoscopic features of the correct diagnosis?
A. Longitudinal brown to black lines with irregular color, spacing, and thickness, with pigment extension onto the hyponychium, revealing a parallel ridge pattern
B. Gray homogenous band consisting of multiple thin homogeneous gray lines
C. Red-black globules along proximal and lateral margins of homogenous pigment that lacks melanin granules
D. Light- to dark-brown parallel striae that extend beneath a translucent eponychium
E. White or yellow streaks, nonlongitudinal homogenous pattern, and reverse triangular pattern

Answers:
A. Longitudinal brown to black lines with irregular color, spacing, and thickness, with pigment extension onto the hyponychium, revealing a parallel ridge pattern — Incorrect. Dermoscopic features suggestive of subungual melanoma may include irregular longitudinal brown to black lines with asymmetry in color, spacing, and thickness. Lines also may show parallelism disruption or blood spots.
B. Gray homogenous band consisting of multiple thin homogeneous gray lines — Incorrect. This dermoscopic feature is a sign of benign melanocytic activation and may be observed in several diagnoses, such as drug-induced pigmentation or ethnic-type melanonychia.
C. Red-black globules along proximal and lateral margins of homogenous pigment that lacks melanin granules — Incorrect. Homogenous red-maroon pigmentation with round globules at the periphery likely represents subungual hematoma. However, red-maroon pigmentation that does not resolve with nail growth may require additional histopathologic examination because of the concern for subungual melanoma.
D. Light- to dark-brown parallel striae that extend beneath a translucent eponychium — Incorrect. This feature is known as pseudo-Hutchinson sign and is a common feature of nail matrix nevi, often observed in younger adults and children. Other features of a nevus include the presence of melanin inclusion granules, regular nail band pattern, parallel lines, and uniform band thickness and spacing.
E. White or yellow streaks, nonlongitudinal homogenous pattern, and reverse triangular pattern — Correct. These features, along with subungual hyperkeratosis, yellow or multicolor pigmentation, and white scale, are more significantly associated with fungal melanonychia than sources of melanocyte activation or melanocyte hyperplasia. The presence of irregular reticular pigmentation has not previously been described, but may represent another dermoscopic feature of fungal melanonychia. Additional studies are needed to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of this feature.

### Vitamin deficiencies / hypervitaminosis and the skin [^1151WmA1]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Vitamins are an indispensable food source and important owing to the enzyme cofactor and catalytic roles they play in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K, and B12, are stored in the body and can cause problems with their excessive accumulation. Other vitamins rarely accumulate in the body because they dissolve in water and are excreted through the kidneys. Alcoholism, strict diets, insufficient parental nutrition, and gastrointestinal absorption problems may be included in the causes of vitamin deficiencies. Although clinical findings of vitamin deficiencies display different characteristics depending on the vitamins, the signs that generally occur are cutaneous pigmentation, pigmentation on mucous membranes, palmoplantar keratoderma characterized by fissures, palmar streaking, yellow streaking on the nails, nail layering, and intranail hemorrhage.

### Earth's longest preserved linear volcanic ridge generated by a moving kerguelen hotspot [^114vuuw2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Recent seismic tomography unveiled complex mantle plume structures diverging from the originally proposed single, narrow, and vertically-oriented plume conduits, which necessitates new perspectives on the mechanism of hotspot motion. While several recent endeavours have focused on Pacific hotspots' motion, knowledge of others remains limited. Here we constrain the motions of the Kerguelen hotspot within the Indian Ocean by obtaining robust 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages for the Ninetyeast Ridge, Earth's longest linear volcanic ridge. These data indicate varying volcanic progression rates along the ridge, contrasting to a constant rate as previously documented. Combined with constraints on the Indian Plate motion and seafloor spreading, we reveal four periods of motions of the hotspot caused by its interactions with the Indian-Antarctic spreading ridge. This suggests that mantle plume lateral flows are susceptible to changes in shallow mantle convection due to the existence of horizontal ponding zones and vertical conduits, especially in the shallow asthenosphere.

### Curly fingernails as a potential new nail variant: a report of two cases [^113eErs8]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Oberlin et alhypothesized that ethnic differences might influence nail shape, analogous to hair, with asymmetric hair follicle differentiation in curly-haired Black patients and uniform differentiation in straight-haired individuals. For instance, Guinness World Record holders for longest fingernails have been a Caucasian woman with straight nails, and African American and Indian men with curly nails. Nonetheless, current hair classifications by geo-racial distinctions do not fully reflect the global diversity or cross-group overlap of hair types. Differences in nail manicuring techniques, as well as lipid and protein nail content, may also explain differences in nail morphology.

Limitations include lack of laboratory evaluation and genetic testing.

Curly fingernails are a rarely reported phenomenon with unknown pathogenesis. This novel clinical finding may serve as a window into previously unrecognized differences in nail morphologies across population groups or potential mutations in keratin genes related to other cutaneous diseases. However, such etiologies are only speculative and further characterization of this phenomenon is needed. Future studies are needed to assess the prevalence of curly nails, and histopathologic examination of this new nail variant may be enlightening. Unique cultural and psychosocial practices surrounding nails adds an extra layer of mystery in our understanding of this skin appendage.

### Successful treatment of type I pityriasis rubra pilaris with ixekizumab [^1113nC5K]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare condition that has been classified into 6 subtypes dependent on morphologic features, prognosis, age of onset, and HIV status. Classic adult subtype I accounts for approximately 55% of cases. It is clinically characterized by diffuse follicular plugging and perifollicular erythema coalescing to form orange-red scaly plaques with follicular plugging extending caudally to form generalized erythema with characteristic small islands of normal-appearing skin. This appearance is typically associated with palmoplantar keratoderma, nail thickening and subungual hyperkeratosis, and erythema with micaceous scale of the face and scalp.

Histopathologic findings include irregular broad acanthosis with short rete ridges and thick suprapapillary plates, focal or confluent hypergranulosis, diffuse orthokeratosis with spotted parakeratosis in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, follicular plugging with a collar of perifollicular parakeratosis, and a superficial perivascular and perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis.

We present a case of classic adult subtype I PRP unresponsive to therapy with acitretin, methotrexate, and etanercept but with a marked rapid and sustained response to the interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitor, ixekizumab.

### Leukonychia: what can white nails tell Us? [^117GE5bs]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Leukonychia, or white nails, is usually not an alarming sign, but it can sometimes unmask severe systemic disorders or congenital conditions. The white color can be due to nail plate or nail bed abnormalities. Differentiating between these two is essential in the classification and interpretation of leukonychia. The aim of this article is to guide clinical practice by reviewing data concerning several types of leukonychia, with particular reference to all clinical and dermoscopic features, associated medical conditions, pathogenesis, and necessary work-up.

### Multiple calcified subungual epidermoid inclusions [^111wQ76Q]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Subungual epidermoid inclusions (also known as subungual onycholemmal cysts) are an uncommon and distinctive nail abnormality occurring in the dermis of the nail bed. Clinically the nail plate may exhibit onychodystrophy, clubbing, ridging, thickening, pigmentation, or appear normal. We report the case of a patient with onychodystrophy of the right halux of 7 years' duration. This case is presented with serial pictures demonstrating the gradual development of nail plate thickening, yellow discoloration, and nail bed hyperkeratosis indicative of the disease. She had negative fungal cultures, poor response to topical and oral antifungal agents, and an initial nondiagnostic superficial biopsy. Repeat full-thickness nail bed biopsy results revealed multiple calcified subungual epidermoid inclusions epidermoid inclusions. Histologic features included characteristic elongation of the rete ridges with cyst formation and pinching off of the connection to the nail bed epithelium, forming free-lying cysts within the dermis of the nail bed. The cysts contained compact onycholemmal keratin and calcification. A granular layer was not present. This case reinforces the need to clinically reassess, possibly x-ray, and perform a sufficient biopsy for persistent undiagnosed nail unit disorders. Subungual calcified inclusions may be an underrecognized and more common entity than currently recognized.

### Blocking diversity causes distinct roles of diabatic heating in the Northern hemisphere [^115LWBzJ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In contrast, diabatic heating structures in dipole blocks exhibit distinct features compared to those in ridge blocks. The maximum moisture-induced temperature tendency locates within the low-pressure system (or the high PV system) of the dipole, which is to the south of the center of blocks (Fig. 2b). For dipole blocks, the upstream region is instead characterized by only moderate diabatic heating compared to that in ridge blocks. Besides, diabatic heating is more robust only after the formation of blocks and can last throughout the entire blocking lifecycle (Fig. 2f). The vertical distribution of moisture-induced temperature tendency further suggests that diabatic heating in dipoles is maximized in the lower troposphere (1000 m to 2000m) and decreases significantly with height, and therefore generates a less stable stratification with a stronger vertical gradient in the lower to middle troposphere than that in ridge blocks (Fig. 2d). Notably, diabatic heating below the boundary layer (1000 m) is always negative in both types of blocks, which can be attributed to the strong evaporation processes near the surface (not shown).

The diverse patterns of the thermodynamic contribution between ridge blocks and dipole blocks imply distinct roles of their dynamic contribution to the wave activity in blocks. Such thermodynamic-to-dynamic transformation can be quantified with the local wave activity (LWA) framework (see methodology and Supplementary Information). Specifically, the vertical structure of diabatic heating combined with static stability determine the change in QGPV, and therefore influence the meandering of the atmosphere, which is quantified as moisture-induced wave activity tendency and is the key variable that quantifies the change of atmospheric blocks by diabatic processes (Eqs. 2 and 3). For example, the change of wave activity in a dipole block at Point A is determined by the line integration of moisture-induced QGPV tendency, but only the red part within the moisture region can make diabatic contribution to the wave activity tendency (see Fig. 3 b, c for schematic demonstrations for such moisture-induced wave activity tendencies for ridge and dipole blocks).

### Intra-operative onychoscopy of subungual epidermoid inclusions [^112Rp2XW]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Subungual epidermoid inclusions (SEI), also known as subungual onycholemmal cysts, represent a distinctive nail disorder arising from the nail bed. They are small epithelial inclusions, sometimes solid but mostly with central keratinization of the onycholemmal type without a granular layer. SEI usually remain microscopic and asymptomatic. Exceptionally, they become large enough to produce symptoms such as swelling of the nail bed resulting in subungual keratosis, onycholysis, or a dystrophic nail plate. Initially, this is painless but later mild pain may appear due to compression between nail and bone. The nail plate may be normal or dystrophic; thickened, clubbed or ridged.

### Nail disorders as signs of pediatric systemic disease [^116yhw8z]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2012). Low credibility.

Herein, we describe some of the more common changes in the nail unit that can be seen in systemic diseases in children. Changes that can be seen are not limited to those discussed in the following pages. The presence of changes on multiple nails is suggestive of a systemic cause in an ill child. However, multiple nails can also be affected in primary inflammatory disorders and infections of the nail unit. When evaluating a pediatric patient with a nail disorder, it is important to perform a complete physical examination of the skin and oral mucosa, as other clues to the diagnosis of the nail problem may be found. A comprehensive family history is also important to uncover possible syndromic associations with nail disease or diseases that can manifest with nail changes.

Brittle nails are characterized by roughness of the surface of the nail plate, fragility, and peeling. This is a condition that is seen commonly in elderly individuals, and it is associated mostly with an abnormality of keratin, keratin associated proteins, water, and/or lipid content. It is idiopathic in the majority of the cases, but there are some dermatological and systemic diseases that can be associated with brittle nails. Treatment is a challenge for the clinician, in some case, can be difficult, and certainly needs strong cooperation of the patient.

### Nail lichen planus in 81 patients: a retrospective study of clinical characteristics, histopathological features, and long-term treatment outcomes [^113vxAe5]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.4 The Correlation of Severity With Disease Duration

Among the 81 patients, clinical severity was classified as mild in 10 cases (12.35%), moderate in 21 cases (25.93%), and severe in 50 cases (61.73%). Notably, within the severe group, 15 cases showed advanced nail atrophy (Figure 1D, E) and 6 patients exhibited dorsal pterygium (Figure 1F). The mean disease duration in patients with severe presentation was 54.06 ± 65.18 months (range 3–240 months), compared to 38.45 ± 35.51 months (range 2–108 months) in those with mild to moderate disease. Although the severe group tended to have a longer disease course, the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.431, unpaired t ‐test).

3.5 Histological Features

All cases were confirmed through longitudinal nail biopsies, showing hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, elongation of rete ridges, a band of lymphocytes in the upper dermis and dermoepidermal junction, and necrosis of basal layer cells in the proximal nail fold, similar to cutaneous LP (Figure 2). Disappearance of the keratogenous zone and hypergranulosis is typically seen in the nail matrix (Table 3). Among the 81 biopsied nails, clinical involvement and histopathological involvement were analyzed; the overall concordance rate between clinical and histopathologic localization was approximately 96.30% (78/81). Interestingly, because longitudinal biopsies allow visualization of the entire nail unit, we found that 47 cases (58.02%) showed pathological involvement of the ventral nail fold, which is often not clinically apparent, especially at the junction between the ventral nail fold and the proximal nail matrix (Figure 2). Moreover, to evaluate the patient‐reported outcomes of the biopsy procedure, we assessed satisfaction with longitudinal nail biopsy in 62 followed‐up patients using a 0–10 scale (10 indicating very satisfied, 0 indicating very dissatisfied). The mean satisfaction score was 8.32 ± 2.86 (range: 1–10). However, it is worth noting that 14.52% of patients (n = 9) reported a satisfaction score below 6, mainly due to postoperative nail deformity.

### Longitudinal erythronychia: suggestions for evaluation and management [^116Ax2DK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Longitudinal erythronychia is a frequent nail presentation with a limited differential diagnosis. This clinical entity may be divided into cases that involve one (localized) or multiple (polydactylous) nails. The different presentations have distinct differential diagnoses and workups yet often share a common pathogenesis. Localized longitudinal erythronychia most commonly represents onychopapilloma, yet malignancies may present identically. Therefore biopsy may be required. Polydactylous longitudinal erythronychia usually coincides with a regional or systemic cause. Occasionally, it may herald an important underlying disease. A thorough understanding of the pathogenesis, clinical presentations, and possible diagnoses is necessary for successful evaluation and management.

### Split fingernails, underdeveloped thumbnails, and triangular lunulae [^1157TjEs]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 67-year-old man presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of split nails. His medical history was notable for bilateral elbow surgeries. On physical examination, it was noted that the patient had split nails of his index fingernails and underdevelopment of his thumbnails (Fig 1). All his fingernails, except for the thumbnails, had triangular lunulae.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Darier disease
B. Lichen planus (LP)
C. Nail-patella syndrome (NPS)
D. Pachyonychia congenita
E. Psoriasis

Answers:
A. Darier disease – Incorrect. Darier disease primarily affects keratinization, leading to hyperkeratotic and warty plaques in a seborrheic distribution. It also manifests with nail changes, including longitudinal red and white streaks, as well as distinct V-shaped notching of the distal nail plate, which may mimic the splitting and cracking seen in the nails of patients with NPS.
B. LP – Incorrect. LP is characterized by violaceous, pruritic papules, and plaques with Wickham striae. LP of the nail classically causes trachyonychia and dorsal pterygium.
C. NPS – Correct. NPS, also known as hereditary onycho-osteodysplasia or Fong disease, typically presents with abnormalities in the nails and the bones of knees, elbows, and pelvis. Nails may be absent, underdeveloped, split, or ridged with pathognomonic triangular lunulae. Bony abnormalities include absent or hypoplastic patellae, radial head dysplasia, and iliac bone exostoses.
D. Pachyonychia congenita – Incorrect. Pachyonychia congenita presents with oral leukokeratosis, palmoplantar keratoderma, and thickened nails with subungual hyperkeratosis. In contrast, NPS is marked by dystrophic nails, triangular lunulae, and skeletal deformities.
E. Psoriasis – Incorrect. Psoriasis is a skin condition that characteristically presents with well-circumscribed, erythematous, and scaly plaques. Psoriasis can affect nails with varying presentations, including irregular pitting, oil drop spots, and onycholysis. Psoriasis affecting the nail does not present with triangular lunulae.

### Blocking diversity causes distinct roles of diabatic heating in the Northern hemisphere [^1154yYYc]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Geographic distribution of ridge blocks and dipole blocks.

Red dots: the peaking location of each ridge block. Blue dots: the peaking location of each dipole block. Blocking events are identified in the Northern Hemisphere from 1980 to 2022 of all seasons based on MERRA2 product.

The thermodynamic structures of two types of blocks differs significantly. Figure 2 shows horizontal and vertical structures of moisture-induced diabatic heating on the peaking dates (i.e. the dates with maximum LWA) of the blocks. Diabatic heating in ridge blocks is primarily located upstream from the center location (Fig. 2a), which is consistent with previous studies that emphasize the importance of upstream latent heat release from extratropical cyclones and associated warm conveyor belts. The vertical structure of moisture-induced temperature tendency in ridge blocks also demonstrates that intense diabatic heating occurs upstream from the core region, and can extend to the upper troposphere (approximately 7000 m) with a deep vertical penetration (Fig. 2c), indicating the strong upward motions and enhanced static stability induced by moist processes. With gradually decreasing diabatic heating from upstream regions, ridge blocks' center is always less influenced by the moisture, and is usually dominated by strong subsidence which can cause surface extreme weather events such as severe heat waves and droughts. The Hovmöller diagram further indicates that diabatic heating in ridge blocks primarily occurs before the blocking formation or in the early stage of the blocking lifecycle (Fig. 2e).

Clinical Characteristics of the Study Cohort

Longitudinal xanthopachyonychia was observed in 9 cases (Fig. 1), followed by longitudinal leukopachyonychia (= 3) (Fig. 2) and longitudinal pachymelanonychia (n = 2). The most common clinical findings identified following dermoscopy and analysis at high magnification of classical photographs were free-edge thickening of the nail plate without pitting (n = 14), longitudinal white ridges (n = 7), round white clods (n = 7), white dots (n = 7) and filiform hemorrhages (n = 7), followed by fuzzy lateral border (n = 5), linear white clods (n = 5), and red–purple blood clods (n = 3) (Figs. 1–3). White dots were typified by small round structures < 0.1 mm in diameter. White round clods corresponded to round structures between 0.1 and 0.2 mm in diameter. Linear and oval white clods corresponded to structures measuring 0.5–1 mm in their largest dimensions.

### An algorithmic approach to posttraumatic nail deformities based on anatomical classification [^11226Luv]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Most of the clinical series on posttraumatic nail deformities (PTNDs) address an individual deformity and its correction. The aim of the study was to classify PTND on the basis of its anatomical defect, devise the reconstructive modality and propose an algorithmic approach to PTND. We have also analysed our results of surgical correction and compared the data with the published literature.

Method

A 5-year retrospective study of 45 patients with PTND was conducted. The deformities were classified into three groups: intact nail bed, partially amputated nail bed and completely amputated nail bed on the basis of the remnant nail bed.

Results

PTNDs with intact nail bed were present in 78%, with partially amputated nail bed in 16% and with completely amputated nail bed in 7% of the patients. Deformities in intact nail bed group were nonadherence (33%), ridged nail (31%), split nail (9%) and nail horn (4%). All patients with partially amputated nail bed presented with hooked nail deformity. A satisfactory result was seen in 87% of nonadherence, 71% of ridged nail, 50% of split nail and 57% of hooked nail. None of the patients with nail horn and absent nail showed a satisfactory result.

Conclusion

PTND with intact nail bed are consistently benefitted when the option is only split-thickness sterile matrix (STSM) grafting. Appreciable correction of hooked nail deformity can be achieved by the reconstruction of lost components. In our opinion, there is no role of split-thickness germinal matrix (STGM) and STSM graft transfer in total nail reconstruction.

### Nail cosmetics [^111uxHWf]. Dermatologic Clinics (2006). Low credibility.

Nail cosmetics are used worldwide by millions of women who desire attractive, adorned nails. Smooth, shiny fingernails and toenails are highly desirable and an entire industry is devoted to achieving that end for the consumer. The grooming and decoration of nails is a well-ingrained cultural ritual in many countries of the world. In the United States alone, US dollars 6.4 billion was spent on nail salon services in the year 2004.
