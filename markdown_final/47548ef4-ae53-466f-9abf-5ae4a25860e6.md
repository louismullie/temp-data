## Question

Obesity treatment options

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about obesity treatment options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle of obesity as a chronic, relapsing disease and how that frames treatment. Then, I should verify the universal first-line role of lifestyle interventions and their expected outcomes. Next, I will examine pharmacotherapy, including approved agents, efficacy, safety, and guideline recommendations. After that, I need to review surgical options, indications, and outcomes. I will then consider endoscopic and device therapies as intermediate options. I should also address pediatric-specific pathways and limitations. Finally, I will integrate emerging therapies, precision medicine, and a practical, stepwise algorithm with shared decision-making and access considerations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease driven by complex neurohormonal and environmental factors, so treatment must be longitudinal, complication-centric, and individualized rather than weight-centric alone. I need to ensure I anchor this in current consensus statements and primary care guidance to avoid drifting into a purely BMI-based approach [^117BF7Mj] [^115whmxE] [^112myVY8].

> Next, I should review lifestyle interventions as the universal first-line therapy. Wait, let me verify the expected magnitude of weight loss and durability. High-intensity, multicomponent behavioral programs with dietary energy deficit, increased physical activity, and behavior change typically achieve about 8 kg (about 8% of initial weight) at 6 months, with maintenance programs reducing but not eliminating regain; importantly, even 5–10% weight loss yields clinically meaningful improvements in cardiometabolic risk, so I should not understate the value of modest losses [^117Ay8bP] [^114xjnoy] [^112gpDTN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pharmacotherapy being optional. I should confirm guideline positions. The AGA strongly recommends adding pharmacotherapy to lifestyle in adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with weight-related complications who have an inadequate response to lifestyle alone, and the AACE/ACE algorithm supports escalation based on disease severity and complications; semaglutide 2.4 mg and tirzepatide have moved the efficacy needle to 15–20% mean weight loss in trials, approaching surgical ranges, though I need to emphasize long-term cardiovascular outcome data are still maturing [^115GF7CL] [^117BF7Mj] [^1118ijBa] [^1118ijBa].

> I will now examine approved agents and their relative efficacy. Let me double-check the network meta-analysis hierarchy. Phentermine-topiramate and GLP-1 receptor agonists (notably semaglutide) demonstrate the highest efficacy among oral agents, with semaglutide showing about a 12% mean weight loss advantage over lifestyle alone and high odds of achieving ≥ 5% and ≥ 10% loss; orlistat is less effective and often limited by GI side effects, while naltrexone-bupropion offers intermediate efficacy; I should also note that tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist, achieves ≥ 20% mean loss in people without diabetes and is FDA-approved for chronic weight management, though I need to ensure I cite the most current approvals accurately [^1118ijBa] [^1118ijBa] [^114rU8dV].

> Wait, I should verify safety, tolerability, and discontinuation risks before recommending agents. GLP-1 agonists commonly cause GI adverse effects and lead to discontinuation in roughly 5–15% in trials, with higher discontinuation in some dual-hormone agents; orlistat is associated with GI effects and fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption; phentermine-topiramate requires caution with neuropsychiatric adverse effects; I need to ensure contraindications are screened, including medullary thyroid carcinoma risk for GLP-1s and pregnancy for teratogenic agents, and I should confirm that long-term continuation is generally required to maintain benefits [^111beE8U] [^114dAXPa] [^115L1kwt].

> Let me consider surgical therapy next. I should confirm indications and expected outcomes. Sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass remain the dominant procedures, with long-term excess weight loss often 25–35% and durable remission of type 2 diabetes in many patients. Eligibility traditionally includes BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with obesity-related complications, and multiple societies endorse considering metabolic surgery down to BMI 30–35 kg/m² in selected patients with inadequately controlled diabetes or other serious comorbidities. I need to ensure I note that surgery is underutilized relative to eligibility, with only about 1% of eligible patients undergoing procedures annually in some settings [^113jvKue] [^116D2akF] [^116fkrA3].

> But wait, what if the patient is not ready for surgery or has moderate obesity with comorbidities? I should review endoscopic and device therapies as intermediate options. Intragastric balloons, endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, and aspiration therapy can achieve 10–20% weight loss in selected patients, though durability depends on adherence to lifestyle and, in some cases, sequential pharmacotherapy; I need to emphasize that these are adjuncts within comprehensive programs and that patient selection and center expertise are critical [^116fkrA3].

> Next, I should review pediatric-specific care. Let me verify the staged approach and approved pharmacotherapy. Comprehensive obesity treatment for youth begins with intensive family-based behavioral therapy, with escalation to pharmacotherapy or metabolic and bariatric surgery if BMI remains ≥ 95th percentile after structured lifestyle intervention. Currently, only orlistat and phentermine are FDA-approved in adolescents, with semaglutide 2.4 mg now approved for adolescents 12 years and older based on robust BMI reductions, while access and long-term safety data remain key gaps. I should confirm that treatment goals extend beyond BMI to comorbidity resolution and quality of life [^114cCNAv] [^116N9juX].

> I need to check emerging therapies and the pipeline. Hold on, I should verify the trajectory of incretin-based combinations. Multiple agents targeting GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors are in late-phase trials, with mean weight loss approaching 20–25% in some programs, suggesting pharmacotherapy may soon rival surgical outcomes for selected patients. However, I should caution that long-term safety, durability, and equitable access remain unresolved issues that will shape adoption [^111beE8U] [^1118ijBa].

> Let me think about precision medicine and treatment heterogeneity. I should confirm that biomarker-driven stratification is nascent but promising. Genetic and phenotypic profiling may eventually guide selection among lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, endoscopic, and surgical options, but current implementation remains limited. Meanwhile, I should emphasize iterative, individualized care with reassessment every 3–6 months and readiness to switch or combine modalities based on response and tolerability [^113bDK6t] [^117BF7Mj].

> I will now examine practical implementation and shared decision-making. I should double-check that guidelines endorse a structured counseling approach. The 5 A's (Ask, Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist) operationalize nonstigmatizing, complication-centric care, and primary care clinicians are encouraged to screen all adults, assess complications, and either deliver or refer to intensive behavioral programs; addressing weight stigma, social determinants, and access barriers is essential to equitable outcomes [^114EWcbY] [^117Ay8bP] [^112myVY8].

> Next, I should review a stepwise algorithm and verify escalation thresholds. Start with lifestyle therapy for all. If BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with complications and inadequate response after 3–6 months, add pharmacotherapy. If pharmacotherapy fails to achieve ≥ 10% weight loss or is not tolerated, consider endoscopic therapy. If BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with serious comorbidities, or if BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² with uncontrolled diabetes despite optimal therapy, discuss metabolic surgery. Throughout, reassess every 3–6 months and escalate or combine modalities as needed, aligning with AACE and AGA guidance [^117BF7Mj] [^115GF7CL] [^112myVY8].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and comorbidity-specific considerations. In type 2 diabetes, prioritize weight-loss–promoting glucose-lowering agents and consider anti-obesity pharmacotherapy early. In cardiovascular disease, emphasize risk reduction through weight loss and comorbidity control rather than BMI alone. In older adults, tailor intensity to frailty, comorbidity burden, and patient preference, recognizing that surgery may still be beneficial when carefully selected [^115L1kwt] [^113TZyzK] [^1121AAtC].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address system-level barriers and future directions. Access, coverage, and workforce capacity limit uptake of effective therapies, and the cost of newer AOMs threatens to widen disparities. Prevention remains indispensable, but for the many living with obesity now, expanding access to intensive lifestyle programs, pharmacotherapy, endoscopic therapies, and surgery — within a chronic care model — is critical to realize population health gains [^116N9juX] [^113Le1Jx] [^114gAPE7].

Obesity treatment is **multimodal and individualized**, with lifestyle interventions as the foundation [^115QQPYh] and pharmacotherapy or bariatric surgery added based on BMI, comorbidities, and response [^115GF7CL] [^113jvKue]. Lifestyle therapy (diet, activity, behavior) yields 5–10% weight loss [^112gpDTN] but is hard to maintain long term [^114xjnoy]; **pharmacotherapy** (semaglutide, tirzepatide, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, orlistat) achieves 10–20% loss [^114rU8dV] and improves metabolic health [^112fsTUY], while **bariatric surgery** (sleeve gastrectomy, RYGB) produces 25–35% durable loss [^113jvKue] and remission of diabetes and other comorbidities [^115CVhd7] [^115QQPYh]. Emerging options include endoscopic procedures [^116fkrA3], combination pharmacotherapy [^111D3WRD], and precision medicine [^113bDK6t]. Treatment should be **long-term and complication-centric** [^117BF7Mj], with shared decision-making and regular monitoring [^113TZyzK].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone of obesity management [^115CVhd7], emphasizing **caloric restriction, increased physical activity, and behavioral modification** [^114xjnoy].

- **Dietary modifications**: Caloric restriction of 500–1,000 kcal/day, with emphasis on low-fat, high-fiber, and low-glycemic load foods [^notfound].
- **Physical activity**: At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, supplemented by resistance training [^1166Z1Pp].
- **Behavioral therapy**: Cognitive-behavioral strategies, motivational interviewing, and self-monitoring to enhance adherence and weight maintenance [^117Ay8bP].

Lifestyle interventions typically achieve **5–10% weight loss** [^112gpDTN] over 6–12 months, but long-term maintenance remains challenging due to physiological adaptations and environmental factors [^115CVhd7].

---

## Pharmacotherapy

Pharmacotherapy is recommended for patients with **BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with obesity-related comorbidities** who have not achieved sufficient weight loss with lifestyle interventions alone [^115GF7CL].

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Average weight loss** | **Common side effects** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Semaglutide (GLP-1 agonist) | Appetite suppression, delayed gastric emptying | 12–15% [^1111836v] | Gastrointestinal symptoms, nausea, vomiting |
| Tirzepatide (GIP/GLP-1 agonist) | Dual incretin effects | 15–20% [^1118ijBa] | Gastrointestinal symptoms, hypoglycemia |
| Phentermine/topiramate | Appetite suppression, energy expenditure increase | 8–10% [^114rU8dV] | Dry mouth, insomnia, cognitive effects |
| Naltrexone/bupropion | Appetite suppression, craving reduction | 5–8% [^notfound] | Nausea, headache, anxiety |
| Orlistat | Lipase inhibition, fat malabsorption | 3–5% [^1152M2pw] | Gastrointestinal side effects, steatorrhea |

---

Pharmacotherapy is generally **well tolerated** [^114rU8dV] but requires careful monitoring for side effects and contraindications. Long-term use is often necessary to maintain weight loss and metabolic benefits [^115L1kwt].

---

## Bariatric surgery

Bariatric surgery is the most effective and durable treatment for severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with comorbidities) [^113jvKue], producing **25–35% sustained weight loss** [^notfound] and significant improvement or remission of obesity-related comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Common procedures include:

- **Sleeve gastrectomy**: Restrictive procedure removing ~80% of the stomach.
- **Roux-en-Y gastric bypass**: Combined restrictive and malabsorptive procedure.
- **Adjustable gastric banding**: Less commonly used due to lower efficacy and higher complication rates.

Bariatric surgery carries risks such as nutritional deficiencies, surgical complications, and weight regain, necessitating **lifelong follow-up and nutritional supplementation** [^113LknVn].

---

## Emerging and experimental therapies

Several emerging therapies are under investigation, including:

- **Endoscopic procedures**: Minimally invasive options such as intragastric balloons, endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, and aspiration therapy [^notfound].
- **Combination pharmacotherapy**: Dual or triple hormone agonists targeting multiple pathways [^1118ijBa].
- **Precision medicine**: Individualized treatment based on genetic, metabolic, and behavioral phenotypes [^113bDK6t].

These therapies show promise but require further research to establish **long-term efficacy and safety** [^114YfJof].

---

## Individualized treatment planning

Effective obesity management requires **individualized treatment planning** that considers:

- **Patient characteristics**: Age, gender, BMI, comorbidities, and psychological factors [^117BF7Mj].
- **Patient preferences**: Willingness to adhere to lifestyle changes, pharmacotherapy, or surgical interventions [^112hoCwi].
- **Clinical guidelines**: Evidence-based recommendations from professional organizations (e.g. AACE, ADA, ASMBS) [^115GF7CL] [^115L1kwt] [^113YEcgS].

Regular monitoring, shared decision-making, and long-term follow-up are essential to optimize outcomes and maintain weight loss [^112myVY8].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Despite available treatments, several challenges persist:

- **Weight regain**: Common after lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy, necessitating long-term management strategies [^112myVY8].
- **Side effects**: Gastrointestinal symptoms, metabolic effects, and surgical complications [^1152M2pw].
- **Access and cost**: Limited insurance coverage, high cost of medications, and surgical procedures [^116N9juX].
- **Patient adherence**: Difficulty maintaining lifestyle changes and medication adherence over time [^111edVWy].

---

Obesity treatment requires a **comprehensive, individualized approach** encompassing lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery, with emerging therapies on the horizon. Long-term success depends on patient adherence, regular monitoring, and addressing physiological, psychological, and environmental factors.

### Drug therapy in obesity: a review of current and emerging treatments [^114pPybS]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

There is growing interest in drug therapies that can support weight loss and thereby reduce the prevalence of obesity and obesity-related complications. Intensive lifestyle interventions for people with obesity are associated with significant improvements in weight, amongst other parameters. The Look AHEAD trial observed a 5% reduction in body weight was associated with sustained improvements in key cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure and lipid profile. As such, many regulatory bodies use a 5% total weight loss to determine whether a drug induces a meaningful weight loss. Whilst the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved five drug therapies to treat obesity (orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, liraglutide), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved only three drug therapies (orlistat, bupropion/naltrexone and liraglutide) at the time of writing. Should medical therapies fail to achieve adequate weight loss, bariatric surgery is a final option for some people. Generally, these therapies support weight loss by either enhancing satiety, inhibiting hunger or increasing catabolism. However, with our evolving understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of obesity there are an increasing number of drug targets being identified, and it is anticipated that more medications will be approved by regulatory bodies such as the FDA and EMA to tackle the obesity epidemic.

In this article, we discuss the clinical trials investigating pharmacotherapy for people with obesity. However, we do not discuss real-world clinical data related to use of these drugs. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors (Fig. 1).

### Treat obesity to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113xgybb]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Obesity is a multifactorial chronic, relapsing progressive disease. It is a root cause of T2DM and harbors increased risk for diabetes-related complications. An obesity-centric treatment approach with sustained weigh loss helps target a key driver of T2DM much earlier in the disease course. Obesity management may also serve as a useful intervention in already established diabetes and its complications. Finally, obesity should be prevented or treated to prevent or treat type 2 diabetes and its complications.

### New drug targets for the treatment of obesity [^117CwqGE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

There is a huge void in the current pharmacological treatment options for obesity. This gap is surprising given the high prevalence and associated costs of obesity. Many factors have prevented active drug development, including the poor safety and efficacy of earlier antiobesity drugs. However, there are now several compelling targets on the horizon. The new generation of antiobesity drugs offers hope for the management of obesity, but no single agent is likely to be a panacea. Rather, obesity will need to be managed like many other chronic diseases, with combination therapies and long-term treatment in order to achieve sustained success. New targets have arisen as more research has been performed to understand the complex circuitry that controls energy homeostasis. The goal of this review is to discuss the latest pharmacological agents and strategies that are under development and that may eventually be used for the treatment of obesity.

### What is the pipeline for future medications for obesity? [^111beE8U]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Potential implications of the new pharmacotherapies on obesity management

The mean WL in clinical trials with the most efficacious new obesity pharmacotherapies ranges between 15% and 25% at 1 year (and it may be even higher for some agents that have not reached weight plateau at study completion). The efficacy of the new pharmacotherapies will allow clinicians to treat obesity towards individualised treatment targets, similar to what is happening with other chronic diseases such as T2D or dyslipidaemia. Moreover, the availability of multiple effective obesity pharmacotherapies with different mechanisms of action will provide clinicians the opportunity to select treatments based on patient preference, underlying comorbidities, medication safety profile and treatment response, with an aim to achieve the individualised WL targets, improve the overall health and/or the quality of life.

However, as with any WL intervention, there will be heterogeneity in treatment responses, even with the new molecules for obesity treatment. Around 10–30% of participants (especially people with T2D) achieved < 10% WL in clinical trials even with the higher doses of the new pharmacotherapies. Moreover, the percentage of participants in clinical trials who stopped the treatment due to AE was 5–15% with most of the new agents, and this percentage was up to 20–30% with some of GLP-1/glucagon RA in phase 2 trials – so a considerable proportion of people may not be able to tolerate the new obesity pharmacotherapies or may be unable to titrate them to the higher and most effective doses. The multiple pharmacological treatment options will enhance clinicians' ability to identify effective personalised regimens by trying a second medication or combining medications with synergistic or complimentary actions or even escalating treatment to bariatric surgery based on patient preference and underlying comorbidities.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^112sCPp8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Recently, the recognition of obesity as a complex disease that requires chronic management has become more widespread. There has also been a movement away from a focus on body mass index alone, and toward the management of obesity‐related comorbidities as well as excess weight. This article examines the current and emerging pharmacological options for weight management in people with overweight or obesity who have, or are at a high risk of, weight‐related comorbidities. In the, the current options for pharmacological weight management are phentermine (indicated for short‐term use only), orlistat, combined phentermine/topiramate extended release, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion and liraglutide 3.0 mg. Currently, orlistat, naltrexone/bupropion and liraglutide 3.0 mg are approved inurope. All of the above‐mentioned medications have shown weight‐loss efficacy versus placebo. Those approved for long‐term weight management have also been associated with improvements in weight‐related comorbidities, such as hypertension, prediabetes, diabetes or dyslipidaemia, or related biomarkers. As with all drugs, the safety and tolerability profiles of medications for weight management should be considered alongside their efficacy to ensure correct use. Additional medications for weight management that are in clinical development include bupropion/zonisamide and beloranib. The field of obesity treatment is advancing with a number of medications being recently approved, and with other pharmacological options emerging.

### Management of obesity: improvement of health-care training and systems for prevention and care [^113Le1Jx]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Although the caloric deficits achieved by increased awareness, policy, and environmental approaches have begun to achieve reductions in the prevalence of obesity in some countries, these approaches are insufficient to achieve weight loss in patients with severe obesity. Because the prevalence of obesity poses an enormous clinical burden, innovative treatment and care-delivery strategies are needed. Nonetheless, health professionals are poorly prepared to address obesity. In addition to biases and unfounded assumptions about patients with obesity, absence of training in behaviour-change strategies and scarce experience working within interprofessional teams impairs care of patients with obesity. Modalities available for the treatment of adult obesity include clinical counselling focused on diet, physical activity, and behaviour change, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. Few options, few published reports of treatment, and no large randomised trials are available for paediatric patients. Improved care for patients with obesity will need alignment of the intensity of therapy with the severity of disease and integration of therapy with environmental changes that reinforce clinical strategies. New treatment strategies, such as the use of technology and innovative means of health-care delivery that rely on health professionals other than physicians, represent promising options, particularly for patients with overweight and patients with mild to moderate obesity. The co-occurrence of undernutrition and obesity in low-income and middle-income countries poses unique challenges that might not be amenable to the same strategies as those that can be used in high-income countries.

### Review on obesity management: diet, exercise and pharmacotherapy [^116wqcVn]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Abstract

Currently, obesity is one of the largest risk factors for cardiometabolic disease in North American adults. Over the past few years, the prevalence of this disease has been steadily increasing. This article is the second article in a three-part series of reviews exploring current clinical guidelines and management strategies used in practice to mitigate the spread of obesity. Guidelines to help physicians manage patients with obesity have been released in Canada and Europe. They outline proper management and treatment for overweight and obese patients. Examples include changes in diet and exercise, behavioural therapy and the administration of antiobesity medications as first-line and second-line treatments. Management of obesity takes on a tiered approach, where first-line therapies include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise and second-line therapies include the use of antiobesity medications.

### Bariatric surgery in class I obesity: a position statement from the international federation for the surgery of obesity and metabolic disorders (IFSO) [^1166rQdX]. Obesity Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Class I obesity conveys an increased risk of comorbidities, impairs physical and mental health-related quality of life, and it is associated to an increased psychosocial burden, particularly in women. The need for effective and safe therapies for class I obesity is great and not yet met by nonsurgical approaches. Eligibility to bariatric surgery has been largely based on body mass index (BMI) cut points and limited to patients with more severe obesity levels. However, obese patients belonging to the same BMI class may have very different levels of health, risk, and impact of obesity on quality of life. Individual patients in class I obesity may have a comorbidity burden similar to, or greater than, patients with more severe obesity. Therefore, the denial of bariatric surgery to a patient with class I obesity suffering from a significant obesity-related health burden and not achieving weight control with nonsurgical therapy simply on the basis of the BMI level does not appear to be clinically justified. A clinical decision should be based on a more comprehensive evaluation of the patient's current global health and on a more reliable prediction of future morbidity and mortality. After a careful review of available data about safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in patients with class I obesity, this panel reached a consensus on ten clinical recommendations.

### Future therapies in obesity [^111KkjyS]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Although diet and exercise have been the cornerstone of therapy for obesity, efficacy is suboptimal and short lived. Surgical procedures are durable but invasive therapy for obesity. Supplemental therapies for obesity that are minimally invasive, low risk, and effective are needed. Several therapeutic options are being developed that offer obese patients and their health care providers alternatives to what is currently available.

### Combination therapy for obesity [^111D3WRD]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Obesity is a chronic disease with serious consequences and although lifestyle modification is considered first line treatment, it is often ineffective, especially in the long term. Relatively few people with obesity will undergo the most effective currently available treatment of bariatric surgery. Pharmacotherapy can bridge the gap between lifestyle modification and surgery, but many monotherapies have only modest efficacy or require high doses with unacceptable side effects. As with many other areas of medicine, combination therapy is now becoming accepted as a way of optimising efficacy for weight management, whilst minimising adverse effects. Combinations may use different medications with complementary modes of action. Currently available combination therapies are low-dose phentermine and sustained release topiramate and naltrexone/bupropion. Many other possibilities exist and promising options include combination of phentermine with a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor or combination of a glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist with other gut hormones or with a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor. The ultimate aim is to match the efficacy of bariatric surgery with a combination of medicines, but this remains an elusive goal.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for the evaluation and treatment of adults with obesity / adiposity-based chronic disease-2025 update [^114hQ2yj]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This 2025 consensus statement provides evidence-based visual guidance in graphic algorithms and a summary of evidence to assist health care professionals and adults with obesity and adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD) in shared decision making to improve care and achieve health goals.

Methods

AACE selected a task force of medical experts to update the 2016 AACE algorithm for the medical care of patients with obesity and align this algorithm update with related AACE clinical guidance. Details on surgical and procedural therapies for obesity treatment as well as the care of pediatric-aged patients are beyond the scope of this algorithm.

Results

The algorithm includes 11 sections: (1) principles of person-centered and complication-centric management of obesity/ABCD, (2) care model for people with obesity/ABCD: screening and diagnosis, (3) diagnosis: anthropometric component, (4) diagnosis: clinical component, (5) individualized treatment plan, therapeutic goals, and follow-up, (6) response to therapy and weight-loss targets for people with ABCD, (7) behavioral/lifestyle therapy for people with obesity/ABCD, (8) hierarchies of preferred medications for complication-centric care of people with ABCD, (9) lower-cost pharmacologic step therapy for ABCD, (10) medications for obesity: individualization of therapy, and (11) medications for obesity approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Conclusions

This 2025 algorithm for the medical care of adults with obesity underscores that ABCD is a complex, chronic disease that necessitates long-term treatment and care. Emphasis is placed on optimizing health rather than just weight reduction and achieving clinical goals other than a singular focus on body mass index (ie, complication-centric care). Choice of interventions and intensity of treatment should be individualized, taking disease severity or stage into account. Equality of care and reducing weight bias and stigma through a biopsychosocial chronic care model are critical and included throughout this clinical guidance statement.

### Addressing the challenge of obesity in primary care: a review of effective interventions and implementation strategies [^112BUxYs]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a worldwide health epidemic that significantly raises morbidity and mortality by means of related comorbidities including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. By means of effective interventions including behavioral therapies, comprehensive lifestyle modifications, and an increasing armamentarium of pharmacological agents capable of appreciable weight loss, primary care physicians are especially positioned to contribute significantly to the management of obesity. This review summarizes the most recent studies on behavioral interventions (such as cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing), pharmacological treatment options (including recently approved and emerging agents), and lifestyle changes (such diet and physical activity) in order to manage obesity in primary care environments. It also addresses the several challenges this field faces-including weight stigma and systematic barriers-as well as future directions for research and fair treatment of patients. At last, it emphasizes evidence-based approaches for putting these interventions into use to maximize patient results. More study is needed to guarantee that everyone has fair access to high-quality obesity treatment, understand the long-term consequences of new treatments, and enhance intervention procedures.

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: moving towards efficacy improvement [^1111836v]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic, recurring, progressive disease and a major public health problem associated with several other diseases that lead to disability, morbidity, and mortality. The prevalence of obesity has increased at pandemic levels, along with increasing weight-related comorbidities and deaths worldwide. Lifestyle interventions alone provide clinically significant long-term weight loss in only a small proportion of individuals, and bariatric surgery is not suitable or desirable for all patients. Historically, anti-obesity medications achieved a mean efficacy with weight loss between 5 and 10%, which significantly impacted several comorbidities and risk factors, but the average efficacy of these medications remained lower than that expected by both patients and health care professionals and eventually curbed long-term use. Moreover, there is no direct evidence on the impact of anti-obesity medications on cardiovascular outcomes. Semaglutide is a newer anti-obesity medication that changes the overall landscape, as phase 3 studies show a mean weight loss near the 15% threshold and significant proportions of patients with a weight loss of greater than 20%. In this review, we focus on the currently available anti-obesity medications, discuss the results of semaglutide, and present perspectives on the future of obesity treatment after semaglutide.

### Obesity consults – comprehensive obesity management in 2013: understanding the shifting paradigm [^111edVWy]. Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Although serious health concerns are associated with obesity, losing even 5% of body weight can produce clinically relevant effects. The initial goal of obesity management is usually a 5% to 10% weight reduction. Some people will sustain weight loss with changes in diet and exercise alone; however, these patients represent the minority, and a large percentage are unable to maintain weight loss over time. Patients and providers often wish to intensify obesity treatment, and therefore interest in new medications has been considerable. Until recently, only two antiobesity medications have received Food and Drug Administration approval for long-term use. In June and July of 2012, respectively, lorcaserin and combination phentermine/topiramate extended-release were approved for obesity therapy. The first section of this article reviews mechanisms, clinical trials, benefits and risks of available medications for treating obesity. Bariatric surgery is the next step for patients with a body mass index of ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with comorbidities, based on National Institutes of Health Clinical Guidelines. These procedures and their risks and benefits are reviewed in the second section. The final section presents common clinical scenarios with guidance for choosing among evidence-based recommendations for developing optimal, individualized, long-term strategies for patients with obesity.

### Weight loss strategies for treatment of obesity [^111HPBqE]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Obesity is one of the most serious and prevalent non-communicable diseases of the 21st century. It is also a patient-centered condition in which affected individuals seek treatment through a variety of commercial, medical and surgical approaches. Considering obesity as a chronic medical disease state helps to frame the concept of using a three-stepped intensification of care approach to weight management. As a foundation, all patients should be counseled on evidence-based lifestyle approaches that include diet, physical activity and behavior change therapies. At the second tier, two new pharmacological agents, phentermine-topiramate and lorcaserin, were approved in 2012 as adjuncts to lifestyle modification. The third step, bariatric surgery, has been demonstrated to be the most effective and long-term treatment for individuals with severe obesity or moderate obesity complicated by comorbid conditions that is not responsive to non-surgical approaches. By using a medical model, clinicians can provide more proactive and effective treatments in assisting their patients with weight loss.

### Effective obesity treatments [^113cqygY]. The American Psychologist (2007). Low credibility.

To curb the epidemic of obesity in the United States, revised Medicare policy allows support for efficacious obesity treatments. This review summarizes the evidence from rigorous randomized trials (9 lifestyle trials, 5 drug trials, and 2 surgical trials) on the efficacy and risk- benefit profile of lifestyle, drug, and surgical interventions aimed at promoting sustained (= 2 years) reductions in weight. Both lifestyle and drug interventions consistently produced an approximate 7-lb (3.2-kg) weight loss that was sustained for 2 years and was associated with improvements in diabetes, blood pressure, and/or cardiovascular risk factors. Surgical interventions have a less solid empirical base but offer promise for the promotion of significant and sustained weight reduction posttreatment in the morbidly obese but with possible significant short-term side effects. In summary, there is strong and consistent support from rigorous randomized trials that lifestyle or drug interventions result in modest weight loss with minimal risks but disproportionate clinical benefit. Combinations of lifestyle, drug, and, where appropriate, surgical interventions may be the most efficacious approach to achieving sustained weight loss for the widest diversity of patients.

Known differences in mechanism and efficacy, along with risks and patient priorities (e.g. weight loss vs. metabolic/diabetes goals) already inform the choice of surgical procedure. However, many questions remain, including the following: How much weight loss is required for health benefits? What is the effect of different interventional methods on long-term outcomes? What mechanisms underlie the heterogeneous responses? Further, regarding diabetes, Is the optimal timing for treatment the same or different from obesity? Are β-cells preserved or do they even grow? Why do not we see the same efficacy and durability of response for other obesity-related pathologies (e.g. hypertension) as for glycemic control? Ongoing randomized clinical trials promise to answer many questions regarding patient selection, optimal procedure, when to intervene, and where initial and chronic care should be delivered.

### A closer look at ACC / AHA and ESC Guidelines for managing obesity and Overweight in adults [^115qjJ4t]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks and future perspectives: a viewpoint

Overall, both guidelines highlight the importance of addressing overweight and obesity to prevent CVD. One key difference is ESC guidelines recommend a comprehensive lifestyle intervention that includes dietary modification, increased physical activity, and behavioral support, whereas the ACC/AHA guidelines recommend a healthy lifestyle that includes counseling, caloric restriction, regular physical activity, and weight management. The ESC guidelines also provide specific recommendations for weight-loss medications and bariatric surgery in select patients with obesity and high CVD risk, whereas the ACC/AHA guidelines do not have specific recommendations for these interventions.

However, what is missing from these guidelines? While both the ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines provide recommendations on managing obesity and overweight, there are some areas where they may be lacking. Personalized approaches to weight management and addressing social and environmental determinants of obesity may not be fully considered. Early intervention and addressing childhood obesity are also areas that may require more emphasis. Despite the existence of evidence-based guidelines for managing obesity in adults, implementing lifestyle interventions in routine clinical practice remains a challenge. While randomized controlled trials provide important information about the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for weight management and are valuable in guiding the guidelines, the programmatic approaches used in these trials may not always be feasible or sustainable in routine clinical practice. For example, lifestyle interventions delivered in academic centers may require significant resources and infrastructure, which may not be available in primary care settings. Thus, there is a need for evidence-based tools that can facilitate weight loss and weight loss maintenance, easily implementable and address the challenges associated with long-term weight management in routine clinical practice. The development and evaluation of such tools should also be a priority for future research in this area.

### Obesity: pathophysiology and Management [^115CVhd7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Obesity continues to be among the top health concerns across the globe. Despite our failure to contain the high prevalence of obesity, we now have a better understanding of its pathophysiology, and how excess adiposity leads to type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle modification is recommended as the cornerstone of obesity management, but many patients do not achieve long-lasting benefits due to difficulty with adherence as well as physiological and neurohormonal adaptation of the body in response to weight loss. Fortunately, 5 drug therapies-orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine/topiramate, and naltrexone/bupropion-are available for long-term weight management. Additionally, several medical devices are available for short-term and long-term use. Bariatric surgery yields substantial and sustained weight loss with resolution of type 2 diabetes, although due to the high cost and a small risk of serious complications, it is generally recommended for patients with severe obesity. Benefit-to-risk balance should guide treatment decisions.

### Assessment and lifestyle management of patients with obesity: clinical recommendations from systematic reviews [^117Ay8bP]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Even though one-third of US adults are obese, identification and treatment rates for obesity remain low. Clinician engagement is vital to provide guidance and assistance to patients who are overweight or obese to address the underlying cause of many chronic diseases.

Objectives

To describe current best practices for assessment and lifestyle management of obesity and to demonstrate how the updated Guidelines (2013) for Managing Overweight and Obesity in Adults based on a systematic evidence review sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) can be applied to an individual patient.

Evidence Review

Systematic evidence review conducted for the Guidelines (2013) for Managing Overweight and Obesity in Adults supports treatment recommendations in 5 areas (risk assessment, weight loss benefits, diets for weight loss, comprehensive lifestyle intervention approaches, and bariatric surgery); for areas outside this scope, recommendations are supported by other guidelines (for obesity, 1998 NHLBI-sponsored obesity guidelines and those from the National Center for Health and Clinical Excellence and Canadian and US professional societies such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American Society of Bariatric Physicians; for physical activity recommendations, the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans); a PubMed search identified recent systematic reviews covering depression and obesity, motivational interviewing for weight management, metabolic adaptation to weight loss, and obesity pharmacotherapy.

Findings

The first step in obesity management is to screen all adults for overweight and obesity. A medical history should be obtained assessing for the multiple determinants of obesity, including dietary and physical activity patterns, psychosocial factors, weight-gaining medications, and familial traits. Emphasis on the complications of obesity to identify patients who will benefit the most from treatment is more useful than using body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) alone for treatment decisions. The Guidelines (2013) recommend that clinicians offer patients who would benefit from weight loss (either BMI of ≥ 30 with or without comorbidities or ≥ 25 along with 1 comorbidity or risk factor) intensive, multicomponent behavioral intervention. Some clinicians do this within their primary care practices; others refer patients for these services. Weight loss is achieved by creating a negative energy balance through modification of food and physical activity behaviors. The Guidelines (2013) endorse comprehensive lifestyle treatment by intensive intervention. Treatment can be implemented either in a clinician's office or by referral to a registered dietitian or commercial weight loss program. Weight loss of 5% to 10% is the usual goal. It is not necessary for patients to attain a BMI of less than 25 to achieve a health benefit.

Conclusions and Relevance

Screening and assessment of patients for obesity followed by initiation or referral of treatment should be incorporated into primary care practice settings. If clinicians can identify appropriate patients for weight loss efforts and provide informed advice and assistance on how to achieve and sustain modest weight loss, they will be addressing the underlying driver of many comorbidities and can have a major influence on patients' health status.

American Medical Association (AMA) role in obesity — Founded in 1847, the AMA is described as the largest national association that convenes 190+ state and specialty medical societies and other stakeholders and leverages existing channels to advance priorities that include promoting awareness that obesity is a treatable chronic disease with evidence-based treatment options, engaging in advocacy at the state and federal level, addressing health disparities, stigma, and bias, addressing the lack of insurance coverage for evidence-based treatments including intensive lifestyle intervention, anti-obesity pharmacotherapy, and bariatric and metabolic surgery, and acknowledging increasing obesity rates in children, adolescents, and adults.

### Childhood obesity: a review of current and future management options [^111rJ5ad]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Obesity is becoming increasingly prevalent in paediatric populations worldwide. In addition to increasing prevalence, the severity of obesity is also continuing to rise. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a worrying trend and highlight one of the most significant challenges to public health. Childhood obesity affects multiple organs in the body and is associated with both significant morbidity and ultimately premature mortality. The prevalence of complications associated with obesity, including dyslipidaemia, hypertension, fatty liver disease and psychosocial complications are becoming increasingly prevalent within the paediatric populations. Treatment guidelines currently focus on intervention with lifestyle and behavioural modifications, with pharmacotherapy and surgery reserved for patients who are refractory to such treatment. Research into adult obesity has established pharmacological novel therapies, which have been approved and established in clinical practice; however, the research and implementation of such therapies in paediatric populations have been lagging behind. Despite the relative lack of widespread research in comparison to the adult population, newer therapies are being trialled, which should allow a greater availability of treatment options for childhood obesity in the future. This review summarizes the current evidence for the management of obesity in terms of medical and surgical options. Both future therapeutic agents and those which cause weight loss but have an alternative indication are also included and discussed as part of the review. The review summarizes the most recent research for each intervention and demonstrates the potential efficacy and limitations of each treatment option.

Algorithm 1 — Principles of person-centered and complication-centric management of obesity/adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD) — emphasizes to "Emphasize whole-person health and de-emphasize BMI and weight-centric approaches in the treatment of individuals with obesity/ABCD". It directs that "People with obesity/ABCD should be evaluated by an empathetic trained health care professional to include both the anthropometric and clinical components of the diagnosis and should be followed long-term by a health care professional who will manage weight loss and assure that treatment goals for optimizing health are achieved". For diagnosis, "For the anthropometric component of the diagnosis, obesity is evaluated using BMI with clinical confirmation of excess adiposity, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, and assessment of body composition when clinically needed". Clinically, "For the clinical component of the diagnosis and disease staging of ABCD, assess the risk, presence, and severity of ORCD. Include internalized weight bias and impact of stigmatization as part of clinical staging". Care planning instructs to "Involve the individual in shared decision-making to determine personalized health goals while targeting sufficient weight loss to achieve clinical treatment goals for health" and to "Develop treatment plans involving lifestyle, pharmacologic, and surgical options using an individualized approach that considers complications and their severity, patient preferences, social determinants of health, psychological disorders, and access to care". Treatment goals state, "The goals of therapy are to improve health and the quality of life by preventing or treating ORCD, not solely defined by the loss of a specific amount of weight", and intensity guidance states, "Therapy, beyond behavioral/lifestyle alone, should be considered at all stages of ABCD (stages 1, 2, or 3) when needed to improve the health of patients".

### Perceptions of anti-obesity medications among people with obesity and healthcare providers in the US: findings from the OBSERVE study [^113bAQQz]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The established negative health impact of the US obesity endemic necessitates the implementation of effective, scalable treatments. Guideline‐recommended treatment options for obesity include a combination of lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, and/or metabolic and bariatric surgery. However, previous research has found that less than 1% of people with obesity (PwO) in the United States used antiobesity medications (AOMs) between 2015 and 2018. Recently, there have been considerable advances in pharmacotherapy for obesity, with multiple new AOMs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for long‐term treatment of this chronic disease. Advancements in the understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity and the effectiveness of new and emerging AOMs are ushering in a modern era of obesity care. Despite guideline recommendations for multimodal obesity care, the low use of AOMs remains a significant barrier for patients. Poor insurance coverage and high costs are major factors limiting access to these treatments. Additionally, some health care providers (HCPs) may be reluctant to prescribe AOMs due to limited clinical experience and knowledge gaps. When HCPs are hesitant to prescribe AOMs, PwO may remain unaware of pharmacotherapy options, further hindering their access to appropriate care.

Given the substantial health care and societal burden of obesity and rapidly evolving treatment landscape, there is an increasing need to adopt pharmacotherapy as a scalable component of evidence‐based multimodal obesity management. However, existing perceptions regarding obesity and its treatment among PwO and HCPs may continue to impede optimal management of the disease. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate current perceptions of obesity and obesity treatment, including AOMs and potential drivers and barriers to AOM use, among PwO and HCPs in the United States.

### Factors influencing patients to choose one obesity treatment over another: a qualitative study [^116jCEDm]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Taking patient preferences for treatment options into consideration when identifying their treatment plan plays an important role in the successful management of chronic disease in patients with obesity complications. Integrating patients' wishes into decision-making includes a patient-centred approach that can improve the effectiveness of interventions. This is valuable for patients with obesity challenges because this collaborative decision-making process helps all parties consider factors that improve each patient's quality of life. After triangulating the data for all participants in each of the three methodologies of individual interviews, Photovoice, and World Café, four main themes emerged around what impacts decision-making for treatments. They were structural factors, physical and emotional impact, knowledge of HCP and patients, and support. Inaccessibility to care and lack of support are challenges for patients in managing their disease. This study demonstrates the importance of developing effective treatment plans with clear information, ensuring access to all options for obesity treatment options, and providing support to help people manage their disease.

### Clinical considerations regarding the use of obesity pharmacotherapy in adolescents with obesity [^113cs5Y1]. Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

A growing number of youth suffer from obesity and in particular severe obesity for which intensive lifestyle intervention does not adequately reduce excess adiposity. A treatment gap exists wherein effective treatment options for an adolescent with severe obesity include intensive lifestyle modification or metabolic and bariatric surgery while the application of obesity pharmacotherapy remains largely underutilized. These youth often present with numerous obesity-related comorbid diseases, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, prediabetes/type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, musculoskeletal problems, and psychosocial issues such as depression, anxiety, and social stigmatization. Current pediatric obesity treatment algorithms for pediatric primary care providers focus primarily on intensive lifestyle intervention with escalation of treatment intensity through four stages of intervention. Although a recent surge in the number of Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for obesity treatment has emerged in adults, pharmacotherapy options for youth remain limited. Recognizing treatment and knowledge gaps related to pharmacological agents and the urgent need for more effective treatment strategies in this population, discussed here are the efficacy, safety, and clinical application of obesity pharmacotherapy in youth with obesity based on current literature. Legal ramifications, informed consent regulations, and appropriate off-label use of these medications in pediatrics are included, focusing on prescribing practices and prescriber limits.

### Drug therapy in obesity: a review of current and emerging treatments [^115LAbpr]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

As our understanding of obesity and the associated hormonal changes continues to improve, further drug developments and therapies will be introduced. Currently, evidence is lacking to introduce many of these therapies into routine practice, though early results are promising. Within the rapidly developing world of diabetes pharmacotherapy, an increasing number of drug targets have been identified and these drugs are often associated with clinically significant weight loss. In this article we have highlighted important clinical trial data that support the pharmacotherapy of obesity. However, an important limitation is the omission of real-world data, which are often different from clinical trial results, partly because of varying patient populations. As further clinical trials continue, it is anticipated that more drugs will be approved for use in people with obesity to support weight loss before often riskier interventions such as bariatric surgery are required.

### Bariatric and metabolic surgery: a shift in eligibility and success criteria [^114JFQbF]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

The obesity epidemic, combined with the lack of available and effective treatments for morbid obesity, is a scientific and public health priority. Worldwide, bariatric and metabolic surgeries are increasingly being performed to effectively aid weight loss in patients with severe obesity, as well as because of the favourable metabolic effects of the procedures. The positive effects of bariatric surgery, especially with respect to improvements in type 2 diabetes mellitus, have expanded the eligibility criteria for metabolic surgery to patients with diabetes mellitus and a BMI of 30–35 kg/m². However, the limitations of BMI, both in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients, need to be considered, particularly for determining the actual adiposity and fat distribution of the patients following weight loss. Understanding the characteristics shared by bariatric and metabolic surgeries, as well as their differential aspects and outcomes, is required to enhance patient benefits and operative achievements. For a holistic approach that focuses on the multifactorial effects of bariatric and metabolic surgery to be possible, a paradigm shift that goes beyond the pure semantics is needed. Such a shift could lead to profound clinical implications for eligibility criteria and the definition of success of the surgical approach.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^117719Wo]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Recently, the recognition of obesity as a complex disease that requires chronic management has become more widespread. There has also been a movement away from a focus on body mass index alone, and toward the management of obesity-related comorbidities as well as excess weight. This article examines the current and emerging pharmacological options for weight management in people with overweight or obesity who have, or are at a high risk of, weight-related comorbidities. In the USA, the current options for pharmacological weight management are phentermine (indicated for short-term use only), orlistat, combined phentermine/topiramate extended release, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion and liraglutide 3.0mg. Currently, orlistat, naltrexone/bupropion and liraglutide 3.0mg are approved in Europe. All of the above-mentioned medications have shown weight-loss efficacy versus placebo. Those approved for long-term weight management have also been associated with improvements in weight-related comorbidities, such as hypertension, prediabetes, diabetes or dyslipidaemia, or related biomarkers. As with all drugs, the safety and tolerability profiles of medications for weight management should be considered alongside their efficacy to ensure correct use. Additional medications for weight management that are in clinical development include bupropion/zonisamide and beloranib. The field of obesity treatment is advancing with a number of medications being recently approved, and with other pharmacological options emerging.

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: moving towards efficacy improvement [^1169xVzW]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

The amount of weight loss that is expected by patients with obesity and healthcare professionals is high and difficult to achieve. Bridging the gap between weight loss goals and actual results by improving the efficacy of treatment is imperative. At the same time, it is important to discuss the fact that even smaller amounts of weight loss could lead to health benefits; otherwise, the discontinuation rate of obesity treatments will continue to increase.

A recent proposal for a new classification of obesity could help clinicians and patients to set more realistic goals, which should be discussed individually. The classification based on weight history introduces the term "controlled obesity" for individuals with weight losses higher than 10% (or 15% if BMI over 40 kg/m²) and is based on the maximal weight achieved in life (MWAL) and the weight trajectory. The classification distinguishes patients with "unchanged" (if close to the MWAL, or less than 5%), "reduced" (if 5–10% weight loss is achieved) and "controlled" obesity (> 10%) if BMI is between 30–40. For individuals with higher BMIs, the threshold for reduced BMI is > 10%, and the threshold for controlled BMI is > 15%. It is important to point out, however, that this proposal is not intended to be a guideline but an ancillary tool to set targets, and the percentage of weight loss achieved should be mentioned in the classification as well.

### Long-term pharmacotherapy for obesity and overweight [^1152M2pw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide prevalence rates of obesity and overweight are rising and safe and effective treatment strategies are urgently needed. A number of anti-obesity agents have been studied in short-term clinical trials, but long-term efficacy and safety need to be established.

Objectives

To assess/compare the effects and safety of approved anti-obesity medications in clinical trials of at least one-year duration.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Current Science Meta-register of Controlled Trials, and reference lists of original studies and reviews were searched. Date of last search was December 2002. Drug manufacturers and two obesity experts were contacted in to detect unpublished trials. No language restrictions were imposed.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomised controlled weight loss and weight maintenance trials of approved anti-obesity agents that 1) enrolled adult overweight or obese patients, 2) included a placebo control group or compared two or more anti-obesity drugs 3) used an intention-to-treat analysis, and 4) had a minimum follow-up period of one year. Abstracts and pseudo-randomised trials were not included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed all potentially relevant citations for inclusion and methodological quality. The primary outcome measure was weight loss.

Main Results

Of the eight anti-obesity agents investigated, only orlistat and sibutramine trials met inclusion criteria. Eleven orlistat weight loss studies (four of which reported a second year weight maintenance phase) and five sibutramine studies (three weight loss and two weight maintenance trials) were included. Attrition rates averaged 33% during the weight loss phase of orlistat trials and 43% in sibutramine studies. All patients received lifestyle modification as a co-intervention. Compared to placebo, orlistat-treated patients lost 2.7 kg (95% CI: 2.3 kg to 3.1 kg) or 2.9% (95% CI: 2.3% to 3.4%) more weight and patients on sibutramine experienced 4.3 kg (95% CI: 3.6 kg to 4.9 kg) or 4.6% (95% CI: 3.8% to 5.4%) greater weight loss. The number of patients achieving ten percent or greater weight loss was 12% (95% CI: 8% to 16%) higher with orlistat and 15% (95% CI: 4% to 27%) higher with sibutramine therapy. Weight loss maintenance results were similar. Orlistat caused gastrointestinal side effects and sibutramine was associated with small increases in blood pressure and pulse rate.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Studies evaluating the long-term efficacy of anti-obesity agents are limited to orlistat and sibutramine. Both drugs appear modestly effective in promoting weight loss; however, interpretation is limited by high attrition rates. Longer and more methodologically rigorous studies of anti-obesity drugs that are powered to examine endpoints such as mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are required to fully evaluate any potential benefit of such agents.

Obesity pharmacotherapy risk management — understanding which medications have the greatest risk of weight gain, using lower risk medications as first-line options, and monitoring closely for weight gain when higher risk medications are required should be considered standard of care. This requires patient-specific shared-decision making and ongoing care, and patients with obesity should be screened for obesity-related co-occurring diseases; when possible, treatment should be initiated, noting that many AOMs can reduce obesity and resolve many of these complications such as type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Pharmacological therapies for obesity [^115ux8mQ]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Pharmacological therapy for obesity is in transition. Historically, there have been few effective agents, and many have been with-drawn because of unacceptable side effects. Current options include three medications approved by the FDA for the treatment of obesity: phentermine, sibutramine and orlistat. Phentermine and sibutramine suppress appetite and promote thermogenesis, and orlistat blocks fat digestion and absorption in the gut. Several drugs approved for other indications often promote weight loss, including bupropion, metformin, topiramate and zonisamide; they have been used empirically for treatment of obesity and to counter the weight-promoting effects of other medications. Expanding knowledge of the physiological mechanisms of body weight regulation has revealed new molecular targets, and more than 150 novel agents are under active development. Because weight regulation is complex, and redundant systems protect against perceived starvation, optimal treatment of obesity will likely require combinations of therapies. The accelerating emergence of new medications will facilitate the development of such effective combinations.

### New horizons. A new paradigm for treating to target with second-generation obesity medications [^115n7Jmv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction: A New Horizon for Obesity Medicine

The advent of a new paradigm in obesity care has transpired due to recent developments in obesity medicine combined with a better understanding of obesity as a chronic disease. At the core of this transformation is the introduction of a medication, with additional drugs under development, having a degree of efficacy and safety that substantially surpasses antecedent therapies. Despite the huge burden of patient suffering and social costs exacted by obesity, the disease is underdiagnosed and there is widespread lack of access to evidence-based therapy. In this sense, healthcare systems have failed our patients and our societies. Hopefully, as will be discussed, new therapeutic tools will change the way clinicians approach the disease and enable a new paradigm of care that will more effectively benefit larger numbers of patients.

Three new concepts will be developed. The first pertains to the designation of second-generation medications for the treatment of obesity. In general, a second-generation medication should entail a considerable advance in efficacy and/or safety compared to previous medications for a disease which, in effect, facilitates a significant change in treatment and ability of clinicians to improve patients' health. In addition, the therapeutic effect should be sustained when applied to chronic diseases given their long-term natural history. A definition specific for the pharmacotherapy of obesity will be proposed based on the degree of efficacy required to substantially improve patient outcomes to a degree than can be transformative for obesity care. This will be discussed in the context of a recently approved medication that meets the defined criteria for a second-generation obesity medication together with others in development with this same potential.

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: an update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^114Kxq6X]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Obesity is an epidemic and a public health threat. Medical weight management remains one of the options for the treatment of excess weight and recent advances have revolutionized how we treat, and more importantly how we will be treating obesity in the near future. Metreleptin and Setmelanotide are currently indicated for rare obesity syndromes, and 5 other medications (orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, liraglutide, semaglutide) are approved for non-syndromic obesity. Tirzepatide is about to be approved, and other drugs, with exciting novel mechanisms of action primarily based on incretins, are currently being investigated in different phases of clinical trials. The majority of these compounds act centrally, to reduce appetite and increase satiety, and secondarily, in the gastrointestinal tract to slow gastric emptying. All anti-obesity medications improve weight and metabolic parameters, with variable potency and effects depending on the specific drug. The currently available data do not support a reduction in hard cardiovascular outcomes, but it is almost certain that such data are forthcoming in the very near future. The choice of the anti-obesity medication needs to take into consideration the patient's clinical and biochemical profile, co-morbidities, and drug contra-indications, as well as expected degree of weight loss and improvements in cardio-renal and metabolic risk. It also remains to be seen whether precision medicine may offer personalized solutions to individuals with obesity, and whether it may represent the future of medical weight management along with the development of novel, very potent, anti-obesity medications currently in the pipeline.

Potential clinical implications and challenges with the new obesity pharmacotherapies

A new era in obesity management

Tirzepatide has received FDA and EMA approval for chronic weight management and results in ≥ 20% mean WL in people without T2D. Multiple other molecules (including combinations of entero-pancreatic hormones and oral GLP-1 RA) are in late phase clinical trials as potential obesity treatments, leading to WL that approaches the efficacy of bariatric surgery. Overall, a new era in obesity care is starting, as multiple effective obesity pharmacotherapies with different mechanisms of action and routes of administration may become available over next years. However, a number of challenges will need to be addressed over next years including a better understanding of the full potential of benefits and risks with the new obesity pharmacotherapies and ensuring wide and equal access for people living with obesity.

### Better together: antiobesity medications and bariatric surgery for the management of obesity [^114YfJof]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

As evidence for the efficacy and safety of the new generation of obesity medications accumulates, it is timely to reconsider the approach to obesity treatment. Although bariatric surgery remains the most effective and durable intervention, new medications are rapidly gaining popularity because they are perceived as a more approachable and reversible option. Long-term studies comparing the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery with those of new antiobesity medications are lacking, and would be informative. However, rather than viewing these highly effective and complementary treatment approaches as inevitable competitors, learning in whom, when, and how to combine them could be even more valuable and relevant to patient care.

Obesity is a highly stigmatized chronic, relapsing disease. To treat it optimally, lessons from other chronic conditions could be adopted. As in cancer care, combining obesity treatment modalities such as pharmacotherapy, endoscopic therapies, use of devices, and bariatric surgery may well be the way forward, either before surgery (neoadjuvant) or after operation (adjuvant or rescue). How to accomplish this is underinvestigated, as highlighted by the systematic reviewof the available evidence demonstrating the research gaps and paucity of high-quality RCTs. Resolving this will require evidence to fill the gaps in understanding of the fundamental principles of obesity care that have been exposed by the emergence of more effective treatment approaches.

One such example is: what is the appropriate treatment target? Is it loss of a certain percentage of bodyweight (say 15%) — a relative number linked to an arbitrary (and variable) starting point?Is it reversal of obesity-associated health and functional impairments? But would that be enough to prevent their subsequent progression? Is it a bodyweight (BMI) or anthropometric measure of adiposity within the range deemed 'normal' or 'low risk'? But how would this risk be defined, given that estimates of population-level risk are not suitable for individuals?

An international consensusby a multidisciplinary team of experts in obesity management has provided some useful and authoritative recommendations, and a practical blueprint for obesity care to temporarily navigate this uncertainty. However, it is clear that high-quality research is imperative to inform evidence-based care. Clinical trials to establish the long-term safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of multimodal strategies are urgently needed, as well as studies that inform optimal patient selection for different treatment approaches.

### Weight loss pharmacotherapy: current and future therapies [^113LknVn]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The rising prevalence of obesity is of major concern. There are currently 5 Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for the treatment of obesity: orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, liraglutide 3.0 mg, and semaglutide 2.4 mg. Surgical options such as bariatric surgery and endoscopic surgery induce more durable weight loss than pharmacotherapy or lifestyle interventions alone. However, patients often experience weight regain and weight loss plateau after surgery. The addition of multimodal or multihormonal pharmacotherapy is a promising tool to address these challenges. The optimal timing of obesity pharmacotherapy with surgical and endoscopic interventions requires further investigation.

Pediatric obesity care and trials — The text states that children with obesity can be treated safely and effectively and that using age as the reason for waiting to treat a child with obesity is harmful medically and psychologically. It emphasizes reliance on best practice and clinical expertise while additional therapies are limited to adults, and that children should be included in trials concurrently with adults; it notes adult treatments often precede pediatric trials, spawning off-label use, and calls for advocacy and payor coverage. System-level needs include treating obesity at diagnosis with advanced therapies, developing a robust primary and specialty care system, leveraging obesity medicine specialists, and shifting to multiple models of care tailored to communities; increased education is needed for a disease that affects 30% of our children. In summary, pediatric obesity is characterized by complex pathophysiology, chronicity requiring lifelong management using multiple treatment modalities, and disease heterogeneity with few known treatment predictors, and pediatric obesity medicine specialists are positioned to evaluate and lead patient management across the therapeutic spectrum.

### Treatment options for severe obesity in the pediatric population: current limitations and future opportunities [^111qpAoD]. Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Severe obesity is the only obesity classification increasing in prevalence among children and adolescents. Treatment options that produce meaningful and sustained weight loss and comorbidity resolution are urgently needed.

Methods

The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of the current treatment options for pediatric severe obesity and offer suggestions regarding future opportunities for accelerating the development and evaluation of innovative treatment strategies.

Results

At present, there are three treatment options for youth with severe obesity: lifestyle modification therapy, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. Lifestyle modification therapy can be useful for improving many chronic disease risk factors and comorbid conditions but often fails to achieve clinically meaningful and sustainable weight loss. Pharmacotherapy holds promise as an effective adjunctive treatment but remains in the primordial stages of development in the pediatric population. Bariatric surgery provides robust weight loss and risk factor/comorbidity improvements but is accompanied by higher risks and lower uptake compared to lifestyle modification therapy and pharmacotherapy. New areas worth pursuing include combination pharmacotherapy, device therapy, identification of predictors of response aimed at precision treatment, and interventions in the postbariatric surgical setting to improve long-term outcomes.

Conclusions

Treating pediatric severe obesity effectively and safely is extremely challenging. Some progress has been made, but substantially more effort and innovation are needed in the future to combat this serious and ongoing medical and public health issue.

### Intensive lifestyle intervention for obesity: principles, practices, and results [^112gpDTN]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Using the Guidelines for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults as a framework, this article reviews intensive lifestyle interventions for weight loss. The Guidelines recommend a minimum of 6 months of high-intensity, comprehensive lifestyle intervention, consisting of a reduced-calorie diet, increased physical activity, and behavior therapy. Persons with obesity typically lose approximately 8 kg (approximately 8% of initial weight) with this approach, accompanied by improvements in health and quality of life. To prevent weight regain, the Guidelines recommend a 1-year weight loss maintenance program that includes at least monthly counseling with a trained interventionist. Lifestyle interventions usually are delivered in-person; however, treatment increasingly is being disseminated through community- and commercial-based programs, as well as delivered by telephone, Internet, and smartphone platforms. These latter modalities expand treatment reach but usually produce smaller weight losses than in-person interventions. The review concludes with an examination of challenges in weight management.

### Approach to obesity treatment in primary care: a review [^112myVY8]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Importance

More than 40% of US adults have obesity, which increases the risks for multiple chronic diseases and premature mortality. Historically, nonsurgical interventions often have not led to sufficient weight loss and maintenance to improve health, but highly effective antiobesity medications (AOMs) have recently become available, and additional effective therapeutics are under development. Given that most medical care for adults with obesity is delivered in primary care settings, guidance for integrating weight-management approaches is needed.

Observations

Lifestyle interventions can lead to a mean weight loss of 2% to 9% of initial weight at 1 year and increase the likelihood of weight loss of 5% or more, but weight regain over time is common even with continued treatment. Adjunctive treatments, including AOMs and surgical approaches, can lead to larger, more sustained weight loss and improvements in numerous obesity-associated medical conditions. Highly effective AOMs, including nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapies, induce mean weight loss of 15% or more. Barriers to intervention, including access to care, have a disproportionate influence on populations most affected by obesity and its consequences.

Conclusions and Relevance

Primary care clinicians play a vital role in the assessment, management, and support of patients with obesity. With careful clinical assessment and shared decision-making, a flexible treatment plan can be developed that reflects evidence of treatment efficacy, patient preference, and feasibility of implementation. Adjunctive therapies to lifestyle interventions, including more effective pharmacotherapeutics for obesity, offer hope to patients and the potential for considerable improvements in health and quality of life.

### Lifestyle modification approaches for the treatment of obesity in adults [^114xjnoy]. The American Psychologist (2020). Medium credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has recommended that primary care clinicians screen all adults for obesity and provide those affected intensive multicomponent behavioral interventions. Approximately 95 million U.S. adults qualify for such care, also referred to as lifestyle modification. Using the Guidelines (2013) for Managing Overweight and Obesity in Adults (hereafter, Obesity Guidelines) as a framework, this article reviews the principal components of comprehensive lifestyle modification, which include diet, physical activity, and behavior therapy. To lose weight, the Obesity Guidelines recommend participation for 6 months in high-intensity programs that provide 14 or more counseling sessions with a trained interventionist. When provided face-to-face individual or group treatment, participants lose up to 8 kg (8% of weight) in 6 months and experience improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors and quality of life. To prevent weight regain, the Obesity Guidelines recommend participation for 1 year in weight-loss-maintenance programs that provide at least monthly counseling. High levels of physical activity, frequent monitoring of body weight, and consumption of a reduced-calorie diet are associated with long-term weight loss. Investigators currently are seeking to increase the availability of lifestyle modification by delivering it in community-based programs, as well as on digital platforms (e.g. Internet and Smartphone). Digitally delivered programs lower costs and expand treatment reach; their efficacy is likely to improve further with the addition of new technologies for monitoring food intake, activity, and weight. Ultimately, to improve long-term weight management, individual lifestyle counseling must be joined with collective and institutional efforts to improve the nation's eating and activity environments.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^115GF7CL]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Pharmacological management of obesity improves outcomes and decreases the risk of obesity-related complications. This American Gastroenterological Association guideline is intended to support practitioners in decisions about pharmacological interventions for overweight and obesity.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of content experts and guideline methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework to prioritize clinical questions, identify patient-centered outcomes, and conduct an evidence synthesis of the following agents: semaglutide 2.4 mg, liraglutide 3.0 mg, phentermine-topiramate extended-release (ER), naltrexone-bupropion ER, orlistat, phentermine, diethylpropion, and Gelesis100 oral superabsorbent hydrogel. The guideline panel used the evidence-to-decision framework to develop recommendations for the pharmacological management of obesity and provided implementation considerations for clinical practice.

Results

The guideline panel made 9 recommendations. The panel strongly recommended the use of pharmacotherapy in addition to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight and obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m², or ≥ 27 kg/m² with weight-related complications) who have an inadequate response to lifestyle interventions. The panel suggested the use of semaglutide 2.4 mg, liraglutide 3.0 mg, phentermine-topiramate ER, and naltrexone-bupropion ER (based on moderate certainty evidence), and phentermine and diethylpropion (based on low certainty evidence), for long-term management of overweight and obesity. The guideline panel suggested against the use of orlistat. The panel identified the use of Gelesis100 oral superabsorbent hydrogel as a knowledge gap.

Conclusions

In adults with overweight and obesity who have an inadequate response to lifestyle interventions alone, long-term pharmacological therapy is recommended, with multiple effective and safe treatment options.

### Medications for the treatment of obesity in adolescents [^111G2v4r]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Future treatment

Just as obesity is a multi-faceted disease, future treatment for adolescents with obesity could be accomplished through multiple modalities including the use of multiple medications. While bariatric surgery is the most effective and durable modality for weight loss long term, the availability and accessibility of bariatric surgery remains limited in the adolescent population. Combination drug therapies could be an effective way to target obesity due to the variability in mechanisms associated with each of the drugs that could lead to potential synergy. Combination therapy could also allow for lower doses of each medication to mitigate side effects. Drugs currently under investigation include centrally acting agents, gut hormones and incretin targets, leptin analogs, dual action GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonists, and lipase inhibitors. Many of these drugs have shown weight loss in either animal or human studies, and targeting obesity is a potential effect.

Currently, pharmacotherapy to treat adolescents with obesity is very limited. Obesity is highly prevalent worldwide, and the percentage of affected individuals is rising, making obesity a disease that needs to be more highly addressed. More research is needed to develop additional pharmacotherapy for the treatment of obesity. In the last 20 years, the FDA has approved 208 drugs for cancer, 118 for cardiovascular disease, 168 for neurological diseases, and only 6 for obesity. Currently, phentermine and orlistat are the only two medications FDA approved for the treatment of obesity in adolescents, with the latter being the only one approved for long-term treatment. Other potential pharmacotherapy options for adolescents with obesity are forthcoming and will provided needed options for healthcare providers treating these patients.

Metabolic and bariatric surgery — indications and common procedures — The foremost procedures are surgical sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, accounting for around 90% of operations globally. A body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 40.0 kg/m², and a BMI of ≥ 35.0 kg/m² with obesity-related complications (ORCD), have long been the proposed thresholds for surgical indications. In 2016, 45 international professional societies stated that metabolic surgery should be considered for people with T2D and a BMI of 30.0 kg/m² to 34.9 kg/m² if hyperglycemia is inadequately controlled despite optimal treatment with either oral or injectable medications. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders have recommended bariatric surgery as a treatment option for adults with BMI ≥ 35.0 kg/m², regardless of the presence, absence, or severity of obesity-related conditions and BMI of 30.0 kg/m² to 34.9 kg/m² who have metabolic disease, such as T2D, and CVD.

### Managing weight and glycaemic targets in people with type 2 diabetes-how far have we come? [^1166Z1Pp]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

3 TREATMENT OF OBESE PEOPLE WITH T2D

3.1 Enhancing weight loss with current therapeutic options

As discussed above, weight management emerges as another important target as glycaemic control for a majority of people with T2D. Various treatments aid achieving glycaemic targets and enhancing body weight loss to a different extent. Here, lifestyle interventions, weight loss medications, anti‐diabetes pharmacotherapies and bariatric surgery will be discussed as well as their effects on both targets.

3.1.1 Diet, physical activity and behavioural intervention

Lifestyle modifications such as diet and increased physical activity have been established as a cornerstone of the treatment of T2D and obesity. Moreover, it has been recommended as a first‐line strategy by guidelines for management of both diabetes and obesity. The aim is management and reversal of excess weight that can lead to better glycaemic control. The approach should be a high‐quality hypocaloric diet, which promotes patient's adherence accompanied by a minimum of 150 min of moderate activity per week.

The feasibility of these recommendations was demonstrated in the Look AHEAD clinical trial. In that study, intensive lifestyle intervention resulted in clinically meaningful weight loss (≥ 5%) in 50% of people with T2D, and approximately 26% maintained a body weight loss of ≥ 10% at year 8. Moreover, intensive dietary interventions with low‐, and very‐low‐calorie diets, have been shown to achieve substantial reduction of HbA1c and sustained T2D remission in obese people with T2D. However, according to the ADA, such structured, low‐calorie diets should be prescribed only for carefully selected patients by well‐trained and experienced practitioners with close monitoring. For the vast majority of obese people with T2D, significant weight loss is feasible with lifestyle programs that achieve a 500–750 kcal/day energy deficit, somewhat regardless of macronutrient composition. Accordingly, dietary choice should be individually tailored to the patient's preferences and nutritional needs.

### Pediatric obesity [^114L681C]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Childhood obesity is a tremendous burden for children, their families, and society. Obesity prevention remains the ultimate goal but rapid development and deployment of effective nonsurgical treatment options is not currently achievable given the complexity of this disease. Surgical options for adolescent obesity have been proven to be safe and effective and should be offered. The development of stratified protocols of increasing intensity should be individualized for patients based on their disease severity and risk factors. These protocols should be offered in multidisciplinary, cooperative clinical trials to critically evaluate and develop optimal treatment strategies for morbid obesity.

### The future of obesity reduction: beyond weight loss [^111mfcVN]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2009). Medium credibility.

Obesity increases the risk of morbidity and mortality and reduces quality of life independent of age, sex or ethnicity. Leading health authorities recommend weight loss as a primary treatment strategy for obesity reduction — weight loss goals range from 5% to 10% of initial body weight. Intentional weight loss in most adults is associated with a reduction in many of the health complications of obesity. Nonetheless, emerging evidence supports the notion that a lifestyle-modification program characterized by an increase in physical activity and a balanced diet can reduce obesity and the risk of obesity-related comorbid conditions despite minimal or no weight loss. The benefits of such an approach include appreciable reductions in abdominal obesity, visceral fat and cardiometabolic risk factors, and increases in both skeletal muscle mass and cardiorespiratory fitness. Individuals with obesity face a serious challenge if they are to attain even modest weight loss in today's obesogenic environment. Clinicians could encourage positive lifestyle changes in their patients by counseling them that obesity and its associated health risks can be reduced in response to an increase in physical activity with or without weight loss.

### Health care strategies for obesity… [^1126tABy]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance Health care providers, health insurance plans, health care delivery systems, and partner organizations play an important role in preventing and treating obesity and related chronic diseases. This page can help providers: find up-to-date guidelines, connect to resources on growth monitoring and evidence-based obesity care, and learn more about diagnosis codes, reimbursement and other important topics. Overview Health care providers, health insurance plans, health care delivery systems, and information technologies all play an important role in preventing and treating obesity. Providers can use evidence-based strategies, including:

- Routinely screening patients for obesity.
- Evaluating patients for obesity-related diseases.
- Using more precise obesity diagnosis codes.
- Implementing or referring to effective treatment. Health plans can support obesity care through comprehensive coverage and reimbursement strategies.

Health IT can enhance quality improvement efforts for obesity care and population-based activities, such as surveillance. New Obesity Diagnosis Codes Released October 1, 2024 New and improved ICD-10 diagnosis codes for obesity are available to use. The new codes provide a more accurate way to classify obesity and severity of obesity. They also aim to reduce stigma and improve obesity care for patients of all ages. See below for more information. The new codes for adult and child obesity provide more accurate and precise coding of obesity severity. In addition, these codes can be used to track services for quality and performance and have been used in health services research. The codes are available for use by health care providers and coders as part of the October 1, 2024, ICD-10-CM release. For adults with obesity, the new E-codes can be used together with the existing Z-codes to align with recommended treatment options.

For children with obesity, the new E-codes can be used together with the new childhood Z-codes to align with recommended treatment options. Additional child obesity information More information

Conclusions

Obesity is a heterogeneous disease, and therefore individualizing therapy is important. Treatment approaches should take into account the underlying causes of obesity. If a complication from obesity exists, targeting both the excess weight and the comorbid disease would be advisable to improve benefit. Pharmacological therapies have their place, as well as limitations, in obesity treatment. Promising medications for long‐term weight management have recently emerged, adding to the possibilities for bespoke weight loss programmes.

### Effect of pediatric obesity treatment on long-term health [^114rfPJo]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in both developed and developing countries. By 2035, the global prevalence of obesity in individuals aged 5 to 19 years is estimated to be 18% among girls and 20% among boys. Childhood obesity is associated with hypertension, steatotic liver disease, insulin resistance, and psychosocial issues, such as anxiety, depression, and stigma. Additionally, children and adolescents with obesity are at a greater risk of ill health in adulthood compared with those of a healthy weight.,

Beneficial response to behavioral lifestyle obesity treatments in children and adolescents improves short- and long-term health. In adolescents, both bariatric surgery and pharmacotherapy have been shown to reduce the degree of obesity when lifestyle intervention alone proves insufficient. However, the extent of weight loss necessary to mitigate, or even eliminate, long-term obesity-related outcomes remains to be determined.

Evidence-based treatment options for childhood obesity have been available in Sweden for more than 15 years, with the main option being behavioral lifestyle modification. Multiple studies, have used the Swedish Childhood Obesity Treatment Register (BORIS)to assess the link between obesity and related complications in children. BORIS is the world's second largest prospective register of children and adolescents receiving treatment for obesity. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of pediatric obesity treatment response on obesity-related outcomes and mortality in young adulthood.

### Evaluation and management of obesity in chronic kidney disease [^113PXxtW]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is arguably the premier global public health problem of our era. It is also an independent risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and adverse outcomes in persons with CKD. Fortunately, effective treatment options for obesity have proliferated in just the last few years. These newer therapies in conjunction with older treatments offer great potential in treating obesity and CKD, though many questions remain about their use, efficacy, and place within the overall therapeutic plan. This paper will provide a discussion of the definition of obesity, its etiology, and its importance as a risk factor for CKD and other kidney-associated problems. It will then review current treatment options for obesity and the related evidence base. Finally, it will address major topics or controversies that remain unresolved and identify obstacles to effective treatment.

### Treatment of obesity: beyond the diet [^111d6RmY]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Obesity affects 2 of 5 Americans, and nearly 1 of 10 is considered severely obese, with the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality. A reduction in body weight of 2% to 5% can lead to improvements in cardiovascular health, with weight loss maintenance associated with the best health outcomes. Lifestyle interventions that focus on changes in diet and physical activity behaviors are best to maintain weight loss. This article provides a review of the treatment of adult obesity with a focus on dietary interventions.

### Obesity: overview of weight management [^1144RDR4]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is a chronic illness that requires a multifaceted personalized treatment approach.

Methods & Findings

Using current guidelines and recent studies in weight management, this article reviews the multiple components of weight management: lifestyle intervention (dietary intervention, physical activity, and behavioral interventions), pharmacotherapy, endoscopic procedures, and surgical procedures. This review briefly discusses specific diets and dietary strategies, compensatory mechanisms acting against weight loss, recent changes to Food and Drug Administration approved antiobesity medications, and technological advances in weight management delivery.

Conclusion

Current literature is lacking large studies on the safety and efficacy of combination therapies involving pharmacotherapy plus 1 or more procedures.

### Obesity-related asthma: new insights leading to a different approach [^112ZSJHZ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Obesity is a growing global health threat that significantly contributes to the burden of asthma by increasing the risk of developing asthma and exerting a distinct effect on lung function and inflammation. The treatment of obesity-related asthma is hindered by a poor response to standard asthma treatments, leading to worse asthma control. Weight loss strategies have a significant effect on asthma symptoms but are not feasible for a large proportion of patients, underscoring the need for a better understanding of the pathophysiology and the development of additional treatment options.

Recent Findings

Recent literature focusing on pathophysiology particularly delved into nontype 2 inflammatory mechanisms, associations with the metabolic syndrome and small airway impairment. Additionally, several new treatment options are currently investigated, including biologics, weight reduction interventions, and novel antiobesity drugs.

Summary

Obesity-related asthma is a highly prevalent asthma phenotype for which weight loss strategies currently stand as the most specific treatment. Furthermore, novel pharmacological interventions aiming at metabolic processes are on the way.

### Treatment of obesity in mitigating metabolic risk [^111kSQqR]. Circulation Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Through diverse mechanisms, obesity contributes to worsened cardiometabolic health and increases rates of cardiovascular events. Effective treatment of obesity is necessary to reduce the associated burdens of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and death. Despite increasing cardiovascular outcome data on obesity interventions, only a small fraction of the population with obesity are optimally treated. This is a primary impetus for this article in which we describe the typical weight loss, as well as the associated impact on both traditional and novel cardiovascular disease risk factors, provided by the 4 primary modalities for obtaining weight loss in obesity-dietary modification, increasing physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and surgery. We also attempt to highlight instances where changes in metabolic risk are relatively specific to particular interventions and appear at least somewhat independent of weight loss. Finally, we suggest important areas for further research to reduce and prevent adverse cardiovascular consequences due to obesity.

### National-level and state-level prevalence of overweight and obesity among children, adolescents, and adults in the USA, 1990–2021, and forecasts up to 2050 [^116N9juX]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

In addition to these much-needed public health interventions, the extremely high forecasts for overweight and obesity indicate many US adults, and some children and adolescents, will require more urgent treatment. For adults and post-pubertal adolescents, options might include anti-obesity medications, intensive dietary modification (eg, very low-energy diets), or bariatric surgeries. Many new-generation anti-obesity medications have shown clinically significant treatment efficacy. The clinical trial on semaglutide in adolescents with obesity, for instance, has found an average of 16.1% reduction in BMI among treated participants after 68 weeks. However, these treatments require medical supervision and are not recommended for those who do not have obesity, for pre-pubertal children, or for adolescents younger than 12 years. As with other chronic diseases (eg, depression and diabetes), any medical treatment needs to be part of a comprehensive management plan that includes lifestyle interventions that have been shown to achieve greater results. However, we must emphasise that the effectiveness of anti-obesity treatments varies widely across individuals, and some treatments are associated with serious side-effects. Many unknowns remain in terms of the long-term effects of new-generation clinical interventions. Equitable access is an additional crucial consideration. The current pricing of the latest GLP-1 anti-obesity medications in the USA is prohibitive. A 2024 report from the US Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee estimated that if half of US adults with obesity took semaglutide, it could cost the health-care system $411 billion per year. This estimate is in sharp contrast with implementing population-wide smart food policies, such as taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages, which is estimated to cost between $430 million over 10 years and $1.7 billion over a lifetime. Although the price of anti-obesity medications might decrease with the end of market exclusivity for some treatments, uncertainty remains regarding the extent of price negotiations, the availability of generic options, and the entry of new and more effective medications. The past adoption trends of treatments for other metabolic diseases, such as statins for dyslipidaemia, suggest that although prescription volumes increased after introducing cheaper generic options, considerable underutilisation remains in susceptible populations. Without addressing access disparities, the use of such treatments will simply widen current inequalities in obesity and associated disease burden, further exacerbating the life expectancy gaps across the USA. Therefore, anti-obesity medications and clinical treatments for obesity should not be viewed as a cure for the obesity epidemic. Prevention and treatment are both indispensable in providing holistic care for people at risk of and living with obesity. Along with enhancing treatment coverage, addressing the structural drivers of population obesity and emphasising prevention remain a central part of any comprehensive strategy.

### Update on treatment strategies for obesity [^113twWiz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Obesity is a disease that is defined as the accumulation of excessive amounts of body fat and is associated with increased risk of serious illness, disability, and death. In clinical practice, obesity is best assessed by calculating body mass index and measuring waist circumference. Treatment options are determined based on the body mass index, waist circumference, and adverse health consequences the patient is experiencing or is at an increased risk for facing in the future. Today, overweight and obesity impacts the majority of patients we treat in our clinical practices. Although endocrinologists are uniquely positioned to treat one of the major consequences of our current obesity epidemic, type 2 diabetes, we also need to be positioned and prepared to effectively treat one of its major causes-obesity. Type 2 diabetes and obesity are very much intertwined. Treatment of each disease affects the other. For these reasons, endocrinologists need to be experts in the treatment of obesity as well as diabetes. They should keep up with advances in obesity treatment including lifestyle, pharmaceutical, and surgical strategies. These strategies offer opportunities for improving the overall treatment for our obese patients today and will continue to improve and expand over the next decade.

Provision of evidence-based care — All care provided to children and youth with obesity and their families should be evidence based where possible; where evidence-based approaches do not exist, care should be evidence informed and/or based on promising practices, and as pediatric obesity becomes an increasing public health issue and recognizable chronic disease it becomes critical to rely on evidence-based medicine and or expert recommendations to establish prevention, assessment, and treatment of obesity.

### Treatment modalities of obesity: what fits whom? [^115QQPYh]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The prevalence of obesity is increasing in both developed and developing countries, with rates reaching approximately 10–35% among adults in the Euro-American region. Obesity is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, and some type of cancers. Obesity significantly affects the quality of life and reduces the average life expectancy. The effective treatment of obesity should address both the medical and the social burden of this disease. Obesity needs to be treated within the health care system as any other complex disease, with empathy and without prejudice. Both health care providers and patients should know that the obesity treatment is a lifelong task. They should also set realistic goals before starting the treatment, whereas keeping in mind that even a modest weight loss of 5–15% significantly reduces obesity-related health risks. Essential treatment of obesity includes low-calorie low-fat diets, increased physical activity, and strategies contributing to the modification of lifestyle. Anti-obesity drugs facilitate weight loss and contribute to further amelioration of obesity-related health risks. A short-term weight loss, up to 6 months, is usually achieved easily. However, the long-term weight management is often associated with a lack of compliance, failures, and a high dropout rate. Regular physical activity, cognitive behavioral modification of lifestyle, and administration of anti-obesity drugs improve weight loss maintenance. Bariatric surgery is an effective strategy to treat severely obese patients. Bariatric surgery leads to a substantial improvement of comorbidities as well as to a reduction in overall mortality by 25–50% during the long-term follow-up. Obesity treatment should be individually tailored and the following factors should be taken into account: sex, the degree of obesity, individual health risks, psychobehavioral and metabolic characteristics, and the outcome of previous weight loss attempts. In the future, an evaluation of hormonal and genetic determinants of weight loss could also contribute to a better choice of individual therapy for a particular obese patient. A multilevel obesity management network of mutually collaborating facilities should be established to provide individually tailored treatment. Centers of excellence in obesity management represented by multidisciplinary teams should provide comprehensive programs for the treatment of obesity derived from evidence-based medicine.

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: an update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^112fsTUY]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Obesity is an epidemic and a public health threat. Medical weight management remains one of the options for the treatment of excess weight and recent advances have revolutionized how we treat, and more importantly how we will be treating obesity in the near future. Metreleptin and Setmelanotide are currently indicated for rare obesity syndromes, and 5 other medications (orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, liraglutide, semaglutide) are approved for non-syndromic obesity. Tirzepatide is about to be approved, and other drugs, with exciting novel mechanisms of action primarily based on incretins, are currently being investigated in different phases of clinical trials. The majority of these compounds act centrally, to reduce appetite and increase satiety, and secondarily, in the gastrointestinal tract to slow gastric emptying. All anti-obesity medications improve weight and metabolic parameters, with variable potency and effects depending on the specific drug. The currently available data do not support a reduction in hard cardiovascular outcomes, but it is almost certain that such data are forthcoming in the very near future. The choice of the anti-obesity medication needs to take into consideration the patient's clinical and biochemical profile, co-morbidities, and drug contra-indications, as well as expected degree of weight loss and improvements in cardio-renal and metabolic risk. It also remains to be seen whether precision medicine may offer personalized solutions to individuals with obesity, and whether it may represent the future of medical weight management along with the development of novel, very potent, anti-obesity medications currently in the pipeline.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

General principles — medical management of obesity — emphasize that comprehensive treatment of obesity is multimodal, obesity treatment is multidisciplinary, and patients should be guided toward evidence-based interventions while being educated regarding nonevidence-based options that may pose potential harm. Clinicians should incorporate shared decision-making to balance risks and benefits, and off-label, but evidence-based, strategies may be considered to mitigate potential harms and optimize health outcomes (for example, lowest therapeutic dose for weight loss maintenance and combination therapies).

### How would you manage this patient with obesity? Grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^117R5cUU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2022, 1 in 8 people in the world were living with obesity, and lifestyle interventions that include diet, exercise, and behavioral modification have been the foundation for management of obesity. Recently, pharmacologic therapies have been developed for management of obesity, the newest of these being glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists. With the development of new pharmacologic options, the American Gastroenterological Association developed a guideline in 2022 to provide evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacologic management of obesity in adults and recommended, for adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related complications who have had an inadequate response to lifestyle interventions, adding pharmacologic agents to lifestyle interventions over continuing lifestyle interventions alone. In this article, 2 experts review the available evidence to answer the following questions: How effective are lifestyle interventions for the treatment of obesity? How effective are pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of obesity? Given these options, how do you engage in a shared decision-making discussion to develop a mutually agreed-on treatment plan?

### Current and future endoscopic weight loss solutions [^116fkrA3]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Obesity poses a significant health care concern in the United States, with 39.8% of adults being classified as obese. Several different methods have been introduced to combat obesity, from medical therapy to surgical options. Bariatric surgery has been demonstrated to be superior to medical therapy alone for weight loss in obese patients. Despite this information, only about 1% of eligible patients undergo bariatric surgery per year. The reason for this treatment gap is multifactorial, but patient apprehension to undergo surgery is a major driving force. Many patients perceive bariatric surgery as dangerous, and believe that living with their current weight is safer than undergoing surgery. To combat this treatment gap, endoscopic therapies have been developed to reach more patients in a less invasive way. This article will review endoscopic treatment options currently available and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, as well as other treatment modalities that are currently in development.

### Medications for the treatment of obesity in adolescents [^115azLDQ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

While there are eight medications/combinations approved for the treatment of obesity in adults, the options for the treatment of obesity in adolescents remain limited. Evidence for obesity medication use in adolescents is limited due to the relatively small number of clinical trials that have been completed and the few adolescents that have been included in many of the trials. The goal of this review will be to present the current evidence for the medications approved for adolescents, medications not approved for adolescents but have adolescent data, and medications approved for adults with the prospect for use in adolescents. We will also discuss current limitations and next steps in the exploration of future treatment options.

### Weight loss strategies for treatment of obesity: lifestyle management and pharmacotherapy [^116UoJAf]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Obesity is one of the most serious and prevalent non-communicable diseases of the twenty-first century. It is also a patient-centered condition in which affected individuals seek treatment through a variety of commercial, medical and surgical approaches. Considering obesity as a chronic medical disease state helps to frame the concept of using a three-stepped intensification of care approach to weight management. As a foundation, all patients should be counseled on evidence-based lifestyle approaches that include diet, physical activity and behavior change therapies. At the second tier, four new pharmacological agents, lorcaserin, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion and liraglutide have been approved since 2012 as adjuncts to lifestyle modification. The third step, bariatric surgery, has been demonstrated to be the most effective and long-term treatment for individuals with severe obesity or moderate obesity complicated by co-morbid conditions that is not responsive to non-surgical approaches. By using a medical model, clinicians can provide more proactive and effective treatments in assisting their patients with weight loss.

### Obesity solutions for patients over 65 years of age: surgeon perspectives on anti-obesity medications and metabolic bariatric surgery-international survey study [^1121AAtC]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of Patients over 65 Years of Age

We asked the respondents what management they would choose in specific clinical situations. According to the latest guidelines, MBS is recommended for patients with a body mass index (BMI) over 30 kg/m² in cases of obesity-related complications and over 35 kg/m² without comorbidities. In line with this, over 70% of surgeons selected AOMs for patients with a BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m², while nearly 20% would still propose MBS as the first option. For patients with a BMI of 35–40 kg/m², the majority of surgeons (> 70%) would opt for MBS. Given that we can achieve long-term weight loss through non-surgical methods in patients with a BMI < 35 kg/m², the introduction of AOMs seems justified in this group. However, in the case of individuals with obesity-related complications, which apply to most patients over the age of 65, we believe that considering MBS as a first option for these patients should not be regarded as an error. This approach aligns with the evolving understanding of obesity treatment in older populations, where the benefits of surgery can outweigh the risks, especially in the presence of significant comorbidities. As the BMI increases further, MBS remains the first choice, with a growing trend towards using AOMs as preparation for MBS. This shows that with the availability of AOMs, we now have a wide range of treatment options. Knowing that MBS is an effective method for patients over the age of 65, we can utilize medications to prepare patients for surgery. Although the relationship between preoperative weight loss and complication risk is not definitively explained in the literature, we do know that weight loss brings several advantages. Primarily, it can facilitate the technical conditions of the surgery, and as demonstrated by Roman et al. it can lead to better postoperative outcomes. Therefore, it seems reasonable to prepare patients with higher BMI s, especially those over the age of 65 who often present with multiple comorbidities, for surgery using AOMs. We proposed a treatment selection algorithm for patients over the age of 65, based on available literature and the opinions of respondents (Fig. 6).

### Pharmacotherapy for adults with overweight and obesity: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114rU8dV]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Pharmacotherapy provides an option for adults with overweight and obesity to reduce their bodyweight if lifestyle modifications fail. We summarised the latest evidence for the benefits and harms of weight-lowering drugs.

Methods

This systematic review and network meta-analysis included searches of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) from inception to March 23, 2021, for randomised controlled trials of weight-lowering drugs in adults with overweight and obesity. We performed frequentist random-effect network meta-analyses to summarise the evidence and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation frameworks to rate the certainty of evidence, calculate the absolute effects, categorise interventions, and present the findings. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD 42021245678.

Findings

14605 citations were identified by our search, of which 132 eligible trials enrolled 48209 participants. All drugs lowered bodyweight compared with lifestyle modification alone; all subsequent numbers refer to comparisons with lifestyle modification. High to moderate certainty evidence established phentermine-topiramate as the most effective in lowering weight (odds ratio [OR] of ≥ 5% weight reduction 8.02, 95% CI 5.24 to 12.27; mean difference [MD] of percentage bodyweight change -7.98, 95% CI -9.27 to -6.69) followed by GLP-1 receptor agonists (OR 6.33, 95% CI 5.00 to 8.00; MD -5.79, 95% CI -6.34 to -5.25). Naltrexone-bupropion (OR 2.69, 95% CI 2.10 to 3.44), phentermine-topiramate (2.40, 1.68 to 3.44), GLP-1 receptor agonists (2.22, 1.74 to 2.84), and orlistat (1.71, 1.42 to 2.05) were associated with increased adverse events leading to drug discontinuation. In a post-hoc analysis, semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, showed substantially larger benefits than other drugs with a similar risk of adverse events as other drugs for both likelihood of weight loss of 5% or more (OR 9.82, 95% CI 7.09 to 13.61) and percentage bodyweight change (MD -11.40, 95% CI -12.51 to -10.29).

Interpretation

In adults with overweight and obesity, phentermine-topiramate and GLP-1 receptor agonists proved the best drugs in reducing weight; of the GLP-1 agonists, semaglutide might be the most effective.

### Therapeutic options to treat pediatric obesity [^1151n5r4]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Obesity in children and adolescents is a severe health, psychosocial, and economic problem. Treatment of obesity should be based on the physiology, biochemistry, and genetics of the disease. Treatment is designed to prevent the comorbidities of obesity and allow a healthy, high-quality, and productive life. Treatment is based on healthy living and usually involves tools such as pharmacotherapy, medical device therapy, and bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery is not acceptable to most patients, parents, primary care providers, and payers. The most successful treatment of obesity follows a chronic disease model, provides a continuum of care, and involves many different disciplines.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115L1kwt]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacotherapy recommendations — When choosing glucose-lowering medications for people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, prioritize medications with beneficial effect on weight. Whenever possible, minimize medications for comorbid conditions that are associated with weight gain. Weight management pharmacotherapy should be considered for people with diabetes and overweight or obesity along with lifestyle changes, and potential benefits and risks must be considered. Weight management pharmacotherapy indicated for chronic therapy should be continued beyond reaching weight loss goals to maintain the health benefits. Sudden discontinuation of weight management pharmacotherapy often results in weight gain and worsening of cardiometabolic risk factors. For those not reaching treatment goals, reevaluate weight management therapies and intensify treatment with additional approaches (e.g., metabolic surgery, additional pharmacologic agents, and structured lifestyle management programs).

The highly variable response to obesity therapies justifies the search for treatment strategies that are best suited to individual patients to enhance their effectiveness and tolerability via precision medicine. Precision medicine development in recent years has been driven by the emergence of powerful methods to characterize patients ("omic" assays). Current available information has revealed that there are numerous intermediary processes that contribute to obesity and have provided a framework for partially comprehending the mechanisms behind the heterogeneity of obesity and its clinical consequences. Some of these processes have or are currently being targeted to individualize obesity therapy with some success.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity is a chronic multifactorial disease influenced and regulated by a complex interplay of hormones and a cascade of adaptive metabolic and physiological mechanisms that are central to the disease process. The prevalence of obesity, defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) of greater than or equal to 30 kg/m² has nearly tripled in numbers since 1975. Recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that in 2022, 1 in 8 people worldwide were living with obesity, while 43% of adults were classified as overweight. Alarmingly, over 390 million children and adolescents aged 5–19 years were overweight, including 160 million who were living with obesity. An 'obesogenic' environment with increasing per‐capita food supplies, sedentary lifestyles, genetics and the gut microbiome are among many other factors contributing to the rising epidemic.

Weight loss, even modest, has been shown to significantly lower the risk of cardio‐metabolic, respiratory, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal disorders, to name a few, and also improve quality of life. Various strategies have therefore been developed not only to curb the rising tide in the prevalence of obesity, but also to manage individuals living with complex severe obesity. Lifestyle (dietary, behavioural and physical activity) interventions remain the cornerstone of prevention and treatment strategies, while weight loss surgery (metabolic and bariatric surgery, MBS) is a treatment of choice for suitable patients. Long‐term weight loss maintenance, however, remains an ongoing challenge to individuals living with overweight/obesity.

This article will focus on current evidence, guidance and best practice for the prevention and management of people living with overweight or obesity by means of lifestyle and behavioural intervention, as well as by MBS. Data search was conducted from MEDLINE & EMBASE, PubMed and Google Scholar, Clinical. A thematic assessment of relevant publications, guidelines and position statements was undertaken and selected to cover the remit of the review, that is, to cover 'The Latest Evidence, Guidance and Best Practice in Lifestyle & Surgical Interventions To Achieve Weight Loss in People With Overweight or Obesity'.
