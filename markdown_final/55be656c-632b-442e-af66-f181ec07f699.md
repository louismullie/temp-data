Create the short proposal for the client brief "Dapagliflozin and Sitagliptin combination therapy"

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a short proposal for a client brief on dapagliflozin plus sitagliptin combination therapy for type 2 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and the complementary mechanisms of action. Then, I should verify the pivotal randomized trial evidence for efficacy and safety. Next, I will review durability and subgroup data, including renal function considerations. After that, I need to check guideline alignment and practical implementation, including dosing, monitoring, and contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and highlight limitations and uncertainties that require clinical judgment.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and the mechanistic rationale for combining dapagliflozin and sitagliptin. Type 2 diabetes is progressive and multifactorial, so targeting multiple pathophysiologic defects can improve glycemic control and durability; dapagliflozin lowers plasma glucose via insulin-independent urinary glucose excretion, while sitagliptin augments endogenous incretins to enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppress glucagon, yielding complementary and potentially synergistic effects without directly increasing hypoglycemia risk [^111BKvzh] [^114zqXjn].

> Wait, let me verify the pivotal efficacy data before drawing conclusions. In a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, adding dapagliflozin 10 mg to sitagliptin 100 mg (with or without metformin) reduced HbA1c by a placebo-corrected mean of −0.5% overall, with −0.56% in the sitagliptin-alone stratum and −0.40% in the sitagliptin-plus-metformin stratum; fasting plasma glucose fell by about 24 mg/dL and body weight decreased by about 2.1 kg versus placebo, with more patients achieving HbA1c < 7% on the combination, and these effects were sustained through 48 weeks in the extension phase [^117RZZRT] [^111Kk2KL] [^116ZxXzk].

> Hold on, I should verify the safety profile and not jump to assumptions. The combination was generally well tolerated, with balanced adverse events and low discontinuation rates; the main signal was an increased risk of genital mycotic infections with dapagliflozin (about 9.8% vs 0.4% with placebo), while urinary tract infections were similar and hypoglycemia remained uncommon due to the glucose-dependent mechanisms, consistent with the class profiles of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors [^117RZZRT] [^115Wh728].

> I need to check durability and broader combination evidence to ensure this isn't a transient effect. Multiple 52-week trials of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin on a metformin background demonstrated greater and more durable HbA1c reductions than sitagliptin alone, with sustained weight and blood pressure advantages and low hypoglycemia, supporting the concept that SGLT2/DPP-4 co-therapy can outperform sequential monotherapy add-ons in appropriately selected patients [^115MoC3c] [^111d39SD].

> But wait, what if renal function alters expected benefits; I should double-check that. In mild renal insufficiency (eGFR 60–89), sitagliptin may outperform dapagliflozin for glycemic lowering because SGLT2 efficacy wanes as filtered glucose declines, whereas DPP-4 activity remains preserved; in moderate impairment (eGFR 45–59), dapagliflozin retains modest HbA1c benefit but dose adjustments and monitoring are essential, and below eGFR 30, SGLT2 inhibitors are generally not recommended for glycemic control, though cardiorenal indications may still apply in CKD populations [^115wrTtB] [^11361Sgd] [^111G1sCx] [^113oGzxF].

> Next, I should review guideline alignment to ensure the recommendation fits current standards. ADA 2025 supports considering combination therapy at initiation to shorten time to goal, and AACE 2023 endorses early combination when A1C is > 7.5% or > 1.5% above target, with explicit allowance for metformin plus agents that do not cause hypoglycemia; ESC guidance emphasizes SGLT2 inhibitors for HF and CKD risk reduction irrespective of A1C, and VA/DoD recommends SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs for patients with ASCVD or CKD even if glycemic targets are met, reinforcing a cardio-renal risk framework when selecting add-on therapy [^116WNWFw] [^112dHfyA] [^113oGzxF] [^116xPmcn].

> I will now examine practical implementation details and dosing, and I need to ensure there are no overlooked interactions. Typical dosing pairs dapagliflozin 10 mg with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, with no pharmacokinetic interaction necessitating dose adjustment; clinically, monitor for genital infections, volume status, and eGFR changes, and consider patient education on hydration and infection recognition; in eGFR < 45, anticipate attenuated glycemic efficacy and reassess the role of SGLT2 therapy, while remembering that cardiorenal benefits may still justify use in CKD per outcome trials and labels [^1148gWVy] [^111G1sCx] [^113oGzxF].

> Let me synthesize the recommendation, but I should confirm I'm not overstating certainty. For adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on sitagliptin (with or without metformin), adding dapagliflozin 10 mg provides an additional ~0.5% HbA1c reduction, lowers fasting glucose and weight, and maintains a favorable hypoglycemia profile, with benefits sustained up to 48 weeks; this strategy aligns with ADA/AACE principles favoring timely intensification and is particularly attractive when weight loss, blood pressure lowering, or cardio-renal risk reduction are desired, provided renal function is adequate and infection risk is acceptable [^117RZZRT] [^116WNWFw] [^112dHfyA].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and uncertainties so we don't overgeneralize. Head-to-head data specifically for dapagliflozin plus sitagliptin are limited to the 24–48 week trial and its extension; longer-term cardiovascular and renal outcome data are lacking for this exact pairing, and most robust outcome evidence exists for SGLT2 inhibitors as a class rather than this specific DPP-4 combination, so shared decision-making should incorporate cost, access, and patient preferences, especially when considering fixed-dose SGLT2/DPP-4 products like dapagliflozin/saxagliptin as proxies for the mechanistic combination [^117RZZRT] [^116AZ2JS] [^114kk5GW].

> In summary, after double-checking the trial data, safety signals, and guideline direction, dapagliflozin plus sitagliptin is a rational, evidence-based intensification for patients with persistent hyperglycemia on sitagliptin-based therapy, offering clinically meaningful glycemic, weight, and metabolic benefits with manageable risks, and fitting within contemporary standards that prioritize timely combination therapy and cardio-renal risk reduction where indicated [^117RZZRT] [^116WNWFw] [^112dHfyA].

---

The dapagliflozin–sitagliptin combination is a **rational, guideline-concordant** option for patients with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled on metformin or metformin plus a DPP-4 inhibitor, offering complementary mechanisms and additive A1C lowering without increased hypoglycemia risk [^117RZZRT] [^112dHfyA]. This regimen provides **weight loss and blood pressure reduction** and is supported by robust RCT data and FDA labeling, with a favorable safety profile that includes low hypoglycemia risk and manageable genital/urinary infections [^111Kk2KL] [^112TM6TG]. It is especially suitable for patients with cardiovascular or renal risk, but renal function should be monitored and the combination avoided in severe renal impairment [^113oGzxF] [^113wx5Ge].

---

## Mechanism of action and complementary pharmacology

Dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, reduces renal glucose reabsorption, increases urinary glucose excretion, and lowers blood glucose independent of insulin — thereby also promoting weight loss and blood pressure reduction [^116kxhW3]. Sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, prolongs endogenous GLP-1 and GIP, enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon, with minimal hypoglycemia risk [^115wrTtB]. Together, the agents provide **complementary, additive effects** that address multiple pathophysiologic defects in T2DM [^111BKvzh].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting combination therapy

- **Randomized controlled trial (RCT)**: A 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT00984867) in 452 adults with T2DM inadequately controlled on sitagliptin ± metformin showed that adding dapagliflozin 10 mg significantly reduced HbA1c (placebo-corrected −0.5%), FPG (−24.1 mg/dL), and body weight (−2.1 kg) vs placebo, with sustained benefits through 48 weeks [^117RZZRT] [^111Kk2KL].

- **FDA labeling**: The dapagliflozin prescribing information confirms significant improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and body weight when added to sitagliptin ± metformin, supporting this combination strategy [^111Kk2KL].

- **Triple therapy**: Trials of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin (another DPP-4i) on metformin demonstrate superior glycemic control vs dual therapy, with low hypoglycemia and favorable metabolic effects, reinforcing the SGLT2+DPP-4 class combination principle [^113HapAA] [^115MoC3c].

---

## Efficacy outcomes

| **Outcome** | **Dapagliflozin + sitagliptin** | **Placebo + sitagliptin** |
|-|-|-|
| HbA1c reduction | -0.5% (placebo-corrected) | 0.0% |
| Fasting plasma glucose reduction | -24.1 mg/dL (placebo-corrected) | +3.8 mg/dL |
| Body weight reduction | -2.1 kg (placebo-corrected) | -0.3 kg |
| Patients achieving HbA1c < 7% | 37.5% | 24.1% |

---

These effects were consistent across subgroups, including patients ≥ 65 years, those with baseline HbA1c ≥ 8.0%, and across sex, race, and BMI categories [^117RZZRT].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Hypoglycemia**: Low and similar to placebo; consistent with the glucose-dependent action of DPP-4 inhibition and insulin-independent SGLT2 mechanism [^1125MF7o].

- **Genital infections**: Higher with dapagliflozin (9.8% vs 0.4% placebo), typically mild and manageable [^117RZZRT].

- **Urinary tract infections**: Similar to placebo (6.7% vs 6.2%) [^117RZZRT].

- **Renal function**: Transient eGFR decline may occur; monitor renal function and avoid in severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^112DEkFy].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from combination therapy

- **Inadequate control on metformin**: Patients not at target on metformin alone or metformin + DPP-4 inhibitor benefit from added A1C lowering and metabolic improvements [^117RZZRT].

- **High cardiovascular risk**: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HF hospitalization and cardiovascular events; this combination is attractive for patients with or at risk for ASCVD or HF [^113vKBzp] [^114kk5GW].

- **Overweight/obesity**: Weight loss (~2 kg) and BP reduction are advantageous for patients with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² [^112TM6TG] [^111d39SD].

- **Renal considerations**: Use is appropriate in mild-to-moderate CKD, with monitoring; avoid in severe impairment [^113oGzxF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ADA 2025 supports **combination therapy** to reach individualized goals more rapidly, and AACE 2023 endorses early combination when A1C is > 7.5% or > 1.5% above target, aligning with this SGLT2+DPP-4 strategy [^116WNWFw] [^112dHfyA]. ESC 2023 recommends SGLT2 inhibitors for T2DM with ASCVD, HF, or CKD, and recognizes DPP-4 inhibitors as neutral for HF risk, supporting this combination in appropriate patients [^113vKBzp] [^112ToGa1].

---

## Practical considerations and implementation

- **Dosing**: Dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily; no dose adjustment needed for either agent when co-administered [^1148gWVy].

- **Monitoring**: Check renal function and volume status at baseline and periodically; counsel on genital hygiene and hydration to mitigate infection risk [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Explain expected benefits (A1C, weight, BP) and potential adverse effects (genital infections, volume effects) to support adherence [^117RZZRT].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Reduced efficacy and increased adverse effects as eGFR declines; avoid in severe impairment [^115wrTtB].

- **Cost**: Combination therapy may increase cost; consider patient access and insurance coverage [^113dd49b].

- **Long-term data**: While 48-week data are supportive, longer-term cardiovascular and renal outcome data specific to this exact combination are limited; class benefits are extrapolated [^117RZZRT] [^114kk5GW].

---

The dapagliflozin–sitagliptin combination is a **clinically sound, evidence-based** option for T2DM not at goal on metformin or metformin+DPP-4 therapy, providing additive A1C lowering, weight/BP benefits, and a favorable safety profile, with particular value in patients with cardiovascular or renal risk.

Add-On Combination Therapy with a DPP4 Inhibitor

A total of 452 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were drug naive, or who were treated at entry with metformin or a DPP4 inhibitor alone or in combination, and had inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 10.0% at randomization), participated in a 24-week, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate dapagliflozin in combination with sitagliptin (a DPP4 inhibitor) with or without metformin (NCT00984867).

Eligible patients were stratified based on the presence or absence of background metformin (≥ 1,500 mg per day), and within each stratum were randomized to either dapagliflozin 10 mg plus sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, or placebo plus sitagliptin 100 mg once daily. Endpoints were tested for dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo for the total trial group (sitagliptin with and without metformin) and for each stratum (sitagliptin alone or sitagliptin with metformin). Thirty-seven percent (37%) of patients were drug naive, 32% were on metformin alone, 13% were on a DPP4 inhibitor alone, and 18% were on a DPP4 inhibitor plus metformin. Dose titration of dapagliflozin, sitagliptin, or metformin was not permitted during the trial.

In combination with sitagliptin (with or without metformin), dapagliflozin 10 mg provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with the placebo plus sitagliptin (with or without metformin) group at Week 24 (see Table 12). These improvements were also seen in the stratum of patients who received dapagliflozin 10 mg plus sitagliptin alone (placebo-corrected mean change for HbA1c −0.56%; n = 110) compared with placebo plus sitagliptin alone (n = 111), and the stratum of patients who received dapagliflozin 10 mg plus sitagliptin and metformin (placebo-corrected mean change for HbA1c −0.40; n = 113) compared with placebo plus sitagliptin with metformin (n = 113).

### Characterization of the open-label lead-in period of two randomized controlled phase 3 trials evaluating dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin in type 2 diabetes [^112bzkv2]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease characterized by a decline in β-cell function and loss of glycemic control. Achieving control of glucose levels is a major focus of treatment. Current guidelines recommend metformin as first-line glucose-lowering therapy in people with type 2 diabetes, with stepwise addition of other antidiabetes agents as glycemic control deteriorates. A wide range of second- and subsequent-line therapies are available for this purpose, each targeting various aspects of the disease pathophysiology; however, there is no clear consensus on the optimal treatment regimen for patients with type 2 diabetes that is inadequately controlled with metformin alone. A key consideration is the need to balance efficacy with the potential risks of adverse effects, and guidelines recommend transition to triple therapy if glycemic targets are not reached or maintained after 3 months of dual therapy. However, treatment intensification in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes is often delayed.

### Dapagliflozin [^117REVFX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview of Clinical Studies of dapagliflozin for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Dapagliflozin has been studied in adult patients as monotherapy, in combination with metformin, pioglitazone, sulfonylurea (glimepiride), sitagliptin (with or without metformin), metformin plus a sulfonylurea, or insulin (with or without other oral antidiabetic therapy), compared to a sulfonylurea (glipizide), and in combination with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (exenatide extended release) added on to metformin. Dapagliflozin has also been studied in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate renal impairment.

Treatment with dapagliflozin as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, or insulin produced statistically significant improvements in mean change from baseline at Week 24 in HbA1c compared to control. Reductions in HbA1c were seen across subgroups including gender, age, race, duration of disease, and baseline body mass index (BMI).

Monotherapy

A total of 840 treatment-naive adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in 2 placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of monotherapy with dapagliflozin.

In one monotherapy trial, a total of 558 treatment-naive patients with inadequately controlled diabetes participated in a 24-week trial (NCT00528372). Following a 2-week diet and exercise placebo lead-in period, 485 patients with HbA1c ≥ 7% and ≤ 10% were randomized to dapagliflozin 5 mg or dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily in either the morning (QAM, main cohort) or evening (QPM), or placebo.

At Week 24, treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg QAM provided significant improvements in HbA1c and the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared with placebo (see Table 7).

### Dapagliflozin is effective as add-on therapy to sitagliptin with or without metformin: a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^117RZZRT]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor with or without metformin.

Research Design and Methods

In this 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3 study with a 24-week blinded extension period, 432 patients were randomized to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg/day or placebo added to sitagliptin (100 mg/day) ± metformin (≥ 1,500 mg/day).

Results

Baseline HbA1c and FPG levels were 7.9% (63.0 mmol/mol) and 162.2 mg/dL (9.0 mmol/L) for the dapagliflozin group and 8.0% (64.0 mmol/mol) and 163 mg/dL (9.0 mmol/L) for placebo. At week 24, dapagliflozin significantly reduced mean HbA1c levels (-0.5% [-4.9 mmol/mol]) versus placebo (0.0% [+0.4 mmol/mol]). Dapagliflozin reduced body weight versus placebo (-2.1 and -0.3 kg) and reduced HbA1c levels in patients with baseline values ≥ 8.0% (-0.8% [8.7 mmol/mol] and 0.0% [0.3 mmol/mol]) and fasting plasma glucose levels (-24.1 mg/dL [-1.3 mmol/L] and 3.8 mg/dL [0.2 mmol/L]). Similar results were observed when data were stratified by background therapy. Glycemic and weight benefits observed at week 24 were maintained through week 48. Changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure at week 8 were not significantly different between treatment groups. Over 48 weeks, fewer patients receiving dapagliflozin were discontinued or rescued for failing to achieve glycemic targets compared with placebo. Adverse events were balanced between groups, and discontinuation rates were low. At week 48, signs and symptoms suggestive of genital infection were more frequent with dapagliflozin (9.8%) than with placebo (0.4%). Signs and symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection were balanced between dapagliflozin (6.7%) and placebo (6.2%).

Conclusions

These results suggest that in patients with type 2 diabetes, inadequately controlled on sitagliptin with or without metformin, add-on treatment with dapagliflozin provides additional clinical benefit and is well tolerated.

### Dapagliflozin (forxiga) for type 2 diabetes? [^114n1rt1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

In the UK, diabetes mellitus affects around 3 million people, of whom over 90% have type 2 diabetes. Aims of treatment include minimising long-term complications (e.g. cardiovascular disease, blindness, chronic kidney disease, premature mortality) and avoiding unwanted effects of treatment (e.g. severe hypoglycaemia, weight gain). Management of diabetes includes patient support and education; addressing symptoms; lifestyle modification; targeting associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease; and surveillance for, and management of, complications including treatment-related hypoglycaemia. Dapagliflozin (Forxiga) belongs to a new class of oral glucose-lowering drugs that inhibit renal glucose reabsorption and promote glycosuria. It is licensed in the UK in adults with type 2 diabetes as monotherapy when diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and who are unable to tolerate metformin; or, as add-on therapy, with other glucose-lowering agents including insulin, when these, with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control. The company's advertising materials claim that dapagliflozin provides a "novel method of controlling excess glucose" with "secondary benefit of weight loss". Here, we review the evidence for the use of dapagliflozin in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

6 Implications for Future Research

Future research should focus on longer‐term cardiovascular outcomes, optimal dosing strategies and effectiveness in diverse populations. Additionally, head‐to‐head comparisons with other third‐line agents would help further define pioglitazone's place in the treatment algorithm. Future studies need to include a large number of patients to increase the power of the findings.

Add-On Combination Therapy with a DPP4 Inhibitor

A total of 452 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were drug naive, or who were treated at entry with metformin or a DPP4 inhibitor alone or in combination, and had inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 10.0% at randomization), participated in a 24-week, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate FARXIGA in combination with sitagliptin (a DPP4 inhibitor) with or without metformin (NCT00984867).

Eligible patients were stratified based on the presence or absence of background metformin (≥ 1,500 mg per day), and within each stratum were randomized to either FARXIGA 10 mg plus sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, or placebo plus sitagliptin 100 mg once daily. Endpoints were tested for FARXIGA 10 mg versus placebo for the total trial group (sitagliptin with and without metformin) and for each stratum (sitagliptin alone or sitagliptin with metformin). Thirty-seven percent (37%) of patients were drug naive, 32% were on metformin alone, 13% were on a DPP4 inhibitor alone, and 18% were on a DPP4 inhibitor plus metformin. Dose titration of FARXIGA, sitagliptin, or metformin was not permitted during the trial.

In combination with sitagliptin (with or without metformin), FARXIGA 10 mg provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with the placebo plus sitagliptin (with or without metformin) group at Week 24 (see Table 12). These improvements were also seen in the stratum of patients who received FARXIGA 10 mg plus sitagliptin alone (placebo-corrected mean change for HbA1c −0.56%; n = 110) compared with placebo plus sitagliptin alone (n = 111), and the stratum of patients who received FARXIGA 10 mg plus sitagliptin and metformin (placebo-corrected mean change for HbA1c −0.40; n = 113) compared with placebo plus sitagliptin with metformin (n = 113).

### Sustained 52-week efficacy and safety of triple therapy with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus dual therapy with sitagliptin added to metformin in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes [^115MoC3c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To compare the efficacy and safety of an intensification strategy of early triple combination therapy with dapagliflozin (DAPA) plus saxagliptin (SAXA) to a dual therapy strategy with sitagliptin (SITA) in patients with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled with metformin (MET) monotherapy.

Materials and Methods

This multinational, active-controlled, parallel-group phase 3b trial randomized 461 patients, at least 18years of age, with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 8%-10.5% (64–91mmol/mol), to either DAPA plus SAXA or SITA, added to MET, for a 26-week double-blind treatment period and an extension of a 26-week blinded treatment period.

Results

Mean (± SD) baseline HbA1c was 8.8% ± 0.9% (73.0 ± 9.3 mmol/mol). DAPA plus SAXA (n = 232) provided a greater reduction from baseline in HbA1c at Weeks 26 and 52 compared with SITA (n = 229) (adjusted mean ± SE change, Week 26: -1.41 ± 0.07% vs -1.07 ± 0.07% [-15.4 ± 0.8 mmol/mol vs 11.7 ± 0.8 mmol/mol]; P = 0.0008; Week 52: -1.29 ± 0.08% vs -0.81 ± 0.09% [14.1 ± 0.9 mmol/mol vs 8.9 ± 1.0 mmol/mol]). The between-group difference in adjusted mean (95% CI) change from baseline in HbA1c increased from -0.34 (-0.54, -0.14) at Week 26 to -0.48 (-0.71, -0.25) at Week 52. DAPA plus SAXA was generally well tolerated and the incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment arms.

Conclusions

Early intensification to triple therapy with DAPA plus SAXA results in better, more durable glycaemic control than addition of SITA only (dual therapy) in patients with high HbA1c levels who are uncontrolled with MET monotherapy.

### Potential for combination of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^112TM6TG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Published Evidence With Combination Therapy

The drug–drug interactions of empagliflozin and linagliptinor sitagliptinwere studied in healthy male volunteers. Both studies showed that administration of either linagliptin or sitagliptin with empagliflozin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either agent; therefore, empagliflozin can be co-administered with either linagliptin or sitagliptin without dose adjustments.

A 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed dapagliflozin (10 mg) as an add-on therapy to sitagliptin (100 mg, with and without metformin, ≥ 1500 mg/day) in 447 participants. After 24 weeks, the addition of dapagliflozin significantly reduced mean HbA1c concentration compared with placebo, excluding data after rescue [placebo-corrected difference −0.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.6 to −0.3 (−6 mmol/mol; 95% CI −7 to −3); p < 0.0001], even in a subset of participants with HbA1c baseline levels ≥ 8% [≥ 64 mmol/mol; placebo-corrected difference −0.8%; 95% CI −1.0 to −0.6 (−9 mmol/mol; 95% CI −11 to −7); p < 0.0001]. Similarly, treatment with dapagliflozin also significantly decreased FPG (placebo-corrected difference −1.55 mmol/l; 95% CI −1.92 to −1.19; p < 0.0001) and body weight (placebo-corrected difference −1.9 kg; 95% CI −2.4 to −1.4; p < 0.0001). Adverse events were balanced among groups and discontinuation rates were low. These results suggest that add-on treatment with dapagliflozin in individuals inadequately controlled with sitagliptin with or without metformin can provide additional clinical benefits and is well tolerated.

### Sustained 52-week efficacy and safety of triple therapy with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus dual therapy with sitagliptin added to metformin in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes [^111d39SD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this double‐blind, double‐dummy 52‐week trial, we report that an intensification strategy of early triple combination therapy with the addition of DAPA plus SAXA provides significantly greater improvements in glycaemic control than a dual therapy strategy with the addition of SITA alone in patients with inadequately controlled MET‐treated type 2 diabetes. These improvements were sustained after 52 weeks and were not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia or other diabetes‐specific events, and the overall incidence of AEs was low. Furthermore, the improvement in glycaemic control with DAPA plus SAXA treatment was accompanied by a greater reduction in body weight and systolic blood pressure compared with treatment with SITA.

Therapeutic guidelines recommend treatment intensification through addition of anti‐diabetes agents for patients with inadequate glycaemic control with MET. 7 However, dual add‐on therapy is rarely used, despite the knowledge that glycaemic control is seldom achieved with single‐agent add‐ons. The use of single‐agent add‐ons often leads to long periods of hyperglycaemia, 8 which are associated with increased morbidity. 9 The objective of this study was to evaluate the strategy of adding two anti‐hyperglycaemic agents (DAPA plus SAXA) simultaneously compared with the more common approach of adding one agent at a time (SITA) in patients with type 2 diabetes that is uncontrolled by MET. Adding two therapies simultaneously led to more rapid glucose control, which was sustained over 52 weeks, suggesting that there may be underlying improvements in insulin sensitivity and β‐cell function. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Treatment with DAPA plus SAXA add‐on to MET provided greater reductions in HbA1c and FPG than treatment with SITA add‐on, although, even with triple therapy, mean final HbA1c values were greater than 7% (53 mmol/mol), probably the result of the patients' high baseline HbA1c levels. However, a significantly greater proportion of patients achieved HbA1c less than 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) with DAPA plus SAXA add‐on therapy than with SITA add‐on after 26 and 52 weeks, despite high baseline HbA1c levels. Differences in adjusted mean change from baseline in both HbA1c and FPG between the two treatment groups increased from Week 26 to Week 52, and a lower proportion of patients in the DAPA plus SAXA group required rescue therapy, indicating that SITA add‐on therapy is associated with more rapid increases in HbA1c and FPG over time, and that the efficacy of early triple therapy with DAPA plus SAXA add‐on to MET is durable. These improvements in glycaemic control are consistent with those reported in a previous clinical study that investigated the efficacy and safety of DAPA plus SAXA add‐on to MET compared with the addition to MET of each agent alone. 16 In separate 52‐week studies in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, triple therapy with the SGLT2 inhibitor ertugliflozin plus SITA add‐on to MET resulted in greater improvements in glycaemic control compared with SITA add‐on, 17 and triple therapy with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin plus the DPP‐4 inhibitor linagliptin added to MET significantly reduced HbA1c levels compared with the individual drugs added to MET. 18 Together, these studies indicate that a treatment strategy with early combination therapy may result in more rapid and more durable glycaemic control, with no increase in AEs, than single‐agent sequential add‐on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes that is inadequately controlled with MET. The proportion of patients experiencing AEs and hypoglycaemia was similar for treatment with DAPA plus SAXA add‐on and for treatment with SITA add‐on therapies. The incidence of genital infections was low and similar between treatment groups; the incidence of UTIs was slightly higher in both men and women with triple therapy than with dual therapy (men, 4.0% vs 1.8%; women, 8.3% vs 5.0%, respectively). The overall incidence of both genital infections and UTIs after 52 weeks was only slightly higher than that observed at 26 weeks, were only mild or moderate in severity, and were similar to those previously reported for DAPA. 19, 20 Triple therapy with DAPA plus SAXA add‐on to MET was associated with cumulative weight loss from 26 to 52 weeks, which was greater than that with dual therapy with SITA add‐on.

1 INTRODUCTION

Clinical guidelines recommend the use of metformin (MET) monotherapy as first‐line anti‐hyperglycaemic therapy for the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes, but treatment intensification will probably be required to maintain glycaemic control as the disease progresses. 1, 2 However, the addition of individual oral therapies to MET may be inadequate to reach glycaemic targets in patients with very high levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) because of the complex multi‐system pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, which requires a multi‐faceted treatment approach. 3, 4 Simultaneous intensification with two therapies that have different mechanisms of action has the potential to provide more rapid, greater and sustained reductions in HbA1c; however, it is not known whether this form of therapy increases the risk of adverse events. Simultaneous intensification with two therapies may have benefits, such as improved adherence, reduced clinical inertia and increased durability, but the safety of such an approach is yet to be established.

In the present study, we report results from a randomized, double‐blind, active‐controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of triple therapy, with the addition of the sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin (DAPA) plus the dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitor saxagliptin (SAXA), vs dual therapy, with the addition of the DPP‐4 inhibitor sitagliptin (SITA) alone, in patients with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled with MET monotherapy. The objective of this study, which included a short‐term 26‐week treatment period and a further 26‐week extension treatment period, was to assess the efficacy, safety and long‐term sustained control of a strategy of adding an early combination of two drugs to MET (triple therapy), compared with the commonly used strategy of adding only one drug (dual therapy).

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, and adverse effects of dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor.

Data Sources

Data were gathered from articles indexed in PubMed, International Pharmaceutical from (2006 to April 2014) was performed using the following terms "dapagliflozin", "SGLT-2 inhibitor", and "Farxiga". Abstracts and manufacturer's package insert were also used as an additional reference.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English language prospective randomized, double-blinded trials evaluating the efficacy of dapagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes were identified.

Data Synthesis

We evaluated 9 clinical trials with dapagliflozin as monotherapy or add-on therapy. Results from these studies demonstrated that dapagliflozin to be noninferior to metformin in treatment naïve patients for reduction in A1C. Additionally, dapagliflozin was noninferior to glimepiride when added on to metformin. As an add-on therapy to insulin, insulin sensitizers or sitagliptin, dapagliflozin was found to be clinically effective compared to placebo. Finally, in all of the clinical trials increased risk of urinary infection was common in dapagliflozin group.

Conclusion

As the second SGLT-2 inhibitor approved in the United States, dapagliflozin is safe and effective for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It appears to have no increased cardiovascular risk and provides a moderate benefit for patients with high blood pressure or those who are overweight. However, dapagliflozin was found to be associated with nasopharyngitis, mycotic infections, and genital or urinary tract infections. This medication may be best used as adjunctive therapy for patients not well-controlled on other antidiabetic agents. However, caution should be taken when used in patients at risk of urinary tract infections and dehydration.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex, chronic condition with eight pathophysiological disturbances collectively referred to as the 'ominous octet' (Fig. 1). These perturbations result in insufficient glycemic control, a characteristic of T2DM, and management requires a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies. Several therapeutic drug classes are available to treat T2DM when non-pharmacological therapies such as diet and exercise prove to be inadequate. Metformin, a biguanide class of oral antidiabetic agent (OAD), is a first-line treatment to achieve glucose-lowering goals in patients with T2DM. However, most patients with T2DM fail to maintain glycemic control with first-line OAD and require either an additional OAD or combination therapy of various OAD drug classes to reduce hyperglycemia.

Ominous octet of type 2 diabetes

The inability of monotherapies in aiding patients to achieve their glycemic targets could lead to an increase in macrovascular and microvascular complications as well as hypoglycemic events. Thus, combination therapies provide an aggressive and proactive approach towards treating T2DM while reducing the incidence of side effects. Additionally, experts suggest that combination therapies could lead to increased patient adherence due to a decrease in pill burden.

1 INTRODUCTION

Attainment of optimal glycaemic control with a low risk of hypoglycaemia and with body weight reduction is a major goal of type 2 diabetes management. 1, 2 Metformin is the first‐line pharmacotherapy recommended for glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and has proven efficacy in achieving clinically relevant reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. 1 Most patients eventually require treatment with 2 or more antidiabetes agents to maintain adequate control of blood glucose levels, 3 and international treatment guidelines recommend stepwise intensification of therapy through add‐on to metformin. 1, 4

The latest generation of oral antidiabetes drugs, including sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors, have demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with inadequate glycaemic control with metformin monotherapy. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Moreover, in a 24‐week study, triple therapy with concomitant addition of dapagliflozin, an SGLT‐2 inhibitor, plus the DPP‐4 inhibitor saxagliptin to metformin led to greater improvements in glycaemic control than add‐on of either agent alone. 11 These improvements were achieved without increased risk of hypoglycaemia compared with dual therapy, and both dapagliflozin‐containing regimens were associated with the benefit of weight loss. 11 Dapagliflozin‐containing treatment regimens, therefore, may be a promising second‐line treatment strategy for patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control.

Sulphonylureas are widely used as second‐line therapy for type 2 diabetes. Although their efficacy as antidiabetes agents is established, drawbacks include hypoglycaemia, weight gain and limited long‐term efficacy. Furthermore, data from some studies have suggested a possible association between sulphonylurea use and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. 12, 13, 14 Use of dapagliflozin‐containing treatment regimens as second‐line therapy may provide an alternative option to sulphonylureas, with a more favourable side‐effect profile and additional beneficial effects on body weight and blood pressure control. In a head‐to‐head study, dapagliflozin and a sulphonylurea (glipizide) demonstrated similar efficacy, with the benefits of sustained reductions in body weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP), greater glycaemic durability and a lower rate of hypoglycaemia with dapagliflozin compared to glipizide after 1 year of treatment. 15 These effects continued to be observed in extensions of up to 4 years. 15, 16, 17

1 INTRODUCTION

Although achievement of optimal glycaemic control is an important aim of type 2 diabetes treatment, available data indicate poor attainment of glycaemic targets in clinical practice. 1, 2 Clinical inertia, defined as failure to intensify anti‐hyperglycaemic therapy in a timely manner, 3 has been proposed as one explanation for these findings when sequential therapy is used. Although many factors contribute to clinical inertia, 4 this traditional sequential treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes, comprising stepwise addition of anti‐hyperglycaemic agents to initial metformin monotherapy in response to increased glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, may be a major reason why some patients experience delays in reaching their glycaemic goals. 5, 6, 7

An alternative approach to type 2 diabetes treatment is simultaneous combination therapy with anti‐hyperglycaemic agents that have complementary mechanisms of action, and therefore target multiple physiological defects. Several studies have shown that first‐line dual therapy, combining anti‐hyperglycaemic agents, had greater efficacy than the components as monotherapies, 8, 9, 10, 11 without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. In a 24‐week study in patients with baseline HbA1c 8.0% to 12.0% and in whom metformin failed, triple therapy achieved by concomitant dual addition of the sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin (highest dose of 10 mg/d) and the dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitor saxagliptin (5 mg/d) led to greater HbA1c reductions than the addition of either agent alone to metformin. 12 In addition, a recent 24‐week trial demonstrated that the same triple therapy combination had greater glucose‐lowering efficacy, and was associated with substantially lower incidence of hypoglycaemia, than glimepiride, a sulphonylurea, added on to metformin. 13

DURATION-8 (Phase 3 28-Week Study With 24-Week and 52-Week Extension Phases to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Exenatide Once Weekly and Dapagliflozin Versus Exenatide and Dapagliflozin Matching Placebo) demonstrated greater reductions in blood pressure and body weight in patients randomly allocated to the combination of dapagliflozin and exenatide than to either agent alone. Combination therapy with both an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1RA for glycemic management also accords with current T2D management guidelines, and in randomized, placebo-controlled trials, dulaglutide, liraglutide, and semaglutide have shown an additive glucose-lowering benefit over placebo.

4 DISCUSSION

In the clinical trial described here, in subjects with type 2 diabetes and mild renal insufficiency, sitagliptin improved glycaemic control to a greater extent than dapagliflozin. These data provide clinical trial evidence that can inform patient‐centered decisions for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and mild renal insufficiency. 9 While clinical trials have been conducted to study the safety and efficacy of various AHAs in patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2), there are limited data defining the safety and efficacy profile of these agents in the cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes and mild renal insufficiency (eGFR ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2).

The overall prevalence of patients with type 2 diabetes and mild renal insufficiency is estimated to be nearly 40% and prevalence increases with age (estimated to be nearly 50% in patients with type 2 diabetes ≥ 65 years of age). 1 Improved glycaemic control has been shown to reduce the risk of diabetic complications and to slow progression of renal impairment. 10 While metformin is the standard first‐line pharmacologic intervention for the management of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes, additional therapies, including oral agents such as an SU, a DPP‐4 inhibitor, or an SGLT‐2 inhibitor are often prescribed in patients with mild renal insufficiency to achieve glycaemic control. This paper provides data on the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin and dapagliflozin, in combination with other commonly used AHAs, in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild renal insufficiency.

DPP‐4 inhibitors are often used in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease because these agents maintain efficacy and demonstrate good tolerability across the spectrum of renal disease. 3 On the other hand, the efficacy of SGLT‐2 inhibitors is reduced in patients with moderate renal insufficiency and is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency. 11 These clinical observations are consistent with the distinct mechanisms of action of the two classes of agents. DPP‐4 inhibitors stabilize the incretins GLP‐1 and GIP, two peptides which stimulate the release of insulin in a glucose‐dependent manner, 12 while the mechanism of action of SGLT‐2 inhibitors depends on renal function. 13 However, until now, these two classes of AHAs have not been prospectively evaluated in a study limited to a population of patients with mild renal insufficiency.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in combination therapy: from mechanisms to clinical considerations in type 2 diabetes management [^115wsYoV]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires practitioners to periodically evaluate patients and intensify glucose-lowering treatment once glycemic targets are not attained. With guidelines moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach toward setting patient-centered goals and allowing flexibility in choosing a second-/third-line drug from the growing number of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved glucose-lowering agents, keen personalized management in T2D has become a challenge for health care providers in daily practice. Among the newer generation of glucose-lowering drug classes, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), which enhance urinary glucose excretion to lower hyperglycemia, have made an imposing entrance to the T2D treatment armamentarium. Given their unique insulin-independent mode of action and their favorable efficacy-to-adverse event profile and given their marked benefits on cardiovascular-renal outcome in moderate-to-high risk T2D patients, which led to updates of guidelines and product monographs, the role of this drug class in multidrug regimes is promising. However, despite many speculations based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, physiological reasoning, and potential synergism, the effects of these agents in terms of glycemic and pleiotropic efficacy when combined with other glucose-lowering drug classes are largely understudied. In this perspective, we review the currently emerging evidence, discuss prevailing hypotheses, and elaborate on necessary future studies to clarify the potential risks and benefits of using an SGLT2i in dual combination with metformin and triple combination with a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, or other glucose-lowering agent that is recommended by the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (i.e., a sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, or insulin) to treat patients with T2D.

1 INTRODUCTION

The alarming increase in the burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), augmented by an increase in the comorbid metabolic cluster of disorders, highlights the need for tailored interference that could target multiple mechanisms simultaneously. In this direction, combination therapies of different classes of anti‐glycaemic agents have emerged with complementary mechanisms of action, reduced doses of each component associated with minimal side effects. Therefore, to achieve a target treatment goal, the American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines recommend/suggest combinations of two (dual) or three (triple) anti‐glycaemic agents, inclusive of metformin (MET) (exception: with MET contradiction) for three‐month intervals.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology guideline recommends initiating dual and triple therapy in individuals with HbA1c levels of 7.5%–9.0% and > 9.0%, respectively.

The population with T2DM in India experiences high cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. Diabetes‐associated complications in India are rising. The prevalence of cardiovascular complications is significantly higher in Southeast Asia (42.5%) compared to global estimates (32.2%). Furthermore, chronic kidney disease is prevalent in 30–50% of T2DM Indian patients.

In contrast to polypharmacy, combination therapies offer simplified treatment regimens that reduce pill burden and improve treatment compliance, thereby enhancing therapeutic benefits. India has one of the highest out‐of‐pocket expenditures in the world, with low insurance coverage. As per the International Diabetes Federation, T2DM‐related health expenditure in India was USD 8.5 billion in 2021, which is projected to rise to USD 10.3 billion by 2030. There is a pharmacoeconomic need to provide affordable treatment for the management of patients with T2DM and modernize the use of generic treatments. This sets the rationale for the use of fixed‐dose combination (FDC) of multiple agents in T2DM management.

The primary aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that dapagliflozin, either alone or in combination with saxagliptin, is non‐inferior to titrated glimepiride, a sulphonylurea, in terms of glucose‐lowering effect in patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycaemic control with a maximum tolerated dose of metformin background therapy. Additional testing was undertaken to assess whether addition of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin is superior to glimepiride plus metformin, given that triple therapy regimens have previously been shown to be more efficacious than dual therapy. Other indicators of glycaemic control, metabolic parameters, body weight and blood pressure were assessed as secondary end points.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes is a complex progressive disease that makes achieving and maintaining glycaemic control a challenge. 1 The typical treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes comprises initial metformin monotherapy, with stepwise addition of further antidiabetes agents as glycaemic control worsens. 2 Most patients eventually require treatment with two or more agents to achieve or maintain their glycaemic targets. 3, 4

Sulphonylureas are widely used as second‐line therapy for type 2 diabetes, owing to their favourable efficacy as antihyperglycaemic agents and low cost. However, their disadvantages include an increased risk of hypoglycaemia, weight gain and poor durability of treatment efficacy. 5 Newer classes of oral antidiabetes drugs, including sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors, are promising alternative second‐line therapies to sulphonylureas. Results from clinical and observational studies suggest that the addition of these agents to metformin provides similar or superior efficacy and an improved side effect profile compared with the addition of sulphonylureas to metformin. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

The combination of dapagliflozin (DAPA), an SGLT‐2 inhibitor, and saxagliptin (SAXA), a DPP‐4 inhibitor, has shown superior efficacy when added to metformin compared with add‐on of either monotherapy alone. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Moreover, results from a recent German study demonstrated that the combination of DAPA, SAXA and metformin was associated with greater improvements in glycaemic control than glimepiride (GLIM; a sulphonylurea) + metformin. 20 However, there remains a need for further head‐to‐head studies to compare this triple therapy regimen with the combination of a sulphonylurea and metformin.

The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in glycaemic control with concurrent addition of DAPA and SAXA, compared with GLIM, in patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control on a maximum tolerated dose of metformin background therapy.

### Triple therapy with low-dose dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus dual therapy with each monocomponent, all added to metformin, in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes [^113kk2vV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Initiating simultaneous combination therapy at early stages of the disease, rather than by the sequential stepwise approach, may permit earlier achievement of glycaemic goals, more durable efficacy, and better preservation of β‐cell function than gradual treatment intensification, 14, 15, 16, 17 and might also enable a greater proportion of patients to meet their glycaemic targets than at present. However, there is still no clear consensus on whether the benefit‐risk profile of this more proactive approach is superior to the sequential approach, or on for which patients early combination therapy would be most appropriate. Indeed, clinical guidelines differ in terms of the HbA1c level at which initial combination therapy is recommended. A recent Consensus Report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommends the use of combination therapy in patients who present with an HbA1c level that is > 1.5% above an individualized HbA1c target, based on the knowledge that most oral glucose‐lowering therapies do not result in HbA1c reductions of > 1.0% when given as monotherapies. 18 By contrast, guidelines from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) recommend the use of initial combination therapy in patients with an HbA1c level ≥ 7.5%. 7

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of triple oral therapy using the lower dapagliflozin dose of 5 mg/d plus saxagliptin 5 mg/d plus metformin ≥ 1500 mg/d, versus dual therapy with each monocomponent (low‐dose dapagliflozin 5 mg/d or saxagliptin 5 mg/d plus metformin ≥ 1500 mg/d) in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.5‐10.0%). 12 Dapagliflozin 5 mg, a lower dose than was used in previous studies of this triple therapy combination, 12, 13 was chosen for this study because it is the recommended starting dose in the United States 19 and because entry criteria for HbA1c levels were lower than those in the previous studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite the availability of several classes of glucose‐lowering agents, HbA1c goal attainment is suboptimal in type 2 diabetes. Even patients who do achieve their HbA1c targets are unlikely to maintain glycaemic control in the long term without treatment intensification. 1

Metformin is the preferred first‐line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes. Current clinical guidelines recommend stepwise addition of other glucose‐lowering therapies as the disease progresses in order to maintain adequate glycaemic control. 2, 3 In patients with high baseline HbA1c, initial dual therapy is recommended, in an attempt to achieve glycaemic control more rapidly than with metformin monotherapy. While several classes of glucose‐lowering agents can be used in combination with metformin, sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors are of particular interest, owing to their favourable efficacy and safety profiles. In phase 3 trials, triple therapy with dapagliflozin (an SGLT‐2 inhibitor), saxagliptin (a DPP‐4 inhibitor) and metformin reduced 24‐week HbA1c to a greater extent than dual therapy with dapagliflozin or saxagliptin in combination with metformin. 4, 5, 6 A once‐daily fixed‐dose combination of 5 mg saxagliptin and 10 mg dapagliflozin is approved in Europe and the United States for treatment of type 2 diabetes.

The use of early combination therapy requires careful assessment of potential AEs. Each drug class has a specific AE profile, and combining agents from different drug classes has the potential to change these side effect profiles or to mitigate or cause additive adverse effects. In addition, the timing and sequence of the added agents may have an impact on the side effects. In this post‐hoc pooled analysis, we aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of triple therapy with dapagliflozin and saxagliptin added on to metformin. We also assessed the relative safety of concomitant add‐on or sequential add‐on therapeutic regimens.

Overview of Clinical Trials of FARXIGA in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

FARXIGA has been studied in adult patients as monotherapy, in combination with metformin, pioglitazone, sulfonylurea (glimepiride), sitagliptin (with or without metformin), metformin plus a sulfonylurea, or insulin (with or without other oral antidiabetic therapy), compared to a sulfonylurea (glipizide), and in combination with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (exenatide extended release) added on to metformin. FARXIGA has also been studied in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate renal impairment.

Treatment with FARXIGA as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, or insulin produced statistically significant improvements in mean change from baseline at Week 24 in HbA1c compared to control. Reductions in HbA1c were seen across subgroups including gender, age, race, duration of disease, and baseline body mass index (BMI).

Monotherapy

A total of 840 treatment-naive adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in 2 placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of monotherapy with FARXIGA.

In one monotherapy trial, a total of 558 treatment-naive patients with inadequately controlled diabetes participated in a 24-week trial (NCT00528372). Following a 2-week diet and exercise placebo lead-in period, 485 patients with HbA1c ≥ 7% and ≤ 10% were randomized to FARXIGA 5 mg or FARXIGA 10 mg once daily in either the morning (QAM, main cohort) or evening (QPM), or placebo.

At Week 24, treatment with FARXIGA 10 mg QAM provided significant improvements in HbA1c and the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared with placebo (see Table 7).

3.1 Patient disposition and baseline characteristics

The first patient visit for this study took place 22 December 2014 and the last patient visit took place 26 October 2016. The number of patients enrolled was 861; of these, 487 entered the lead‐in period and 461 were randomized to receive at least one dose of medication during the double‐blind treatment period (DAPA plus SAXA, n = 232; SITA, n = 229) (Figure S2). Of the 461 patients randomized, 411 (89.2%) completed the short‐term 26‐week treatment period, 402 (87.2%) entered the long‐term 26‐week extension period and 378 (82.0%) (DAPA plus SAXA, n = 198; SITA, n = 180) completed the study. Patient demographics and characteristics at baseline were similar across treatment groups (Table 1). Mean (± SD) baseline HbA1c was 8.8 ± 0.9% (73.0 ± 9.3 mmol/mol). More than 99% of patients in both treatment groups were compliant with the study medication (patients received ≥ 80% and ≤ 120% of planned drug doses).

Patients Inadequately Controlled on combination therapy with Metformin Plus a DPP4i

The combinations identified (plus background therapies containing metformin and a DPP4i) were dapagliflozin 10 mg (metformin + sitagliptin), dapagliflozin 10 mg (metformin + saxagliptin), empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg (metformin + linagliptin), titrated canagliflozin (metformin + sitagliptin) and ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (metformin + sitagliptin). No RCTs that included insulin as a comparator met the inclusion criteria for investigation as add-on to combination therapy with metformin plus a DPP4i. Only one RCT of a GLP-1 RA (liraglutide on background of metformin) met the inclusion criteria; as such, this study was included in a sensitivity analysis to explore the NMA's secondary objective. All included trials were placebo-controlled double-blind RCTs. Limited variability was observed in the baseline characteristics of the included studies.

Given the limited number of studies meeting the inclusion criteria of our study, it is important to note the elements of heterogeneity in study designs that should be considered when interpreting the findings. In addition to metformin, study participants had differing DPP4i background therapies, requiring an assumption of a non-differential impact of underlying DPP4i therapy. Further, in the study of Rodbard et al. the patients underwent dose titration of canagliflozin (84.5% titrated from 100 to 300 mg), complicating the ability of the authors to interpret a distinct low or distinct high dose. Finally, patients randomized into the liraglutide arm in the study of Bailey et al. (included in sensitivity analysis 1) discontinued sitagliptin and commenced liraglutide with weekly dose escalation until the maintenance dose of 1.8 mg/day was reached.

### Efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of dapagliflozin and linagliptin (AJU-A51) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase III study [^111THuEp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a chronic disease that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Based on its long‐standing evidence of efficacy, cost, weight neutrality, and favourable safety profile, metformin is traditionally recommended as the first‐line oral antidiabetic medication for T2D. Since 2010, metformin has consistently been the most prescribed antidiabetic medication. However, because T2D has a progressive course, many patients need multiple antidiabetic medications to achieve their glycaemic goals. Clinical guidelines provide several recommendations for second‐line drugs after metformin, each considering the individual's clinical characteristics, including cardiovascular risk, weight management goals, side effects, and preferences. The combination of metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitor is predominantly used as dual therapy for T2D in Korea. Linagliptin is one of the most frequently prescribed DPP‐4 inhibitors. Compared with other DPP‐4 inhibitors, linagliptin is mainly eliminated through nonrenal pathways. Thus, dosage adjustments are unnecessary for patients with impaired renal function.

Despite the widespread use of dual therapy, the rate of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) control has not significantly improved. Various medications can be added as a third option when glycaemic control with metformin and a DPP‐4 inhibitor is inadequate (HbA1c > 7%). However, there is no consensus regarding the optimal choice for third‐line therapy because there is insufficient evidence supporting the use of one medication over another. Although previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of triple combinations involving a sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor with metformin and a DPP‐4 inhibitor, the specific effect of adding dapagliflozin to linagliptin and metformin remains unknown. Additionally, the efficacy of dapagliflozin and linagliptin fixed‐dose combination (FDC) has not yet been evaluated in patients with dual antidiabetic therapy.

In this phase III trial, the efficacy and safety of add‐on dapagliflozin in the form of a dapagliflozin/linagliptin FDC in patients with T2D who had inadequate glycaemic control with metformin and linagliptin were investigated.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus insulin glargine over 52 weeks as add-on to metformin with or without sulphonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, parallel-design, open-label, phase 3 trial [^115z5tov]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metformin monotherapy frequently proves inadequate for glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), necessitating additional glucose‐lowering agents. 1, 2, 3, 4 A patient‐centric approach is recommended to select an appropriate add‐on therapy. 5 Injectable insulin may not appeal to the patient and is associated with body weight (BW) gain and an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The ideal oral add‐on antihyperglycaemic agent should have long‐term efficacy, attain glycated haemoglobin A 1c (HbA1c) targets without hypoglycaemia through complementary mechanisms of action, 5, 6 and achieve BW reduction or neutrality.

Studies have reported that the sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitor (SGLT‐2i) dapagliflozin (DAPA) plus the dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor (DPP‐4i) saxagliptin (SAXA) in combination with metformin provides superior HbA1c reductions versus either agent added to metformin alone, with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and BW gain. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 The risk of genital infection is lower in treatment regimens with the combination of DAPA + SAXA than DAPA monotherapy. 13 However, validation is needed to determine the long‐term efficacy of DAPA + SAXA versus injectable insulin as an add‐on to metformin therapy in patients with T2D.

This Phase 3 study is part of a clinical programme supporting the development of a fixed‐dose combination (FDC) of DAPA 10 mg and SAXA 5 mg for T2D management. In an earlier 24‐week randomized trial, in patients with T2D that were inadequately controlled on metformin with or without sulphonylurea, co‐administration with DAPA + SAXA was non‐inferior to co‐administration with insulin glargine (INS) in achieving HbA1c reductions and reducing BW gain and hypoglycaemia. 14 In the 28‐week extension, we compared the efficacy, tolerability and safety of DAPA + SAXA versus INS over 52 weeks with respect to HbA1c, BW and glycaemic control in patients with T2D that were inadequately controlled on metformin with or without sulphonylurea.

### Triple therapy with low-dose dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus dual therapy with each monocomponent, all added to metformin, in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes [^113vfdjZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The incidence of hypoglycaemia was generally low across groups, consistent with previous studies and the mechanisms of action of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin. 31, 32 Although hypoglycaemic incidence was higher with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin plus metformin than with addition of either monocomponent to metformin, these events were mild and easily managed. Only two cases of hypoglycaemia in the whole study met the ADA criteria for severe hypoglycaemic events (one in each of the dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin plus metformin and the dapagliflozin plus metformin treatment groups), and the glucose levels reported during these events were not consistent with levels typically associated with severe hypoglycaemia. Moreover, no participant discontinued the study as a consequence of hypoglycaemia.

Current treatment guidelines offer differing perspectives on the most appropriate time to initiate and advance therapy with a combination of agents given simultaneously in participants with type 2 diabetes. Guidelines from the AACE recommend initiation of dual therapy as first‐line treatment in patients with HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and triple therapy as first‐line treatment in patients with HbA1c ≥ 9.0%, 7 whereas the recent consensus statement from the ADA and the EASD advises use of dual combination therapy if a patient is > 1.5% above their target HbA1c level. 18 There is a growing argument that treating the disease more aggressively at earlier stages than is current practice may slow disease progression. 33 In the past, a less aggressive approach to treatment intensification might have been justified as avoiding the adverse consequences of hypoglycaemia with drugs such as sulphonylureas. 34 However, the risk of hypoglycaemia is very low with newer anti‐hyperglycaemic drugs such as SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP‐4 inhibitors, so safety would be less of a concern when these are used as part of combination treatment regimens. 35

### Dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin add-on therapy compared with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes poorly controlled by metformin with or without sulfonylurea therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^113pPHdP]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study evaluated whether an oral combination of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor achieved glycemic control similar to basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes, poorly controlled with metformin, without increasing hypoglycemia or body weight.

Research Design and Methods

In a multinational, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov reg. no. NCT02551874), adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin, with or without sulfonylurea, were randomized (1:1) to receive dapagliflozin (DAPA) plus saxagliptin (SAXA) or titrated insulin glargine (INS). The primary end point was change in glycated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) from baseline to week 24. DAPA + SAXA treatment was tested for noninferiority versus INS.

Results

The efficacy data set included 643 patients (mean ± SD HbA 1c, 9.1 ± 1.0% [75 ± 11 mmol/mol]). At week 24, DAPA + SAXA treatment versus INS resulted in noninferior reductions in HbA 1c (adjusted mean ± SE change, -1.7 ± 0.1% vs. -1.5 ± 0.1% [18.3 ± 0.7 mmol/mol vs. 16.8 ± 0.7 mmol/mol]; P = 0.118), significantly different body weight change (between-group difference, -3.64 kg [95% CI -4.20 to -3.09]; P < 0.001), fewer patients with confirmed hypoglycemia (21.3% vs. 38.4%, P < 0.001), more patients achieving HbA 1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) without hypoglycemia (20.9% vs. 13.1%, P = 0.008), and a similar proportion of patients achieving HbA 1c < 7.0% (33.2% vs. 33.5%, P = 0.924). Mean reductions in 24-h glucose measurements from baseline to week 2 were greater with DAPA + SAXA than with INS (P < 0.0001). No patients in the DAPA + SAXA group and three patients (0.9%) in the INS group experienced severe hypoglycemia.

Conclusions

Adding DAPA + SAXA to insulin-naive patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes achieved similar glycemic control, a lower risk of hypoglycemia, and a clinically relevant body weight difference compared with basal INS.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design

This multinational, randomized, double‐blind, active‐controlled, double‐dummy parallel‐group phase 3b trial (Identifier: NCT02284893) was conducted in Hungary, Mexico, Poland, Romania, South Africa and the United States, in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol and its amendments were reviewed and approved by an Independent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board at each study site, and all patients provided written informed consent.

The study comprised a 2‐week screening period, a 2‐week lead‐in period, an initial 26‐week randomized, double‐blind treatment period, and an extension 26‐week site‐blind and patient‐blind treatment period (Figure S1). During the lead‐in period, patients continued to receive background MET medication (≥ 1500 mg/d). After completing the lead‐in period, eligible patients were randomized (1:1) using an interactive voice‐response system to receive a combination of DAPA (10 mg/d) and SAXA (5 mg/d) or SITA (100 mg/d), in addition to their regular MET dose for 26 weeks. After completing the 26‐week double‐blind treatment period, patients entered the extension 26‐week site‐ and patient‐blind treatment period, during which they received the same blinded study treatment as during the initial 26‐week period in addition to their regular MET dose. Study sites and patients were blinded to the treatment during the extension period, but the study sponsor's delegate, Bristol‐Myers Squibb, was unblinded.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Guidelines recommend combination therapies with glucose‐lowering agents to manage the progressive nature of T2D when metformin monotherapy fails to achieve or sustain glycaemic control. 5 To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an FDC of DAPA + SAXA versus INS in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin with or without sulphonylurea over a long period (52 weeks). The mean total daily insulin dose at week 52 in the current study was 37.9 U, which was lower than that reported in most treat‐to‐target studies where the daily insulin dose varied between 37 and 62 U. 17, 18, 19, 20 Glycaemic endpoint in the INS arm is dependent on the aggressiveness of the insulin dose titration. However, although hypoglycaemia is relatively rare at insulin initiation, it is essential to achieve a balance between a lower glucose level and hypoglycaemic risk. In the current study, a proportion of patients without hypoglycaemia did not achieve target HbA1c levels, indicating that the insulin titrations could have been more aggressive. However, daytime glucose control was crucial, as approximately 50% of patients receiving insulin had hypoglycaemia, which would probably have become pronounced with a more aggressive titration schedule. FDCs with different classes of glucose‐lowering agents are advantageous over monotherapies, as they enhance adherence to therapy and reduce treatment burden, improve glycaemic control, increase patient satisfaction and lower healthcare costs. 21, 22 An FDC therapy with DAPA + SAXA differs from the other classes of antihyperglycaemic drugs by its complementary mechanism of action, low risk for hypoglycaemia without increasing the risk of BW gain, 10, 23, 24 and no requirement for dose titration, which simplifies the therapy compared with insulin. Results of our short‐term trial showed that oral combination therapy with DAPA 10 mg and SAXA 5 mg resulted in non‐inferior reductions in HbA1c, with a beneficial BW profile and a lower prevalence of hypoglycaemia versus insulin, regardless of the presence or absence of background sulphonylurea. 14 The current extension study demonstrated the sustained efficacy of oral combination therapy with DAPA + SAXA as add‐on to metformin with or without sulphonylurea over 52 weeks in reducing HbA1c and BW from baseline, with a lower prevalence of hypoglycaemia versus INS. These results were consistent with those of a previous 52‐week study comparing DAPA with sulphonylureas as add‐ons to metformin therapy; hypoglycaemic events with DAPA were significantly lower versus sulphonylureas. 25

Combination Therapy with Exenatide-Extended Release as Add-On to Metformin

A total of 694 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c ≥ 8.0 and ≤ 12.0%) on metformin, were evaluated in a 28-week double-blind, active-controlled trial to compare dapagliflozin in combination with exenatide extended-release (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) to dapagliflozin alone and exenatide extended-release alone, as add-on to metformin (NCT02229396). Patients on metformin at a dose of at least 1,500 mg per day were randomized following a 1-week placebo lead-in period to receive either dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily (QD) in combination with exenatide extended-release 2 mg once weekly (QW), dapagliflozin 10 mg QD, or exenatide extended–release 2 mg QW.

At Week 28, dapagliflozin in combination with exenatide extended-release provided statistically significantly greater reductions in HbA1c (-1.77%) compared to dapagliflozin alone (-1.32%, p = 0.001) and exenatide extended-release alone (-1.42%, p = 0.012). Dapagliflozin in combination with exenatide extended-release provided statistically significantly greater reductions in FPG (-57.35 mg/dL) compared to dapagliflozin alone (-44.72 mg/dL, p = 0.006) and exenatide extended-release alone (-40.53, p < 0.001).

Use in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Moderate Renal Impairment

Dapagliflozin was assessed in two placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate renal impairment.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and an eGFR between 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2inadequately controlled on current diabetes therapy participated in a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT02413398). Patients were randomized to either dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo, administered orally once daily. At Week 24, dapagliflozin provided statistically significant reductions in HbA1c compared with placebo (Table 13).

### A randomized clinical trial of the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin compared with dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild renal insufficiency: the compoSIT-R study [^11361Sgd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common complication of type 2 diabetes. While the prevalence of moderate or severe renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², CKD stages 3‐5) in patients with type 2 diabetes has been estimated at approximately 22%, a larger proportion (38%) have mild renal insufficiency (eGFR ≥ 60 and < 90 mL/min/1.73 m², stage 2). 1 These rates increased in those with type 2 diabetes ≥ 65 years of age, among whom 43% have moderate or severe renal insufficiency and 48% have mild renal insufficiency. 1 While it is widely recognized that the choice of an antihyperglycaemic agent (AHA) for treatment of type 2 diabetes should be influenced by renal function, only CKD stages 3‐5 are usually considered relevant to that decision. 2 Additionally, clinical studies in patients with CKD are usually focused on patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2. While patients with type 2 diabetes and mild renal insufficiency are typically included in Phase III studies of antihyperglycaemic therapies, the specific impact of mild renal insufficiency on the efficacy and safety of most AHAs has not generally been prospectively evaluated in clinical trials.

Among the classes of oral AHAs available for treatment of type 2 diabetes, dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors are considered both efficacious and well tolerated across the range of renal function, although dose adjustment to control drug exposure is sometimes required. 3 In contrast, the sodium/glucose transporter‐2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitors have reduced efficacy in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency due to their mechanism of action. 4

The CompoSIT‐R (comparison of sitagliptin with dapagliflozin in mild renal impairment) study was a prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of the DPP‐4 inhibitor sitagliptin with the SGLT‐2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild renal insufficiency.

### Cost-effectiveness of liraglutide versus dapagliflozin for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the UK [^113czXtn]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

This study used the CORE Diabetes Model (CDM), a widely published and previously validated simulation model. The CDM estimates long-term health and cost outcomes of interventions in diabetes taking into account population characteristics at baseline and accounting for evolution of a range of micro- and macrovascular complications over a set time horizon. Model outputs include economic consequences, incidence of complications, life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).

The interventions included in the study were the daily GLP-1RA liraglutide 1.2 mg daily and liraglutide 1.8 mg daily and the SGLT-2i dapagliflozin 10 mg daily. The current analyses assessed the interventions as dual or triple therapies in the management of patients with T2DM in the UK.

Patient baseline characteristics for the dual therapy analysis, including glycemia, cardiovascular risk factors, and the presence of existing diabetic complications, were taken from the NN2211–1860 study, Table 1. This was an international, open-label, randomized trial of patients with T2DM who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin and who were randomized to receive 1.2 or 1.8 mg liraglutide once daily, subcutaneously or 100 mg sitagliptin once daily, orally. Patient baseline characteristics for the triple therapy analysis were derived from the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes 4 (LEAD-4) study, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial in which patients were randomized to receive 1.2 or 1.8 mg of once-daily liraglutide or liraglutide placebo injected subcutaneously in combination with metformin and rosiglitazone in all three treatment groups. The proportion of smokers and alcohol consumption data were not available from the trials and were obtained from the World Health Organization and Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) statistics on smoking.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors: is there a role in type 1 diabetes mellitus management? [^117RNmaW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to identify and evaluate disease management of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who were treated with a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor as an adjunct to insulin therapy.

Data Sources

A PubMed (1969 to March 2017) and Ovid (1946 to March 2017) search was performed for articles published utilizing the following MESH terms: canagliflozin, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, type 1 diabetes mellitus, insulin dependent diabetes, insulin, sodium-glucose transporter 2. There were no limitations placed on publication type.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles were evaluated for association of SGLT-2 inhibitors and type 1 diabetes. Further studies were identified by review of pertinent manuscript bibliographies.

Data Synthesis

All 3 SGLT-2 inhibitors, when combined with insulin, resulted in an overall reduction of hemoglobin A1C (up to 0.49%), lower total daily insulin doses, and a reduction in weight (up to 2.7 kg). The combination therapy of insulin and SGLT-2 inhibitors also resulted in a lower incidence of hypoglycemia. Study duration varied from 2 to 18 weeks.

Conclusion

A review of the identified literature indicated that there is a potential role for the combination of SGLT-2 inhibitors with insulin in T1DM for improving glycemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. The short duration and small sample sizes limit the ability to fully evaluate the incidences of diabetic ketoacidosis and urogenital infections. The risks associated with this combination of medications require further evaluation.

Systematic review methodology

A systematic review was conducted, using a structured search (Additional file 1) via the OVID platform of the following electronic databases: CENTRAL (March 2013), Medline and Medline in Process (1946 to 9th April 2013), and Embase (1980 to 2013 week 14). The search strategy employed was set up to be sensitive, to ensure that all relevant publications would be retrieved by the search, although this strategy would also retrieve a high proportion of irrelevant abstracts which would subsequently need to be excluded during the screening process. In addition, the 2012 and 2013 (where available) conference proceedings from the following organisations were searched: American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Diabetes Association (ADA), American Heart Association (AHA), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), The Obesity Society and The International Diabetes Federation. The clinical trials registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) was hand-searched for unpublished trials. Citations were included in the systematic review if they met the pre-defined inclusion criteria (Table 1). The initial screening for relevant studies was based on the citation abstract and title. For the second stage, the full-text publication was retrieved and the citations were re-screened to ensure their eligibility for inclusion in the systematic review. Disputes as to eligibility were referred to a third reviewer (PF). A quality assessment of the included studies was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias.

Meta-analysis

All meta-analyses were conducted on a modified intent-to-treat population, which is defined as the set of patients who were randomised and received at least 1 dose of study medication. For some studies the efficacy analysis set was further restricted to those with baseline and ≥ 1 follow-up efficacy result. Due to the limited number of studies available, study arms were pooled by drug class to improve accuracy by increasing the amount of data available for each class-level comparison. The pooled summary measure for continuous endpoints is weighted mean difference (WMD) and for binomial outcomes is the odds ratio (OR). ORs were utilised in order to facilitate indirect comparisons using the Bucher method and the logit (log odds) model within the NMA. For continuous endpoints, both the mean and standard error were required for the meta-analysis. If the standard error was not reported then this was calculated from the confidence interval (CI) or the standard deviation (SD), or imputed from the observed standard errors using the method described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

### Sodium-glucose cotransport inhibition with dapagliflozin in type 2 diabetes [^116kxhW3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

This study demonstrated the clinical efficacy of inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption with dapagliflozin in type 2 diabetic patients and relative safety across numerous doses. Our results suggest that dapagliflozin, as the first in a new class of SGLT inhibitors, can improve glycemic and weight status of type 2 diabetic patients. Although we evaluated monotherapy, the insulin-independent mechanism of dapagliflozin may complement other type 2 diabetes agents that act through insulin signaling pathways and thus enhance combination therapy. Although human genetic case reports are reassuring, the chronic effects of pharmacologically induced glucosuria are unknown and require long-term assessment. On the basis of evidence to date, further clinical study of dapagliflozin is warranted to develop a more definitive benefit/risk profile for this novel therapeutic agent.

### Practical approach to initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes [^1179o7o5]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic condition characterized by a hyperglycemic state due to impaired insulin secretion and diminished insulin action in peripheral tissues. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, non-traumatic limb amputations, and chronic kidney disease. It is strongly associated with an increased risk of life-threatening cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Achieving optimal glycemic control remains a challenge due to several obstacles: the pathophysiology of diabetes, involving multiple deficiencies and/or resistances; low treatment adherence; clinical inertia; and resistance to implementing behavioral and lifestyle changes. Adverse events (AEs), such as hypoglycemia or weight gain, also contribute to the challenge. Traditional therapeutic approaches have been characterized by stimulating insulin secretion and/or improving peripheral insulin resistance. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin in the United States and Europe, and ipragliflozin, luseogliflozin, and tofogliflozin in Japan) are a novel and attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of T2DM.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The dapagliflozin and saxagliptin in combination with metformin has been studied in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled on metformin in the following studies.

Treatment with dapagliflozin and saxagliptin and metformin (combination or add-on therapy) at all doses produced statistically significant improvements in HbA1c compared to the active comparator or placebo study arms in combination with metformin.

14.1 Add-on Therapy with Dapagliflozin plus Saxagliptin in Patients on Metformin

Adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in 2 active-controlled studies of 24-week duration to evaluate therapy with 5 mg dapagliflozin/5 mg saxagliptin or 10 mg dapagliflozin/5 mg saxagliptin combinations on a background of metformin.

One study was a 24-week randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group study (NCT02681094) in T2DM patients with an HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 10.0%. Patients were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (≥ 1500 mg per day) for at least 8 weeks prior to being randomized to one of three double-blind treatment groups to receive 5 mg dapagliflozin and 5 mg saxagliptin added to metformin, 5 mg saxagliptin and placebo added to metformin, or 5 mg dapagliflozin and placebo added to metformin.

At Week 24, concomitant addition of 5 mg dapagliflozin and 5 mg saxagliptin plus metformin resulted in statistically significant decreases in HbA1c, and a larger proportion of patients achieving the therapeutic glycemic goal of HbA1c < 7%, compared to dapagliflozin plus metformin or saxagliptin plus metformin (see Table 8).

The adjusted mean change from baseline for body weight at Week 24, using values regardless of rescue or treatment discontinuation, was -2.0 kg for the 5 mg dapagliflozin and 5 mg saxagliptin plus metformin group, -2.1 kg for the 5 mg dapagliflozin plus metformin group, and -0.4 kg for the 5 mg saxagliptin plus metformin group. The difference in mean body weight between the 5 mg dapagliflozin and 5 mg saxagliptin plus metformin group and the 5 mg dapagliflozin plus metformin group was -1.6 kg (95% CI [-2.1, -1.0]).

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation, and approved by the relevant institutional review boards or independent ethics committees. All persons gave informed consent for both the short‐ and long‐term study periods before study inclusion.

Adult (age ≥ 18 years) male or female patients with T2D and inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 8% to ≤ 12%) receiving stable metformin therapy (≥ 1500 mg/day) with or without sulphonylurea (≥ 50% of maximal dose) for at least 8 weeks before screening were eligible. Study participants had body mass index (BMI) ≤ 45.0 kg/m 2 at screening and baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤ 270 mg/dL. Major exclusion criteria included type 1 diabetes, maturity‐onset diabetes of the young, secondary diabetes or diabetes insipidus, and a history of diabetic ketoacidosis or of renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min and serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL in men or ≥ 1.4 mg/dL in women). Participants were randomized 1:1 using an interactive voice response system stratified by sulphonylurea use with background metformin treatment to receive either DAPA + SAXA or INS for 24 weeks with a long‐term extension (Figure 2).

### Randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial of triple therapy with dapagliflozin add-on to saxagliptin plus metformin in type 2 diabetes [^1125MF7o]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with dapagliflozin versus that with placebo add-on to saxagliptin plus metformin in patients whose type 2 diabetes is inadequately controlled with saxagliptin plus metformin treatment.

Research Design and Methods

Patients receiving treatment with stable metformin (stratum A) (screening HbA1c level 8.0–11.5% [64–102 mmol/mol]) or stable metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (stratum B) (HbA1c 7.5–10.5% [58–91 mmol/mol]) for ≥ 8 weeks received open-label saxagliptin 5 mg/day and metformin for 16 weeks (stratum A) or 8 weeks (stratum B) (saxagliptin replaced any DPP-4 inhibitor). Patients with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c 7–10.5% [53–91 mmol/mol]) were randomized to receive placebo or dapagliflozin 10 mg/day plus saxagliptin and metformin. The primary end point was the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24. Secondary end points included fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level, 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG) level, body weight, and proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c level of < 7% (53 mmol/mol).

Results

Treatment with dapagliflozin add-on to saxagliptin plus metformin resulted in a greater mean HbA1c reduction than placebo (-0.82 vs. -0.10% [-9 vs. -1.1 mmol/mol], P < 0.0001). Significantly greater reductions in FPG level, 2-h PPG level, and body weight were observed, and more patients achieved an HbA1c level of < 7% (53 mmol/mol) with treatment with dapagliflozin versus placebo. Adverse events were similar across treatment groups, with a low overall risk of hypoglycemia (∼1%). Genital infections developed in more patients with dapagliflozin treatment (5%) than with placebo (0.6%).

Conclusions

Triple therapy with dapagliflozin add-on to saxagliptin plus metformin improves glycemic control and is well tolerated in patients whose type 2 diabetes is inadequately controlled with saxagliptin plus metformin therapy.

### Efficacy and tolerability of initial triple combination therapy with metformin, dapagliflozin and saxagliptin compared with stepwise add-on therapy in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes (TRIPLE-AXEL study): a multicentre, randomized, 104-week, open-label, active-controlled trial [^115uhgsj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of an initial triple combination therapy (TCT) compared with conventional stepwise add-on therapy (SAT) in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Materials and Methods

This multicentre, randomized, 104-week, open-label trial randomized 105 patients with drug-naïve T2D (with HbA1c level ≥ 8.0%, < 11.0%) to the TCT (1000mg of metformin, 10mg of dapagliflozin and 5mg of saxagliptin once daily) or SAT (initiated with metformin, followed by glimepiride and sitagliptin) groups. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who achieved an HbA1c levelof less than 6.5% without hypoglycaemia, weight gainof5% or higher, or discontinuation of drugs because of adverse events at week 104.

Results

HbA1c reduction from baseline at week 104 was similar between the groups (the least squares mean change was -2.56% in the TCT group vs. -2.75% in the SAT group). The primary outcome was achieved in 39.0% and 17.1% of the TCT and SAT groups, respectively, with a risk difference of 22.0 (95% confidence interval 3.0, 40.8; p = 0.027). HbA1c levelless than6.5% at week 104 was 46.3% in both the TCT and SAT groups, whereas the incidence of hypoglycaemia, weight gain, or discontinuation of drugs was 16.7% and 62.0% in the TCT and SAT groups, respectively (P < .001). TCT was well-tolerated and had fewer adverse events than SAT.

Conclusions

Among newly diagnosed patients with T2D, initial TCT effectively lowered HbA1c levels with higher tolerability and safety than SAT for 104weeks, suggesting a novel strategy for initial combination therapy in T2D patients.

### A randomized clinical trial of the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin compared with dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild renal insufficiency: the compoSIT-R study [^117CXsJL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The results of this clinical trial may be of particular interest to physicians treating older patients with type 2 diabetes. Age is associated with reduction in renal function, 21 and together with potentially longer duration of diabetes, older patients are likely to be at increased risk of microvascular complications 22 including renal impairment and other co‐morbidities. 23

A limitation of this study is that the results are relevant to the population studied and not necessarily to patients at other stages of CKD. Another limitation is that the study evaluated sitagliptin and dapagliflozin, and results cannot be extrapolated to other DPP‐4 or SGLT‐2 inhibitors. The strengths of this study are: its large sample size, which allowed a robust estimate of between‐group differences in efficacy; the requirement for duplicate eGFR measurements during screening that ensured a population with stable renal status; and uptitration of dapagliflozin to its maximal approved dose (achieved in approximately 95% of patients). Lastly, the CKD‐epi formula used to estimate GFR in this study is considered more accurate and less likely to underestimate GFR at higher levels of renal function (≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease estimate. 24, 25

In summary, in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild renal insufficiency who were inadequately controlled on metformin ± sulfonylurea, treatment with sitagliptin compared with dapagliflozin demonstrated greater glycaemic efficacy, a greater percentage of patients at glycaemic goal, and a good safety profile. Additional prospective studies, evaluating the safety and efficacy of other AHAs in patients with mild renal impairment, could be of value to prescribing physicians. Physicians and patients should consider the level of a patient's renal function, including mild renal insufficiency, when choosing antihyperglycaemic therapy.

### Impact of voglibose on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^117LaRe1]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The number of people diagnosed with diabetes worldwide has more than doubled since 1980 to nearly 350 million. The rise in prevalence of diabetes has been particularly rapid in Japan and is likely to have been fueled by changes in lifestyle. In Japanese medical practice there is an increasing use of combination therapy with multiple antidiabetic drugs in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Frequently an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor is a part of this treatment regimen. Voglibose is an oral antihyperglycemic agent of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor class that is widely used in the management of T2DM in Japan. Voglibose undergoes minimal systemic absorption and primarily functions within the gastrointestinal tract to decrease and delay the intestinal absorption of carbohydrate.

Dapagliflozin is a first-in-class selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor under development for the treatment of T2DM that improves glycemic control by reducing the reabsorption of glucose in the kidney and enhancing the urinary excretion of excess glucose. As with voglibose, the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin is independent of insulin secretion or action and efficacy, and its safety has been evaluated in a broad range of patients with T2DM as a monotherapy and as an add-on to metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, and insulin. Both dapagliflozin and voglibose effectively control postprandial blood glucose excursions in patients with T2DM. Thus, the co-administration of dapagliflozin with voglibose could potentially provide a complementary approach to glycemic control.

### Expert opinion: optimum clinical approach to combination-use of SGLT2i + DPP4i in the Indian diabetes setting [^115mXdqe]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The Asian-Indian phenotype of type 2 diabetes mellitus is uniquely characterized for cardio-metabolic risk. In the context of implementing patient-centric holistic cardio-metabolic risk management as a priority, the choice of various combinations of antidiabetic agents should be individualized. Combined therapy with two classes of antidiabetic agents, namely, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, target several pathophysiological pathways. The wide-ranging clinical outcomes associated with this combination, including improvement of glycemia and adiposity, reduction of metabolic and vascular risk, safety, and simplicity for sustainable compliance, are extremely relevant to the Asian Indian patient population living with T2DM. In this review we describe the available evidence in detail and present a rational practical guidance for the optimum clinical use of this combination in this patient population.

4 DISCUSSION

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of add‐on therapy with dapagliflozin vs glimepiride in metformin‐treated patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control. We considered two regimens: either dapagliflozin alone or in combination with saxagliptin, as a combination of an SGLT‐2 and a DPP‐4 inhibitor has been shown previously to lead to superior improvements in glycaemic control than that achieved with either agent alone.

For the primary end point of change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 52, non‐inferiority was demonstrated for the combination of dapagliflozin and metformin compared with glimepiride plus metformin. Superiority was met for this end point for triple therapy with dapagliflozin, saxagliptin and metformin vs glimepiride plus metformin. Similar trends were observed for key secondary end points; with dapagliflozin‐containing regimens, superiority was met for the proportion of patients reporting confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes during treatment, as well as for the change from baseline in total body weight at Week 52. Both dapagliflozin‐containing regimens decreased FPG from baseline to Week 52 to an equal or greater extent than glimepiride plus metformin. All treatment regimens were well tolerated, and the safety profile of the dapagliflozin‐saxagliptin combination was in line with that of the individual drugs, without additional side effects. Findings from this study are in accordance with those from previous studies of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin when administered as part of either dual or triple therapy with metformin. 6, 7, 11, 18 The results were also in line with previous head‐to‐head comparisons of dapagliflozin and other SGLT‐2 inhibitors vs sulphonylureas. 15, 16, 17, 19, 20

### Dapagliflozin as an adjunct therapy to insulin in the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^116VLxG9]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) is presently restricted to insulin and in selected cases, pramlintide and islet or pancreas transplantation.

In contrast the management of DM1 with oral drugs is limited. Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2I), as initial or in combination therapy have recently been used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). These drugs improve glycemic control, promote weight loss and lower arterial tension; meanwhile, SGLT-2 studies in DM1 are scarce or short-timed.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dapagliflozin in a group of patients with poorly controlled DM1. We expected that adding dapagliflozin to this population's insulin regimen, would improve their glycemic control.

Clinicians should be cognizant that combination of incretin therapies is not recommended. Antihyperglycemic medications should be titrated to the maximally tolerated dose and additional agents should be considered in a timely fashion to avoid therapeutic inertia.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive disease involving multiple pathophysiologic defects, and combination therapy is often required to achieve and sustain glycaemic control. Triple oral therapy with metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) has demonstrated high and durable glycaemic-lowering efficacy, favourable safety and tolerability, and additional metabolic benefits in T2DM patients with diverse background therapies, including those who are treatment-naïve and those with inadequate control on monotherapy or dual therapy. In light of the increasing clinical use of this triple regimen and the absence of established consensus to guide its use, the Diabetes Committee of the Chinese Research Hospital Association convened an expert panel comprising endocrinologists and evidence-based experts. Through a systematic literature review and a Delphi process, the panel formulated 11 consensus recommendations (8 strong and 3 weak recommendations) on the clinical use of metformin+DPP-4i +SGLT2i, including fixed-dose combination formulations. Safety considerations regarding its use were also described. This consensus aimed to provide clinicians with practical guidance to optimize the effective and safe use of metformin+DPP-4i +SGLT2i in T2DM management.

2.3 Treatments

The study design is shown in Figure 1. Patients receiving metformin monotherapy were randomized (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 treatment arms by a computer‐generated random sequence. These comprised dapagliflozin 10 mg; dapagliflozin 10 mg plus saxagliptin 5 mg; and glimepiride 0 to 6 mg (titrated). Matching placebos were used in each group and all study personnell were blinded to the randomization scheme during the study. Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin were taken orally, once daily, at fixed doses throughout the treatment period. Glimepiride treatment was initiated at 1 mg/day and was titrated upwards or downwards in 1 mg increments at subsequent visits, in accordance with prescribing information. The glimepiride/placebo dose was titrated to achieve an individualized FPG target, agreed by the patient and investigator at the start of treatment; a general target of approximately 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) was proposed in the study protocol. In order to reflect real‐life clinical practice as closely as possible, glimepiride titration was allowed for the duration of the study.

### Characterization of the open-label lead-in period of two randomized controlled phase 3 trials evaluating dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin in type 2 diabetes [^116peu6R]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

To examine the utility of sequential versus dual add-on approaches in patients who have type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control with metformin therapy alone, we characterized the efficacy and safety of dual therapy with dapagliflozin or saxagliptin added to metformin in the open-label lead-in periods of two phase 3 trials (study 1, NCT01619059; study 2, NCT01646320) that evaluated triple therapy in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

Methods

During the lead-in periods of each trial, patients [glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 8.0–11.5%] who had been receiving metformin ≥ 1500 mg/day for ≥ 8 weeks received metformin immediate release at an equivalent dose plus dapagliflozin 10 mg/day (study 1; N = 482) or saxagliptin 5 mg/day (study 2; N = 349) for 16 weeks. Efficacy end points were assessed at week - 2 before randomization.

Results

Mean change in HbA1c [95% confidence interval (CI)] from lead-in baseline (study 1, 9.3%; study 2, 9.4%) was - 1.6% (- 1.7, - 1.5) in study 1 and - 1.3% (- 1.5, - 1.2) in study 2. Mean changes (95% CI) from lead-in baseline in weight and fasting plasma glucose were - 2.4 kg (- 2.6, - 2.1) and - 47.5 mg/dL (- 52.8, - 42.3) for study 1 and - 0.5 kg (- 0.8, - 0.2) and - 28.5 mg/dL (- 35.8, - 21.2) for study 2. At the end of the lead-in period, 22.0% of patients achieved HbA1c < 7.0% in study 1 and 17.5% in study 2. Dual therapy was well tolerated, with hypoglycemia incidence < 1% in both studies.

Conclusion

Dual therapy improved glycemic control and was well tolerated; however, most patients required additional therapy to further improve HbA1c towards target, suggesting that an early move to triple therapy with oral glucose-lowering drugs rather than a stepwise approach may be beneficial for patients with high HbA1c levels on metformin therapy.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — evidence summary in T2D shows that SGLT2 inhibitors have emerged as important new oral therapies for patients with T2D, and Large, randomized controlled trials in patients with T2D have demonstrated that many of these agents reduce MACE in patients with established ASCVD and/or DKD, and reduce the risk of HF hospitalizations. The benefit of reducing HF hospitalizations reflected primarily prevention of symptomatic HF in T2D patients at high risk, as ~90% did not have HF at baseline. The benefits of an SGLT2 inhibitor in treating established HF were demonstrated in the DAPA-HF trial, in which dapagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of CV death or worsening HF, and improved HF-related symptoms in ~4,800 patients with HFrEF.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design

This was a 24‐week, multicentre, randomized, parallel‐group, double‐blind, active‐controlled phase III study (NCT02681094), conducted at 119 centres in Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, Russia, and the United States. Local regulatory authorities and the responsible ethics committees/institutional review boards of the participating centres approved the study protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization.

2.1.1 Participants

Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they fulfilled the following criteria: age ≥ 18 years; diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; stable metformin dose (≥ 1500 mg/d) for ≥ 8 weeks before enrolment; body mass index ≤ 45 kg/m²; fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤ 15 mmol/L (≤ 270 mg/dL); and HbA1c 7.5% to 10.0%. Major exclusion criteria included: a cardiovascular event in the 3 months before enrolment; moderate or severe impairment of renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL for men, or ≥ 1.4 mg/dL for women]); presence or history of severe (New York Heart Association class III and IV) congestive heart failure; and/or unstable or acute congestive heart failure.

Table 3
Cardiovascular risk categories in patients with diabetes

CVD, cardiovascular disease; DM, diabetes mellitus; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; T1D, type 1 diabetes; T2D, type 2 diabetes

a Proteinuria, renal impairment defined as eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, left ventricular hypertrophy, or retinopathy

b Age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and obesity

The order for management recommendations is based on the following:
When glycemic targets are not achieved with healthy lifestyle management alone, metformin should be preferred as the initial pharmacological therapy, unless contraindicated (when GFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2). Early intensive glucose control reduces progression of microvascular complications. When the HbA1c target is not achieved within 3 months, dual therapy can be considered with other classes of medication, including sulfonylurea, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonist, or basal insulin.
SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) offer high levels of CVD prevention and nephroprotection and hence can be considered as a primary recommendation in patients with high CVD risk
GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide) offer CV benefits.

Concomitant use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors is not recommended as this combination therapy provides marginal and nonsignificant glycemic control, offers minimal weight loss, and is not cost-effective. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are associated with a higher risk of incident HF (serious/severe) and should not be recommended in patients at risk of HF or with history of HF. SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin should be the first-choice drugs (Tables 4, 5).

Consultation with Specialists in Diabetes is indicated in the Following Cases

In case of hyperglycemia that is difficult to manage with drugs (patients with HbA1c above target even after combination therapy including two to three oral antidiabetic drugs), patients with atherosclerotic CVD, or patients at the beginning of complex (basal-bolus) insulin regimen.
In case of microvascular complications, such as diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy.
In the presence of hypoglycemia episodes despite adjustments in treatment where hypoglycemia is defined as glucose levels < 70 mg/dL (symptomatic or asymptomatic).

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and place in therapy of the fixed-dose combination (FDC) product, QTERN (dapagliflozin/saxagliptin) tablets.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE (1946 to July 1, 2017) were conducted using the keywords QTERN, saxagliptin, and dapagliflozin. Additional data were obtained from the prescribing information, the product dossier, and Clinicaltrials.gov.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English language articles related to pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of the combination therapy in human subjects were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin were not affected significantly when administered as an FDC product. Saxagliptin may suppress the increased secretion of glucagon associated with dapagliflozin. The combination dapagliflozin/saxagliptin has been studied as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The difference in hemoglobin A 1C (A1C) between saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin (triple therapy) and saxagliptin + metformin was -0.59 (95% CI = -0.81 to -0.37, P < 0.0001), and the difference between triple therapy and dapagliflozin + metformin was -0.27 (95% CI = -0.48 to -0.05, P = 0.0166). The combination was well tolerated when added to metformin.

Conclusion

QTERN (dapagliflozin/saxagliptin) tablets are a reasonable option for patients with T2DM not controlled on metformin, but cost, insurance coverage, and a lackluster reduction in A1C will likely limit its use until more data regarding its effects on complications of diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes become available.

### Ertugliflozin compared to other anti-hyperglycemic agents as monotherapy and add-on therapy in type 2 diabetes: a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^117VjzSk]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This evidence synthesis represents the first published NMA that compares the effectiveness and safety of ertugliflozin to other SGLT2is. Previous NMAs of the SGLT2i class conducted prior to the availability of ertugliflozin suggested differences in effectiveness, generally favoring canagliflozin.

The current analysis has several findings that may be informative to prescribers and healthcare policy-makers. Indirect comparisons for HbA1c reduction found that ertugliflozin 5 mg was associated with greater reductions in HbA1c than dapagliflozin 5 mg in patients uncontrolled on metformin alone, whereas ertugliflozin 15 mg was associated with greater HbA1c reductions compared to dapagliflozin 10 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg when added to the diet and exercise regimen and to the metformin regimen. HbA1c reduction associated with both doses of ertugliflozin were no different from that with the respective canagliflozin doses across all populations.

In this first study to compare SGLT2is as add-on to patients inadequately controlled on combination therapy with metformin plus a DPP4i, the results indicate that both ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg were more effective in lowering HbA1c than dapagliflozin 10 mg when added to a combination of sitagliptin + metformin. However, no significant differences were observed for the comparisons of ertugliflozin (5 mg or 15 mg) added to sitagliptin + metformin versus dapagliflozin 10 mg added to saxagliptin + metformin.

With the exception of a lower SBP for canagliflozin 300 mg in patients inadequately controlled with diet and exercise, ertugliflozin doses did not differ significantly from other respective low and high doses of other SGLT2is for the remaining outcomes across each population. In a sensitivity analysis among patients uncontrolled on combination therapy with metformin plus a DPP4i, no significant differences for efficacy outcomes were found between adding ertugliflozin to the regimen compared to a switch from sitagliptin to liraglutide.

SGLT2 inhibitor use to manage ASCVD, HF, and DKD risk in type 2 diabetes follows this algorithm: Patient is ≥ 18 years old with T2D and ≥ 1 of the following: ASCVD, HF, DKD, or at high risk for ASCVD. If the patient is pregnant or breast feeding, do not start an SGLT2 inhibitor (no safety data available). If the patient's eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m², do not start an SGLT2 inhibitor. If not, consider starting an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven ASCVD, HF, or DKD benefit; after a discussion incorporating patient-clinician preferences and priorities, if the patient wishes to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor, initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven ASCVD, HF, or DKD benefit. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin is appropriate. No dose titration is required. Adjust other antihyperglycemic therapies if necessary. Monitor response to therapy and consider further therapies for CV risk reduction, as indicated. This may include the addition of a GLP-1RA in the appropriate patient.

### Need for streamlined use of DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^1144GWas]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Regulatory agencies request an assessment of cardiovascular safety for all "new" oral anti-diabetic drugs in order to avoid possible negative effects on cardiovascular events. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors have emerged as a new therapeutic alternative for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but the several large post-marketing clinical trials have shown only a modest effect in glycaemic control and, more importantly, a neutral effect on total and cardiovascular events. Conversely a recent trial with empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, has shown significant effect on overall and cardiovascular mortality. Although glycaemic control is an important aspect of diabetes management, the results of the EMPA-REG outcome trial suggest that it is possible to develop anti-diabetic drugs that may exert an overall beneficial effect beyond the mere improvement of glycaemic control. While the regulatory hurdles should not be increased, there is the need for evaluation of the net clinical impact and cost effectiveness of all anti-diabetic agents. Therefore, a better collaboration among all stakeholders is needed in order to develop studies with endpoints that will be both clinically meaningful including appropriate follow-up, and economically relevant in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between dapagliflozin, a novel sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitor, and metformin, pioglitazone, glimepiride or sitagliptin in healthy subjects [^1148gWVy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

Dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion by selectively inhibiting renal sodium-glucose transporter 2, an insulin-independent mechanism of action that may be complementary to that of other oral antidiabetes drugs. The current studies assessed the potential for pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between dapagliflozin and pioglitazone, metformin, glimepiride or sitagliptin in healthy subjects following single-dose administration.

Methods

In open-label, randomized, three-period, three-treatment crossover studies, 24 subjects received 50 mg dapagliflozin, 45 mg pioglitazone or the combination, while 18 subjects received 20 mg dapagliflozin, 1000 mg metformin or the combination. In an open-label, randomized, five-period, five-treatment, unbalanced crossover study, 18 subjects first received 20 mg dapagliflozin, 4 mg glimepiride or the combination, and afterward 100 mg sitagliptin or sitagliptin plus 20 mg dapagliflozin. Blood samples were taken over 72 h of each treatment period. Lack of PK interaction was defined as the ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence interval (CI) for combination:monotherapy being within the range of 0.80–1.25.

Results

Co-administration of dapagliflozin with pioglitazone, metformin, glimepiride or sitagliptin had no effect on dapagliflozin maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) or area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Similarly, dapagliflozin did not affect the C(max) or AUC for the co-administered drug, except for slight extensions of the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means for glimepiride AUC (upper limit 1.29) and pioglitazone C(max) (lower limit 0.75). All monotherapies and combination therapies were well tolerated.

Conclusion

Dapagliflozin can be co-administered with pioglitazone, metformin, glimepiride or sitagliptin without dose adjustment of either drug.

### Expert opinion: optimum clinical approach to combination-use of SGLT2i + DPP4i in the Indian diabetes setting [^111BKvzh]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiological Approach to Diabetes Management

The "ominous octet" is the pathophysiological core of the mechanism of diabetes. As depicted in Fig. 1, various classes of agents act differently on different components of the "ominous octet".

Fig. 1
The "ominous octet" of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the target sites for glucose-lowering therapies. DDP-4i Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, GLP-1RA glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, SGLT2i sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors.

(Adapted from Chatterjee and Davies)

A "pathophysiological approach" using initial combination therapy with agents known to address the established defects in T2DM seems more rational. It is preferable to use combination therapies having complementary mechanisms of action that target different pathways addressing the multiple pathophysiologic abnormalities of T2DM. The complementary beneficial effect of this combination is depicted in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2

(Adapted from Scheen)

The presence of multiple pathophysiologic abnormalities dictate several important implications in the management of patients with T2DM.
Multiple drugs in combination may be required to manage the various pathophysiological abnormalities.
Drugs that target the known pathophysiological processes and help to counteract or reverse them should be considered.
Treatment should not be based on mere reduction of HbA1c, or just controlling fasting/postprandial blood glucose.
Intensive treatment should be started early to prevent or halt the progression of β-cell failure.
Few of the various pathophysiological abnormalities can be targeted with multiple anti-hyperglycemic agents, while few of the agents can target multiple pathways as well.

### Potential for combination of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^114zqXjn]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

In individuals with advanced type 2 diabetes (T2DM), combination therapy is often unavoidable to maintain glycaemic control. Currently metformin is considered the first line of defence, but many patients experience gastrointestinal adverse events, necessitating an alternative treatment approach. Established therapeutic classes, such as sulphonylureas and thiazolidinediones, have some properties undesirable in individuals with T2DM, such as hypoglycaemia risk, weight gain and fluid retention, highlighting the need for newer agents with more favourable safety profiles that can be combined and used at all stages of T2DM. New treatment strategies have focused on both dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, which improve hyperglycaemia by stimulating insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent fashion and suppressing glucagon secretion, and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which reduce renal glucose reabsorption and induce urinary glucose excretion, thereby lowering plasma glucose. The potential complimentary mechanism of action and good tolerance profile of these two classes of agents make them attractive treatment options for combination therapy with any of the existing glucose-lowering agents, including insulin. Together, the DPP-4 and SGLT2 inhibitors fulfill a need for treatments with mechanisms of action that can be used in combination with a low risk of adverse events, such as hypoglycaemia or weight gain.

2.1.2 Treatments

The study comprised screening and enrolment visits, after which participants completed a randomization visit, followed by a 24‐week, double‐blind treatment phase (Figure 1 A). At the randomization visit, participants were randomized (1:1:1) to one of three treatment arms using an interactive voice response system: (a) dapagliflozin 5 mg plus saxagliptin 5 mg, (b) dapagliflozin 5 mg plus saxagliptin placebo, or (c) saxagliptin 5 mg plus dapagliflozin placebo, each added on to the patient's existing metformin treatment. Participants, investigators, and study site personnel were blinded to treatment assignment throughout the study. Participants were eligible for open‐label rescue with dapagliflozin 10 mg/d plus saxagliptin 5 mg/d, or with insulin (the dose administered was at the investigator's discretion and based on the participant's need), from week 6 of the study onwards. The criteria for rescue medication were as follows: week 6, FPG > 15.0 mmol/L (270 mg/dL); weeks 6 to 12, FPG > 13.3 mmol/L (240 mg/dL); weeks 12 to 24, FPG > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL).

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115JdpUi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — adults with cardiovascular or renal disease — in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have cardiovascular disease or renal disease, we suggest that the addition of a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) be considered, even if individualized glycemic targets have been achieved. This recommendation is most applicable to patients who attain adequate glycemic control with monotherapy (i.e., metformin) or combination therapy with agents other than an SGLT-2 inhibitor or a GLP-1 RA; adding or substituting these agents could improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes but might pose an extra medication burden, and GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors both have discrete adverse event profiles. The Work Group systematically reviewed the evidence, categorized this as Reviewed, New-added, and stated that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA): We recommend initiating a patient-clinician discussion about SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1RA therapy at a follow-up visit for patients with T2D who have or who are at very high risk for clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and/or diabetic kidney disease (DKD). An SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit is recommended for patients with T2D and HF, especially heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or who are at high risk of developing HF, DKD, clinically evident ASCVD, or combinations of these. A GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit is recommended for patients with established or at very high risk for ASCVD. Patients with T2D may become eligible for these therapies if they are subsequently hospitalized or diagnosed with ASCVD, HF, and/or DKD, although hospitalized patients were not included in most CV outcome trials and inpatient formularies may not include these agents. Outpatient adherence after an acute CV event can be favorably influenced by initiation at discharge. CV specialists should consider periodic screening for T2D by measuring HbA1c at guideline-recommended intervals (e.g., annually in patients with prediabetes). Patients with ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD and/or HF should consider initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit irrespective of HbA1c levels. Although canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin have differences in FDA-approved CV indications, they appear to have broadly similar CV and renal benefits, and the choice of an individual agent should be made after appropriate patient-clinician discussion of benefits and potential risks.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Safety endpoints included the proportion of patients experiencing adverse events (AEs) and hypoglycaemia, as well as findings from physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and clinical laboratory evaluations. Hypoglycaemic events were classified, according to the 2013 American Diabetes Association recommendations, 21 as follows: severe hypoglycaemia (an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions); documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia [typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤ 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L)]; and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia [an event not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia but with a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤ 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Events could fall within more than one category. We also classified hypoglycaemic events as either "major", which was defined as a symptomatic episode that required third‐party assistance due to severe impairment in consciousness or behaviour, with a plasma glucose level of < 54 mg/dL (< 3 mmol/L) and a prompt recovery after glucose or glucagon administration, or "minor", which was defined as either a symptomatic or an asymptomatic episode, with a plasma glucose level of < 63 mg/dL (< 3.5 mmol/L), which did not qualify as a major episode.

### Canagliflozin compared with sitagliptin for patients with type 2 diabetes who do not have adequate glycemic control with metformin plus sulfonylurea: a 52-week randomized trial [^113So3C8]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

A limitation of this study was its 1-year duration, because longer-term studies will be needed to evaluate the durability of the effects of canagliflozin. This study enrolled subjects using background therapy with metformin plus a sulfonylurea and included subjects with a reasonably wide range of baseline A1C values; therefore, the findings may not be generalizable to patients using other AHA regimens or those with milder or more severe hyperglycemia at baseline. Additionally, studies including other AHAs as active comparators will be useful for evaluating the relative efficacy/safety profile of canagliflozin compared with other AHAs commonly used as third agents in combination therapy with metformin plus sulfonylurea.

In conclusion, canagliflozin significantly improved glycemic control and reduced body weight and systolic BP compared with sitagliptin over 52 weeks, with an increase in genital infections and osmotic diuresis–related AEs, but it was generally well-tolerated in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin plus sulfonylurea. These results support the potential value of canagliflozin in triple combination therapy with metformin plus a sulfonylurea for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.

In this study, hypoglycaemic events were categorized according to five definitions: (1) hypoglycaemic event, typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia, accompanied by blood glucose ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (≤ 70 mg/dL); (2) major hypoglycaemic episode, symptomatic event with blood glucose ≤ 3.0 mmol/L (≤ 54 mg/dL) with a need for external (third party) assistance; (3) confirmed hypoglycaemic event, typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia with a blood glucose reading of ≤ 2.8 mmol/L (≤ 50 mg/dL); (4) asymptomatic hypoglycaemic event, measured plasma glucose ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (≤ 70 mg/dL) without typical hypoglycaemia symptoms; (5) other hypoglycaemic episode, symptoms of hypoglycaemia without a blood glucose reading or with blood glucose > 3.0 mmol/L (> 70 mg/dL). Patients were eligible for open‐label rescue with basal insulin for the entire duration of the treatment phase (criteria for initiation of rescue therapy: weeks 0 to 12, FPG > 240 mg/dL [13.3 mmol/L]; weeks 12 to 24, FPG > 200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]; weeks 24 to 52, HbA1c > 8.0%). In patients who had not reached their maximum tolerated dose of glimepiride/placebo, up‐titration of glimepiride/placebo was attempted before rescue with insulin was initiated.

Cardiovascular outcome trials report "Empagliflozin and canagliflozin demonstrated reduction in MACE in CVOTs; empagliflozin also demonstrated decreased CV death and all-cause mortality" and "Empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin have shown a decrease in hospitalization for HF in their CVOTs". Regulatory indications include that "the FDA has given canagliflozin an indication to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with T2D and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria" and "Dapagliflozin based on the DAPA-CKD RCT has received an FDA indication to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with CKD at risk of progression". Consequently, "individuals with T2D at significant risk for or with established ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD should be treated with a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i with proven benefit for the individual's specific conditions".

### A treatment strategy implementing combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin results in superior glycaemic control versus metformin monotherapy due to a low rate of addition of antihyperglycaemic agents [^1171LzyK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

Combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin has shown superior efficacy compared with metformin monotherapy. In this study, we compare two strategies: initial combination therapy with sitagliptin/metformin as a fixed-dose combination (FDC) and initial metformin monotherapy, with the option to add additional antihyperglycaemic agents (AHAs) in either treatment arm during the second phase of the study in order to reach adequate glycaemic control.

Methods

We evaluated the sitagliptin and metformin FDC compared with metformin monotherapy over 44 weeks in 1250 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a two-part, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The initial 18-week portion (Phase A) of this study in which additional AHAs were only allowed based on prespecified glycaemic criteria, has been previously reported. Here, we present results from the 26-week Phase B portion of the study during which double-blind study medication continued; however, unlike Phase A, during Phase B investigators were unmasked to results for haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and directed to manage glycaemic control by adding incremental AHA(s) as deemed clinically appropriate.

Results

There were 1250 patients randomized in the study with 965 completing Phase A and continuing in Phase B. Among patients receiving sitagliptin/metformin FDC or metformin monotherapy, 8.8% and 16.7% received additional AHA therapy, respectively. Although glycaemic therapy in both groups was to have been managed to optimize HbA1c reductions with the option for investigators to supplement with additional AHAs during Phase B, patients randomized to initial therapy with sitagliptin/metformin FDC had larger reductions of HbA1c from baseline compared with patients randomized to initial metformin monotherapy [least squares (LS) mean change: -2.3% and -1.8% (p < 0.001 for difference) for sitagliptin/metformin FDC and metformin monotherapy groups, respectively]. A significantly larger reduction in FPG from baseline was observed in the sitagliptin/metformin FDC group compared with the metformin monotherapy group (p = 0.001). Significantly more patients in the sitagliptin/metformin FDC group had an HbA1c of less than 7.0% or less than 6.5% compared with those on metformin monotherapy. Both treatment strategies were generally well tolerated, with a low and similar incidence of hypoglycaemia in both groups and lower incidences of abdominal pain and diarrhoea in the sitagliptin/metformin FDC group compared with the metformin monotherapy group.

Conclusions

A strategy initially implementing combination therapy with sitagliptin/metformin FDC was superior to a strategy initially implementing metformin monotherapy, even when accounting for the later addition of supplemental AHAs. Sitagliptin/metformin FDC was generally well tolerated.

Type 1 diabetes adjunctive therapy — glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium–glucose cotransporter inhibitors — shows mixed benefits and safety/approval considerations. In T1D, liraglutide produced "a reduction of A1C of 0.4% with the highest 1.8 mg dose in addition to a 5 kg weight loss", yet "the added hypoglycemia and ketosis noted has resulted in no attempt for FDA approval in T1D". For SGLT2i/SGLT1/2i, "In one meta-analysis of 14 studies and with 4591 participants, A1C was reduced by 0.4% with a 2.7 kg weight loss", but "A 3.38-fold increased risk of DKA (often euglycemic, now generally defined as a BG less than 250 mg/dL) has resulted in no approval in T1D in the United States", although "the European Medicine Agency has approved dapagliflozin (5 mg) and sotagliflozin (200 mg) for those with T1D and a BMI above 27 kg/m2".

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors: This guideline reviewed no evidence on the combination use of GLP-1 RAs with SGLT-2 inhibitors. Whether these classes should be used as first-line therapy or as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with ASCVD is unclear, and large cardiovascular outcome trials included 71–82% of patients on metformin as baseline therapy. For adults with T2DM and ASCVD, a GLP-1 RA or SGLT-2 inhibitor with proven CV benefits should be a part of the treatment regimen, regardless of HbA1C, to decrease the risk of MACE.
