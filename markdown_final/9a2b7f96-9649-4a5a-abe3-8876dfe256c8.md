## Question

How do the risks and benefits of lovastatin compare with those of other statins?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the risks and benefits of lovastatin compare with those of other statins. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about a structured framework for comparison: lipid-lowering efficacy and outcome data. Then, I should verify safety and drug–drug interaction profiles. Next, I will compare lovastatin's potency with contemporary statins and examine guideline-concordant clinical positioning. Finally, I need to synthesize practical recommendations, while double-checking dosing constraints and interaction caveats that could shift therapy choices.

> Let me first confirm the evaluation framework so I don't jump to conclusions. Statin benefit largely tracks the absolute LDL-C reduction achieved and baseline ASCVD risk; more intensive LDL-C lowering produces greater proportional reductions in major vascular events, so potency and tolerability together shape clinical outcomes and guideline choices, which I need to keep front-of-mind as I compare agents [^117Jv7mj] [^115BLpbC].

> I will now examine lovastatin's lipid effects and dosing so I can anchor its intensity. Wait, let me verify typical LDL reduction: modeling estimates associate lovastatin with about a 34% LDL-C reduction and a 27% total cholesterol reduction, with a modest HDL-C increase, consistent with a moderate-intensity profile; the ER formulation is dosed 20–60 mg once daily for prevention, which squares with common use in moderate-intensity ranges [^112bThMD] [^112EuY8p].

> Next, I should review clinical outcomes for lovastatin to ensure it has event reduction data. The historical data, consistent with the AFCAPS/TexCAPS-era results in labeling, show a 37% reduction in first acute major coronary events in primary prevention, driven by fewer myocardial infarctions and unstable angina, with revascularization reductions as well; however, efficacy in very low-risk subgroups could not be adequately assessed due to few events, underscoring that absolute benefit depends strongly on baseline risk [^114U2yPB] [^114vgdhA].

> Hold on, I should verify the safety and interaction profile, because this often determines whether lovastatin is practical. Lovastatin is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4, so exposure rises with CYP3A4 inhibitors and certain transport inhibitors; the FDA label advises avoiding gemfibrozil and cyclosporine, and mandates dose caps with danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone, and verapamil (max 20 mg) and with amiodarone (max 40 mg), reflecting heightened myopathy risk under these combinations, which can blunt our ability to intensify therapy to reach LDL targets [^1111muP5] [^114Z9X4d].

> Let me consider broader safety signals so I don't miss class effects. Statins as a class slightly increase diabetes risk and can raise transaminases; dose-related transaminase elevations occur with higher doses of several agents including lovastatin, while simvastatin at its highest doses has more CK elevation risk, framing how we weigh intensity versus tolerability across the class [^1131XaAp]. I should confirm whether any statin-specific adverse event signals change the risk calculus; observational syntheses suggest atorvastatin and lovastatin can be associated with liver dysfunction, plausibly reflecting hepatic metabolism, but comparative certainty varies by statin due to data sparsity and dosing heterogeneity [^1165WqFB].

> Now, I need to compare potency across statins to contextualize lovastatin's efficacy. Rosuvastatin and atorvastatin are more potent, achieving larger LDL reductions at comparable doses; head-to-head and dose-ranging trials show rosuvastatin typically lowers LDL-C more than atorvastatin, and both outperform simvastatin and pravastatin, while lovastatin sits in the moderate range, broadly similar to simvastatin at mid doses but below high-intensity options [^111ha8wi] [^112GHh2m]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied lovastatin approaches high-intensity potency; that would be inaccurate — lovastatin's typical effect is clearly moderate, not high intensity, with roughly one-third LDL reduction, well below the reductions achieved by high-dose atorvastatin or rosuvastatin [^112bThMD].

> Next, I should review contemporary outcomes tied to intensity so the potency discussion translates to clinical impact. More versus less intensive statin regimens yield incremental reductions in major vascular events proportional to additional LDL lowering, and intravascular ultrasound data show that high-intensity atorvastatin 80 mg and rosuvastatin 40 mg can halt and even regress atheroma, supporting a strategy of maximal tolerated LDL reduction in higher-risk patients [^117Jv7mj] [^11652G9r]. Network meta-analyses in diabetes also rank high- and moderate-intensity rosuvastatin and high-intensity atorvastatin among top performers for non-HDL-C lowering, reinforcing the potency-outcome link in populations where absolute risk is high [^113b53Uo] [^116r7qcW].

> I should double-check guideline positioning so the comparative data align with practice. Major guidelines advocate risk-based intensity, with high-intensity statins for very-high-risk ASCVD and addition of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors if LDL-C thresholds or goals are unmet; in this landscape, lovastatin's moderate potency and heavy interaction burden limit its role when high-intensity therapy is indicated or when polypharmacy raises CYP3A4 concerns [^113p5GKP] [^117T55DC]. But wait, what if high-intensity therapy is not tolerated or is contraindicated? In such cases, combination approaches with moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe can achieve greater LDL reduction than high-intensity monotherapy for some patients, providing an alternative path to targets, though MACE advantages are not consistently demonstrated across studies and heterogeneity is high [^115aXyE8] [^111JM65m].

> Let me reconsider drug–drug interaction management, because this often steers the statin choice more than potency alone. If CYP3A4 inhibitors or substrates like diltiazem, verapamil, or amiodarone are necessary, lovastatin's dose caps and myopathy risk argue for switching to a statin with fewer CYP3A4 liabilities, such as pravastatin or rosuvastatin, whereas if no interacting agents are present and moderate LDL lowering suffices, lovastatin may be reasonable and cost-effective, provided liver enzyme monitoring and symptom surveillance are maintained [^1111muP5] [^114Z9X4d] [^113xfs7R].

> I need to ensure practical steps are explicit. Start by estimating baseline ASCVD risk and LDL-C reduction needed, select intensity accordingly, screen for interacting medications, and choose an agent with a feasible safety/interaction profile; recheck lipids 4–12 weeks after initiation or change, escalate intensity or add ezetimibe if targets are not met, and consider PCSK9 inhibition in very-high-risk patients not at goal despite maximally tolerated therapy, aligning with outcome-driven LDL-C strategies [^117Jv7mj] [^117T55DC] [^113ycEJA].

> Pulling this together, I should confirm the bottom line without overgeneralizing. Lovastatin reduces LDL-C by about one third and has proven primary prevention benefits, but compared with modern high-intensity regimens it is less potent and more constrained by CYP3A4-mediated interactions and dose caps; therefore, in patients needing large LDL reductions or taking interacting drugs, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, or a non–CYP3A4 pathway statin with or without ezetimibe, is often a safer and more effective path to guideline-concordant risk reduction, whereas lovastatin can still be considered for moderate-intensity needs when interactions are absent and tolerability is prioritized [^114U2yPB] [^112bThMD] [^1111muP5] [^117Jv7mj] [^111ha8wi].

---

Lovastatin provides **moderate LDL-C lowering** [^112bThMD] and **modest cardiovascular risk reduction** in primary prevention [^114vgdhA] [^114U2yPB], but is less potent than atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and is not suitable for high-intensity therapy [^111ha8wi] [^117Jv7mj]. Its **CYP3A4 metabolism** increases interaction risk [^114Z9X4d] (e.g. with gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, diltiazem, verapamil, amiodarone), thereby raising the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis and necessitating dose limits or avoidance [^1111muP5]. Lovastatin is appropriate for patients needing moderate LDL-C reduction without complex comorbidities or polypharmacy [^115BLpbC]. For high-risk patients or those needing > 50% LDL-C reduction, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin are preferred due to greater potency and fewer interactions [^112mFCb6] [^114Z9X4d].

---

## Cardiovascular benefits

Lovastatin has demonstrated significant **cardiovascular benefits** in clinical trials [^114vgdhA], particularly in primary prevention settings, reducing the risk of first acute major coronary events by 37% compared to placebo (3.5% vs. 5.5%; p < 0.001) [^114U2yPB]. It also reduced **secondary endpoints** including unstable angina (32%), myocardial infarction (40%), and coronary revascularization procedures (33%) [^114U2yPB].

However, lovastatin's **LDL-C lowering efficacy** is moderate compared to other statins, with **LDL-C reduction** of approximately 21–27% at typical doses (20–40 mg/day). As it is not classified as **high-intensity therapy**, it is less effective at achieving aggressive LDL-C targets than atorvastatin or rosuvastatin.

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Lovastatin is **generally well tolerated**, but several adverse effects and risks warrant consideration [^115BLpbC]:

- **Muscle-related side effects**: Myalgia, myopathy, and rare rhabdomyolysis are associated with lovastatin, particularly at higher doses or when combined with interacting medications [^1131XaAp].

- **Liver enzyme elevations**: Lovastatin, like other statins, can cause transient elevations in liver enzymes, though clinically significant hepatotoxicity is rare [^1135fR4o].

- **Diabetes risk**: Statins, including lovastatin, have been associated with a modest increase in new-onset diabetes, particularly in patients with predisposing risk factors [^1131XaAp].

---

## Drug interactions

Lovastatin is metabolized mainly by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (**CYP3A4**) system, making it susceptible to significant drug interactions [^114Z9X4d]:

- **CYP3A4 inhibitors**: Strong inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, ritonavir) significantly increase lovastatin plasma concentrations, raising the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [^114Z9X4d].

- **Gemfibrozil**: Combined use with gemfibrozil should be avoided due to increased risk of myopathy [^1111muP5].

- **Other lipid-lowering drugs**: Caution is advised when combining lovastatin with other fibrates or high-dose niacin due to increased myopathy risk [^1111muP5].

- **Cyclosporine**: Use with cyclosporine should be avoided due to significant interaction risk [^1111muP5] [^114Z9X4d].

- **Dose limitations**: Lovastatin dose should not exceed 20 mg daily when combined with danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone, or verapamil, and 40 mg daily with amiodarone [^1111muP5].

## Comparison with other statins

Compared with other statins, lovastatin has distinct **advantages and disadvantages** [^111ha8wi] [^113b53Uo]:

| **Metric** | **Lovastatin** | **Atorvastatin** | **Rosuvastatin** | **Pravastatin** | **Simvastatin** |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| LDL-C reduction | Moderate (21–27%) | High (35–50%) | High (45–55%) | Moderate (25–34%) | Moderate-high (30–40%) |
| Cardiovascular benefit | Moderate | High | High | Moderate | Moderate-high |
| Drug interactions | High (CYP3A4) | Moderate (CYP3A4) | Low (minimal CYP) | Low (minimal CYP) | High (CYP3A4) |
| Muscle side effects | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Low | Moderate-high |
| Diabetes risk | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Low | Moderate |

---

Lovastatin's primary disadvantages relative to newer statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin) are its **lower potency** and **higher susceptibility to drug interactions** due to CYP3A4 metabolism [^111ha8wi] [^114Z9X4d]. Nevertheless, it remains a **viable option** for patients requiring moderate LDL-C reduction without complex comorbidities or polypharmacy [^115BLpbC].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized statin therapy** based on patient risk, LDL-C targets, and potential drug interactions [^113p5GKP]:

- **High-risk patients**: Atorvastatin or rosuvastatin are preferred due to their higher potency and ability to achieve aggressive LDL-C targets [^117Jv7mj].

- **Moderate-risk patients**: Lovastatin may be appropriate for patients requiring moderate LDL-C reduction without significant drug interaction concerns [^114vgdhA].

- **Elderly patients**: Lovastatin may be considered in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities or polypharmacy due to its moderate potency and established safety profile.

---

## Conclusion

Lovastatin offers moderate cardiovascular benefits and LDL-C reduction, making it **suitable for moderate-risk patients** without significant drug interaction concerns [^115BLpbC]. However, its **lower potency** and **higher susceptibility to drug interactions** limit its role in high-risk patients requiring aggressive LDL-C lowering [^114Z9X4d]. Clinicians should consider patient-specific factors, including cardiovascular risk, LDL-C targets, and potential drug interactions, when selecting lovastatin or alternative statins.

- **Gemfibrozil**: The combined use of lovastatin with gemfibrozil should be avoided.

- **Other lipid-lowering drugs (other fibrates or ≥ 1 g/day of niacin)**: Caution should be used when prescribing other fibrates or lipid-lowering doses (≥ 1 g/day) of niacin with lovastatin, as these agents can cause myopathy when given alone. The benefit of further alterations in lipid levels by the combined use of lovastatin with other fibrates or niacin should be carefully weighed against the potential risks of these combinations.

- **Cyclosporine**: The use of lovastatin with cyclosporine should be avoided.

- **Danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone or verapamil with higher doses of lovastatin**: The dose of lovastatin should not exceed 20 mg daily in patients receiving concomitant medication with danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone, or verapamil. The benefits of the use of lovastatin in patients receiving danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone, or verapamil should be carefully weighed against the risks of these combinations.

- **Amiodarone**: The dose of lovastatin should not exceed 40 mg daily in patients receiving concomitant medication with amiodarone. The combined use of lovastatin at doses higher than 40 mg daily with amiodarone should be avoided unless the clinical benefit is likely to outweigh the increased risk of myopathy. The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when amiodarone is used concomitantly with higher doses of a closely related member of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor class.

### Altoprev [^114U2yPB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Lovastatin immediate-release reduced the risk of a first acute major coronary event, the primary efficacy endpoint, by 37% (lovastatin immediate-release 3.5%, placebo 5.5%; p < 0.001). A first acute major coronary event was defined as myocardial infarction (54 participants on lovastatin immediate-release, 94 on placebo) or unstable angina (54 vs. 80) or sudden cardiac death (8 vs. 9). Furthermore, among the secondary endpoints:

- **Risk of unstable angina**: Reduced by 32% (1.8% vs. 2.6%; p = 0.023).
- **Myocardial infarction**: Reduced by 40% (1.7% vs. 2.9%; p = 0.002).
- **Coronary revascularization procedures**: Reduced by 33% (3.2% vs. 4.8%; p = 0.001). Procedures include coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.

Trends in risk reduction associated with treatment with lovastatin immediate-release were consistent across males and females, smokers and non-smokers, hypertensives and non-hypertensives, and older and younger participants. Participants with ≥ 2 risk factors had risk reductions (RR) in both acute major coronary events (RR 43%) and coronary revascularization procedures (RR 37%). Because there were too few events among those participants with age as their only risk factor in this study, the effect of lovastatin immediate-release on outcomes could not be adequately assessed in this subgroup.

These risk estimates assume no treatment with statin therapy. In order to estimate baseline risk in a statin user, we estimated pretreatment lipid levels, calculated risk estimates (as above) using these estimated pretreatment values, and then applied statin‐associated relative risk reductions to these pretreatment risk levels. For persons reporting use of pravastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, or fluvastatin, we estimated pretreatment lipid measurements assuming these medications had effects on total cholesterol (27% reduction), low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (34% reduction), and HDL cholesterol (5% increase); for persons reporting use of atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or pitavastatin, we assumed these medications had larger effects on total cholesterol (37% reduction), LDL cholesterol (48% reduction), and HDL cholesterol (5% increase); see Table S2 for tabulation of statin users in the NHANES target population.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin across doses (STELLAR trial) [^111ha8wi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this 6-week, parallel-group, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial was to compare rosuvastatin with atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin across dose ranges for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Secondary objectives included comparing rosuvastatin with comparators for other lipid modifications and the achievement of National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III and Joint European Task Force LDL cholesterol goals.

After a dietary lead-in period, 2,431 adults with hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol ≥ 160 and < 250 mg/dl; triglycerides < 400 mg/dl) were randomized to treatment with rosuvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; or pravastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg. At 6 weeks, across-dose analyses showed that rosuvastatin 10 to 80 mg reduced LDL cholesterol by a mean of 8.2% more than atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, 26% more than pravastatin 10 to 40 mg, and 12% to 18% more than simvastatin 10 to 80 mg (all p < 0.001).

Mean percent changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the rosuvastatin groups were +7.7% to +9.6% compared with +2.1% to +6.8% in all other groups. Across dose ranges, rosuvastatin reduced total cholesterol significantly more (p < 0.001) than all comparators and triglycerides significantly more (p < 0.001) than simvastatin and pravastatin. Adult Treatment Panel III LDL cholesterol goals were achieved by 82% to 89% of patients treated with rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg compared with 69% to 85% of patients treated with atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg.

All these meta-analyses support the pleiotropic properties of statins and confirm the multifactorial mechanism of action of statins. These effects may lead to statins becoming the most important cardiovascular drugs, both in primary and secondary prevention settings.

### Comparative tolerability and harms of individual statins: A study-level network meta-analysis of 246,955 participants from 135 randomized, controlled trials [^1131XaAp]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2013). Low credibility.

Our objective was to estimate the comparative harms of individual statins using both placebo-controlled and active-comparator trials.

- **Methods and results**: We systematically reviewed randomized trials evaluating different statins in participants with and without cardiovascular disease. We performed random-effects pairwise and network meta-analyses to quantify the relative harms of individual statins. We included 55 two-armed placebo-controlled and 80 two- or multi-armed active-comparator trials, comprising 246,955 individuals. According to pairwise meta-analyses, individual statins were not different from control in terms of myalgia, creatine kinase elevation, cancer, and discontinuations because of adverse events. Statins as a class resulted in significantly higher odds of diabetes mellitus (odds ratio: 1.09; 95% confidence interval: 1.02–1.16) and transaminase elevations (odds ratio: 1.51; 95% confidence interval: 1.24–1.84) compared with control. When individual statins were compared in network meta-analyses, there were numerous statistically detectable differences, favoring simvastatin and pravastatin. According to dose-level comparisons, individual statins resulted in higher odds of discontinuations with higher doses of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Similarly, higher doses of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin were associated with higher odds of transaminase elevations. Simvastatin at its highest doses was associated with creatine kinase elevations (odds ratio: 4.14; 95% credible interval: 1.08–16.24). Meta-regression analyses adjusting for…

### The benefits of statin therapy — what questions remain [^114mdTm9]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Early hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) trials provided the first evidence of the benefits of statin therapy in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). Outcomes data from more recent trials involving atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin have since expanded the patient population shown to benefit from statin therapy. Studies are evaluating the benefits of lowering lipid levels with statins to below goals, examining benefits in special patient populations, and evaluating the value of surrogate markers of CHD. Early trials provided a solid foundation of knowledge on the efficacy and safety of statins. Recent and ongoing trials continue to generate new data to resolve remaining questions in the fields of CHD prevention and lipidology.

### A comparative analysis of current lipid treatment guidelines: Nothing stands still [^113p5GKP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Lipid treatment guidelines have continued to evolve as new evidence emerges. We sought to review the similarities and differences of five lipid treatment guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, Canadian Cardiovascular Society, European Society for Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and U.S. Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense. All guidelines utilize rigorous evidentiary review, highlight statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and emphasize a clinician-patient risk discussion.

However, there are differences in statin intensities, use of risk estimators, treatment of specific patient subgroups, and consideration of safety concerns. Clinicians should understand these similarities and differences in current and future guideline recommendations when considering if and how to treat their patients with statin therapy.

### Relation of different measures of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to risk of coronary artery disease and death in a meta-regression analysis of large-scale trials of statin therapy [^1128rUUi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have established the efficacy of statins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. These benefits are often framed in terms of percentage reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline or percentage reductions between control and treatment groups. However, epidemiologic data suggest that the absolute intergroup difference in LDL cholesterol (ΔLDL(Control-Rx)) is the more informative measure.

A systematic review of large-scale trials of statins versus placebo, usual care, or active (lower dose statin) control was conducted to calculate updated summary estimates of risk reduction in coronary artery disease and all-cause mortality. Meta-regression analysis was used to ascertain the relations of different LDL cholesterol metrics to outcomes. In 20 eligible RCTs, there were significant overall reductions for coronary artery disease (odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.78) and mortality (odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.94), but with substantial variability in trial results.

ΔLDL(Control-Rx) was the strongest determinant of coronary artery disease risk reduction, particularly after excluding active-comparator studies, and was independent of baseline LDL cholesterol. In contrast, baseline LDL cholesterol edged out ΔLDL(Control-Rx) as the strongest determinant of mortality, but neither was significant after the exclusion of active-comparator studies. The exclusion of 3 RCTs involving distinct populations, however, rendered ΔLDL(Control-Rx) the predominant determinant.

### Comparative effectiveness of statins on non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol in people with diabetes and at risk of cardiovascular disease: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113b53Uo]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

To compare the efficacy of different statin treatments by intensity on levels of non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes, a systematic review and network meta-analysis was conducted.

- **Data sources**: Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase from inception to 1 December 2021.

- **Review methods**: Randomized controlled trials comparing different types and intensities of statins, including placebo, in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. The primary outcome was changes in levels of non-HDL-C, calculated from measures of total cholesterol and HDL-C. Secondary outcomes included changes in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol, three-point major cardiovascular events (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and death related to cardiovascular disease), and discontinuations due to adverse events. A Bayesian network meta-analysis of statin intensity (low, moderate, or high) with random effects evaluated the treatment effect on non-HDL-C by mean differences and 95% credible intervals. Subgroup analysis of patients at greater risk of major cardiovascular events was compared with patients at low or moderate risk. The confidence in network meta-analysis (CINeMA) framework was applied to determine the certainty of evidence.

In 42 randomized controlled trials involving 20,193 adults, 11,698 were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, the greatest reductions in levels of non-HDL-C were observed.

### Lipid-lowering efficacy of rosuvastatin [^117LHUmM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Rosuvastatin is one of the most potent statins and is currently widely prescribed. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of rosuvastatin on blood lipids.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective is to quantify the effects of various doses of rosuvastatin on serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides in participants with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease. Secondary objectives include quantifying the variability of the effect of various doses of rosuvastatin and the withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in the randomized placebo-controlled trials.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 10 of 12, 2014 in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1946 to October week 5, 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 week 44), Web of Science Core Collection (1970 to 5 November 2014), and BIOSIS Citation Index (1969 to 31 October 2014). No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of rosuvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data. WDAEs information was collected from the placebo-controlled trials.

- **Main results**: One hundred and eight trials (18 placebo-controlled and 90 before-and-after) evaluated the dose-related efficacy.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^113ycEJA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Although treatment with statins is the predominant approach for managing elevated LDL-C, statin therapy alone does not allow some patients to achieve LDL-C values of < 55 mg/dL. Some patients may not tolerate statins at higher intensities, and a minority may reportedly be intolerant entirely. Recent data have highlighted an important role for the nocebo effect in patients who perceive adverse effects following statin therapy. In some cases, even high-intensity statins may not suffice, necessitating supplementation with nonstatin agents, such as ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitors, to further optimize LDL-C reduction.

Recent real-world European data indicate that LDL-C goals are rarely met among very high-risk patients. Only 18% (approximately 1 in 6) of these patients achieved the 2019 European guideline LDL-C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L), whereas 39% met the 2016 goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). A prospective observational study in the United States, examining treatment patterns over two years in patients with ASCVD, identified that at two years of follow-up, 31.7% of patients overall had LDL-C levels < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). The increased use of nonstatin agents in combination with statins may help higher-risk patients meet the LDL-C levels recommended by guidelines.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin among patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack: A national registry-based observational study [^116kCyRx]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are the most widely used statins in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA); however, evidence on their effectiveness and safety during actual use is scarce. This study aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of initiating atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin among patients with ischemic stroke or TIA.

- **Methods**: This observational study was based on the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III), which recruited consecutive adult patients with ischemic stroke or TIA within 7 days from the onset of symptoms to enrollment between August 2015 and March 2018. The study identified 3322 adults aged ≥ 18 years who had a pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 and initiated atorvastatin or rosuvastatin on the day of onset. The primary outcome was the ideal outcome, defined by a mRS score of 0, at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included the ideal outcome at discharge, at 6 months, and at 12 months, along with 12-month stroke recurrence, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events.

- **Findings**: A total of 3322 eligible patients were identified, with 2605 initiating atorvastatin and 717 initiating rosuvastatin. The proportion of patients achieving an ideal outcome, as defined by a modified Rankin Scale of 0, was 44.63% in rosuvastatin initiators, significantly higher than 41.46% in atorvastatin initiators, with a relative rate of 1.12 (95% confidence interval 1.03, 1.22). Additionally, a greater percentage of rosuvastatin initiators attained the ideal outcome at discharge.

### Lipid-lowering therapy and risk of hemorrhagic stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115Wp3UB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and checklist for conducting a systematic review (see Supplemental Material) to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of LDL-C– and triglyceride-lowering therapies that reported hemorrhagic stroke (HS) risk or other outcomes related to HS, for example, intracranial hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICerH), and cerebral hemorrhage. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to be RCTs on human subjects older than 18 years, with more than 1000 participants, and to have reported HS events with at least 2 years of follow-up in the original paper or in one of the meta-analyses we cited. Two years is the minimum period required to see relevant effects of lipid-lowering on clinical outcomes and to detect rare complications. Our inclusion criteria align with those of the CTTC, so we could compare our results. This is important because CTTC is the most comprehensive evidence synthesis for statin trials. Such a comparison was done by previous meta-analyses of studies on lipid-lowering therapies.

We limited our search to peer-reviewed articles published in English and excluded duplicate data, secondary subgroup trial data analyses, post-trial follow-up studies, and trials not powered for cardiovascular outcomes. We defined statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK-9 inhibitors as LDL-C–lowering therapies, and fibrate and marine omega-3 supplementation as triglyceride-lowering therapies, as defined in the guidelines. We did not consider statins to be triglyceride-lowering therapies because statins are primarily prescribed for LDL-C lowering.

### Statin eligibility in primary prevention: From a risk-based strategy to a personalized approach based on the predicted benefit [^117PxV5a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines have recommended statin initiation based on the absolute cardiovascular risk. We tested the hypothesis that a strategy based on the predicted cardiovascular benefit, compared with the risk-based approach, modifies statin eligibility and the estimated benefit in a population in primary cardiovascular prevention. The study included 16,008 subjects (48 ± 6 years, 73% men) with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 70 to < 190 mg/dl, not on lipid-lowering drugs, who underwent a routine health screening in a single center.

For the risk-based strategy, the criterion for statin eligibility was defined as a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of ≥ 7.5%. In the benefit-based strategy, subjects were considered for statin according to the predicted absolute cardiovascular risk reduction, so that the number of statin candidates would be the same as in the risk-based strategy. The benefit-based strategy would replace 11% of statin candidates allocated in the risk-based approach with younger, lower risk subjects with higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Using the benefit-based strategy, 13% of subjects with a 5.0% to < 7.5% ASCVD risk would shift from a statin-ineligible to a statin-eligible status, whereas 24% of those with a 7.5% to < 10.0% ASCVD risk would become statin ineligible. These effects would transfer the benefit from higher to lower-risk subjects. In the entire population, no clinically meaningful change in the benefit would be expected. In conclusion, switching from a risk-based strategy to a benefit-based approach, while maintaining the same ra…

### Comparative effectiveness of statins on non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol in people with diabetes and at risk of cardiovascular disease: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114H8WZE]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of different statin treatments, classified by intensity, on levels of non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in individuals with diabetes.

The design was a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data were sourced from Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase from their inception to December 1, 2021.

- **Review methods**: The inclusion criteria comprised randomized controlled trials comparing different types and intensities of statins, including placebo, in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary outcome was changes in levels of non-HDL-C, derived from measures of total cholesterol and HDL-C. Secondary outcomes included changes in levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol, major cardiovascular events (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and death related to cardiovascular disease), and discontinuations due to adverse events.

A Bayesian network meta-analysis of statin intensity (low, moderate, or high) with random effects was conducted to evaluate treatment effects on non-HDL-C, presented as mean differences with 95% credible intervals. Subgroup analysis included patients at greater risk of major cardiovascular events compared with those at low or moderate risk. The confidence in network meta-analysis (CINeMA) framework was used to determine the certainty of evidence.

The results section reported that in 42 randomized controlled trials involving 20,193 adults, 11,698 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, the greatest reductions in levels of non-HDL-C were observed.

### Beyond the laboratory: Clinical implications for statin pleiotropy [^117SuRc4]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Results from large-scale clinical trials of lipid lowering with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have led to a revolution in the management of atherosclerosis. In addition to their potent effect on serum lipid levels, statins influence several other cellular pathways, including those involving inflammatory, oxidative, and thrombotic processes. These effects clearly have the potential to beneficially modify the atherogenic process, and it has been suggested that they contribute to the impressive results seen in the clinical trials.

We review the clinical evidence for benefits of statin therapy that are distinct from their effect on lipid biology. In particular, we address three key issues: the role of statins in diseases not traditionally associated with elevated cholesterol levels; whether clinical benefits are seen with statin therapy before an effect on lipid levels; and whether the magnitude of clinical benefit observed with statin therapy is unrelated to the degree of cholesterol reduction. At present, low-density-lipoprotein lowering seems to be the primary mechanism underlying the clinical benefits of statin therapy and should remain the focus of risk-reduction strategies in clinical practice.

### Associations between statins and adverse events in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: Systematic review with pairwise, network, and dose-response meta-analyses [^1165WqFB]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Compared with rates seen in routine clinical practice, the baseline incidence of adverse events for patients included in trials might be lower due to differences in patient characteristics. These differences could explain the inconsistency seen in the absolute risks of adverse events of treatment with statins between trials and observational studies. Even when estimates from trials and observational studies are considered, modelling studies suggest that the benefits of statins for primary prevention outweigh their potential harms in most patients eligible for treatment. In terms of clinical importance, most of the associated adverse events are self-reported, mild, or localized conditions, unlikely to lead to morbidity or mortality, compared with the major cardiovascular events that statins prevent.

Only a few significant effects of individual types of statins were found for specific adverse events in this review (refer to figure 4 and odds ratio values in the results section). The associations of atorvastatin and lovastatin with liver dysfunction could be due to these statins being primarily metabolized in the liver. Rosuvastatin was associated with self-reported muscle symptoms, renal insufficiency, eye conditions, and diabetes. These risks may be limited to rosuvastatin or could be due to larger sample sizes and higher doses in the trials of rosuvastatin. Comparisons between different types of statins showed considerable uncertainty, owing to insufficient data for several statins, especially fluvastatin, pitavastatin, and simvastatin.

### Refining statin prescribing in lower-risk individuals: Informing risk/benefit decisions [^1122Jvkr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, as well as those from the Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense and the Joint British Societies, all recommended treating more people with statins than previous guidelines. In each guideline, the decision-making process began with an assessment of overall cardiovascular risk. Each group proposed updated treatment thresholds, and all of them lowered the threshold compared with earlier guidelines.

Since the release of these new guidelines in 2013 and 2014, additional evidence has emerged to suggest a rationale for extending statin consideration to an even larger proportion of asymptomatic adults — even those with a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk below 7.5%. This review discusses new findings since 2013 and proposes strategies emanating from the guidelines to help clinicians and patients make more informed decisions about long-term statin use, especially pertinent to lower-risk patients.

### Statins provide less benefit in populations with high noncardiovascular mortality risk: Meta-regression of randomized controlled trials [^116qUyCi]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). High credibility.

To examine whether the benefit of statins varied according to cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV mortality of the treated population, a meta-analysis and meta-regression of 16 randomized placebo-controlled trials was conducted.

The study setting included both community and hospital environments. Participants consisted of statin-treated (n = 59,671) and placebo-treated (n = 59,707) individuals, with and without CV disease, whose mean age ranged from 55 to 75.

Meta-regression was used to model relative risks (RRs) of major CV events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, and total mortality for statins versus placebo. These risks were examined as a function of the CV and non-CV mortality risks of the study population.

- **Results**: Every 1% increase in 5-year non-CV mortality risk of the study population was associated with a 3.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2 to 6.3%) greater RR of major CV events and a 4.4% (95% CI = 2.1 to 6.9%) greater RR of total mortality. Higher RRs indicate smaller benefits. CV mortality was not associated with statin effects (P > .05).

- **Stratified analysis**: According to CV (≥ 5.3% vs < 5.3%) and non-CV mortality (≥ 3.8% vs < 3.8%) of the study population, statins had little mortality benefit in populations with high non-CV mortality, regardless of CV mortality. Random-effects pooled RR was 0.81 (95% CI = 0.72 to 0.91) for low CV and low non-CV mortality; 0.90 (95% CI = 0.76 to 1.06) for low CV and high non-CV mortality; 0.79 (95% CI = 0.72 to 0.87) for high CV and low non-CV mortality; and 0.94 (95% CI = 0.87 to 1.02) for high CV and high non-CV mortality.

### Simvastatin [^112KYLmV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Simvastatin tablets are an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor indicated for several uses:

- **Indications and usage**: Simvastatin is used to reduce the risk of total mortality by lowering the risk of coronary heart disease death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and the need for coronary and non-coronary revascularization procedures. This is applicable to adults with established coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes, who are at high risk of coronary heart disease events.

- **Adjunct to diet**: It helps to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the following cases:

	- In adults with primary hyperlipidemia.
	- In adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).
	- As an adjunct to other LDL-C-lowering therapies to reduce LDL-C in adults with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).

- **Treatment of lipid disorders**: Simvastatin is also indicated as an adjunct to diet for the treatment of adults with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia and hypertriglyceridemia.

These indications demonstrate the comprehensive applications of simvastatin in managing cholesterol levels and associated risks in various populations.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^112mFCb6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is an important causal, modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Evidence from multiple prospective, randomized studies has substantiated that patients achieving the lowest LDL-C levels have the lowest risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), without associated safety concerns or adverse events, even when LDL-C is reduced to very low levels (< 40 mg/dL [< 1 mmol/L]). Managing LDL-C in a risk-stratified manner is particularly important in patients at high or very-high risk of MACEs.

European guidelines now recommend even lower LDL-C levels in groups at very-high risk of ASCVD. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines and the more recent 2021 ESC guidelines recommend an LDL-C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline for very high-risk patients, whereas US guidelines suggest high-intensity or maximal statin therapy, with addition of ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor if LDL-C remains above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L).

### Population impact & efficiency of benefit-targeted versus risk-targeted statin prescribing for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^112myhKE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Statins are effective at reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease events. Guidelines recommend primary prevention with statins targeted according to a person's estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, such as myocardial infarction, fatal and nonfatal stroke, or coronary heart disease death, with a treatment threshold of 7.5%. Statins are thus recommended for all individuals with a 10-year risk greater than 7.5%. Some have proposed targeting therapy according to the expected benefit from statins, measured by the absolute reduction in risk of events expected from statin therapy. While baseline risk is a good marker for expected benefit, the expected benefit may also depend on individual characteristics that modify statin effectiveness. For instance, a person with very low baseline lipid levels might have a moderately high baseline ASCVD risk but relatively low expected benefit from statins. Benefit-targeted primary prevention with statins may therefore be more efficient than risk-targeted primary prevention.

It is unclear, however, how much a switch to benefit-targeted statin therapy from risk-targeted statin therapy would actually benefit the US population. A previous analysis projected that switching from risk-targeted statin therapy, with a baseline risk treatment threshold of 7.5%, to benefit-targeted statin therapy, with an expected absolute risk reduction (ARR) treatment threshold of 2.3%, could lead to the treatment of an additional 9.5 million Americans and prevent an additional 266,508 cardiovascular events over 10 years.

### Efficacy and safety of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol: A meta-analysis of data from 170,000 participants in 26 randomised trials [^117Jv7mj]. Lancet (2010). High credibility.

Lowering of LDL cholesterol with standard statin regimens reduces the risk of occlusive vascular events in a wide range of individuals. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol with statin therapy.

- **Methods**: We undertook meta-analyses of individual participant data from randomised trials involving at least 1000 participants and at least 2 years' treatment duration of more versus less intensive statin regimens (five trials; 39,612 individuals; median follow-up 5.1 years) and of statin versus control (21 trials; 129,526 individuals; median follow-up 4.8 years). For each type of trial, we calculated not only the average risk reduction but also the average risk reduction per 1.0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction at 1 year after randomisation.

- **Findings**: In the trials of more versus less intensive statin therapy, the weighted mean further reduction in LDL cholesterol at 1 year was 0.51 mmol/L. Compared with less intensive regimens, more intensive regimens produced a highly significant 15% (95% CI 11–18; p < 0.0001) further reduction in major vascular events, consisting of separately significant reductions in coronary death or non-fatal myocardial infarction of 13% (95% CI 7–19; p < 0.0001), in coronary revascularisation of 19% (95% CI 15–24; p < 0.0001), and in ischaemic stroke of 16% (95% CI 5–26; p = 0.005). Per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, these further reductions in risk were similar to the proportional reductions in the trials of statin versus control. When both types of trial were combined, similar proportional reductions were observed.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115aXyE8]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The search strategy yielded a total of 3060 articles. After removing duplicates and screening the articles, 32 trials were included in the meta‐analysis. Inter‐reader agreement was high (κ coefficient = 0.9).

The included articles consisted of 12,042 ASCVD patients, among which 5880 (48.42%) participants received low/moderate‐intensity statin with ezetimibe, whereas 6162 participants received high‐intensity statin monotherapy. The included studies employed various statins, namely rosuvastatin (n = 5), atorvastatin (n = 12), simvastatin (n = 3), pravastatin (n = 1), multiple statins (n = 10), and one study used both atorvastatin and multiple statins. Approximately half of the studies were blinded (47%), whereas blindness was not mentioned in 40% of studies. Only two studies used a placebo in the monotherapy arm. The duration of treatment in these studies ranged from 1 to 36 months from baseline.

- **Laboratory data**: Twenty‐one studies compared high‐intensity statin monotherapy with low/moderate‐intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy on LDL‐C levels in ASCVD patients. The combination therapy demonstrated a greater reduction in LDL‐C levels compared to monotherapy (MD = −6.6, 95% CI: −10.6 to −2.5). However, a high degree of heterogeneity was noted among the included studies (I2 = 84%, p < 0.01).

### The benefits of statins in people without established cardiovascular disease but with cardiovascular risk factors: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114vgdhA]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

We followed the quality of reporting of meta-analysis guidelines. We searched various sources, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline (1990-November 2008), Embase (1980-November 2008), DARE, and the ACP Journal Club for randomized clinical trials comparing statins with a control group in individuals without established cardiovascular disease but with cardiovascular risk factors.

We identified relevant studies using the MeSH terms for:

- **Statins**: "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor", "atorvastatin", "simvastatin", "pravastatin", "fluvastatin", "rosuvastatin", "lovastatin"
- **Cardiovascular conditions**: "cardiovascular disease", "coronary heart disease", "cerebrovascular disease", "myocardial infarction"
- **Lipid profiles**: "cholesterol", "LDL" [low density lipoprotein], "HDL" [high density lipoprotein], "triglycerides"

The focus was on primary prevention restricted to randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses. Additionally, the reference lists and related links of retrieved articles in PubMed were examined to identify studies potentially eligible for inclusion.

We included studies if they met the following criteria: they were randomized trials of statins compared with controls (placebo, active control, or usual care), had a mean follow-up of at least one year, reported on mortality or cardiovascular disease events as primary outcomes, included at least 80% of participants without established cardiovascular disease, or reported data separately on a sole primary prevention group with specific numbers for patients and events in that group. Eight studies were excluded that primarily investigated statin-related non-clinical and intermediate surrogate outcomes.

### Clinically relevant differences between the statins: Implications for therapeutic selection [^113xfs7R]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Although the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, share a common lipid-lowering effect, there are differences within this class of drugs. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-lowering efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, drug-food interactions, and cost can vary widely, thus influencing the selection of a particular statin as a treatment option. The statins that produce the greatest percentage change in LDL cholesterol levels are atorvastatin and simvastatin. Atorvastatin and fluvastatin are least affected by alterations in renal function. Fewer pharmacokinetic drug interactions are likely to occur with pravastatin and fluvastatin, because they are not metabolized through the cytochrome P450 (3A4) system. The most cost-effective statins, based on cost per percentage change in LDL cholesterol levels, are fluvastatin, cerivastatin, and atorvastatin. Awareness of these differences may assist in the selection or substitution of an appropriate statin for a particular patient.

### Interpretation of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of statin therapy [^115BLpbC]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

This review is intended to help clinicians, patients, and the public make informed decisions about statin therapy for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. It explains how the evidence that is available from randomised controlled trials yields reliable information about both the efficacy and safety of statin therapy. In addition, it discusses how claims that statins commonly cause adverse effects reflect a failure to recognize the limitations of other sources of evidence about the effects of treatment.

Large-scale evidence from randomised trials shows that statin therapy reduces the risk of major vascular events (i.e. coronary deaths or myocardial infarctions, strokes, and coronary revascularisation procedures) by about one-quarter for each mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol during each year (after the first) that it continues to be taken. The absolute benefits of statin therapy depend on an individual's absolute risk of occlusive vascular events and the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol that is achieved.

For example, lowering LDL cholesterol by 2 mmol/L (77 mg/dL) with an effective low-cost statin regimen (e.g. atorvastatin 40 mg daily, costing about £2 per month) for 5 years in 10,000 patients would typically prevent major vascular events from occurring in about 1,000 patients (i.e. 10% absolute benefit) with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease (secondary prevention) and in 500 patients (i.e. 5% absolute benefit) who are at increased risk but have not yet had a vascular event (primary prevention). Statin therapy has been shown to reduce vascular disease risk.

### Reducing residual risk for patients on statin therapy: The potential role of combination therapy [^1145KDRr]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Cholesterol-lowering therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, has been established as an effective method of reducing death and myocardial infarction among patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, a significant number of patients receiving statin therapy continue to have high residual risk. An important clinical challenge exists in reducing residual CAD risk with optimal therapies without increasing adverse effects. Combination therapy appears most appropriate for patients with a high rate of events of residual risk despite optimal statin therapy. This article discusses the role of combination therapy in managing CAD and in achieving optimal targets in high-risk patient populations.

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: Key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^117T55DC]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

In patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the guideline recommends starting high-intensity statin or the maximum tolerated dose as early as possible. This recommendation stands regardless of initial LDL-C values, aiming to achieve the very high-risk group goals of a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline and a goal of < 55 mg/dL (class I, level A). Lipid levels should be evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after ACS to determine whether these targets have been achieved.

If the goal of < 55 mg/dL is not reached with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, combining with ezetimibe is recommended (class I, level B). If, after 4 to 6 weeks, the goal is still not met with a maximum tolerated dose of a statin and ezetimibe, a further combination with a PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended (class I, level A). For patients whose LDL-C levels are not at target despite already taking a maximally tolerated statin dose and ezetimibe, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor early after the event (including prior to discharge) should be considered (class II, level C).

### Overcoming challenges with statin therapy [^114sVU5x]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). High credibility.

**Factors that increase adverse effects by increasing exposure to statins**: There are a number of mechanisms that affect drug exposure in individual patients; these are integral to and associated with the risk of adverse events that exhibit dose dependence, notably myopathy. They include pharmacokinetic interactions and pharmacogenomic factors that result in higher levels of statins in the blood and in hepatic and muscle tissue.

### Association between intensity of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with statin-based therapies and secondary stroke prevention: A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115ZRUgR]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

The benefits and risks associated with intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering statin-based therapies to lessen the risk of recurrent stroke have not been established.

- **Objective**: To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to evaluate the association between more intensive vs. less intensive LDL-C-lowering statin-based therapies with outcomes for patients with ischemic stroke.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from January 1, 1970, to July 31, 2021.

- **Study selection**: This meta-analysis included randomized clinical trials that compared more intensive vs. less intensive LDL-C-lowering statin-based therapies and recorded the outcome of recurrent stroke among patients with stroke.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: The "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses" (PRISMA) reporting guideline was used for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity. Relative risk (RR) with 95% CI was used as a measure of the association of more intensive vs. less intensive LDL-C lowering with primary and secondary outcomes.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was recurrent stroke, and the secondary outcomes were major cardiovascular events and hemorrhagic stroke.

- **Results**: The final analysis included 11 randomized clinical trials with 20,163 patients (13,518 men [67.0%]; mean [SD] age, 64.9 [3.7] years) with stroke. The mean follow-up was 4 years (range, 1–6.1 years). Pooled results showed that more intensive LDL-C-lowering…

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^112RNNfu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The impact of treating a population with each intervention was explored using simulation techniques. Using the DA VINCI (The EU-Wide Cross-Sectional Observational Study of Lipid Modifying Therapy Use in Secondary and Primary Care) study, a European Union-wide cross-sectional observational study of lipid-modifying therapy use in secondary and primary care, we estimated the mean (and standard deviation) LDL-C for the group of patients with ASCVD receiving stabilized statin therapy without ezetimibe or PCSK9i. Assuming a normal distribution, we simulated 10,000 LDL-C values, and values > 70 mg/dL (> 1.8 mmol/L) were selected to represent a hypothetical pool of patients requiring additional LLT.

We then simulated the LDL-C reduction achieved by each intervention by randomly sampling from a normal distribution with mean estimated from the primary NMA and standard deviation estimate obtained from a specific clinical trial. The NMA does not provide any information about the variability between individuals; hence, to estimate the standard deviation, a single clinical trial was selected for each intervention, with a preference given to the largest study with the time point closest to 12 weeks. For ezetimibe, only studies that included patients stabilized on statin at randomization were considered as a source for the standard deviation because, for the studies that included patients not stabilized on statin at randomization, the percentage reduction in LDL-C from baseline of ezetimibe versus placebo had been derived from the data provided (statin plus ezetimibe versus statin plus placebo).

### Statin therapy for young adults: A long-term investment worth considering [^113wFdxn]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Statins, or HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, significantly decrease low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, resulting in stabilization and, in some cases, regression of atherosclerotic plaque with a subsequent reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. At the time of writing, there remains a paucity of data to guide the use of statins in young adults (20–49 years old). We herein aim to summarize the potential benefits and risks for statin therapy in younger adults, outlining a possible approach to statin use in young adults.

Early identification and treatment of young individuals at risk for ASCVD offer the potential to significantly reduce the lifetime risk of ASCVD. However, there is a paucity of data on the potential side effects of long-term statin use over many decades. Comprehensive risk assessment, including the calculation of lifetime ASCVD risk, as well as incorporating non-traditional risk factors, such as lipoprotein (a), strong family history of premature ASCVD, familial hypercholesterolemia, LDL-C level, and the presence of underlying systemic inflammatory disorders, can be helpful in identifying young adults who stand to benefit the most from statin therapy.

- **Selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) assessment**: As well as potentially polygenic risk scores, can be considered in situations where there remains uncertainty regarding risk assessment.
- **Decision-making process**: Importantly, the decision for statin treatment should occur in the context of a patient-centered shared decision-making process.

### 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: Lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk [^113rBLp6]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, and more specifically concerning elderly patients, the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend starting statins at a low dose in patients over 65 years old if there is significant renal impairment or the potential for drug interactions. The dosage can then be titrated upwards to achieve the LDL-C treatment goal.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114KYHYj]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The study evaluated the difference between the effect of high-intensity statin monotherapy and low/moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy on various lipid parameters, including HDL‐C, TG, TC, and hs‐CRP. These effects were analyzed in 18, 16, 17, and 14 studies, respectively. The analyses revealed no significant difference in HDL‐C (MD = 3.1, 95% CI: −1.5 to 7.7), TG (MD = −4.7, 95% CI: −16.5 to 6.1), TC (MD = −0.6, 95% CI: −13.1 to 11.9), and hs‐CRP (MD = 0, 95% CI: −0.0 to 0.0) levels between the treatment arms.

Considerable heterogeneity was noted among the studies, with I² values of 99% (p = 0) for HDL‐C, 78% (p < 0.01) for TG, 99% (p < 0.01) for TC, and 31% (p = 0.13) for hs‐CRP. Although no significant publication bias was observed for HDL‐C, TG, and hs‐CRP, inspection of the funnel plot and Egger's test demonstrated the existence of publication bias for TC. Subgroup analyses based on the statin class and treatment duration did not reveal any significant differences between the efficacy of the two treatment arms. Among the studies analyzing HDL‐C subgroups, heterogeneity was attributed to the atorvastatin subgroup. In the case of TC, heterogeneity was influenced by studies involving multiple statins and atorvastatin.

### Population impact & efficiency of benefit-targeted versus risk-targeted statin prescribing for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^112zzKEP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

We estimated reduced cardiovascular risk with moderate-intensity statins by modeling statin effectiveness using methods and assumptions developed by Thanassoulis et al. Moderate-intensity statins were defined as those achieving an LDL reduction of 40% in individuals not already on statin therapy. The effects of LDL-lowering from statins were translated into a reduced event risk by applying the absolute risk reduction (ARR) formulation developed by Thanassoulis et al, which is derived from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) meta-analysis. This analysis demonstrated an interaction in statin efficacy by baseline level of risk (formulas provided by Thanassoulis et al. in their online appendix).

We used the calculated expected ARR to both estimate the reduction in risk from statins for each NHANES participant treated with statins (for both benefit- and risk-targeted therapy) and to target therapy (for benefit-targeted therapy only). The PIE Model Stata code implementing the calculation of the expected ARR is archived and available online. The critical steps are as follows:

- **ARR computation**:
	- lnRR_thanassoulis = −0.10821 + 0.12346 * ln(baselinerisk) (from Thanassoulis et al.)
	- RR_thanassoulis = exp(lnRR_thanassoulis) (RR per mmol/L LDL reduction)
	- RR = RR_thanassoulis^(LDL reduction in mmol/L) (Calculated RR for given patient)

Our base-case analysis focused on comparing risk-targeting versus benefit-targeting of statins for primary prevention. We did not apply statin therapy in individuals with previous cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or LDL ≥ 190 mg/dL, as statins are indicated for these conditions.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111JM65m]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

We did not find a meaningful difference in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) between the two treatment methods. The results of the meta-analysis conducted by Zhan et al. in 2018 also corroborate comparable all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality between the two treatment groups. However, patients have a lower risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in the combination therapy group. The findings of the cohort study conducted by Kim et al. were also in agreement with our finding by showing that there was no significant difference in the risk of non-fatal MI, repeat revascularization, stroke, and all-cause mortality between the two treatment groups following a 5-year follow-up.

There are two main hypotheses to elucidate the conflicting outcomes. First, most analyses on MACE outcomes didn't comprise patients who discontinued their treatment due to adverse events and were more susceptible to cardiovascular outcomes. Second, the different dosages and types of statins used in various therapies among the related studies could be an underlying cause of these conflicting results. Although our study did not demonstrate a clear superiority of combination therapy in reducing MACE, the significant reduction in LDL-C levels and improved tolerability profiles observed with this approach may still provide important clinical benefits. Clinicians should consider these factors when weighing the risks and benefits of statin monotherapy versus combination therapy for individual patients.

### Associations between statins and adverse events in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: Systematic review with pairwise, network, and dose-response meta-analyses [^1135fR4o]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the associations between statins and adverse events in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, and to examine how the associations vary by the type and dosage of statins. This research was designed as a systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Data sources**: Studies were identified from previous systematic reviews and searched in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, up to August 2020.

- **Review methods**: Randomized controlled trials in adults without a history of cardiovascular disease that compared statins with non-statin controls or different types or dosages of statins were included.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcomes focused on common adverse events such as self-reported muscle symptoms, clinically confirmed muscle disorders, liver dysfunction, renal insufficiency, diabetes, and eye conditions. Secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular disease as measures of efficacy.

- **Data synthesis**: A pairwise meta-analysis was conducted to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each outcome between statins and non-statin controls. The absolute risk difference in the number of events per 10,000 patients treated for a year was estimated. A network meta-analysis was performed to compare the adverse effects of different types of statins. An E max model-based meta-analysis was used to examine dose-response relationships of the adverse effects of each statin.

Results from the study included 62 trials with 120,456 participants followed up for an average of 3.9 years. Statins were associat

### Effect of two intensive statin regimens on progression of coronary disease [^11652G9r]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Statins reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes and slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in proportion to their ability to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. However, few studies have assessed the ability of intensive statin treatments to achieve disease regression or compared alternative approaches to maximal statin administration.

- **Methods**: We performed serial intravascular ultrasonography in 1,039 patients with coronary disease at baseline and after 104 weeks of treatment with either atorvastatin, 80 mg daily, or rosuvastatin, 40 mg daily, to compare the effect of these two intensive statin regimens on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and assess their safety and side-effect profiles.

- **Results**: After 104 weeks of therapy, the rosuvastatin group had lower levels of LDL cholesterol than the atorvastatin group (62.6 vs. 70.2 mg per deciliter [1.62 vs. 1.82 mmol per liter], P < 0.001), and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (50.4 vs. 48.6 mg per deciliter [1.30 vs. 1.26 mmol per liter], P = 0.01). The primary efficacy endpoint, percent atheroma volume (PAV), decreased by 0.99% (95% confidence interval, -1.19 to -0.63) with atorvastatin and by 1.22% (95% CI, -1.52 to -0.90) with rosuvastatin (P = 0.17). The effect on the secondary efficacy endpoint, normalized total atheroma volume (TAV), was more favorable with rosuvastatin than with atorvastatin: -6.39 mm³ (95% CI, -7.52 to -5.12) compared with -4.42 mm³ (95% CI, -5.98 to -3.26) (P = 0.01). Both agents induced regression in the patients studied.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^115m73Me]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted using frequentist methods with the Netmeta R package, and Bayesian models in WinBUGS (MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK) version 1.4.3. Bayesian analyses followed the methodology described in Toth et al. All analyses utilized the mean difference between groups and standard error (SE), rather than the mean and SE for each group. When more than one treatment difference was reported for a pair of treatments within a single study (e.g. for two different statin backgrounds), meta-analysis estimated a single treatment difference for each treatment pair within each study. A random-effects model was consistently applied. Local inconsistency was examined using the Netmeta R package, which allowed for the separation of network estimates into direct and indirect evidence contributions. Network graphs were created to illustrate the evidence weight and the number of trials linking each pair of treatments.

### Effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin compared over 52 weeks of treatment in patients with hypercholesterolemia [^112GHh2m]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Despite the demonstrated benefits of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease, many patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy fail to achieve LDL-C goals. We compared the effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in reducing LDL-C and achieving LDL-C goals in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

- **Methods and results**: In this 52-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial (4522IL/0026), 412 patients with LDL-C 160 to < 250 mg/dL received a 5-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 138), a 10-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 134), or a 10-mg dose of atorvastatin (n = 140) for 12 weeks; during the following 40 weeks, dosages could be sequentially doubled up to 80 mg if National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP-II) LDL-C goals were not achieved. At 12 weeks, 5- and 10-mg doses of rosuvastatin were associated with significantly greater LDL-C reductions than 10-mg doses of atorvastatin (46% and 50% vs. 39%, both P < .001). At 12 weeks, both rosuvastatin dosages brought more patients to within ATP-II and European LDL-C goals than atorvastatin (86% and 89% vs. 73% and 75%, and 86% vs. 55%, respectively). At 52 weeks, compared with atorvastatin, both initial rosuvastatin treatment groups significantly reduced LDL-C (47% and 53% vs. 44%, P < .05 and P < .001). Overall, more patients in the initial rosuvastatin 10-mg group achieved their ATP-II LDL-C goal than those in the initial atorvastatin 10-mg group (98% vs. 87%), with 82% of patients treated with rosuvastatin achieving their goal at the 10-mg level.

### Statins research unfinished saga: Desirability versus feasibility [^115dQVSE]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2005). Low credibility.

Extensive evidence from intervention trials has been presented to demonstrate that "old" statin treatment results in reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By contrast, statin treatment has not been associated consistently with the reduction in plasma RLP-C levels. In general, however, it can be concluded that RLP-C lowering by statins depends on their ability to reduce triglyceride levels. Therefore, among all currently clinically available statins, only atorvastatin and rosuvastatin have the potential to reduce RLP-C levels.

In addition, the concomitant use of fibrate and statin seems to be attractive in patients whose LDL cholesterol is controlled by statin but whose HDL cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels are still inappropriate. A combination of statin/fibrate may be necessary to control all lipid abnormalities in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Safety concerns about some fibrates, such as gemfibrozil, may lead to exaggerated precautions regarding fibrate administration and therefore diminish the use of these agents. However, other fibrates, such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate, appear to be safer and better tolerated.

The combination of fibrate with statins that are not mainly metabolized within the liver by the cytochrome P450 system (like pravastatin or fluvastatin) may be even less hazardous. We believe that proper coadministration of statins and fibrates in some cases, selected on the basis of their safety, could be more effective in achieving comprehensive lipid control compared to monotherapy. An alternative sort of future combination may…

### Drug interactions with lipid-lowering drugs: mechanisms and clinical relevance [^114Z9X4d]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering drugs, especially 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A inhibitors (statins), are widely used in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic disease. The benefits of statins are well documented. However, lipid-lowering drugs may cause myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the risk of which is heightened by certain drug interactions. Simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (simvastatin acid is also metabolized by CYP2C8); their plasma concentrations and risk of myotoxicity are greatly increased by strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and ritonavir. Weak or moderately potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. verapamil and diltiazem) can be used cautiously with small doses of CYP3A4-dependent statins.

Cerivastatin is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, while fluvastatin is metabolized by CYP2C9. The exposure to fluvastatin is increased by less than two-fold by inhibitors of CYP2C9. Pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin are excreted mainly unchanged, and their plasma concentrations are not significantly increased by pure CYP3A4 inhibitors. Cyclosporine (INN, ciclosporin) inhibits CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein (multidrug resistance protein 1), organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), and some other hepatic uptake transporters. Gemfibrozil and its glucuronide inhibit CYP2C8 and OATP1B1. These effects of cyclosporine and gemfibrozil explain the increased plasma statin concentrations and, together with pharmacodynamic factors, the increased risk of myotoxicity when coadministered with statins.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin among patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack: A national registry-based observational study [^114rWX14]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are the most widely used statins in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). However, evidence on their effectiveness and safety during actual use is scarce. This study aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of initiating atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin among patients with ischemic stroke or TIA.

This observational study was based on the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III), which recruited consecutive adult patients with ischemic stroke or TIA within 7 days from the onset of symptoms to enrollment from August 2015 to March 2018. Researchers identified 3322 adults aged ≥ 18 years who had a pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 and initiated atorvastatin or rosuvastatin on the day of onset. The primary outcome was the ideal outcome, as defined by a mRS score of 0, at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included the ideal outcome at discharge, at 6 months, and at 12 months, along with 12-month stroke recurrence, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events.

A total of 3322 eligible patients were identified, with 2605 initiating atorvastatin and 717 initiating rosuvastatin. The proportion of patients achieving an ideal outcome, as defined by a modified Rankin Scale of 0, was 44.63% in rosuvastatin initiators, significantly higher than 41.46% in atorvastatin initiators, with a relative rate of 1.12 (95% confidence interval 1.03, 1.22). Also, a greater percentage of rosuvastatin initiators attained the ideal outcome.

### Population impact & efficiency of benefit-targeted versus risk-targeted statin prescribing for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^116LjAG6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Benefit-targeted statin prescribing may be superior to risk-targeted statin prescribing (the Standard), but the impact and efficiency of this approach are unclear.

- **Methods and results**: We analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) using an open-source model (the Prevention Impact and Efficiency Model) to compare targeting of statin therapy according to expected benefit (benefit-targeted) versus baseline risk (risk-targeted) in terms of projected population-level impact and efficiency. Impact was defined as the relative percentage reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the U.S. population for the given strategy compared to statin treatment patterns, and efficiency as the number needed to treat over ten years (NNT 10, average and maximum) to prevent each atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event. Benefit-targeted moderate-intensity statin therapy at a treatment threshold of 2.3% expected 10-year absolute risk reduction could produce a 5.7% impact (95% confidence interval, 4.8–6.7), which is approximately equivalent to the potential impact of risk-targeted therapy at a treatment threshold of 5% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk (5.6% impact [4.7–6.6]).

Whereas the estimated maximum NNT 10 is much improved for benefit-targeted versus risk-targeted therapy at these equivalent-impact thresholds (43.5 vs. 180), the average NNT 10 is nearly equivalent (24.2 vs. 24.6). Reaching a 10% impact (half the Healthy People 2020 impact objective, loosely defined) is theoretically possible with benefit-targeted moderate-intensity statin therapy.

### A comparison of statin therapies in hypercholesterolemia in women: A subgroup analysis of the STELLAR study [^111nDCyy]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Another meta-analysis compared the effect of statins in secondary prevention of CVD in men and women across 11 trials. Statin therapy (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin) was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events in both women (risk ratio [RR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.74–0.89) and men (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.78–0.85). However, there was no benefit regarding stroke and all-cause mortality in women, unlike in men.

Data on the impact of statin treatment on carotid intima-media thickness are equally limited. A small study involving 51 postmenopausal women aged ≥ 55 years with dyslipidemia showed that women who received rosuvastatin 2.5 mg per day for 12 months had significantly lower carotid intima-media thickness values compared with women who received no statin therapy. These changes coincided with significant decreases in LDL-C and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

Overall, statins have proved to be generally well tolerated in most patients. Safety data from several large-scale statin trials, when analyzed by gender, indicate that statins are generally well tolerated in women. Taken together, the available efficacy and safety data suggest that dyslipidemic women should receive appropriate statin therapy to reduce LDL-C levels and thereby reduce the risk of CVD.

### Review of primary and secondary prevention trials with lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin [^112RLyHV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

There is overwhelming evidence supporting cholesterol as a modifiable risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Lifestyle modifications are considered first-line treatments for lowering cholesterol, while drug therapies are recommended for at-risk groups. Trials published before the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III reports have positioned statins as a primary choice in lipid therapies, with recent trials providing insights into high-risk prevention. Although six statins are currently available, large clinical trials have predominantly evaluated atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin for the prevention of CAD and other cardiovascular events. A few small endpoint trials have assessed fluvastatin, while rosuvastatin trials are in their early stages.

### Comparison of benefits and risks of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin from a meta-analysis of head-to-head randomized controlled trials [^116HGN4Y]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The benefit from statin therapy is proportional to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction. However, adverse events appear to be related to dose rather than LDL cholesterol reduction. Although serious side effects are rare, any comparison of statins requires scrutiny of the relationship between therapeutic effect and risk of side effects. This report sought to determine whether the additional LDL cholesterol lowering with rosuvastatin over atorvastatin could be obtained without increased risk of short-term adverse events. Twenty-five studies (approximately 20,000 patients) were identified that provided 28 comparisons of 1:1 dose ratios, 20 comparisons of 1:2 dose ratios, and 6 comparisons of 1:4 dose ratios.

- **Treatment difference in benefit and risk**: Treatment differences in benefit (percentage of LDL cholesterol reduction) and risk (odds ratios for myalgia, increased alanine aminotransferase > 3 times the upper limit of normal, creatine kinase > 10 times the upper limit of normal, and percentage of change in glomerular filtration rate, as well as deaths, serious adverse events, and withdrawals caused by adverse events) were estimated using meta-analysis and presented in benefit-risk planes.

Rosuvastatin was more efficacious than the same dose of atorvastatin (1:1 dose ratio) or a 2 times higher dose (1:2 dose ratio) of atorvastatin. There was no significant difference between rosuvastatin and a 4 times higher dose of atorvastatin (1:4 dose ratio). There were no significant differences between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin at any dose ratio for adverse events. Percentages of change in GFR improved significantly.

### Comparative effectiveness of statins on non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol in people with diabetes and at risk of cardiovascular disease: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116r7qcW]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

The surface under the cumulative ranking curve score provides an overall ranking of each treatment. In reducing levels of non-HDL-C, rosuvastatin at moderate intensity was ranked as the best statin treatment (surface under the cumulative ranking curve 77.5%); the second-best treatment was rosuvastatin at high intensity (76.8%), followed by simvastatin at high intensity (76.7%), and atorvastatin at high intensity (76.3%). The treatment with the lowest surface under the cumulative ranking curve score (excluding placebo) was fluvastatin at low intensity (8.5%).

Figure 3 presents a league table of the results of the network meta-analysis comparing the effects of the different statin intensities. Almost all statins were effective compared with fluvastatin and pravastatin at low intensity. Rosuvastatin at high intensity seemed to be the best-performing statin in direct comparisons with other statin intensities; however, the differences in effect sizes were not significant and showed only a small benefit compared with other top performers (i.e. rosuvastatin at moderate intensity, simvastatin at high intensity, and atorvastatin at high intensity). To ensure the certainty of evidence, we incorporated the CINeMA judgments into figure 2 and figure 3. The quality of the evidence according to CINeMA was mostly moderate or high overall, and we found no evidence of funnel plot asymmetry. Results of the sensitivity analyses of the network meta-analysis by specific statin dose were similar to the main statin intensity model, with atorvastatin showing consistent results.

### Alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy vs high-intensity statins in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^113HBHrV]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with high-intensity statins is generally recommended. However, alternative approaches considering statin-related adverse effects and intolerance are needed.

The objective of this study is to compare the long-term efficacy and safety of an alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy versus a high-intensity statin strategy in patients with ASCVD in randomized clinical trials. Data sources included PubMed, Embase, and other websites such as ClinicalTrials.gov, European Society of Cardiology, and tctMD, which were systematically searched from inception to April 19, 2024.

Study selection focused on randomized clinical trials comparing an alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy with a high-intensity statin strategy in patients with ASCVD, with the presence of cardiovascular events as endpoints.

Data extraction and synthesis were conducted using individual patient data obtained from randomized clinical trials that met the prespecified eligibility criteria: RACING (Randomized Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Lipid-Lowering With Statin Monotherapy vs Statin/Ezetimibe Combination for High-Risk Cardiovascular Disease) and LODESTAR (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol-Targeting Statin Therapy vs Intensity-Based Statin Therapy in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease). The moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy in the RACING trial and the treat-to-target strategy in the LODESTAR trial were classified as alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategies.
