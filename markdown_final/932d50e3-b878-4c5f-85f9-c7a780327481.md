## Question

Azathioprine for acute otitis media

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether azathioprine is an appropriate therapy for acute otitis media (AOM). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline-recommended management of AOM and whether any role for immunosuppressants exists. Then, I should verify azathioprine's approved indications and mechanism to assess plausibility. Next, I will check the provided literature to see if azathioprine has ever been studied or recommended in AOM. Finally, I need to synthesize a risk–benefit assessment and provide a clear recommendation aligned with pediatric AOM guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the standard of care for AOM so I don't jump to conclusions. AOM is typically managed with analgesia, consideration of observation in select nonsevere cases, and antibiotics when indicated, with high-dose amoxicillin as first-line in most children; broader coverage is reserved for specific situations such as prior amoxicillin exposure, conjunctivitis-otitis syndrome, or recurrence unresponsive to amoxicillin, and nonresponse warrants reassessment at 48–72 hours with potential regimen change [^112KSmBB] [^116ujukL] [^114FpdgU] [^113y75pc] [^112QStUz].

> Wait, let me verify whether azathioprine appears anywhere in AOM guidance or related trials. I should double-check the AAP/AAFP guideline set and companion reviews: there is no mention of azathioprine or any systemic immunosuppressant as therapy for AOM in these documents, which focus on analgesia, observation, and antibiotics only; likewise, general practice reviews do not include azathioprine in AOM management pathways [^112KSmBB] [^114DqTAM] [^113y75pc]. I also need to check azathioprine's labeling and specialty guidelines: azathioprine is indicated for autoimmune conditions and as a steroid-sparing agent in diseases like ocular myasthenia, with no infectious disease indications or otitis-related labeling, which strongly suggests no role in AOM treatment [^114JFGp9] [^114JFGp9] [^114jpwTS].

> Hold on, I should verify azathioprine's pharmacologic rationale and potential impact on an acute bacterial ear infection. Azathioprine functions as an immunosuppressant in autoimmune contexts and transplant medicine rather than as an antimicrobial or anti-infective adjunct, so using it to treat infection would be mechanistically discordant; moreover, immunosuppression can predispose to persistent or complicated otitis, as highlighted by reports urging immunologic evaluation when complications cluster, which underscores that immunosuppression is a risk state, not a therapy, in this setting [^114jpwTS] [^113nve1H]. I should also remember azathioprine's notable drug–drug interaction profile, such as contraindication with febuxostat, which adds avoidable complexity for a condition typically managed simply and safely with analgesia and appropriate antibiotics [^114Qfw4y].

> I need to ensure the guideline-concordant pathway is explicit to avoid any ambiguity. For uncomplicated AOM, manage pain, consider observation in eligible children, and use high-dose amoxicillin as first-line when antibiotics are needed; escalate to an agent with β-lactamase coverage for recent amoxicillin exposure, conjunctivitis-otitis syndrome, or failure, and re-evaluate within 48–72 hours if the child is not improving or is worsening; prophylactic antibiotics are discouraged, and none of these steps include immunosuppressants such as azathioprine [^116ujukL] [^112QStUz] [^114FpdgU] [^113y75pc] [^1145jP1m].

> Hmm, wait a minute, is there any conceivable anti-inflammatory role where azathioprine might help AOM symptoms? I initially wondered about that, but let me reconsider: inflammation in AOM is driven by an acute bacterial process, and guidelines do not endorse systemic immunosuppression to modulate it; in fact, suppressing host defenses could plausibly worsen bacterial persistence and complications, which runs counter to AOM treatment goals, so this line of thought does not hold up under scrutiny [^112KSmBB] [^116ujukL]. I should double-check: there is simply no evidentiary or guideline support for azathioprine in AOM, and its immunosuppressive nature argues against off-label use here [^114jpwTS] [^114JFGp9].

> Let me now synthesize the risk–benefit balance. There is no evidence of clinical benefit for azathioprine in AOM, no endorsement by AOM guidelines, and a clear potential for harm via immunosuppression and drug interactions; conversely, established, effective, and safer strategies exist and are well standardized, so azathioprine has no role in the acute management of AOM [^112KSmBB] [^116ujukL] [^114JFGp9] [^114Qfw4y].

> Bottom line, I should state this plainly and clinically. Azathioprine is not indicated and is inappropriate therapy for acute otitis media; treat per AAP/AAFP guidance with analgesia, consider observation in eligible cases, use high-dose amoxicillin first-line when antibiotics are needed, adjust coverage based on risk factors or nonresponse, and reassess at 48–72 hours if symptoms persist; if a child happens to already be receiving azathioprine for another condition, anticipate a higher risk of persistence or complications and coordinate care accordingly, but do not initiate azathioprine to treat AOM [^112KSmBB] [^116ujukL] [^114FpdgU] [^113y75pc] [^114JFGp9].

Azathioprine is not indicated for **acute otitis media (AOM)** because AOM is a bacterial infection requiring antibiotics [^116ujukL], not immunosuppression [^114DqTAM]. It has no role in AOM management and is not included in any guideline [^112KSmBB]; using it would only increase infection risk and adverse effects without benefit. Standard care is **amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate** [^116ujukL] [^114FpdgU], with observation for select cases; azathioprine should be avoided in AOM.

---

## Pharmacological properties of azathioprine

Azathioprine is a purine analog that inhibits DNA synthesis, suppressing lymphocyte proliferation and immune responses. It is used for autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection [^114jpwTS], **not for acute bacterial infections such as AOM**.

---

## Pathophysiology and standard treatment of acute otitis media

AOM is an **acute bacterial infection** of the middle ear [^1119JE4N], most often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. It presents with the rapid onset of ear pain, fever [^114DqTAM], and tympanic membrane inflammation [^113LJRNc]. The standard treatment is antibiotics, with **amoxicillin as first-line therapy** [^116ujukL]; observation is appropriate for select mild cases.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding azathioprine in acute otitis media

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting azathioprine for AOM; no trials or studies have evaluated its efficacy or safety in this context, and it is not mentioned in any AOM guideline.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of azathioprine in acute otitis media

Azathioprine carries **significant risks**, including:

- **Increased infection risk**: Immunosuppression can worsen bacterial infections like AOM.

- **Bone marrow suppression**: Leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia increase infection and bleeding risk.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Liver enzyme elevations and hepatitis can occur.

- **Gastrointestinal toxicity**: Nausea, vomiting, and pancreatitis are possible.

- **Malignancy risk**: Long-term use increases lymphoma and skin cancer risk.

These risks **outweigh any hypothetical benefit in AOM**, which is a self-limited bacterial infection [^112MMcfy].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)** and the **American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)** recommend:

- **First-line antibiotic therapy**: Amoxicillin for uncomplicated AOM [^116ujukL].

- **Observation strategy**: For select mild cases with close follow-up.

- **No role for immunosuppressants**: Azathioprine is not recommended or mentioned in any AOM guideline [^112KSmBB].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Azathioprine is not indicated for **AOM**; there is no evidence of benefit and it poses significant risks. Clinicians should use guideline-directed antibiotics and avoid immunosuppressants in AOM [^116ujukL].

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112KSmBB]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, specifically in relation to systemic antibiotics, the AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend ensuring follow-up when observation is used as an initial strategy. Antibiotic therapy should be initiated when the patient worsens or fails to improve within 48–72 hours of the onset of symptoms. This is particularly applicable for older children, where observation may be initially preferred.

### Otitis media: diagnosis and treatment [^114DqTAM]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is diagnosed in patients with acute onset, presence of middle ear effusion, physical evidence of middle ear inflammation, and symptoms such as pain, irritability, or fever. Acute otitis media is usually a complication of eustachian tube dysfunction that occurs during a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common organisms isolated from middle ear fluid. Management of acute otitis media should begin with adequate analgesia. Antibiotic therapy can be deferred in children two years or older with mild symptoms. High-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is the antibiotic of choice for treating acute otitis media in patients who are not allergic to penicillin. Children with persistent symptoms despite 48 to 72 hours of antibiotic therapy should be reexamined, and a second-line agent, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, should be used if appropriate.

Otitis media with effusion is defined as middle ear effusion in the absence of acute symptoms. Antibiotics, decongestants, or nasal steroids do not hasten the clearance of middle ear fluid and are not recommended. Children with evidence of anatomic damage, hearing loss, or language delay should be referred to an otolaryngologist.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^113LJRNc]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute otitis media, specifically concerning the diagnostic criteria, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend diagnosing AOM in children who present with moderate-to-severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or the new onset of otorrhea not due to acute otitis externa.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^116ujukL]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute otitis media, particularly in relation to systemic antibiotics, the AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend administering amoxicillin as the first-line therapy for patients with uncomplicated AOM. This recommendation is applicable in the absence of penicillin allergy, recent treatment with amoxicillin, or purulent conjunctivitis.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^113NjLSL]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). High credibility.

Baseline characteristics and pre-enrollment ear disease were assessed from clinical records. Infants were examined fortnightly from enrollment to randomization and monthly over the 24-week intervention period or until success was documented.

- **Assessments**: At each study visit, a pediatrician or pediatric nurse trained by an Australian expert used video pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry (Grason Stadler GSI 38) to assess ear status. Clinic notes were reviewed to assess inter-illness and side effects. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline and at each post-randomization visit and processed as previously reported to detect pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

- **Criteria for otitis media categories**: Diagnostic criteria were as previously reported. Table 1 gives definitions and the severity scale used to assign the worse (highest score) ear diagnosis at each examination. In this study, ear examinations that demonstrated type B tympanogram, reduced mobility on pneumatic otoscopy, and a marked or moderately bulging TM were categorized as AOM without perforation (AOMwoP) even if the child was asymptomatic.

- **Success**: The primary outcome ('success') was the detection of bilateral aerated middle ears (confirmed with tympanometry) at two consecutive monthly visits.

- **Statistical power and methods**: We aimed to achieve a sample size of 118 that would provide 80% power to detect a 20% increase in success rate.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115Draen]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, particularly with respect to systemic antibiotics, the AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend initiating antibiotic therapy in patients aged 6–23 months with bilateral AOM, regardless of symptom severity.

### A prospective observational study of 5-, 7-, and 10-day antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media [^111EvRWC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

To compare 5-, 7-, and 10-day durations of antibiotic therapy for acute otitis media (AOM) in children, a prospective nonrandomized 1-year evaluation was conducted in a private pediatric setting. Outcomes were assessed 14 ± 4 days after the start of therapy, with clinical responses categorized as cure, improvement, or failure.

A total of 2172 children were studied. Among them, 46.4% were 2-years-old (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in having AOM episodes in the preceding month (P = 0.07) or in the preceding 12 months (P = 0.03).

The study supports the transition from 10 to 5 days for standard AOM antibiotic treatment duration in most patients. A 10-day regimen may be superior in children who have experienced an episode of AOM within the preceding month, as this is a known risk factor for resistant bacterial infection in otitis-prone patients.

### Current approaches to otitis media [^111qtShY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is the most commonly diagnosed illness in children and is one of the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription. In many countries, antibiotic resistance is increasing among the bacteria implicated in acute otitis media, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae.

This evolution should stimulate changes in the management of acute otitis media, focusing on several key areas:

- **Improvement in diagnostic accuracy**: Enhanced precision in diagnosing can significantly benefit patient outcomes.
- **Reduction in antibiotic use**: Minimizing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions can help combat resistance.
- **Selection of the most appropriate drugs at the appropriate dosage**: Implementing optimal therapeutic strategies contributes to effective treatment.
- **Reduction in duration of treatment, when possible**: Shortening treatment durations helps to decrease antimicrobial exposure.
- **Implementation of new vaccines**: Introducing innovative vaccines plays a crucial role in prevention.

Advancing these strategies is essential to address the challenges posed by antibiotic resistance in treating acute otitis media.

### Predictors of pain and/or fever at 3 to 7 days for children with acute otitis media not treated initially with antibiotics: A meta-analysis of individual patient data [^113FLBid]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine the predictors of a prolonged course for children with acute otitis media.

- **Methods**: A meta-analysis of data from six randomized controlled trials was performed. Participants included 824 children, ranging from 6 months to 12 years of age, with acute otitis media. The primary outcome focused on a prolonged course of acute otitis media, defined by the presence of fever and/or pain at 3 to 7 days.

- **Results**: Among the 824 children, 303 exhibited pain and/or fever at 3 to 7 days. Independent predictors of a prolonged course included age under 2 years and bilateral acute otitis media. The risk of a prolonged course for children under 2 years of age with unilateral acute otitis media (which comprised 47% of all children) was 25%.

- **Conclusions**: The risk for a prolonged course was twice as high for children under 2 years of age with unilateral acute otitis media. Clinicians can utilize these features — specifically, age under 2 years and bilateral acute otitis media — to better inform parents about the expected progression of their child's otitis media. These features can also guide parents on when to contact their clinician for a child's reexamination.

### Clinical practice guideline: Otitis media with effusion executive summary (update) [^117Y9bUu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 18 recommendations developed emphasize diagnostic accuracy, identification of children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from otitis media with effusion, and education of clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most otitis media with effusion and the lack of efficacy for medical therapy (e.g. steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Otitis media: Beyond the examining room [^112TZrgR]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The management of hearing loss associated with otitis media is multifaceted. Clinical practice guidelines set the collaborative prescriptive standards for the medical management of otitis media in children. Treatment of this condition does not end with the medical practitioner. There are far-reaching effects of otitis media and its sequelae that permeate every aspect of patients' lives, including physiological, educational, and psychosocial. Therefore, a comprehensive interprofessional treatment plan must be designed, taking into consideration best practices from a range of professions. This plan should aim to maximize clinical outcomes and involve the treating physician, speech-language pathologist, clinical audiologist, educational audiologist, and professionals in the educational setting.

The EFNS 2014 guidelines specifically address the treatment of ocular myasthenia in patients with myasthenia gravis. They recommend initiating corticosteroid-sparing treatment with azathioprine to reduce corticosteroids to the lowest effective dose if corticosteroids do not result in good symptom control and/or if it is necessary to use high corticosteroid doses.

### Clinical outcomes associated with amoxicillin treatment for acute otitis media in children [^113nNwhr]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common reason children are prescribed antibiotics. Bacteria that produce beta-lactamase are an increasingly frequent cause of AOM and may be resistant to amoxicillin, the currently recommended treatment for AOM. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of children treated with amoxicillin for AOM and assessed whether outcomes vary by infecting pathogen or beta-lactamase production.

- **Methods**: 205 children aged 6–35 months diagnosed with AOM and prescribed amoxicillin were included. Bacterial culture and qualitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed on nasopharyngeal swabs collected at enrollment. Parents completed surveys assessing symptoms, antibiotic adherence, and potential adverse events. The primary outcome was treatment failure with amoxicillin. Secondary outcomes included recurrence, symptom improvement, resolution, and adverse drug events (ADE).

- **Results**: 8 children (5.4%) experienced treatment failure and 14 (6.8%) had recurrence. By day 5, 152 (74.1%) children had symptom improvement and 97 (47.3%) had resolution. Parents reported ADE for 56 (27.3%) children. Among 149 children who did not take any amoxicillin before enrollment, 98 (65.8%) had one or more beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Common bacterial otopathogens were Moraxella catarrhalis (79, 53.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (51, 34.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (30, 20.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (21, 14.1%). Treatment failure did not differ between children that did (5, 5.1%) and did not (3, 5.9%) have beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.

### Clinical practice guideline: Otitis media with effusion [^114EDL2Q]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children", developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). Unlike the earlier guideline, which was limited to children aged 1 to 3 years with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions predisposing to OME and its sequelae.

The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee strongly recommended that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media (AOM). They recommended that clinicians should:

- **Document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms**: This should be done at each assessment of the child with OME.
- **Distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems**: Prompt evaluation of hearing is advised for these children.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^116wXkHe]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The conclusions provide evidence favoring placebo at one and nine months, indicating that topical intranasal corticosteroids are not likely to be an effective means of treating children with bilateral otitis media with effusion. The study demonstrates the feasibility of active monitoring in general practice, with particularly high natural resolution rates occurring after as little as one month of follow-up.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^1162orWZ]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute otitis media, particularly with respect to systemic antibiotics, the AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines provide specific recommendations. For young children aged 6–23 months who do not exhibit severe signs or symptoms, it is advised either to initiate antibiotic therapy or to offer observation with close follow-up. If the child's condition worsens or fails to improve within 48–72 hours from the onset of symptoms, antibiotic therapy should be started.

### Management of acute otitis media by primary care physicians: Trends since the release of the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics/American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1137w1m6]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

In 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians released a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute otitis media, which included the endorsement of an observation option for selected cases and recommendations of specific antibiotics. This study sought to describe primary care physicians' management of acute otitis media to compare it with the guideline's recommendations and describe trends since 2004.

We utilized a mail survey conducted from March through June 2006 within the Slone Center Office-Based Research Network, a national practice-based pediatric research network.

The response rate was 299 (62.7%) out of 477. The observation option was considered reasonable by 83.3% of respondents, compared with 88.0% in 2004, and was used in a median of 15% of acute otitis media cases over the previous three months.

- **Common barriers**: The most common physician-identified barriers to the use of the observation option were parental reluctance (83.5%) and the cost and difficulty of follow-up for children who do not improve (30.9%).

- **Antibiotic choices**: In terms of antibiotic choices for acute otitis media, agreement with the guideline's antibiotic recommendation for four common clinical scenarios was as follows: high-dose amoxicillin for acute otitis media with non-severe symptoms (57.2%), high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for acute otitis media with severe symptoms (12.7%), high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for cases that failed to respond to amoxicillin (42.8%), and intramuscular ceftriaxone for cases that failed to respond to treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate (16.7%).

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112QStUz]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, particularly concerning systemic antibiotics, the AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend initiating antibiotic therapy in patients aged 6 months or older with AOM (bilateral or unilateral) who exhibit severe signs or symptoms, including moderate or severe otalgia, duration of otalgia for 48 hours or more, and a temperature exceeding 39 °C.

### Improving delayed antibiotic prescribing for acute otitis media [^117VPEpv]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common indication for antibiotics in children. Delayed antibiotic prescribing for AOM can significantly reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for select children. We sought to improve delayed prescribing for AOM across eight outpatient pediatric practices in Colorado.

- **Methods**: Through a collaborative initiative with the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we implemented an economical six-month antimicrobial stewardship intervention. This included education, audit and feedback, online resources, and content expertise. Practices used The Model for Improvement and plan-do-study-act cycles to improve delayed antibiotic prescribing. Generalized estimating equations were used to generate relative risk ratios (RRRs) for outcomes at the intervention end and three and six months post-intervention. Practice surveys were evaluated.

- **Results**: In total, 69 clinicians at eight practice sites implemented 27 plan-do-study-act cycles. Practices varied by size (range: 6–37 providers), payer type, and geographic setting. The rate of delayed antibiotic prescribing increased from 2% at baseline to 21% at the intervention end (RRR: 8.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.68–17.17). Five practices submitted post-intervention data. The rate of delayed prescribing at three months and six months post-intervention remained significantly higher than baseline (three months post-intervention, RRR: 8.46; 95% CI: 4.18–17.11; six months post-intervention, RRR: 6.69; 95% CI: 3.53–12.65).

### Recurrence up to 3.5 years after antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media in very young Dutch children: Survey of trial participants [^115UEwBR]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the long-term effects of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media in young children. The study was designed as a prospective three-year follow-up within the framework of a primary care-based, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

The study setting included 53 general practices in the Netherlands, involving 168 children aged 6 months to 2 years diagnosed with acute otitis media. The interventions compared were amoxicillin at a dosage of 40 mg/kg/day in three doses versus a placebo.

- **Main outcome measures**: Recurrence of acute otitis media; referral to secondary care; ear, nose, and throat surgery.

- **Results**: Acute otitis media recurred in 63% (47/75) of children in the amoxicillin group and in 43% (37/86) of the placebo group, with a risk difference of 20% (95% confidence interval 5% to 35%). Additionally, 30% (24/78 amoxicillin; 27/89 placebo) of children in both groups were referred to secondary care. Ear, nose, and throat surgery occurred in 21% (16/78) of the amoxicillin group compared with 30% (27/90) of the placebo group, with a risk difference of −9% (−23% to 4%).

The conclusion drawn is that acute otitis media recurred more frequently in children originally treated with amoxicillin. This provides further support for the judicious use of antibiotics in children with acute otitis media.

Trial registration is noted under Netherlands Trial Register NTR1426.

### Etiology of acute otitis media in children less than 5 years of age: A pooled analysis of 10 similarly designed observational studies [^1119JE4N]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Finally, although this analysis included 10 countries, most countries and regions are not represented, including North America, most of Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, as well as native high-risk populations. Consequently, the generalizability of some of our findings may be limited to the health-care–seeking pediatric population in the countries included. However, as noted, the identity of the most prominent etiologic pathogens, as determined in the pooled analysis, was largely consistent between the studies included, and with other published reports, so those results may be considered more broadly applicable.

Despite differences in PCV7-CRM use and clinical management of acute otitis media (AOM), this pooled analysis indicates that Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hflu) remain the leading causes of AOM in the regions investigated. Both pathogens cause disease in the youngest and oldest children, and it is known that early AOM cases are associated with more AOM cases or recurrence. Infants thus remain important targets for vaccination for either pathogen. Both pathogens are responsible for both mild and more severe AOM, as assessed by different measures, and are clinically significant. Finally, both pathogens are associated with antibiotic resistance. Although most serotypes in PCV7-CRM-vaccinated children could now be covered by one or both expanded serotype pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), it is notable that already more than 20% of isolates were not covered by any currently licensed PCV, and this proportion will certainly increase as higher valency vaccines are fully implemented.

### Delayed versus immediate antimicrobial treatment for acute otitis media [^1172hC8s]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Watchful waiting with the option of delayed antimicrobial treatment for acute otitis media is recommended in several guidelines. Our aim was to study whether delayed, as compared with immediate, initiation of antimicrobial treatment worsens the recovery from acute otitis media in young children.

- **Methods**: Children (6–35 months) with acute otitis media received either delayed or immediate antimicrobial treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate for 7 days. The delayed antimicrobial treatment group (n = 53) consisted of placebo recipients from a randomized-controlled trial to whom antimicrobial treatment was initiated following a watchful waiting period. The immediate antimicrobial treatment group (n = 161) consisted of children allocated to receive antimicrobial treatment immediately.

- **Results**: Improvement during antimicrobial treatment (which includes both symptoms and otoscopic signs) was observed in 91% and 96% of children in the delayed and immediate antimicrobial treatment groups, respectively (P = 0.15). The median watchful waiting period was 48 hours. Delayed initiation of antimicrobial treatment was associated with prolonged resolution of fever, ear pain, poor appetite, and decreased activity, but not ear rubbing, irritability, restless sleep, or excessive crying. Parents of children in the delayed antimicrobial treatment group missed more workdays (mean 2.1 versus 1.2 days, P = 0.03). Diarrhea, vomiting, and rash were equally common in both groups.

- **Conclusions**: Our results indicate that delayed initiation of antimicrobial treatment does not worsen the recovery from acute otitis media in young children.

### Bacterial eradication in the treatment of otitis media [^115awQah]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Drugs differ in their ability to eradicate various pathogens from the middle-ear cavity during acute otitis media (AOM), and these differences clearly affect clinical outcomes. The outcome is derived from differences in the association between concentrations of the drugs at the site of infection and the antimicrobial effect, termed pharmacodynamics. These differences are even more marked in the present era of antimicrobial resistance. However, since AOM is a self-limiting disease in most cases, differences in clinical outcomes are more difficult to ascertain than those of bacteriological outcomes, which are measured within 3–5 days. A favorable clinical outcome, regardless of the bacteriological effect of the drug, can result in false optimism when less-effective antibiotic drugs are used. Inappropriate study design and manipulation of clinical results add to this confusion. In this review, we attempt to highlight the evidence regarding bacteriological response to antibiotics in AOM and to draw attention to potential flaws that may mislead clinicians.

### Suprax [^114v4nY6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical studies of otitis media were conducted in nearly 400 children aged 6 months to 10 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 47% of the patients, Haemophilus influenzae from 34%, Moraxella catarrhalis from 15%, and S. pyogenes from 4%.

The response rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae to cefixime was approximately 10% lower, and the response rate to Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis was approximately 7% higher (12% when beta-lactamase positive isolates of H. influenzae are included) than the corresponding response rates to the active control drugs.

Patients were randomized and treated with cefixime at dose regimens of 4 mg/kg twice a day or 8 mg/kg once a day, or with a comparator. Sixty-nine to 70% of the patients in each group showed resolution of otitis media signs and symptoms when evaluated 2 to 4 weeks post-treatment. However, persistent effusion was observed in 15% of the patients. At the completion of therapy, 17% of patients receiving cefixime and 14% of those receiving effective comparative drugs (18% when including patients with Haemophilus influenzae resistant to the control drug) were considered treatment failures. By the 2 to 4 week follow-up, 30% to 31% of patients exhibited either treatment failure or recurrent disease.

### Etiology of acute otitis media in children less than 5 years of age: A pooled analysis of 10 similarly designed observational studies [^111nBVjQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a leading cause of global childhood morbidity and empiric antibiotic prescriptions, despite guidelines recommending judicious antimicrobial use. Prevention of AOM is an important public health objective, and pediatric pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), which are licensed to prevent AOM caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), are crucial tools to reduce medical care costs and antibiotic resistance.

Double-blind, randomized control trials with different PCVs in infants have reported reductions in overall AOM episodes ranging from −1% to 34% and in antibiotic prescriptions from 5% to 8%. These differences in vaccine effect have been attributed to varied study designs (e.g. case definition), access to care, local distribution of otopathogens, and the specific vaccine formulation tested.

Spn and nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) have historically been leading causes of AOM, with Spn generally associated with acute disease and NTHi with recurrent cases as well as otitis media with effusion. Pneumococcal serotypes in the heptavalent PCV (PCV7-CRM) covered approximately 60%–70% of pneumococcal isolates from PCV-naive children aged 6–59 months with AOM. The efficacy studies revealed that decreases in overall clinical AOM are primarily driven by reductions in vaccine-type pneumococcal AOM. However, there is some evidence that PCVs may also differ in their impacts on non-vaccine type pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae.

### Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis [^112jaiYY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis are two of the most common indications for antimicrobial agents in children. Together, they are responsible for billions of dollars in healthcare expenditures. The pathogenesis of the two conditions is identical. In the majority of children with either condition, a preceding viral upper respiratory tract infection predisposes them to the development of the acute bacterial complication. It has been shown that viral upper respiratory tract infection predisposes to the development of acute otitis media in 37% of cases.

Currently, precise microbiologic diagnosis of acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis requires performance of tympanocentesis in the former and sinus aspiration in the latter. The identification of a virus from the nasopharynx in either case does not obviate the need for antimicrobial therapy. Furthermore, nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs are not useful in predicting the results of culture of the middle ear or paranasal sinus. However, it is possible that a combination of information regarding nasopharyngeal colonization with bacteria and infection with specific viruses may inform treatment decisions in the future.

### Otitis media [^116Ck6vq]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Otitis media (OM) continues to be one of the most common childhood infections and is a major cause of morbidity in children. The pathogenesis of OM is multifactorial, involving the adaptive and native immune system, Eustachian-tube dysfunction, viral and bacterial load, and genetic and environmental factors. Initial observation seems to be suitable for many children with OM, but only if appropriate follow-up can be assured. In children younger than 2 years with a certain diagnosis of acute OM, antibiotics are advised. Surgical candidacy depends on associated symptoms, the child's developmental risk, and the anticipated chance of timely spontaneous resolution of the effusion. The recommended approach for surgery is to start with tympanostomy tube placement, eventually followed by adenoidectomy. The ideal intervention for OM, however, does not yet exist, and an urgent need remains to explore new and creative options based on modern insights into the pathophysiology of OM.

### Nonsevere acute otitis media: A clinical trial comparing outcomes of watchful waiting versus immediate antibiotic treatment [^1138BL2B]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) has resulted in the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens that are difficult to treat. However, it has been shown that most children with nonsevere AOM recover without antibiotics (ABX). The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy, acceptability, and costs of a non-ABX intervention for children with nonsevere AOM.

- **Methodology**: Children 6 months to 12 years old with AOM were screened using a novel AOM-severity screening index. Parents of children with nonsevere AOM received an educational intervention, and their children were randomized to receive either immediate antibiotics (ABX; amoxicillin plus symptom medication) or watchful waiting (WW; symptom medication only). The investigators, but not the parents, were blinded to enrollment status. Primary outcomes included parent satisfaction with AOM care, resolution of symptoms, AOM failure/recurrence, and nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to ABX. Secondary outcomes included medication-related adverse events, serious adverse events, unanticipated AOM-related office and emergency department visits, and telephone calls. Additional factors considered were the child's absence from daycare or school resulting from AOM, the parent's absence from school or work because of their child's AOM, and costs of treatment. Subjects were defined as failing (days 0–12) or recurring (days 13–30) if they experienced a higher AOM-severity score on reexamination.

- **Results**: A total of 223 subjects were recruited: 73% were nonwhite, and 57% were under the age of 2 years.

### Clinical practice guideline: Otitis media with effusion (update) [^112YAxw6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

This update of a 2004 guideline, co-developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from four new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials. There is an enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision-making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits of medical therapy (e.g. steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental concerns.

### Acute otitis media in infants: The disease and the illness. Clinical distinctions for the new treatment paradigm [^114xR7SQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media has conceptually shifted from being a feared infection with severe complications to a modest disease requiring symptomatic relief, often without immediate antimicrobials. This is applicable for infants and children with nonsevere forms of the illness if parents and clinicians agree to a strategy of watchful waiting with easy access to follow-up. Accurate otologic examination is critical for recognizing disease, but the initial treatment choice must also consider the general impact on each patient. The appraisal of symptoms characterizing the illness in a child, paired with the otoscopic intensity of the disease, provides a comprehensive estimation of overall severity used by many experts for research. The perspectives examined in this article and the proposed schematic construct, which suggests considering disease and illness independently, may help integrate the paradigm of acute otitis media into everyday pediatric practice as a model for more rational and personalized patient management.

### The challenge of recalcitrant acute otitis media: Pathogens, resistance, and treatment strategy [^114TvSg5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). High credibility.

Recalcitrant acute otitis media (AOM), including the well-defined entities of persistent AOM and recurrent AOM (reAOM), is a common pediatric problem. Episodes of AOM in children with either persistent AOM or reAOM have been associated with the recovery of middle ear fluid bacterial pathogens, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae, which exhibit higher resistance to antibiotics compared to children with AOM who have not recently been treated with antibiotics. The relationships between nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and the persistence of middle ear fluid pathogens — despite clinical improvement or cure — and subsequent recurrence are discussed in depth. These findings emphasize the importance of bacteriologic eradication in preventing episodes of reAOM.

### Recurrence up to 3.5 years after antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media in very young Dutch children: Survey of trial participants [^116QqCKj]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

The study was conducted within the framework of a primary care-based, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. It investigated the effects of amoxicillin compared with a placebo in children with acute otitis media aged between 6 and 24 months. The diagnosis of acute otitis media was based on the presence of acute signs of infection and confirmed through otoscopy. The original study took place in the Netherlands between February 1996 and May 1998 and included 240 children who were followed actively for six months. Upon trial entry, parents were informed that the treatment allocation would only be revealed after the final follow-up, including a post-trial period of about three years. The treatment code would only be broken during the trial in cases of severe complications or side effects. The trial results at days four and eleven and at six months were reported in 2000 and 2006.

Approximately three and a half years after the start of the trial, in 2000, we sent a questionnaire to the parents of the participating children. The questionnaire inquired about episodes of recurrent acute otitis media, referrals to secondary care, and ear, nose, and throat surgery. We defined the primary outcome measure, reported recurrent acute otitis media, as at least one episode of acute otitis media occurring between the last study appointment at six months and the survey. Additionally, we compared the proportion of children referred to secondary care (pediatrician or ear, nose, and throat surgeon) and the rate of ear, nose, and throat surgery.

Initially, we considered only the risk difference and did not adjust for potential confounders.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: Double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^1118woaa]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The trial profile shows the flow of participants throughout the study period (fig 1). In the active monitoring group, 77.4% (961/1242) of children were excluded by the first tympanometry screen because bilateral otitis media with effusion was not confirmed, and 55% (109/197) were excluded after three months because bilateral otitis media with effusion had not persisted. In those without active monitoring, 79.7% (683/857) were excluded because bilateral otitis media with effusion was not confirmed. In all, 261 children met the study entry criteria and 217 were randomised — 72 with previous active monitoring and 174 without.

Table 2 shows that potential confounders were equally distributed between the groups, but with slightly more boys in the placebo group (56% vs. 44%), confirming that randomisation was effective overall. The level of retention was high — 93% (201) at one month, 84% (182) at three months, and 73% (158) at nine months. At one month, 7% (16) of children were lost to follow-up, but a further 3% (7) had missing tympanometric data, were uncooperative, or had uninterpretable tympanograms. We assumed that all missing data were missing at random and censored them in the analysis (without imputation).

### Diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^113qN9za]. Pediatrics (2004). High credibility.

This evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 2 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated acute otitis media (AOM). The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in the fields of otolaryngology, epidemiology, and infectious disease. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the evidence-based literature related to AOM. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations.

The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific definition of AOM. It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibacterial treatment, appropriate choices of antibacterials, and preventive measures. Decisions were made based on a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, as well as expert consensus when definitive data were not available. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the partnering organizations. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with AOM; rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making.

### Does acetaminophen interfere in the antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media caused by a penicillin-resistant pneumococcus strain? A gerbil model [^114TLoeM]. Pediatric Research (2003). Low credibility.

The possible interference of acetaminophen, combined with antibiotics, in the treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) caused by a penicillin-resistant (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC], 2 microg/mL), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid- and erythromycin-sensitive pneumococcus was evaluated in a gerbil model. Animals were challenged with approximately 5 × 10⁶ bacteria in each ear through transbullar instillation. Acetaminophen was administered subcutaneously at 50 mg/kg, 30 minutes before each antibiotic dose. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and erythromycin (2.5 and 10 mg/kg) were administered subcutaneously at 2, 10, and 18 hours after inoculation. Samples were obtained from the middle ear (ME) on day 2 after inoculation for bacterial count.

The overall results showed no difference between animals that received acetaminophen, with or without antibiotics, and those that did not receive acetaminophen. The antibiotic concentrations in the ME were practically identical in both groups of animals, indicating that acetaminophen did not interfere with the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in the ME. However, both antibiotics significantly reduced the number of culture-positive results and the bacterial concentration in ME samples when compared with antibiotic-untreated animals. Both antibiotics, whether combined with acetaminophen or not, lowered the presence of AOM to the extent that 75% of animals presented otitis media with effusion, and no differences were shown between groups. A high rate of bacterial eradication from the ME correlated with antibiotic serum concentrations being over the MIC of the infecting organism for more than 15% of the dose.

### Diagnosis and treatment of otitis media [^111nc5aK]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media include rapid onset of symptoms, middle ear effusion, and signs and symptoms of middle ear inflammation. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial isolates from the middle ear fluid of children with acute otitis media. Fever, otalgia, headache, irritability, cough, rhinitis, listlessness, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and pulling at the ears are common, but nonspecific symptoms. Detection of middle ear effusion by pneumatic otoscopy is key in establishing the diagnosis.

Observation is an acceptable option in healthy children with mild symptoms. Antibiotics are recommended in all children younger than six months, in those between six months and two years if the diagnosis is certain, and in children with severe infection. High-dosage amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is recommended as first-line therapy. Macrolide antibiotics, clindamycin, and cephalosporins are alternatives in penicillin-sensitive children and in those with resistant infections. Patients who do not respond to treatment should be reassessed.

Hearing and language testing is recommended in children with suspected hearing loss or persistent effusion for at least three months, and in those with developmental problems.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^112HrX2y]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Amoxicillin is the recommended antibiotic for most children who have not had acute otitis media (AOM) in the prior 30 days, but we observed that only 70% of antibiotic prescriptions at index encounters for AOM were for amoxicillin. This is consistent with prior studies using commercial insurance claims databases, where 57–71% of patients were prescribed amoxicillin. Notably, 16% of antibiotic prescriptions in our cohort were for cefdinir. This may, in part, be a response to reported beta-lactam allergies, present in 11% of encounters. However, it is known that over 90% of children with a reported allergy are able to tolerate the antibiotic.

A study among children enrolled in Kentucky Medicaid found similarly high rates of cefdinir prescribing for AOM, with 27–30% of all cefdinir prescriptions having an indication of AOM. Cefdinir is a broader-spectrum antibiotic than amoxicillin, and based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, oral cephalosporins are unlikely to achieve sufficiently high levels in middle ear fluid to effectively treat most pneumococcal ear infections. Rising rates of cefdinir use for common outpatient infections are concerning and, therefore, represent a target for future stewardship interventions.

### Effect of antimicrobial treatment of acute otitis media on the daily disappearance of middle ear effusion: a placebo-controlled trial [^114XWodg]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial treatment reduces the symptoms of acute otitis media (AOM). However, the effect of antimicrobial treatment on the duration of middle ear effusion (MEE) and concomitant hearing impairment is not known. This study aims to determine whether the antimicrobial treatment of AOM reduces the duration of MEE.

This research involved a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 84 children aged between 6 months and 15 years who had AOM. Participants were recruited from September 14, 1999, to January 4, 2000; October 10, 2005, to December 16, 2005; and September 22, 2009, to June 4, 2012, from an AOM prevention trial and local outpatient clinics in Oulu, Finland.

Children involved in the trial were randomly assigned to receive either 40 mg/kg of amoxicillin-clavulanate or a placebo mixture daily for 7 days. The primary outcome measure was the time to disappearance of MEE, defined by a normal tympanogram finding (A curve) from both ears on two consecutive measurement days. Parents performed daily tympanometry at home, while the study physician performed tympanometry and otoscopy at study entry, after 3 and 7 days, and then weekly until both ears were healthy. The main secondary outcome measures included the time to normal otoscopy findings and the proportion of children without persistent MEE at 14 days and 2 months.

Results indicated that middle ear effusion disappeared 2.0 weeks (13.7 days) earlier (P = 0.02) in the antimicrobial group (mean time, 2.7 weeks; 95% CI, 1.7–3.7) than in the placebo group.

### Treatment failure, recurrence, and antibiotic prescription rates for different acute otitis media treatment methods [^116gnzNJ]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

In an era of increasing antibiotic resistance, reliance on empirical antibiotic therapy for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) will eventually become an untenable strategy. New research efforts are needed to identify effective treatment alternatives. In this retrospective analysis, we assessed AOM treatment failure (AOMTF), recurrent AOM (RAOM), and antibiotic prescription rates for groups of AOM episodes managed with either immediate antibiotics (ABX), tympanocentesis plus observation (Tap + OBS), or tympanocentesis plus immediate antibiotics (Tap + ABX).

No significant differences in rates of AOMTF or RAOM were observed between any of the treatment groups. The 30-day rate of antibiotic prescriptions written for AOM was significantly lower in the Tap + OBS group (1 prescription per 3.8 episodes) than in the immediate antibiotic therapy groups (1.2 prescriptions per episode), P < .001. The comparative risk of AOMTF was slightly higher among AOM episodes caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (OR 2.523; CI 1.070–5.944; P = 0.056). Neither the presence of other particular otopathogens, nor the presence of drug-resistant otopathogens, nor the choice of any particular AOM antibiotic therapy correlated with increased risk of either AOMTF or RAOM.

The observed absence of significant differences in clinical outcomes between the various treatment groups in this study is consistent with findings published by other authors: alternative AOM therapies can help reduce reliance on antibiotics without inviting significant increases in rates of clinical failure.

### Tympanostomy tubes or medical management for recurrent acute otitis media [^1133TgsQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Official recommendations differ regarding tympanostomy-tube placement for children with recurrent acute otitis media.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned children 6 to 35 months of age who had experienced at least three episodes of acute otitis media within 6 months, or at least four episodes within 12 months with at least one episode within the preceding 6 months, to either undergo tympanostomy-tube placement or receive medical management involving episodic antimicrobial treatment. The primary outcome was the mean number of episodes of acute otitis media per child-year (rate) during a 2-year period.

- **Results**: In our main, intention-to-treat analysis, the rate (± SE) of episodes of acute otitis media per child-year during a 2-year period was 1.48 ± 0.08 in the tympanostomy-tube group and 1.56 ± 0.08 in the medical-management group (P = 0.66). Because 10% of the children in the tympanostomy-tube group did not undergo tympanostomy-tube placement and 16% of the children in the medical-management group underwent tympanostomy-tube placement at parental request, we conducted a per-protocol analysis, which gave corresponding episode rates of 1.47 ± 0.08 and 1.72 ± 0.11, respectively. Among secondary outcomes in the main analysis, results were mixed. Favoring tympanostomy-tube placement were the time to a first episode of acute otitis media, various episode-related clinical findings, and the percentage of children meeting specified criteria for treatment failure. Favoring medical management was children's cumulative number of days with otorrhea. Outcomes that did not show substantial difference.

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media: A meta-analysis with individual patient data [^112MMcfy]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

Individual trials to test the effectiveness of antibiotics in children with acute otitis media have been too small for valid subgroup analyses. We aimed to identify subgroups of children who would and would not benefit more than others from treatment with antibiotics.

- **Methods**: We conducted a meta-analysis of data from six randomized trials examining the effects of antibiotics in children with acute otitis media. Individual patient data from 1,643 children aged from 6 months to 12 years were validated and re-analyzed. The primary outcome was defined as an extended course of acute otitis media, consisting of pain, fever, or both at 3–7 days.

- **Findings**: Significant effect modifications were noted for otorrhoea, age, and bilateral acute otitis media. In children younger than 2 years with bilateral acute otitis media, 55% of controls and 30% on antibiotics still had pain, fever, or both at 3–7 days, with a rate difference between these groups of -25% (95% CI -36% to -14%), resulting in a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of four children. No significant differences were identified for age alone. In children with otorrhoea, the rate difference and NNT were -36% (-53% to -19%) and three, respectively, whereas for children without otorrhoea, the equivalent values were -14% (-23% to -5%) and eight.

- **Interpretation**: Antibiotics seem to be most beneficial in children younger than 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media and in children with both acute otitis media and otorrhoea. For most other children with mild disease, an observational policy seems justified.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^114FpdgU]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute otitis media, particularly concerning systemic antibiotics, the AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend administering an antibiotic with additional β-lactamase coverage in patients meeting any of the following criteria:

- **Receipt of amoxicillin in the last 30 days**: Patients who have recently taken amoxicillin may require additional β-lactamase coverage.
- **Presence of concomitant purulent conjunctivitis**: This condition may necessitate an antibiotic regimen with broader coverage.
- **History of recurrent acute otitis media (reAOM) unresponsive to amoxicillin**: Past cases that did not respond to amoxicillin may benefit from an alternative treatment approach.

### Multiple simultaneous complications of acute otitis media in a child diagnosed with chronic granulomatous disease: A case report [^113nve1H]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

While the prevalence of acute otitis media complications in pediatric patients has decreased over the past 30 years due to effective antibiotic therapy, the incidence has begun to rise again recently, possibly because of increased antibiotic resistance. Patients who simultaneously manifest multiple complications may require a more thorough evaluation, including an immunologic work-up. The presented case should encourage physicians to investigate the possibility of an underlying immunodeficiency when treating patients with multiple simultaneous complications of acute otitis media.

### The clinical course of acute otitis media in high-risk Australian Aboriginal children: A longitudinal study [^114RW6uV]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

- **Comparison with outcomes in clinical trials**: Should we be surprised that "persistent AOM" is so common in this population? In published prospective studies where children have not been treated with antibiotics, the rate of clinical failure in the first week ranged from 2% to 83%. The median failure rate was 24%. The most striking influence on reported rates of clinical failure was the definition used for this outcome. Authors that defined clinical failure in terms of persistent symptoms (fever or otalgia) reported the lowest rates of clinical failure (all < 25% at the end of the first week). The median clinical failure rate for these studies was 15%.

	- In contrast, the five studies with the highest clinical failure rates (range 38–83%, median 73%) defined clinical failure as persistence of otoscopic signs. Only one study described both the rate of persistent symptoms (13%) and persistent otoscopic signs (73%) after seven days. Overall, these studies suggest that symptoms resolve quickly in most children with AOM not receiving antibiotics, while otoscopic signs do not. Consequently, we should probably not be surprised by our findings of persistent otoscopic signs in a high-risk population where compliance with recommended antibiotic treatment is poor and antibiotic resistance is common.

	- Unfortunately, in nearly all published clinical trials, there is insufficient information to determine whether persistent bulging of the TM was a common finding. Persistent middle ear discharge was probably unusual, as it is a readily identified complication of AOM.

### Antibiotic treatment in acute otitis media promotes superinfection with resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae carried before initiation of treatment [^115U2pdc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Antibiotic-resistant pneumococci are difficult to eradicate from the middle ear fluid (MEF) and nasopharynx (NP). Bacteriologic eradication from the NP and MEF during acute otitis media (AOM) by three common antibiotic drugs was prospectively evaluated. In 19 (16%) of 119 MEF culture-positive patients, an organism susceptible to the treatment drug (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or both) was isolated from the initial MEF, whereas resistant S. pneumoniae was present in the NP. In 9 (47%) patients, the initial resistant NP organism (identified by serotyping, resistance to the administered drug, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) replaced the susceptible MEF organism only a few days after the initiation of treatment. In regions where resistant pneumococci are prevalent, antibiotics may not only fail to eradicate the organisms, but they may also often induce MEF superinfection with resistant pneumococci initially carried in the NP. This is an important mechanism by which, in recently treated patients, AOM infections often become refractory to treatment.

### Tuberculous otitis media in a renal transplant recipient [^111d8eCx]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Tuberculous otitis media is a rare cause of chronic suppurative infection of the middle ear and a very uncommon form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Although there have been several case reports in the non-immunosuppressed population of tuberculous otitis media, it has never been reported in an immunosuppressed allograft recipient. We present a case of diagnosed tuberculous otitis media after chronic otitis media was treated several times with empiric antibiotic treatment.

After the patient developed a postauricular fistula and underwent surgical removal of granulation tissue, the diagnosis was made on the basis of histopathology and growth in culture of Ziehl-Neelsen. Clinical response promptly followed the institution of antituberculous treatment, including isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.

### Treatment of corticosteroid-responsive autoimmune inner ear disease with methotrexate: a randomized controlled trial [^115e6kLN]. JAMA (2003). High credibility.

A number of therapies have been proposed for the long-term management of corticosteroid-responsive, rapidly progressive, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (autoimmune inner ear disease [AIED]). Methotrexate has emerged as the benchmark agent but has not been rigorously evaluated for hearing improvement in patients with AIED.

- **Objective**: To assess the efficacy of long-term methotrexate in maintaining hearing improvements achieved with glucocorticoid (prednisone) therapy in patients with AIED.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted from February 3, 1998, to November 5, 2001. It involved 67 patients with rapidly progressive, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss at 10 tertiary care centers in the United States.

- **Intervention**: Randomization to either oral methotrexate (15 to 20 mg/wk; n = 33) or placebo (n = 34), in combination with an 18-week prednisone taper. Follow-up examinations, including audiometric evaluation, were performed at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 52 weeks, or until hearing loss was documented.

- **Main outcome measure**: Maintenance of hearing improvement achieved from prednisone treatment.

- **Results**: Sixty-seven patients enrolled in the prednisone challenge, and 57.8% experienced hearing improvement. Twenty-five patients (37%) experienced hearing improvements in both ears. Of the individuals who reached study end points, 24 (80%) of 30 end points were due to measured hearing loss in the methotrexate group and 29 (93.5%) of 31 end points were due to measured hearing loss in the placebo group (P = 0.15).

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media: evaluating the evidence [^111MDeQS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common illnesses for which children in the United States receive an antimicrobial agent. Of the six recommendations offered in recent guidelines for the treatment of AOM, only one, the assessment and treatment of pain with analgesics, is based on strong evidence. This article reviews the diagnosis of AOM and the accuracy of various signs and symptoms in indicating a bacterial origin, the data on the effect of antimicrobial agents compared with placebo in the treatment of AOM, and the gaps in knowledge that should be addressed by future research and clinical trials.

### Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria in children with acute otitis media and ear discharge: A systematic review [^1143rHg1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common childhood infections and a leading cause of doctor consultations and antibiotic prescribing worldwide. Approximately 15%–20% of children with AOM present with acute onset ear discharge due to a spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane (AOMd). Contrary to widespread beliefs, children with AOMd experience similar levels of ear pain and feel less well at presentation than those without ear discharge (AOMwd). Children with AOMd have a higher disease burden, with increased rates of ear pain and/or fever at 3–7 days, along with more AOM recurrences and hearing problems at 3 months compared to children without ear discharge. Antibiotics are more effective in children with AOMd than in those with AOMwd; the number needed to treat to achieve resolution of ear pain and/or fever at days 3 to 7 is 3 versus 8, respectively. AOM guidelines, therefore, recommend clinicians consider immediate antibiotic prescribing in children with AOMd, in contrast to AOMwd, for which a watchful waiting approach is advised for otherwise healthy children with non-severe unilateral disease.

It has been suggested that the differences in clinical picture and disease course between AOMwd and AOMd may be attributed to differences in causative pathogens. A 2016 systematic review, including 38 published reports of microbiology of children with AOMwd, found that Streptococcus pneumoniae (average detection rate of 27.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (23.1%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (7.0%) are the most common bacteria associated with AOMwd globally.

### Otitis media and its consequences: beyond the earache [^114CgyV2]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

An international group of multidisciplinary experts on middle-ear and paediatric infections met to explore where consensus exists on the management of acute otitis media. After informal discussions among several specialists in paediatric infectious disease, the group was expanded to include a larger spectrum of professionals with complementary expertise in middle-ear disease.

Acute otitis media is a very common bacterial infection in children worldwide, leading to excessive antibiotic consumption in children in most countries and to a substantial burden of deafness and suppurative complications in developing countries. The group attempted to move beyond the existing controversies surrounding guidelines on acute otitis media and to propose their views to clinicians and public health officials on the actions needed to reduce the disease burden caused by acute otitis media and the microbial antibiotic resistance from the resulting use of antibiotics.

Defining acute otitis media and ensuring diagnostic accuracy are crucial steps to identify children who will potentially benefit from treatment with antibiotics and to eliminate unnecessary prescribing. Although the group agreed that antibiotics are distributed indiscriminately, even to children who do not seem to have the disease, no consensus could be reached on whether antibiotics should be given to all appropriately diagnosed children. This reflects the wide range of practices and lack of convincing evidence from observational studies. The major unanimous concern was an urgent need to reduce unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics.

### Panel 7: Otitis media: Treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of recurrent acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media, and complications of otitis media, as well as their implications for clinical practice.

Data sources included PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. From 1122 potential articles reviewed, 118 relevant articles were included in this summary.

Conclusions drawn from recent literature and guidelines emphasize the importance of accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is an optional approach in mild to moderate acute otitis media; however, antibiotics can shorten symptoms and the duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age-dependent. Topical antibiotics are the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to the surgical closure of eardrum perforations appear promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments.

Implications for practice include a strong emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media in its various forms.

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa [^115Fetqo]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. It provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. Variations in the management of AOE and the importance of an accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the clinical resolution of AOE.

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote the appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is necessary due to new clinical trials, systematic reviews, and a lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patients are individuals aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. While differential diagnosis will be discussed, recommendations for management are limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. It is applicable in any setting where patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

In clinical studies, a randomized, multi-center, evaluator-blinded study investigated the effectiveness of CETRAXAL in patients with acute otitis externa. Patients were treated with either CETRAXAL twice daily or a combination of neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and hydrocortisone otic solution (PNH) three times daily for 7 days.

In the per protocol population, clinical cure was achieved at the end of the 7-day treatment in 70% (173/247) of the CETRAXAL-treated group, compared to 60% (147/243) in the control group.

### Effectiveness of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for outcomes of acute otitis media [^1164Tjth]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

To determine whether adherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for acute otitis media (AOM) could be increased, a cluster randomization study was conducted. The objective was also to see if improved adherence would result in better outcomes for AOM.

A cluster randomization study was conducted in 12 pediatric practices, with 6 intervention and 6 control sites. The main outcome measures were adherence to the CDC recommendations, which included two additional antimicrobial agents, and a subsequent antibiotic prescription for AOM within 30 days after diagnosis.

Of 3152 patients referred to research assistants, 2584 (82%) were eligible. Among those eligible, 1368 (99%) out of 1382 at the intervention sites and 1138 (99%) out of 1146 at the control sites consented to participate. The rates of adherence to the CDC recommendations were not significantly higher at the intervention sites than at the control sites, both for initial enrollment episodes (78.2% vs 70.6%) and second episodes (62.6% vs 59.9%). After controlling for clustering according to site and covariates, it was found that children who were not treated in adherence to the CDC recommendations for both episodes had 1.60 times the odds of receiving a subsequent prescription within 12 days, compared with those treated in adherence at both episodes.

Despite employing evidence-based methods known to influence physician behavior, the study was unable to increase adherence to the CDC recommendations for AOM treatment. However, it was established that the prescription of antimicrobial therapy consistent with CDC guidelines reduced the likelihood of subsequent antibiotic prescriptions.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112WRk5V]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

This evidence-based clinical practice guideline is a revision of the 2004 acute otitis media (AOM) guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians. It provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM. In 2009, the AAP convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in the fields of pediatrics, family practice, otolaryngology, epidemiology, infectious disease, emergency medicine, and guideline methodology.

The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the new literature related to AOM since the initial evidence report of 2000. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations. The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM.

It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures. It also addresses reAOM, which was not included in the 2004 guideline. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the AAP. This clinical practice guideline is a critical tool for improving patient care.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^1151Z5eo]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). High credibility.

During therapy, bilaterally normal ears were observed at least once in 21% of amoxicillin-treated infants compared to 10% in the placebo group. More children in the amoxicillin group had at least one diagnosis of OME and more cases of AOM without perforation (AOMwoP). Fewer amoxicillin-treated children experienced AOMwiP (25% and 33%, respectively), with a significantly lower recurrence rate of AOMwiP in amoxicillin children (4%) than in placebo children (18%) (RD = -14% [-25, -2]).

Results as a proportion of examinations showed bilateral normal ears in 6% of visits for amoxicillin infants and 2% for placebo infants (adjusted risk ratio = 2.7 [0.78, 9.13], p = 0.116). OME was diagnosed as the worst condition in about half of the visits, while AOMwoP was detected in about one quarter. AOMwiP was diagnosed less frequently in amoxicillin-treated children (8%) compared to placebo (19%) (adjusted risk ratio = 0.36 [0.16, 0.84], p = 0.017). Significant differences in perforation were found when pooling data for any suppurative OM, any perforation, and any active perforation. Antibiotic prescribing for clinical indications was less common at examinations for amoxicillin children (55%) compared to placebo children (68%) (adjusted risk ratio = 0.67 [0.36, 1.22], p = 0.190).

- **Nasopharyngeal outcomes at the end of therapy**: At therapy's conclusion, the carriage of OM pathogens and penicillin non-susceptible strains are detailed in Table 2.
