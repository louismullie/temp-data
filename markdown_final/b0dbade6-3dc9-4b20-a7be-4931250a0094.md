## Question

Ticagrelor for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ticagrelor has a role in bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what current ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines actually recommend for infective endocarditis prophylaxis. Then, I should verify ticagrelor's approved indications and pharmacology to see if there is any plausible rationale. Next, I will examine the clinical and translational evidence on ticagrelor and infection outcomes. After that, I have to check whether any guideline explicitly mentions antiplatelet agents for prophylaxis. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical recommendation, highlight what not to do, and consider research gaps, while double-checking for internal consistency with the cited guidance throughout.

> Let me first confirm the standard of care for endocarditis prophylaxis, because if guidelines only endorse antibiotics for specific high-risk groups and procedures, that would immediately shape the answer; ACC/AHA and ESC restrict antibiotic prophylaxis to patients at highest risk undergoing invasive dental procedures that manipulate gingival tissue or perforate oral mucosa, with no routine prophylaxis for most non-dental procedures in the absence of active infection, which strongly suggests no role for antiplatelet agents in prophylaxis by default [^1117ghTf] [^114eTwUw] [^1173L2pL] [^114BRUvb] [^1153dkrk] [^116tJsFK].

> Wait, I should double-check the recommended prophylactic regimens themselves, because if ticagrelor were ever considered it would likely be noted alongside antibiotics; guideline-endorsed dental prophylaxis is antibiotic-based, historically centered on amoxicillin with alternatives for penicillin allergy, whereas clindamycin features variably across eras and contexts, and crucially this concerns antibiotic prophylaxis rather than antiplatelet therapy, with no endorsement of antiplatelets for prophylaxis in these documents, and I should also not confuse therapeutic cautions about clindamycin in staphylococcal native-valve IE treatment with prophylaxis indications, which are distinct [^1117ghTf] [^114BRUvb] [^116CxDok] [^112wDTSh].

> I need to ensure ticagrelor's pharmacology and labeled use are clear, because if it is purely antithrombotic and not antimicrobial, its role in preventing bacteremia-driven IE would be mechanistically misaligned; ticagrelor is a reversible P2Y12 inhibitor for ACS with dosing of 180 mg load then 90 mg twice daily, and despite any immunomodulatory platelet effects it is not an antibiotic nor approved for infection prevention [^112WTc93] [^112AWk49] [^112CfT1X].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence linking ticagrelor to infections, and I need to be cautious about observational bias; one retrospective matched cohort suggested a lower risk of gram-positive infections with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in ACS patients over one year, but a separate STEMI cohort found no significant difference in in-hospital infections, underscoring inconsistent findings and the absence of any endocarditis-specific prophylaxis outcome, so causation cannot be inferred here [^113mNjbi] [^114tAiMg].

> Hold on, let me examine translational data that might hint at a plausible mechanism; ticagrelor has been shown in vitro and in a case report to enhance platelet-mediated killing of Staphylococcus aureus and mitigate α-toxin platelet injury, and broader systems analyses have speculated on host-directed therapies including platelet modulation, yet these are exploratory signals not tested in prophylaxis trials, and animal models of antiplatelet or antithrombin prophylaxis against experimental IE do not translate into current clinical recommendations for human prophylaxis [^112qmveP] [^116Tm1kp] [^1128mT8X].

> I should confirm whether any major society guideline mentions ticagrelor or antiplatelet therapy for IE prevention, because if there is truly no mention, that is decisive; across ACC/AHA and ESC endocarditis prevention guidance there are no recommendations for antiplatelet agents for prophylaxis, and the 2021 AHA scientific statement on VGS IE prevention reaffirmed the narrowed 2007 approach without expanding beyond antibiotic prophylaxis in the highest-risk groups, further reinforcing that antiplatelets are not part of prophylactic strategy [^1117ghTf] [^114BRUvb] [^112wDTSh].

> Let me think about goals of prophylaxis versus ticagrelor's effects, because misalignment here would argue against use; prophylaxis aims to prevent or rapidly suppress procedure-related bacteremia and early adherence, which requires antimicrobial activity or coverage of expected flora, while ticagrelor lacks bactericidal action and carries bleeding considerations around invasive procedures, and although de-escalation to ticagrelor monotherapy reduces bleeding versus prolonged DAPT, that still does not convert an antiplatelet into a substitute for antibiotics in IE prevention [^115wy1i5] [^112PejMr] [^114BRUvb].

> I will now synthesize the clinical recommendation, but first I should verify there is no edge case where ticagrelor status modifies prophylaxis decisions; for high-risk cardiac conditions undergoing indicated dental procedures, give antibiotic prophylaxis per ACC/AHA and ESC regardless of concomitant ticagrelor use, and for non-dental procedures in the absence of active infection, do not give prophylaxis, which means ticagrelor neither replaces nor negates guideline-directed antibiotic prophylaxis decisions [^1117ghTf] [^114eTwUw] [^1173L2pL] [^114BRUvb].

> But wait, what if someone proposes adding ticagrelor "just in case" for prophylaxis; I should be explicit that this is not appropriate since there is no evidence base, no endorsement by societies, and potential bleeding drawbacks during procedures, so clinicians should not substitute or add ticagrelor for IE prophylaxis and should not withhold antibiotics solely because a patient is on ticagrelor for ACS indications [^114BRUvb] [^1117ghTf] [^112WTc93].

> Next, I should review future research directions without overstating readiness; platelet–bacteria interactions are intriguing and merit randomized trials focused on infection endpoints, but current signals are translational or observational and not in prophylaxis populations, so definitive testing would require well-designed RCTs assessing IE prevention, and until then, practice should remain aligned with antibiotic-only prophylaxis for the appropriate high-risk cohorts [^112qmveP] [^113mNjbi] [^114tAiMg] [^116Tm1kp].

> Final check: I should confirm there is no overlooked evidence of benefit in established IE to avoid conflating treatment with prevention; observational data suggest chronic antiplatelet therapy may reduce embolic events in active IE, but that pertains to complication mitigation during infection and does not establish a role for antiplatelet agents in preventing IE, so this distinction supports maintaining antibiotic-only prophylaxis for prevention [^114gpyZQ] [^114BRUvb].

Ticagrelor is not recommended for **bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis** [^114BRUvb]. Current ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines endorse only **antibiotic prophylaxis** [^1117ghTf] for high-risk patients undergoing specific procedures [^112wDTSh]. Ticagrelor's antiplatelet and limited antibacterial effects [^112qmveP] do not prevent bacteremia or IE, and **its bleeding risk outweighs any theoretical benefit**. There is no clinical evidence supporting ticagrelor for IE prevention, and **it should not be used for this purpose** [^112wDTSh].

---

## Current clinical guidelines for endocarditis prophylaxis

Current clinical guidelines from the **ESC and ACC/AHA** [^114BRUvb] [^1117ghTf] provide clear recommendations on bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis. The ESC 2023 guidelines recommend **antibiotic prophylaxis** for high-risk patients undergoing specific dental [^114BRUvb], respiratory [^111qqtws], gastrointestinal [^1153dkrk], genitourinary [^1116PWSo], and cardiac procedures [^1138QMUt]. The ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines similarly recommend **antibiotic prophylaxis** for high-risk patients undergoing dental procedures [^1117ghTf] involving manipulation of gingival tissue, the periapical region, or perforation of the oral mucosa. Both emphasize antibiotic prophylaxis only for high-risk patients and procedures [^1173L2pL], with **no mention or recommendation of antiplatelet agents** such as ticagrelor for prophylaxis [^112wDTSh].

---

## Ticagrelor's pharmacological properties and potential antibacterial effects

Ticagrelor is a reversible oral P2Y12 receptor antagonist [^112CfT1X] used primarily as an antiplatelet agent in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [^112AWk49]. Recent studies suggest it may possess **limited antibacterial properties** [^112qmveP], particularly against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. In vitro studies show that ticagrelor enhances **platelet-mediated killing of Staphylococcus aureus**, potentially through inhibition of bacterial α-toxin-mediated platelet injury [^112qmveP]. Clinical observations from a retrospective cohort study suggest a **reduced risk of gram-positive infections** in patients treated with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel following ACS hospitalization [^113mNjbi]. However, these effects are limited and **not sufficient to prevent bacteremia or bacterial colonization** of cardiac valves — critical steps in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis [^114BRUvb].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding ticagrelor for endocarditis prophylaxis

There is **no clinical evidence or randomized controlled trials** specifically evaluating ticagrelor for prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis. Available evidence regarding ticagrelor's antibacterial effects is limited to in vitro studies [^112qmveP], animal models, and observational clinical studies [^113mNjbi], none of which directly address its efficacy in preventing endocarditis. Animal studies indicate that antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and ticlopidine have shown some **protective effects in experimental endocarditis**, but these findings have not translated into clinical practice or guidelines [^1128mT8X]. Clinical studies have not specifically **evaluated ticagrelor for endocarditis prophylaxis**.

---

## Risks and benefits of ticagrelor compared to standard antibiotic prophylaxis

When considering ticagrelor for endocarditis prophylaxis, it is essential to weigh potential risks and benefits against standard antibiotic prophylaxis. Benefits are **limited**: ticagrelor's potential antibacterial effects are insufficient to prevent bacteremia or bacterial colonization of cardiac valves, so any theoretical benefit is minimal and unsupported by clinical evidence. Risks include **significant bleeding** — including major bleeding events well documented in clinical trials [^115wy1i5] and guidelines — as well as dyspnea and other adverse effects that further limit its suitability for prophylactic use. In contrast, **antibiotic prophylaxis is specifically targeted** [^1117ghTf] to prevent bacterial colonization and infection, with well-established efficacy and safety profiles in high-risk patients undergoing specific procedures [^114BRUvb].

---

## Current clinical recommendations and expert consensus

There are **no clinical guidelines or expert consensus statements recommending ticagrelor** for prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis [^114BRUvb]. The ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines explicitly recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for high-risk patients undergoing specific procedures, with no mention of antiplatelet agents such as ticagrelor [^114BRUvb] [^1117ghTf].

---

## Ongoing clinical trials and research

As of now, there are **no ongoing clinical trials specifically investigating ticagrelor** for prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis. Available research primarily focuses on ticagrelor's role in cardiovascular disease management [^112CfT1X] and its potential antibacterial effects in other clinical contexts [^113mNjbi].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, **ticagrelor is not recommended** for prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis [^114BRUvb]. Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus explicitly recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for high-risk patients undergoing specific procedures, with no mention or support for antiplatelet agents such as ticagrelor [^1117ghTf] [^112wDTSh]. The limited antibacterial effects of ticagrelor are insufficient to prevent bacteremia or bacterial colonization of cardiac valves [^112qmveP], and its significant bleeding risk further limits suitability for prophylactic use. Therefore, **ticagrelor should not be used** for prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis, and **antibiotic prophylaxis remains the standard of care** for high-risk patients undergoing specific procedures [^114BRUvb].

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^117FFGTn]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

In 2012, the Endocarditis Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) published updated guidelines for the treatment of endocarditis. Given the significant progress in the field, a new multidisciplinary and multiprofessional BSAC Working Party was convened to systematically review the literature and update the previous guideline where appropriate. This statement includes native valve endocarditis (NVE) and prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). For the purposes of this guideline, "PVE" includes prosthetic valves of all types, annuloplasty rings, intracardiac patches, aortic root grafts and patches, and shunts. There is some overlap with the management of implantable cardiac electronic device infections, but many issues have been previously addressed elsewhere.

Infective endocarditis (IE) remains a difficult condition to diagnose with high mortality. Patients with IE can present with a wide variety of symptoms, signs, and complications and are consequently managed by teams from a wide variety of specialties. In the UK, patients with IE may present acutely to district general hospitals or to a heart centre (hospital with a cardiac surgical unit). Only patients living in the immediate catchment of a heart centre are likely to be admitted directly to a heart centre. Detailed data on the place of presentation are lacking, but a recent study from a heart centre in London found the vast majority of patients were transferred from district general hospitals. Clinicians with primary responsibility for a patient with IE may have relatively little experience.

### Erythromycin lactobionate [^111yLSn6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Although no controlled clinical efficacy trials have been conducted, oral erythromycin has been recommended by the American Heart Association for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis in penicillin-allergic patients. This includes those with prosthetic cardiac valves, most congenital cardiac malformations, surgically constructed systemic pulmonary shunts, rheumatic or other acquired valvular dysfunctions, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS), a previous history of bacterial endocarditis, and mitral valve prolapse with insufficiency when undergoing dental procedures and surgical procedures of the upper respiratory tract.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of erythromycin and other antibacterial drugs, erythromycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empirical selection of therapy.

### Effect of ticagrelor on reducing the risk of gram-positive infections in patients with acute coronary syndrome [^113mNjbi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

In light of recent studies describing the antibacterial properties of ticagrelor, the association between treatment with ticagrelor and subsequent risk for infection following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is taking on increased importance. A single-center, retrospective, matched cohort analysis was performed. All patients older than 30 years of age admitted between January 1, 2013, and November 1, 2019, for an ACS and discharged with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) were included. The primary outcome was defined as hospital admissions due to infections likely caused by gram-positive bacteria up to 1 year following the ACS hospitalization.

The base cohort included 3,909 patients. About 2,035 (52.1%) were treated with ticagrelor, and 1,874 (47.9%) with clopidogrel. Patients treated with ticagrelor had a 64% lower risk of gram-positive infection during the first year following hospitalization after adjusting for demographic and co-morbidity factors compared with those treated with clopidogrel (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.61; p < 0.001). In a cohort starting from 1 year (conclusion of DAPT period) and up to 3 years following ACS hospitalization, the risk of gram-positive infection was comparable in both groups (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.19; p = 0.182). Treatment with ticagrelor was not associated with a reduced risk of gram-negative infections (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.21 to 1.06; p = 0.07).

In conclusion, a DAPT regimen that includes aspirin and ticagrelor is associated with a reduced risk of gram-positive infection compared with the combination of a clopidogrel-based regimen.

### New British and American guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: Do the changes make sense? A critical review [^111JqndQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and the American Heart Association have radically revised their guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis. This review discusses the evidence behind the most controversial changes and considers possible future developments.

- **Recent findings**: The new guidelines emphasize good oral hygiene for preventing viridans streptococcal endocarditis. Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures is only recommended for patients with the highest-risk cardiac conditions. American Heart Association guidelines no longer recommend prophylaxis for urological and gastrointestinal procedures.

- **Summary**: While only up to 6% of endocarditis cases may be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis, there is controversy regarding recommendations for individual cardiac patients undergoing specific procedures. The new guidelines about dental prophylaxis are based on epidemiological studies that failed to include sufficient subjects undergoing specific interventions. When considering viridans streptococcal rather than total bacteraemia rates, asserting that the prevalence of bacteraemia after invasive dental procedures is similar to that after toothbrushing may be incorrect. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy report probably overestimates the risk of fatal anaphylaxis after an oral dose of amoxicillin. In contrast, the American Heart Association guidelines comment on the absence of any reports of fatal anaphylaxis associated with the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^112i6ccw]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Based on the variability of the monthly data before the change, we set as the margin a 15% increase over the fitted number for cases and deaths. To carry out the test, we constructed a 95% confidence interval for the monthly mean number of cases or deaths for the 25 months after the guideline change. If the upper limit of the confidence interval corresponded to an increase of less than 15% over the model's estimate for the number of cases or deaths for March 2008 (that is, < 139.8 or < 22.4, respectively), we considered that the number of cases or deaths had not increased significantly.

Prespecified secondary tests of whether cases of infective endocarditis or deaths had increased since the introduction of the guideline were: testing whether there was an increase in the time trend in the Poisson regression models, and noting whether in 17 or more months from April 2008 to April 2010 the number of cases or deaths exceeded the fitted value for March 2008 (121.6 cases or 19.5 deaths). The probability of 25 independent counts of 17 exceeding this level was 0.22 (that is, < 5%), and so we set 17 as the test statistic.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^116FJfkL]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Cost-effectiveness estimates are subject to uncertainty relating to values of the input parameters on clinical effectiveness, costs, and health outcomes. This uncertainty is a genuine concern because any decision could be incorrect; health benefits could be lost because of investment in a treatment that is not cost-effective. The value of eliminating all uncertainty, such that there is no risk of an incorrect decision, is called the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), which provides an estimate of the upper bound of the cost of any additional research that would reduce uncertainty. For the all-at-risk population, the EVPI is near zero (£9,020 [$11,997; €10,824] for amoxicillin, £11,409 [$15,174; €13,691] for clindamycin over 10 years in England). This is because there is little uncertainty; antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) is almost certainly cost-effective and, therefore, reducing uncertainty in any of the input parameters would be unlikely to lead to a different conclusion. However, the clinical effectiveness of AP is subject to some uncertainty because of reliance on observational data and interrupted time-series analysis.

Accordingly, we conducted an additional exploratory analysis in which assumptions concerning uncertainty around the efficacy of AP in the all-at-risk population were increased. The base case analysis assumes that withdrawal of AP led to 34.9 additional cases of infective endocarditis (IE) per month. Therefore, a model averaging approach was used such that half the sample maintained this estimate and half used an estimate of zero (i.e. AP has no effect).

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, the 2015 AHA guidelines recommend administering combination antimicrobial therapy in patients with infective endocarditis of prosthetic valves or other prosthetic material caused by S. aureus. It is advised to administer gentamicin for the initial two weeks of therapy, alongside either β-lactam or vancomycin-containing regimens.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: Diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: A scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^114QwYYb]. Circulation (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy in line with the AHA 2015 guidelines, consider administering regimens that include either ampicillin or aqueous crystalline penicillin G plus gentamicin, or ampicillin plus ceftriaxone in patients with infective endocarditis (IE) caused by enterococci susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin, and aminoglycosides.

Consider completing either 4 or 6 weeks of ampicillin or penicillin plus gentamicin therapy in patients with native valve IE, depending on the duration of IE symptoms before the initiation of therapy. If ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is selected as the treatment regimen, a 6-week therapy is recommended regardless of symptom duration. For patients with prosthetic valve IE, a 6-week antimicrobial therapy should be administered.

### Prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: Current tendencies, continuing controversies [^114ToEa4]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a severe disease with high mortality and results most often from the combination of bacteraemia (sometimes provoked) and a predisposing cardiac condition. Prophylaxis for infective endocarditis has been recommended by different countries based on the supposed pathophysiology of the disease, although no randomized clinical trial has confirmed its efficacy. We review the data presented over the past few decades, challenge the principles underlying prophylaxis recommendations, and analyze the arguments that explain the general tendency in very recent years to decrease prophylaxis indications. Such arguments include the probable important role of everyday-life bacteraemia in the occurrence of infective endocarditis, the estimated vast number of prophylaxis doses required to avoid a single case of infective endocarditis, and the lack of scientific evidence to identify procedures that should lead to prophylaxis. Recommendations for prophylaxis are now essentially focused on patients with high-risk predisposing cardiac conditions before dental procedures.

### Using ticagrelor to prevent recurrent type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarctions: Boon or bane [^117UYTmv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The role of ticagrelor in preventing recurrent myocardial infarctions (MIs) is under continuous investigation. Some studies suggest that ticagrelor may be effective in reducing recurrent type 1 and type 2 MIs, whereas others have shown less definitive results. Researchers are particularly interested in understanding how ticagrelor compares to other antiplatelet therapies, both in terms of safety and efficacy.

- **The mechanisms of action**: Ticagrelor works by reversibly binding to the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, thereby inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation. This can result in a decreased risk for clot formation, which is a primary cause of myocardial infarction.

- **Clinical trials**: Recent clinical trials provide mixed evidence regarding the net benefit of ticagrelor in diverse patient populations. While some data indicate a reduction in the incidence of recurrent MIs, the risk of bleeding complications remains a concern for clinicians.

It is crucial for ongoing and future studies to more definitively establish the comparative effectiveness of ticagrelor, considering both clinical outcomes and patient safety profiles.

### Impact of a specific echocardiographic report comment regarding endocarditis prophylaxis on compliance with American Heart Association recommendations [^114mRfr5]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

There is substantial underuse and overuse of antibiotic prophylaxis. American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations are heavily dependent on echocardiographic data that may not be familiar to referring physicians. We sought to determine the impact of a specific prophylaxis report comment on compliance with AHA recommendations.

- **Methods and results**: Using a standardized electronic reporting system, physicians interpreting approximately 50% of echocardiograms included a concluding comment classifying endocarditis risk and stating whether prophylaxis was indicated. The remaining reports were identical in format/content but did not include such comments. Of 1461 eligible outpatients during a 6-month period, 969 (66.3%) responded to a mail survey regarding prophylaxis instructions. Overall, 50% reported taking prophylaxis. Compliance with AHA recommendations was greater among those with a comment (73.2% versus 65.4% for those receiving versus those not receiving comments, respectively; P = 0.011), with particular improvement among moderate-risk patients (69.5% versus 59.9%, P = 0.024).

- **Conclusions**: An echocardiographic report statement regarding endocarditis risk and the need for prophylaxis is a simple, low-cost intervention that improves compliance with AHA recommendations. Interpreting physicians should become familiar with AHA recommendations and include a concluding statement addressing prophylaxis.

### Ticagrelor and the risk of infections during hospitalization in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^114tAiMg]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Low credibility.

Although ticagrelor exerts antibacterial activity, its effect on infections in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is unclear. We aimed to assess whether ticagrelor and clopidogrel affect infections in these patients during hospitalization.

- **Methods**: A total of 2116 consecutive patients with STEMI undergoing PCI were divided into the ticagrelor (n = 388) and clopidogrel (n = 1728) groups. The primary outcome was infection onset. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). Propensity score analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results.

- **Results**: Infections developed in 327 (15.4%) patients. There was no significant difference in infection rates between both groups (ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel: 13.1% vs. 16.0%, p = 0.164). Patients in the ticagrelor group had lower rates of in-hospital all-cause death and MACCE than patients in the clopidogrel group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined that ticagrelor and clopidogrel had a similar preventive effect on infections during hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80–1.78, p = 0.380). Compared to patients treated with clopidogrel, those treated with ticagrelor had a slightly lower risk of other outcomes, but no statistical difference. Propensity score analyses demonstrated similar results for infections and other outcomes.

### De-escalation to ticagrelor monotherapy versus 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with and without acute coronary syndromes: A systematic review and individual patient-level meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115wy1i5]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 12 months is the standard of care after coronary stenting in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The aim of this individual patient-level meta-analysis was to summarise the evidence comparing DAPT de-escalation to ticagrelor monotherapy versus continuing DAPT for 12 months after coronary drug-eluting stent implantation.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD)-level meta-analysis of randomised trials with centrally adjudicated endpoints was performed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy (90 mg twice a day) after short-term DAPT (from 2 weeks to 3 months) versus 12-month DAPT in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with a coronary drug-eluting stent. Randomised trials comparing P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy with DAPT after coronary revascularisation were searched in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and two websites (www.tctmd.com and www.escardio.org) from database inception up to May 20, 2024. Trials that included patients with an indication for long-term oral anticoagulants were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The principal investigators of the eligible trials provided IPD by means of an anonymised electronic dataset. The three ranked coprimary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACCE; a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stroke), tested for non-inferiority in the per-protocol population, and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 3 or 5.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the joint British societies [^1144hyvU]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

The scoping exercise for this guideline revision identified new questions concerning the optimal delivery of care for patients with infective endocarditis (IE). The key questions were:

- **How should IE services be delivered**: This includes an assessment of infrastructure and support, endocarditis teams, referral processes, and governance.
- **What outpatient follow-up should be provided**: This covers patient follow-up and information dissemination.
- **What information should be given to patients**: Emphasizing patient education and communication.

After excluding duplicates, the guideline review identified 16,231 papers related to IE, of which 20 papers were pertinent to the delivery of IE services and met the inclusion criteria. These findings were categorized into broad themes: endocarditis teams, infrastructure and support, referral processes, patient follow-up and information, and governance. Eight studies involved adults only, while 12 did not specify age inclusion or exclusion criteria. Importantly, no study explicitly included children.

The audit tool used to assess compliance with infective endocarditis service delivery guidelines is depicted in Table 1. Additionally, the results of the risk of bias assessment can be found in the online supplemental file 2.

### Perspectives on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis [^113B2rJW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association published a guideline statement that dramatically changed its previous position on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at risk of infective endocarditis (IE). This year, these views were incorporated into an update of the 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease. The new recommendations represent a dramatic shift regarding which patients should receive antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of IE and for what procedures.

The shift in recommendations is particularly striking because they are based not on new data but rather on a lack of data. There are no large, prospective, randomized double-blind trials testing the efficacy of IE prophylaxis. However, available data suggest that there may be no real risk associated with IE prophylaxis. Even if few cases of IE are successfully prevented using antibiotic prophylaxis, those few cases may represent a favorable risk-benefit ratio.

For patients with organic heart valve disease who are trying to delay or avoid surgical intervention, there is a very real risk if they develop IE and a very real benefit if they avoid it. Pending data from prospective randomized trials, a strategy of individual decision-making by informed patients may be best.

### Ticagrelor plus aspirin for 1 month, followed by ticagrelor monotherapy for 23 months vs aspirin plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by aspirin monotherapy for 12 months after implantation of a drug-eluting stent: a multicentre, open-label, randomised superiority trial [^114owJzS]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin for 1 month, followed by ticagrelor alone, improves outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention compared with standard antiplatelet regimens.

- **Methods**: GLOBAL LEADERS was a randomized, open-label superiority trial conducted at 130 sites across 18 countries. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with a biolimus A9-eluting stent for stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 75–100 mg of aspirin daily plus 90 mg of ticagrelor twice daily for 1 month, followed by 23 months of ticagrelor monotherapy. Alternatively, patients received standard dual antiplatelet therapy, which consisted of 75–100 mg of aspirin daily plus either 75 mg of clopidogrel daily (for those with stable coronary artery disease) or 90 mg of ticagrelor twice daily (for those with acute coronary syndromes) for 12 months, followed by aspirin monotherapy for the subsequent 12 months. Randomization was concealed and stratified by center and clinical presentation (stable coronary artery disease vs. acute coronary syndrome). It was blocked, with randomly varied block sizes of two and four. The primary endpoint at 2 years was a composite of all-cause mortality or non-fatal centrally adjudicated new Q-wave myocardial infarction, as assessed by a core lab in a blinded manner. The key secondary safety endpoint was site-reported bleeding assessed according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium criteria (grade 3 or 5). Analysis was conducted by intention to treat.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^117H7Qjf]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to quantify the change in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures for patients at risk of infective endocarditis, and any concurrent change in the incidence of infective endocarditis. This followed the introduction of a clinical guideline from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in March 2008, which recommended the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom.

- **Design**: Before and after study.
- **Setting**: England.
- **Population**: All patients admitted to hospitals in England with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of acute or subacute infective endocarditis.
- **Main outcome measures**: Monthly number of prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis, consisting of a single 3 g oral dose of amoxicillin or a single 600 mg oral dose of clindamycin. It also included monthly numbers of cases of infective endocarditis, infective endocarditis-related deaths in hospitals, or cases of infective endocarditis with a possible oral origin for streptococci.

Results showed a highly significant 78.6% reduction (P < 0.001) in the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, from an average of 10,277 (SD 1068) prescriptions per month to 2,292 (SD 176) after the introduction of the NICE guideline. However, evidence was lacking that the general upward trend in cases of infective endocarditis before the guideline was significantly altered after its introduction (P = 0.61). Using a non-inferiority test, any increase in the number of cases by 9.3% or more could be excluded following the introduction of the guideline. Similarly, an increase in infective endocarditis-related deaths in hospitals was excluded after the guideline's implementation.

### Genome-scale meta-analysis of host responses to Staphylococcus aureus identifies pathways for host-directed therapeutic targeting [^116Tm1kp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

There is interest in the modulation of thrombosis and platelet responses as an adjunct to antimicrobials in SAB, including a case report of ticagrelor adjunctive therapy in a person with persistent SAB associated with endovascular infection and metastatic foci. Our analysis supports therapeutic targeting of mechanisms associated with thrombocytopenia (e.g. ticagrelor) and bacteria/fibrin/platelet microthrombus formation, such as using dabigatran. Differential treatment effects are likely to exist between endotypes of S. aureus disease, as demonstrated for adjunctive rifampicin. Low platelet counts were associated with endocarditis, suggesting that preventing platelet loss could be beneficial. In contrast, higher counts were associated with musculoskeletal metastatic infection (without endocarditis), suggesting that inhibiting microthrombus formation could be more beneficial.

There are important limitations to this study. First, the ranking is based on the strength of evidence for any association with S. aureus disease and cannot distinguish between pro- or antibacterial effects of a given host factor, or roles in dysregulated immunity. For example, C5AR1 was a prioritized gene, and activation by C5a impairs neutrophil phagolysosomal killing of S. aureus, contributing to immune failure during critical illness. Second, included studies were heterogeneous in terms of the model systems and bacterial strains used. While this is also a strength that provides a global view of the host response, it means the final ranking applies at the broadest level.

### Ticagrelor increases platelet-mediated Staphylococcus aureus killing, resulting in clearance of bacteremia [^112qmveP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Platelets are a critical immune defense against Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections. Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin is a virulence factor that decreases platelet viability and accelerates platelet clearance. It has been shown that ticagrelor blocks α-toxin-mediated platelet injury and resulting thrombocytopenia, protecting mice in a lethal S. aureus sepsis model. We now present the use of ticagrelor as adjunctive therapy in a patient with a S. aureus endovascular infection and thrombocytopenia, associated with restoration of platelet count and bacteremia clearance. Ticagrelor enhanced platelet killing of the S. aureus bloodstream isolate from the treated patient in vitro.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^1141hHsg]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

There is concern that the period of follow-up was not long enough. However, in over 90% of cases, the incubation period for infective endocarditis is less than six weeks, and other studies have used three months as the cut-off for capturing all cases of infective endocarditis that will develop after exposure to the risk of infection. We, therefore, believe that if antibiotic prophylaxis was effective in preventing infective endocarditis, the large decrease in prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis that occurred after the introduction of the NICE guideline would have resulted in a detectable increase in cases during the 25 months of the study. Any such change should have been particularly noticeable among those cases where the causal organism was of possible oral streptococcal origin. Regardless, we intend to periodically monitor the rate of endocarditis in the English population over time.

The 78.6% decrease in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis in the months after the introduction of the guideline was large and suggests much better compliance than is often seen after policy changes in medicine. Compliance was particularly good among dentists who, besides being strongly urged to adopt the new guidelines by the chief dental officer, NICE, and the dental press, were advised by the malpractice insurance organizations that it would be difficult to defend cases where the new guidelines had not been followed. A residual level of prescribing does, however, seem to persist at around 20% of the level before the guideline. There are several possible explanations for this. First…

### Impact of prior antiplatelet therapy on risk of embolism in infective endocarditis [^114gpyZQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Embolism is a dreaded complication of infective endocarditis (IE). Currently, antimicrobial therapy is the only medical intervention proven to decrease the risk of embolism associated with IE. We hypothesized that, because platelet aggregation is operative in the pathogenesis of vegetation formation, embolism associated with IE should occur less frequently among patients who have received prior, continuous daily antiplatelet therapy for noninfectious reasons.

- **Methods**: We studied a retrospective cohort of adult patients with a diagnosis of IE who presented to the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) during 1980–1998. The cohort was divided into two groups based on whether they had received continuous daily antiplatelet therapy for at least 6 months prior to hospitalization for IE. Antiplatelet therapy included aspirin, dipyridamole, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, or any combination of these agents. The primary endpoint was a symptomatic embolic event that occurred prior to or during hospitalization. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the impact of continuous daily antiplatelet therapy on the risk of symptomatic emboli associated with IE.

- **Results**: One hundred forty-seven (24.5%) of 600 patients experienced a symptomatic embolic event; the most common embolic manifestation was stroke (in 48.2% of patients). Embolic events occurred significantly less often among those who had received prior, continuous daily antiplatelet therapy (12.0% of patients who had received therapy vs. 27.8% of patients who had not received therapy; P < .001).

### Prophylaxis of experimental endocarditis with antiplatelet and antithrombin agents: A role for long-term prevention of infective endocarditis in humans [^1128mT8X]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) mostly occurs after spontaneous low-grade bacteremia; thus, IE cannot be prevented by circumstantial antibiotic prophylaxis. Platelet activation following bacterial-fibrinogen interaction or thrombin-mediated fibrinogen-fibrin polymerization is a critical step in vegetation formation. We tested the efficacy of antiplatelet and antithrombin agents to prevent experimental IE.

- **Methods**: A rat model of experimental IE, following prolonged low-grade bacteremia mimicking smoldering bacteremia in humans, was used. Prophylaxis with antiplatelets (aspirin, ticlopidine [alone or in combination], eptifibatide, or abciximab) or anticoagulants (antithrombin dabigatran etexilate or anti-vitamin K acenocoumarol) was started 2 days before inoculation with *Streptococcus gordonii* or *Staphylococcus aureus*. Valve infection was assessed 24 hours later.

- **Results**: Aspirin plus ticlopidine, as well as abciximab, protected 45%-88% of animals against *S. gordonii* and *S. aureus* IE (P < .05). Dabigatran etexilate protected 75% of rats against IE due to *S. aureus* (P < .005) but failed to protect against *S. gordonii* (< 30% protection). Acenocoumarol was ineffective.

- **Conclusions**: Antiplatelet and direct antithrombin agents may be useful in the prophylaxis of IE in humans. In particular, the potential dual benefit of dabigatran etexilate might be reconsidered for patients with prosthetic valves, who require lifelong anticoagulation and in whom *S. aureus* IE is associated with high mortality.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^115zBmBZ]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

In the absence of high-quality evidence, all new recommendations in this section represent Working Party consensus. Infective endocarditis (IE) is an uncommon and challenging condition, and management by experienced multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) is widely considered to be the standard of care. In our opinion, the primary aim of the IE team is to improve patient outcomes, with a secondary aim to enhance the efficiency of care. The necessity for IE teams in all hospitals is evident, as patients with IE or suspected IE can present to any acute hospital; however, this has not been sufficiently emphasized. The functions and composition of an IE team will vary in different settings and may need to be dynamic, allowing individuals to rotate into the role, depending on resources and local staffing arrangements.

- **Functions of the multidisciplinary IE team**: We believe that early diagnosis of IE leads to improved outcomes, but this is likely dependent on the early initiation of optimal antibiotic therapy and the optimal timing of surgery. A reduction in time to targeted antibiotic therapy and the first transthoracic echocardiogram was observed in one MDT evaluation. Educational packages to raise awareness of the risk of IE in patients with S. aureus bacteremia may also help speed diagnosis. One factor that is likely to affect outcomes positively for many patients is prompt access to cardiac surgery. Since this is best assessed in a heart center, there is a need for clear pathways for consultation and referral between non-surgical and surgical centers, and objective criteria to guide referral or transfer.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^1144WRma]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

This study aimed to quantify the change in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures for patients at risk of infective endocarditis. It also examined any change in the incidence of infective endocarditis following the introduction of a clinical guideline from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in March 2008, which recommended the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom.

- **Design**: Before and after study.

- **Setting**: England. The population consisted of all patients admitted to hospitals in England with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of acute or subacute infective endocarditis.

- **Main outcome measures**: Monthly number of prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis consisted of a single 3 g oral dose of amoxicillin or a single 600 mg oral dose of clindamycin, and the monthly number of cases of infective endocarditis, infective endocarditis-related deaths in hospital, or cases of infective endocarditis with a possible oral origin for streptococci.

The results showed a highly significant 78.6% reduction (P < 0.001) in the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis after the introduction of the NICE guideline. Prescriptions dropped from a mean of 10,277 (SD 1068) per month to 2,292 (SD 176). However, there was no significant evidence that the general upward trend in cases of infective endocarditis before the guideline was altered after its introduction (P = 0.61). A non-inferiority test indicated that an increase in the number of cases of 9.3% or more could be excluded after the guideline's introduction.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^116RZAk8]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

The cost-effectiveness of the antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) regimen used in the United Kingdom before the 2008 NICE guidelines was evaluated. This regimen consisted of a single 3-g oral dose of amoxicillin, or a single 600-mg oral dose of clindamycin for those allergic to penicillin or who had received amoxicillin in the previous month. This approach was compared to a strategy of no AP, as per the NICE guidelines, for all individuals at risk (i.e. those at moderate or high risk of infective endocarditis (IE)). Additionally, no AP was compared with a strategy restricting AP to only those at high risk of IE, in line with European and North American guidelines. Costs were estimated using the English National Health Service standards, and health effects were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).

A decision model, based on the one used by NICE for their health-economic analysis informing the 2008 guidelines, was developed. This model estimated cost differences and health benefits from the short-term consequences of administering AP or not, as well as from the long-term effects of AP and IE. AP-related adverse events and IE may result in fatal outcomes or affect the probability of a patient remaining otherwise healthy, requiring valve replacement surgery, or experiencing congestive heart failure (CHF). These long-term impacts were captured using a state transition model, with 1-year cycles and a 50-year lifetime horizon. The analysis utilized Treeage Pro software and the Sheffield Accelerated Value of Information Tool.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^1147QxcG]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

The starting point for this review was the previous 2012 guideline; evidence was sought to warrant changes from previous recommendations. The Working Party was recruited from the BSAC membership, along with specialist cardiology societies interested in the guideline's preparation. Each society nominated a participant following approval from their respective governance structures. Other members were invited to ensure diverse expert and non-expert representation. This included infection specialists, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, pharmacists, laboratory scientists, and a patient and public representative.

The joint Working Party comprised members of the BSAC, the British Cardiovascular Society, the British Heart Valve Society, the British Society of Echocardiography, the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, and the British Infection Association. The British Congenital Cardiac Association joined later in the process and contributed to the final guideline.

During a face-to-face meeting, an initial scoping exercise was conducted by Working Party members to identify key clinical questions concerning the delivery of specialist IE services to patients in the UK NHS. This was followed by a round-table discussion to determine and prioritize principal guideline topics. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken (see online supplemental file for search strategy and methods for screening and selection of papers for inclusion). Initial recommendations were developed from the literature review and identification process.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of endocarditis [^117JMtzR]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, more specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend administering daptomycin combined with β-lactams (ampicillin, ertapenem, or ceftaroline) or fosfomycin. The following doses are advised for adult patients with infective endocarditis caused by VRE species:

- **Daptomycin**: 10–12 mg/kg/day IV in one dose.
- **Ampicillin**: 300 mg/kg/day IV in 4–6 equally divided doses.
- **Fosfomycin**: 12 g/day IV in four doses.
- **Ceftaroline**: 1,800 mg/day IV in three doses.
- **Ertapenem**: 2 g/day IV or IM in one dose.

### Efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy by clinical presentation: Pre-specified analysis of the GLOBAL LEADERS trial [^115U3a9f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

In conclusion, this analysis provides novel large-scale randomized evidence to support the use of ticagrelor monotherapy following an abbreviated treatment with DAPT to mitigate the risk of bleeding in patients with ACS while preserving efficacy. Ticagrelor monotherapy after PCI in patients with ACS, therefore, deserves further study.

### Infective endocarditis hospitalizations and antibiotic prophylaxis rates before and after the 2007 American Heart Association guideline revision [^111e1Y8K]. Circulation (2019). Low credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association recommended antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE) only for the highest-risk patients. Whether this change affected the use of antibiotic prophylaxis and the incidence of IE is unclear.

- **Methods**: IE-related hospitalizations were identified from 2002 to 2014 among all adults and those at high and moderate risk for IE, stratified by age. Prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis were obtained from the Ontario Drug Benefit database for adults aged 65 and older. Outcomes were antibiotic prophylaxis prescription rates and incidence of IE-related hospitalization. Trends in patient and pathogen characteristics were analyzed. Time series analyses were performed with segmented regression and change-point analyses.

- **Results**: Prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis decreased substantially in the moderate-risk cohort after the guideline revision (mean quarterly prescriptions: 30,680 versus 17,954; level change: -6,481; P = 0.0004 per 1 million population), with a minimal, yet significant decrease followed by a slow increase in the high-risk group. There were 7,551 IE-related hospitalizations among 6,884 adults aged 18 and older. Among adults aged 65 and older, the mean IE rate increased from 872 to 1,385 and from 229 to 283 per 1 million population at risk per quarter in the high- and moderate-risk groups, respectively. Change-point analyses indicated that this increase occurred in the second half of 2010 in adults aged 65 and older, three years after the American Heart Association guideline revision.

### Prevention of viridans group streptococcal infective endocarditis: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112wDTSh]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association published updated evidence-based guidelines on the recommended use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent viridans group streptococcal (VGS) infective endocarditis (IE) in cardiac patients undergoing invasive procedures. The 2007 guidelines significantly scaled back the underlying conditions for which antibiotic prophylaxis was recommended, leaving only four categories thought to confer the highest risk of adverse outcomes. The purpose of this update is to examine interval evidence of the acceptance and impact of the 2007 recommendations on VGS IE and, if needed, to make revisions based on this evidence.

- **Methods and results**: A writing group was formed consisting of experts in the prevention and treatment of infective endocarditis, including members of the American Dental Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, in addition to the American Heart Association. MEDLINE database searches were conducted for English language articles on compliance with the recommendations in the 2007 guidelines and the frequency of, and morbidity or mortality from, VGS IE after the publication of the 2007 guidelines. Overall, there was good general awareness of the 2007 guidelines but variable compliance with recommendations. There was no convincing evidence that VGS IE frequency, morbidity, or mortality has increased since 2007.

- **Conclusions**: On the basis of a review of the available evidence, there are no recommended changes to the 2007 VGS IE prevention guidelines. We continue to recommend VGS IE prophylaxis.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^112nvaPw]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

The table provides estimated annual percentage changes in the number of cases and deaths related to infective endocarditis before and after the guideline change. From January 2000 to March 2008, an increasing trend in the number of cases of infective endocarditis was observed (P < 0.001), including cases possibly attributable to oral streptococci (P < 0.001), and deaths from infective endocarditis (P = 0.008). There was a significant correlation between the number of cases and the number of deaths (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.46, P = 0.001).

- **Estimated annual percentage change in cases**: This is assessed before and after the introduction of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline recommending the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis. All estimates in a single Poisson regression model are adjusted for population size, including one term for months since January 2000 and another for months since the guideline change.

- **Footnotes**:
	- ✱ p value* for the test of a term before the introduction of the guideline.
	- ✱ p value* for whether the term after the guideline change is 0 — indicating whether the annual percentage change differs between before and after the guideline introduction.
	- Percentage difference in the annual percentage increase in cases before and after the guideline was introduced.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^113LSTDH]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

The lack of high-quality evidence to inform practice around the delivery of care for patients with suspected or confirmed infective endocarditis (IE) was striking. The following research questions arise in the wake of this guideline development process.

- **IE team**: What are the clinical and cost benefits of an IE team? What is the most clinically and cost-effective model of service delivery?

- **Infrastructure and location of care of the patients with IE**: What are the relative benefits and risks of patients with IE being cared for in a local hospital without the facilities of a heart centre on site? For example, considering the availability of transoesophageal echocardiography or cardiac surgical support.

- **Patient follow-up**: What is the most clinically and cost-effective timing, nature, and frequency of follow-up after an episode of IE?

- **Patient information**: What information would patients prefer and how is this best provided?

- **People who inject drugs (PWID)**: What are the clinical and cost-effective benefits of substance misuse teams to support PWID who also have IE?

- **IE registry**: Would an IE registry improve benchmarking and research? Can local data be linked to central NHS Digital or other relevant databases to report on patient outcomes?

- **Children**: How are IE services best delivered for children?

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for GI endoscopy [^111hVmR5]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for infective endocarditis — specifically in relation to antibiotic prophylaxis for gastrointestinal procedures — the ASGE 2015 guidelines recommend against administering routine antibiotic prophylaxis before gastrointestinal endoscopy solely for the prevention of infective endocarditis. Consider administering antibiotics in patients with high-risk cardiac conditions and established gastrointestinal tract infections in which enterococci may be part of the infecting bacterial flora.

### A comparison of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of infective endocarditis [^114wcFgB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a microbial infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of treatment, but their use is not standardized due to differences in presentation, the populations affected, and the variety of micro-organisms that can be responsible.

- **Objectives**: To assess the existing evidence about the clinical benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens used to treat people with infective endocarditis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE Classic and EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index on 30 April 2015. We also searched three trial registers and hand-searched the reference lists of included papers. We applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of antibiotic regimens for treating possible infective endocarditis diagnosed according to modified Duke's criteria. We considered all-cause mortality, cure rates, and adverse events as the primary outcomes. We excluded people with possible infective endocarditis and pregnant women.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction in duplicate. We constructed 'Summary of findings' tables and used GRADE methodology to assess the quality of studies. We described the included studies narratively.

- **Main results**: Four small randomized controlled trials involving 728 allocated/224 analyzed participants met our criteria.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^114rJxHb]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Over the past 10 years, there has been a general move to reduce antibiotic prescribing to save costs and prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Although this could have contributed to the reduction in prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis, it seems unlikely given the size and suddenness of the reduction, its coincidence with the introduction of the NICE guideline, the low cost of a single dose of amoxicillin or clindamycin, and national prescribing data that shows a slight increase in the general prescribing of penicillins and macrolide antibiotics over the same period.

The results of this analysis cover a large group of patients for whom antibiotic prophylaxis was prescribed before the introduction of the NICE guideline. Our results suggest that for most of these patients, including those with a history of rheumatic fever or a heart murmur, there may be little or no benefit in giving antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis. However, because we cannot exclude the possibility that residual antibiotic prophylaxis prescribing targets those perceived to be at the highest risk of infective endocarditis, it does not completely tackle the problem of whether a subset of patients, particularly those with prosthetic heart valves or a history of infective endocarditis, might still benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis. To more directly answer this question, a carefully designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis in these patients would be required.

Given that oral viridans group streptococci are c

### Prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis: To use or not to use [^114cGiYC]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) published their revised guidelines in 2007, markedly limiting the recommendations for the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE), except for patients at the highest risk of adverse outcomes. A recent focused update on valvular heart diseases changed the recommendation for antibiotic use for patients with many underlying heart conditions, including mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which were considered "low risk" heart defects.

In this article, we argue that antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered until concrete clinical evidence is provided to dispute the use of this strategy, particularly for patients with MVP. This approach is cost-efficient and offers a chance to prevent a dreadful disease. We have also included two clinical cases to support our argument. These scenarios are not uncommon and emphasize that IE can be fatal despite optimal treatment. Patients have the right to make the final decision and should be allowed to participate in choosing for, or against this approach until adequate clinical evidence is available.
