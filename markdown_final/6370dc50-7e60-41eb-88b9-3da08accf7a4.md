## Question

Is Eliquis contraindicated in LLA-positive patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Eliquis (apixaban) is contraindicated in LLA-positive patients, which I will interpret as lupus anticoagulant–positive patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether isolated lupus anticoagulant positivity is the same as definite antiphospholipid syndrome and how that distinction affects anticoagulant choice. Then, I should verify the current regulatory and guideline positions on direct oral anticoagulants in antiphospholipid syndrome, especially in triple-positive patients. Next, I will check Eliquis-specific labeling to see if antiphospholipid syndrome appears as a formal contraindication. After that, I need to review the direct and indirect clinical evidence for apixaban and the broader DOAC class in APS. Finally, I should consider laboratory testing interferences and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are talking about the same clinical construct. "LLA-positive" almost certainly refers to lupus anticoagulant positivity, which is one component of the antiphospholipid antibody panel; however, isolated LA positivity is not synonymous with definite antiphospholipid syndrome, which requires clinical thrombotic or obstetric criteria plus persistent antibody positivity on repeat testing at least 12 weeks apart, and persistence can fluctuate over time, especially under anticoagulation, which complicates interpretation and risk stratification [^1117udCQ] [^114qF6mj].

> Next, I should review the regulatory posture for DOACs in APS; hold on, let me verify the scope of these warnings. Regulators have cautioned against DOACs in APS based on increased thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonists, with specific emphasis on triple-positive APS; for example, FDA language for DOACs notes a higher thrombotic risk in triple-positive APS, and European regulators have advised not to use DOACs for secondary prevention in APS, highlighting the particularly high risk in triple-positive profiles [^116qdVzb] [^1117udCQ].

> Now, I need to check Eliquis-specific labeling to see if there is a formal contraindication; let me confirm the label details. The current U.S. prescribing information for Eliquis outlines approved indications and key warnings but does not list antiphospholipid syndrome or lupus anticoagulant positivity as a labeled contraindication, which means the regulatory signal is framed as "not recommended/avoid" in APS rather than a formal label contraindication for apixaban specifically [^113w3q2p].

> I will now examine the direct evidence for apixaban in APS, but wait, I should double-check whether outcome data exist beyond patient-reported satisfaction. An apixaban trial in thrombotic APS reported higher treatment satisfaction with apixaban versus warfarin in ACTS measures, but the excerpted data do not provide primary efficacy or safety outcomes needed to establish noninferiority or safety, which limits decision making; class signals are further informed by the RAPS rivaroxaban trial that failed to meet its noninferiority threshold on endogenous thrombin potential and by broader evidence summaries noting recurrent thrombosis in APS on DOACs in small series, all of which sustain concern for class effectiveness in APS [^112GL6FY] [^112xnnUf] [^111xKE6S].

> Let me consider practical laboratory issues because they can bias both diagnosis and risk grading; I should confirm DOAC–assay interference. DOACs frequently interfere with lupus anticoagulant testing and can generate false-positive or false-negative results, leading ISTH guidance to recommend avoiding LA testing during DOAC therapy or using mitigation strategies; adsorption products such as DOAC-Stop or DOAC-Remove can reduce interference, though not perfectly, and apixaban may produce less spurious LA positivity than rivaroxaban, while overall anticoagulation still increases odds of isolated positive results, complicating interpretation during therapy [^116SCV5x] [^114BANwk] [^113HjVXw] [^113PnUZa].

> Synthesis requires risk stratification, so let me review who is at greatest risk because I need to ensure the recommendation fits the phenotype. Triple-positive APS carries the highest thrombotic risk and is the core population for whom regulators and guidelines most clearly advise against DOACs; some agencies and reviews have extended caution to all thrombotic APS, acknowledging uncertainty in single- or double-positive profiles but favoring vitamin K antagonists as standard of care for secondary prevention in APS until robust DOAC efficacy is demonstrated [^1117udCQ].

> Here is where I must be precise about wording; my initial inclination is to call Eliquis "contraindicated" in LA-positive patients, but wait, I should correct that. It is not a formal label contraindication for apixaban; rather, based on regulatory guidance and available evidence, DOACs including apixaban are not recommended and should generally be avoided in thrombotic APS, especially in triple-positive patients, with vitamin K antagonists preferred for secondary prevention [^116qdVzb] [^1117udCQ].

> But wait, what if the patient is only LA-positive without definite APS or has a history suggesting lower risk; I should not jump to conclusions. For isolated LA positivity without established thrombotic APS criteria, evidence is sparse, and the strong "avoid DOACs" signal is anchored to thrombotic APS; nonetheless, if APS is suspected or confirmation is pending, many clinicians favor VKA until the profile is clarified, whereas if APS is ultimately excluded and an alternative indication remains, apixaban may be reasonable per its labeled uses, with shared decision-making about uncertainties and periodic reassessment of the antibody profile off-DOAC when feasible [^1117udCQ] [^111xKE6S].

> Operationally, I should double-check how to manage testing and transitions because misclassification can misguide therapy. If LA testing is necessary, obtain samples off-DOAC when possible per ISTH guidance or consider DOAC adsorption strategies while recognizing incomplete neutralization; for patients already on apixaban with confirmed thrombotic APS, discuss switching to warfarin, and if testing must proceed while anticoagulated, coordinate timing at trough and use specialized approaches to minimize interference, documenting residual uncertainty in results interpretation [^116SCV5x] [^114BANwk] [^113HjVXw].

Eliquis (apixaban) is not absolutely contraindicated in patients who are lupus anticoagulant (LA) positive, but it is not recommended for patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) [^116qdVzb] due to increased thrombotic risk [^1117udCQ]. For LA-positive patients with single or double antibody positivity, use Eliquis with caution [^111xKE6S] and consider warfarin as the preferred option [^1117udCQ], especially if there is a history of arterial thrombosis or recurrent events. Eliquis is contraindicated in patients with active pathological bleeding, severe hypersensitivity to apixaban, or severe hepatic impairment.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Triple-positive APS is a setting in which DOACs, including apixaban, are not recommended [^1117udCQ] because of increased thrombotic risk compared with VKAs [^116qdVzb]. For single or double antibody positivity, evidence is limited; use caution [^111xKE6S] and consider VKAs, especially with arterial thrombosis or recurrent events.

---

## Specific contraindications and precautions

- Active pathological bleeding: Contraindicated due to bleeding risk.

- Severe hypersensitivity reactions: Contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to apixaban.

- Severe hepatic impairment: Contraindicated due to increased bleeding risk.

- Renal impairment: Use caution; dose adjustments may be necessary [^117H9wKn] [^114svfRp].

- Drug interactions: Use caution with strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors or inducers [^114dw672] [^113w3q2p].

---

## Laboratory considerations

Interference with LA testing may occur [^113PnUZa], as apixaban can produce false-positive or false-negative LA results; interpret with caution [^116SCV5x] [^114BANwk].

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **Triple-positive APS**: Avoid Eliquis; use VKAs [^116qdVzb].

- **Single or double antibody positivity**: Use caution [^111xKE6S]; consider VKAs, especially with arterial thrombosis or recurrent events [^1117udCQ].

- **Active bleeding or severe hepatic impairment**: Contraindicated.

- **Renal impairment or drug interactions**: Use caution and adjust dose as needed [^117H9wKn] [^114dw672].

---

Eliquis is not absolutely contraindicated in LA-positive patients, but it is not recommended for triple-positive APS due to increased thrombotic risk [^116qdVzb]. Use caution in single or double antibody positivity, and consider VKAs, especially with arterial thrombosis or recurrent events [^1117udCQ].

### What is the appropriate anticoagulation strategy for thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome [^1117udCQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune prothrombotic disorder mediated by a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies collectively known as antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). These include lupus anticoagulant (LA), IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), and anti-β2-glycoprotein I (anti-β2GPI) antibodies. It has been shown that patients with all three aPL (triple positive) are at the highest risk of both a first thrombotic event and of recurrence, despite anticoagulation.

In response to the publication of a meta-analysis and a randomized controlled trial assessing the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban versus warfarin in triple-positive APS with venous and/or arterial thrombosis, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued recommendations. They advised that direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) should not be used for secondary prevention of thrombosis in all APS patients, although they specifically highlighted the high risk for triple-positive patients.

As there is less evidence for patients with single- or dual-positive APS, this might be an over-interpretation of the data. In this review, we explore the available evidence on the safety and efficacy of DOACs in thrombotic APS, the problem of detecting LA while on DOAC, and provide some practical guidance for managing this issue.

DOACs have revolutionized anticoagulant management and are becoming the cornerstone treatment for stroke prevention in AF and VTE prophylaxis and treatment, with the list of other indications expanding.

- **Challenges in prescribing DOACs**: There are many factors that affect appropriate efficacy and safety endpoints when prescribing DOAC therapy. This review aims to address these scenarios.

- **Patient considerations**: Patient comorbidities must be considered when selecting the most appropriate anticoagulant. It is now recognized that routine monitoring of renal and hepatic function, signs/symptoms of bleeding, and parameters of compliance should be considered for all patients.

- **Clinical recommendations**: Clinicians should incorporate patient preferences, clinical outcomes data, patient characteristics, and quality‐of‐life considerations when recommending an anticoagulant.

- **Cost considerations**: Cost can play a critical role in this decision, with DOAC affordability for individual patients varying based on medication benefit copayment tiers.

As the future of anticoagulant therapies continues to evolve, DOACs will remain a critical therapy for preventing thrombotic events.

### Rationale and design of PROACT Xa: A randomized, multicenter, open-label, clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with a mechanical On-X aortic heart valve [^111WJu8z]. American Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists are the only approved oral anticoagulants for long-term prophylaxis against valve thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients with a mechanical heart valve. Despite the proven efficacy and safety of anticoagulation with the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor apixaban compared with warfarin in high-risk populations including subjects with atrial fibrillation or with venous thromboembolism, it remains unknown whether patients with a mechanical heart valve can be safely managed with apixaban. The On-X Aortic Heart Valve and On-X Ascending Aortic Prosthesis with the Vascutek Gelweave Valsalva Graft may have lower rates of valve thrombosis and thromboembolism than conventional bileaflet and tilting disc valves due to its unique pyrolytic carbon composition and flared inlet design.

- **Design**: PROACT Xa is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial comparing apixaban with warfarin in patients with an On-X Aortic Heart Valve or On-X Ascending Aortic Prosthesis with the Vascutek Gelweave Valsalva Graft. The study will randomize approximately 1,000 patients from around 60 sites in North America who underwent aortic valve replacement at least 3 months prior. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive apixaban 5 mg twice daily or warfarin with a target international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0. The last randomized participant will be followed for at least 2 years.

The primary efficacy outcome is the composite of valve thrombosis and valve-related thromboembolism, and the primary safety outcome is major bleeding.

### Acute management of bleeding in patients on novel oral anticoagulants [^116XBArE]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Novel oral anticoagulants that directly inhibit thrombin (dabigatran) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban) are currently available for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after orthopedic surgery, treatment of acute VTE, and prevention of arterial thromboembolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. These agents offer several advantages over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), including rapid onset, shorter half-lives, fewer drug interactions, and the absence of a need for routine monitoring. However, there are no established agents to reverse their anticoagulant effect.

We review the risk of bleeding associated with the novel oral anticoagulants and discuss the limitations of conventional coagulation assays for measuring anticoagulant effect. Additionally, we provide an approach to managing patients with bleeding complications and present evidence for various interventions for reversal, where available.

### Eliquis [^111B3tXN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Eliquis also showed significantly fewer major bleeds than warfarin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Kaplan-Meier estimate**: Time to first stroke or systemic embolism in ARISTOTLE (Intent-to-Treat Population).

All-cause death was assessed using a sequential testing strategy that allowed testing for superiority if effects on earlier endpoints, such as stroke, systemic embolus, and major bleeding, were demonstrated. Eliquis treatment resulted in a significantly lower rate of all-cause death (p = 0.046) than warfarin treatment, primarily due to a reduction in cardiovascular deaths, particularly stroke-related deaths. Non-vascular death rates were similar in both treatment arms.

In ARISTOTLE, the results for the primary efficacy endpoint were generally consistent across most major subgroups. These subgroups included factors like weight, CHADS2 score (a scale from 0 to 6 used to predict stroke risk in patients with AF, with higher scores indicating greater risk), prior warfarin use, level of renal impairment, geographic region, and aspirin use at randomization.

### Quantitative risk for single-positive lupus anticoagulant results with different anticoagulants [^113PnUZa]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). High credibility.

Clinical experts recommend against testing for lupus anticoagulant (LAC) during anticoagulation. We quantitated the risk of a single-positive dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) result or partial thromboplastin time-based phospholipid neutralization (PN) result on anticoagulation. Any anticoagulation led to a fourfold greater likelihood of single-positive results, primarily by rivaroxaban (odds ratio [OR] = 8.6) and warfarin (OR = 6.6), resulting in a positive dRVVT test with a normal PN test. Heparin and apixaban were twofold more likely to show single-positive results, but enoxaparin did not show significant single positivity. Our results quantitatively support experts' avoidance of LAC testing during anticoagulation.

### Lupus anticoagulant test persistence over time and its associations with future thrombotic events [^114E7ikD]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Data on lupus anticoagulant (LA) test stability in patients persistently positive for LA are limited, and its implications on clinical outcomes are lacking. We investigated the rate and predictors of a negative LA test and whether experiencing a negative test affected a patient's risk of future thrombotic events or death in a prospective observational study of persistently LA+ patients. We followed 164 patients (84% women) for a median of 9.2 years and a total of 1,438 follow-up visits. During the observation period, 50 thrombotic events (23 arterial and 27 venous events) occurred, and 24 patients died.

Forty-six of the patients had at least one negative LA test during the observation period, corresponding to a 10-year cumulative incidence of a negative LA test of 28% (95% confidence interval, 20–35). The majority of patients with available follow-up following a negative LA test (n = 41) had at least one subsequent positive test for LA (n = 28/41, 68%). Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment at baseline was associated with a negative LA test during follow-up. Using a multistate time-to-event model with multivariable adjustment, a negative LA test had no impact on a patient's prospective risk of thrombosis or mortality. We conclude that a negative LA test during observation cannot be used clinically to stratify a patient's risk for future events.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: Method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^113EzNca]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). High credibility.

The study examines the development of a universal anti-Xa assay designed to measure the activity of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Method validation was conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy and external validity of this assay.

- **Method validation**: The anti-Xa assay was calibrated using low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) to ensure accurate readings across different anticoagulants.

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: The study evaluated the assay's capability to differentiate between therapeutic and sub-therapeutic levels of these anticoagulants, highlighting its potential use in clinical settings for patient monitoring.

- **External validation**: External validation involves applying the assay across various clinical scenarios to confirm its robustness and reliability in measuring the targeted anticoagulant effects.

Overall, the universal assay could significantly enhance the management of patients on anticoagulant therapy by providing precise and reliable drug measurements.

### Apixaban to prevent venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer [^113Xj4ax]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The AVERT study, published by Carrier M and colleagues in 2019 in the journal The New England Journal of Medicine, focused on diseases such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The trial investigated the effect of thromboprophylaxis with apixaban in intermediate-to-high-risk ambulatory patients with cancer who were beginning chemotherapy.

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: The study comprised 563 patients, including 323 females and 240 males. The inclusion criteria specified ambulatory patients with cancer at an intermediate-to-high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) who were initiating chemotherapy. Key exclusion criteria were increased risk of clinically significant bleeding, hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, acute leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasm, and those undergoing stem cell transplantation.

- **Interventions**: Patients were divided into two groups: 288 received apixaban (2.5 mg BID for 180 days), while 275 received placebo (identical tablets BID for 180 days).

- **Outcomes**:
	- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in the rate of VTE was observed within 180 days (4.2% vs. 10.2%; HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.65).
	- **Secondary outcomes**: A significant increase in major bleeding was noted in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (3.5% vs. 1.8%; HR 2, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.95).
	- **Safety outcomes**: No significant differences were found in major bleeding during the treatment period (2.1% vs. 1.1%; HR 1.89, 95% CI 0.39–9.24).

In conclusion, the study found that in ambulatory patients with cancer, who were at intermediate-to-high risk for VTE, apixaban significantly reduced the rate of venous thromboembolism. However, there was an associated increase in major bleeding events.

### Apixaban vs rivaroxaban in patients with atrial fibrillation at high or low bleeding risk: A population-based cohort study [^115deiNH]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Low credibility.

Despite many atrial fibrillation (AF) patients being at risk of bleeding, very limited data are available on bleeding rates of different direct oral anticoagulants based on the spectrum of bleeding risk.

- **Objective**: We aimed to compare the risk of major bleeding and thromboembolic events with apixaban vs rivaroxaban for AF patients stratified by bleeding risk.

- **Methods**: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all adult patients (66 years or older) with AF in Ontario, Canada, who were treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban between April 1, 2011, and March 31, 2020. Bleeding risk was estimated by the HAS-BLED score, with high bleeding risk defined as a score of ≥ 3. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding, and the primary efficacy outcome was thromboembolic events. Comparisons were adjusted for baseline comorbidities by inverse probability of treatment weighting.

- **Results**: This study included 18,156 AF patients with high bleeding risk and 55,186 AF patients with low bleeding risk. Apixaban use was more common in patients with high bleeding risk; 63% of high-risk patients used apixaban compared with 56% of low-risk patients. Apixaban users had lower rates of major bleeding in high-risk patients (2.9% vs 4.2% per year; hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58–0.81) and in low-risk patients (1.8% vs 2.9% per year; HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.56–0.70) compared with rivaroxaban. There were no differences in rates of thromboembolic events, 3.1% vs 3.0% per year (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.86–1.22) in high-risk patients and 1.9% vs 1.9% per year (HR, 1.00; 95% CI.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety between apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban among patients with atrial fibrillation: A multinational population-based cohort study [^115wjaDf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but head-to-head trial data do not exist to guide the choice of DOAC.

- **Objective**: To conduct a large-scale comparison between all DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) in routine clinical practice.

- **Design**: Multinational population-based cohort study.

- **Setting**: Five standardized electronic health care databases covering 221 million people in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

- **Participants**: Patients newly diagnosed with AF from 2010 through 2019 who received a new DOAC prescription.

- **Measurements**: Database-specific hazard ratios (HRs) of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and all-cause mortality between DOACs were estimated using a Cox regression model stratified by propensity score and pooled using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: A total of 527,226 new DOAC users met the inclusion criteria (apixaban, n = 281,320; dabigatran, n = 61,008; edoxaban, n = 12,722; and rivaroxaban, n = 172,176). Apixaban use was associated with a lower risk for GIB than use of dabigatran (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.94]), edoxaban (HR, 0.77 [CI, 0.66 to 0.91]), or rivaroxaban (HR, 0.72 [CI, 0.66 to 0.79]). No substantial differences were observed for other outcomes or DOAC-DOAC comparisons. The results were consistent for patients aged 80 years or older. Consistent associations between lower GIB risk and apixaban versus rivaroxaban were observed.

### Rivaroxaban versus warfarin to treat patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (RAPS): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2/3, non-inferiority trial [^112xnnUf]. The Lancet Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Randomisation and masking were crucial components of the trial design. Randomisation was performed by a web-based independent randomisation service (Sealed Envelope, London, UK) to ensure allocation concealment. The schedule was created using permuted blocks with a random block length, stratified by centre and patient type (with vs. without systemic lupus erythematosus). Participants were randomised 1:1 to either remain on standard-intensity warfarin with a target INR of 2.5 (range 2.0–3.0) or switch to 20 mg oral rivaroxaban once daily (or 15 mg once daily depending on local clinical care and following the summary of product characteristics in patients with creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min) for 180 days.

The trial was open label to ensure optimum warfarin dosing, as the variable sensitivity of thromboplastins to lupus anticoagulant can lead to INR instability. This and other factors, such as changing medication, can necessitate frequent anticoagulant monitoring with unpredictable time intervals. Additionally, the management of bleeding events differs between patients receiving warfarin and rivaroxaban. Masking of treatment allocation was also not possible in the RAPS central laboratory as different tests were needed for the two anticoagulants, and samples taken at baseline and day 42 were tested simultaneously to minimise variability between assays.

Follow-up continued for 210 days. Patients or clinicians could choose to stop treatment early because of unacceptable serious adverse events (SAEs), thrombotic events, or any change in the patient's condition that justified discontinuation.

### A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of the risk of bleeding with apixaban versus vitamin K antagonists [^112UNLxK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Apixaban is one of the new oral anticoagulants, which is prescribed as an alternative to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Concerns regarding its bleeding profile persist and require further evaluation. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the risks of bleeding and all-cause mortality between apixaban and VKAs. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library of Clinical Trials databases were systematically searched for RCTs comparing the risks of bleeding and all-cause mortality of apixaban (2.5 or 5 mg twice daily) with those of VKAs. We included RCTs conducted in adults and published in English or French. Data were pooled across RCTs using random-effects meta-analytical models.

Our systematic search identified 5 RCTs meeting our inclusion criteria (n = 24,435). They included patients with atrial fibrillation (n = 18,358), total knee replacement surgery (n = 458), and venous thromboembolism (n = 5,619). Data pooled across RCTs revealed that apixaban was associated with reduced risks of any bleeding (relative risk [RR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59 to 0.90) and a composite of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.88). Apixaban was also associated with a lower risk of intracranial bleeding (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.58), whereas analyses of major and minor bleeding were inconclusive. Moreover, apixaban was associated with decreased all-cause mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99), although this finding was driven by the results of the ARISTOTLE trial.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^113FL5uJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In general, FDA‐approved indications for each of the DOACs are comparable. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are approved for lowering the risk of stroke and embolism in NVAF, as well as for the treatment and prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Unique indications include betrixaban for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients with an acute medical illness, and rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin to reduce major cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease. However, there is still uncertainty in understanding the safe and effective use of DOACs in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, specifically atrial fibrillation (AF) with recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), AF with concomitant artificial heart valves, stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and cancer‐associated thromboembolism. This section aims to clarify the use of DOACs within these patient subgroups.

### Eliquis [^116dBr2w]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Apixaban is a selective inhibitor of FXa and does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. It inhibits both free and clot-bound FXa, along with prothrombinase activity. Although apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, it indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban decreases thrombin generation and thrombus development.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: As a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). However, changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected therapeutic dose are small and subject to high variability, making them not useful for monitoring the anticoagulation effect of apixaban.

The Rotachrom® Heparin chromogenic assay was used to measure the effect of apixaban on FXa activity in humans during the apixaban development program. A concentration-dependent increase in anti-FXa activity was observed in the dose range tested and was similar in both healthy subjects and patients with AF. This test is not recommended for assessing the anticoagulant effect of apixaban.

- **Effect of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) on pharmacodynamics of Eliquis**: There is no clinical experience to reverse bleeding with the use of 4-factor PCC products in individuals who have received Eliquis. Effects of 4-factor PCCs on the pharmacodynamics of apixaban were studied in healthy subjects. Following administration of apixaban dosed to steady state, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) returned to pre-apixaban levels 4 hours after the initial dose.

According to European guidelines, left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is recommended in patients who survived a major or life-threatening bleeding or have a compelling contraindication to oral anticoagulants (OAC). The low bleeding risk profile of patients enrolled in PROTECT AF and PREVAIL trials, compared with those who usually undergo LAAC in daily practice, may have mitigated the protective effect of the procedure on bleeding complications, as suggested by studies on subjects not eligible for OAC.

On the other hand, PRAGUE‐17 is the only randomized trial including a control arm receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and demonstrated noninferior net benefit outcomes with LAAC along with a significant reduction in clinically relevant bleeding. Notably, in all trials, bleeding rates tended to be similar with LAAC and OAC early after enrollment because of periprocedural events in the interventional arm. However, the incidence and temporal trends of major procedural complications have improved over time, in parallel with operators' experience, procedural, and device optimization techniques. Recent registries show the incidence of early (< 7 days) pericardial effusion ranged from 0.4% to 4%.

Therefore, larger sample sizes and longer-term follow-up may be needed for a significant bleeding benefit of LAAC to emerge. Even though the rate of ischemic stroke appeared numerically higher, this difference has previously been shown to be less pronounced when procedure-related strokes are excluded and to be driven by nondisabling strokes. In our study, we also observed a significant reduction in hemorrhagic stroke with LAAC versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and a consistent trend for LAAC versus DOACs.

### Differences in preferences between clinicians and patients for the use and dosing of direct oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation [^116yU5Fr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are effective in reducing stroke risk for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation if prescribed at the labeled dose, yet underdosing is frequent. Little is known about clinician knowledge and patient or clinician preferences for DOAC dosing.

- **Methods and results**: From April 2019 to March 2020, 240 clinicians and 343 patients with atrial fibrillation completed an assessment of anticoagulation knowledge/preferences. Clinician knowledge of DOAC dosing was tested with four hypothetical patient scenarios. Patients and clinicians were asked to grade the importance of 25 factors in anticoagulation decision making. Among clinicians, the median age was 55 years, and 23% were primary care clinicians. In scenarios of a patient indicated for full-dose DOAC, 41.2% of clinicians underdosed apixaban and 17.6% underdosed rivaroxaban. In scenarios of a patient indicated for reduced-dose DOAC, 64.6% and 71.7% of clinicians chose to use reduced-dose apixaban and rivaroxaban, respectively. Only 35.0% of clinicians correctly answered all four scenarios with the label-indicated dose; this knowledge gap was similar between clinicians who did and did not underdose.

Among patients with atrial fibrillation, the median age was 65 years, and 89% were currently anticoagulated. Patients and clinicians ranked stroke prevention and avoiding severe bleeding as very important to anticoagulation decision making. Patients were more likely than clinicians to rank the ability to reduce anticoagulation dose if needed as very important (70.5% versus 43.6%; P < 0.001).

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^111xKE6S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

There are limited clinical data on the safety and efficacy of NOACs in patients with APS. The rivaroxaban trials (EINSTEIN‐DVT and EINSTEIN‐PE) included a small subset of patients with known thrombophilic conditions (5–7%), including some patients with aPLs. The sample size of those patients is limited, and details on the antibody profile or APS status are not available. The results of these studies cannot be generalized to patients with APS. In small case series, dabigatran and rivaroxaban have failed to prevent thrombosis in patients with APS.

- **RAPS trial**: In the RAPS (Rivaroxaban in Anti‐Phospholipid Syndrome) trial, patients with APS and a history of VTE who had been on warfarin (INR range between 2.0 and 3.0) for at least 6 months were randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (or 15 mg once daily if creatinine clearance is 30–49 mL/min, n = 116) or continue warfarin with a target INR of 2.5 (n = 54). The primary outcome was the percentage change in endogenous thrombin potential from randomization to day 42. Rivaroxaban failed to reach the noninferiority threshold in reducing endogenous thrombin potential. There was no increase in thrombotic risk in patients treated with rivaroxaban compared with standard‐intensity warfarin, although this small study was not powered for efficacy.

There are three ongoing clinical trials currently evaluating NOACs in patients with APS. The TRAPS (Trial on Rivaroxaban in AntiPhospholipid Syndrome, NCT02157272) is a multicenter, randomized, open‐label study that evaluates whether rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (or 15 mg in patients with moderate renal insu…

### Perioperative management of patients taking direct oral anticoagulants: A review [^116nqRDb]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which include apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, are widely prescribed medications for patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Managing DOACs in patients undergoing surgical or nonsurgical procedures is crucial to minimizing the risk of bleeding and thromboembolism.

- **Observations**: For elective surgical or nonsurgical procedures, a standardized perioperative management approach for DOACs is essential. Procedures are categorized based on the risk of procedure-related bleeding: minimal (e.g. minor dental or skin procedures), low to moderate (e.g. cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair), or high risk (e.g. major cancer or joint replacement procedures).

	- For minimal bleeding risk procedures, DOACs may be continued, or if there is concern about excessive bleeding, they may be discontinued on the day of the procedure.
	- Patients undergoing low to moderate risk procedures should typically discontinue DOACs 1 day before surgery and restart 1 day after.
	- For high bleeding risk procedures, it is recommended to stop DOACs 2 days prior to the operation and restart them 2 days afterward.

With this strategy, the rates of thromboembolism (0.2%-0.4%) and major bleeding (1%-2%) remain low, and the delays or cancellations of surgical and nonsurgical procedures are infrequent. Patients on DOACs requiring emergent (< 6 hours after presentation) or urgent surgical procedures (6–24 hours after presentation) experience bleeding rates as high as 23%, and thromboembolism risk remains significant.

### Eliquis [^116FP4cB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warning**: (a) Premature discontinuation of Eliquis increases the risk of thrombotic events. (b) Spinal/epidural hematoma.

- **Premature discontinuation of Eliquis increases the risk of thrombotic events**: Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including Eliquis, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with Eliquis is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

- **Spinal/epidural hematoma**: Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with Eliquis who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures.

	- Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:
	- Use of indwelling epidural catheters
	- Concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, and other anticoagulants
	- A history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures
	- A history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery
	- Optimal timing between the administration of Eliquis and neuraxial procedures is not known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary.

### Clinical outcomes and management associated with major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with apixaban or warfarin: Insights from the ARISTOTLE trial [^1128maZn]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

In the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial, apixaban compared with warfarin reduced the risk of stroke, major bleed, and death in patients with atrial fibrillation. This ancillary study evaluated the clinical consequences of major bleeds and the management and treatment effects of warfarin versus apixaban.

- **Methods and results**: Major International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis bleeding was defined as overt bleeding accompanied by a decrease in haemoglobin (Hb) of ≥ 2 g/dL or transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red cells, occurring at a critical site or resulting in death. Time to event (death, ischaemic stroke, or myocardial infarction [MI]) was evaluated using Cox regression models. The excess risk associated with bleeding was evaluated through separate time-dependent indicators for intracranial (ICH) and non-intracranial haemorrhage.

Major bleeding occurred in 848 individuals (4.7%), of whom 126 (14.9%) died within 30 days. Of the 176 patients with an ICH, 76 (43.2%) died, and of the 695 patients with major non-ICH, 64 (9.2%) died within 30 days of the bleeding. The risk of death, ischaemic stroke, or MI increased roughly 12-fold following a major non-ICH bleeding event within 30 days. The corresponding risk of death following an ICH was markedly increased, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 121.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.3–161.8), as was the risk for stroke or MI with an HR of 21.95 (95% CI 9.88–48.81), respectively. Among patients with major bleeds, 20.8% received vitamin K and/or related medications (fresh frozen plasma, coagulation factors, factor VIIa) to stop the bleeding.

### Lupus anticoagulant test persistence over time and its associations with future thrombotic events [^116FQiXT]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

During the observation period, 118 patients (72%) had stable lupus anticoagulant (LA) status, defined by having only positive LA tests. The other quarter of the study cohort (n = 46, 28%) had at least one negative LA test. Among these 46 patients, there was a median number of two within-patient changes in LA status (25th-75th percentile, 1–2; range, 1–6) and a median number of 0.3 within-patient changes in LA status per year of observation time (25th-75th percentile, 0.2–0.5; range, 0.05–1.7). Overall, this corresponded to a 10-year cumulative incidence of a negative LA test of 28% (95% confidence interval, 20–35).

- **Change in LA test status over time**:
	- Cumulative incidence of the first negative LA test over time: The line shows the risk of developing a first negative LA test in the study cohort (n = 164), with the x-axis representing the time in years from study inclusion.
	- Cumulative incidence of the next positive LA test after the first negative LA test over time: The line reports the risk of a positive LA test after the first negative LA test in the n = 42 patients who experienced a first LA negative test and had follow-up. The x-axis represents the time elapsed since the first negative LA test. Curves were estimated with competing risk estimators, with the gray shaded area representing the 95% confidence interval.

Among the 46 patients who turned LA negative, 5 patients did not have further follow-up, and 28 (68%) of the remaining 41 patients turned LA positive again. This corresponded to a 10-year cumulative incidence of turning positive again of 64% (95% CI, 48–77).

### Performance characteristics of DOAC-Remove for neutralization of the effects of apixaban and rivaroxaban in lupus anticoagulant assays [^113HjVXw]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

This study established the performance characteristics of DOAC-Remove for neutralization of the effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban in lupus anticoagulant (LAC) testing.

- **Methods**: Normal donor, LAC control, and patient samples were spiked with rivaroxaban or apixaban to simulate their effects on the dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and dilute prothrombin time (dPT). Anti-Xa activity was measured after spiking and after DOAC-Remove neutralization. Accuracy, complex precision, and reference interval verification were evaluated.

- **Results**: DOAC-Remove neutralized rivaroxaban and apixaban concentrations as high as 415 ng/mL and 333 ng/mL, respectively. Percentage positive and negative agreement between the baseline and post-neutralization interpretations were 75% or higher for the dRVVT and APTT methods but not for the dPT method. Coefficients of variation (CVs) were 10% or less for all assays except the Staclot-LA delta, which had a standard deviation of 2.5 seconds or a CV of 25% or less depending on the level. The laboratory's reference intervals were verified for the dRVVT and APTT assays after DOAC-Remove treatment but not for the dPT assays.

DOAC-Remove appears to have acceptable performance characteristics for neutralizing the effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban in the dRVVT and APTT methods but not in the dPT method.

### Apixaban vs. standard of care after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: The ATLANTIS trial [^1135z5wc]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The respective roles of oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remain debated. ATLANTIS is an international, randomized, open-label, superiority trial comparing apixaban to the standard of care.

- **Methods and results**: After successful TAVI, 1,500 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive apixaban 5 mg (2.5 mg if impaired renal function or concomitant antiplatelet therapy) (n = 749) twice daily, or standard of care (n = 751). Randomization was stratified by the need for chronic anticoagulation therapy. Standard-of-care patients received a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) (Stratum 1) or antiplatelet therapy (Stratum 2) if there was an indication for anticoagulation or not, respectively. The primary endpoint was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, systemic embolism, intracardiac or bioprosthesis thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and life-threatening, disabling, or major bleeding over 1-year follow-up. The primary safety endpoint was major, disabling, or life-threatening bleeding.

The primary outcome occurred in 138 (18.4%) and 151 (20.1%) patients receiving apixaban or standard of care, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73–1.16], and there was no evidence of interaction between treatment and stratum (P interaction = 0.57). The primary safety endpoint was similar in both groups (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.72–1.44). In Stratum 1 (n = 451), an exploratory analysis showed no difference for all endpoints between apixaban and VKA.

### Practical considerations and testing nuances for the detection of lupus anticoagulant: Do low phospholipid screen results, assay type, and test ratio matter [^111GeeZH]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Low credibility.

Lupus anticoagulant (LA) detection requires: (1) prolongation of a phospholipid (PL)-dependent clot-based screening assay, (2) noncorrection upon adding normal pooled plasma, and (3) a confirmatory PL dependency test. Paired LA assays run screening and confirmatory tests simultaneously, with their test ratio (TR) or differences used to evaluate test results. We evaluated patients whose paired testing demonstrated PL dependence suggestive of LA, yet the low PL screen was not prolonged.

- **Methods**: Clinical and laboratory parameters are compared across (1) true positive (screen prolonged, TR positive) vs. borderline (screen not prolonged, TR positive); (2) low-, moderate-, and high-TR subgroups; and (3) dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) vs. silica clotting time (SCT).

- **Results**: Borderline samples are not statistically different from true positives in their rate of repeat LA positivity or association with other anti-PL antibodies. Compared with true positives, borderline dRVVT is more frequent in pregnancy, women, and younger age. Elevated activated partial thromboplastin time is more frequent in true-positive dRVVT and SCT vs. borderline and with an increasing dRVVT TR. LA persistence is more frequent with an increasing SCT TR. In addition, dRVVT true positivity is more frequent with thromboembolic events, while SCT is more frequent with autoimmunity and pregnancy complications.

- **Conclusions**: Negative low-PL screens may not necessarily lack LA. A reevaluation of the laboratory criteria for LA detection may be needed.

### SPL drug information for andexanet alfa [^111C9STp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Contraindication regarding the use of andexanet alfa IV (also known as Andexxa) and concomitant use of heparin: avoid using andexanet alfa for the reversal of direct factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban and rivaroxaban) before heparinization, as andexanet alfa may cause unresponsiveness to heparin. Use an alternative anticoagulant to heparin if anticoagulation is needed.

### Advantages and limitations of the new anticoagulants [^117Qf83g]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

During recent years, three new anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) have been introduced to the market. It is probable that one more anticoagulant (edoxaban) will become available in the next two years. This review is not intended to compare the efficacy and risks of these new agents but rather to detail their advantages and limitations.

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these drugs are noteworthy. There are few drug and food interactions, predictable dose responses, and rapid onset and offset, resulting in simplified management of patients requiring anticoagulant therapy. Notably, no routine laboratory monitoring is required. An exciting observation regarding the new anticoagulants is the uniform reduction in intracranial bleeding by half compared with warfarin.

The potential limitations of the new anticoagulants include uncertainty regarding the assessment of drug levels, determining safe drug levels for major surgery, managing major bleeding, renal dependence, multiple dose regimens, and adherence in the absence of frequent monitoring. Additionally, unknown, rare side effects not captured in trials remain a concern. This review aims to clarify some of these issues.

### Oral apixaban for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism [^115x3Xmn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The AMPLIFY (apixaban) study, published by Agnelli G and colleagues in 2013 in the journal *The New England Journal of Medicine*, investigates the role of apixaban in patients with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE). This study focuses on pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.

The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a population of 5,395 patients, including 2,228 females and 3,167 males. Inclusion criteria specified patients with acute VTE, while key exclusion criteria involved active bleeding, high bleeding risk, contraindications to treatment with enoxaparin and warfarin, cancer, planned long-term treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin, or dual antiplatelet therapy.

The interventions compared were:

- **Apixaban group**: 2,609 patients received apixaban (10 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg orally twice daily for 6 months).
- **Warfarin group**: 2,635 patients received subcutaneous enoxaparin followed by warfarin.

The primary outcome assessed whether the differences did not exceed the non-inferiority margin regarding recurrent symptomatic VTE or death related to VTE, which was 2.3% in the apixaban group versus 2.7% in the warfarin group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.18).

- **Secondary outcomes included**:

- No significant difference in VTE or death from cardiovascular cause (2.3% vs. 2.9%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.11).
- No significant difference in VTE or death from any cause (3.2% vs. 3.9%; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.08).
- A significant decrease in VTE, death related to VTE, or major bleeding (2.8% vs. 4.5%; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.75).

These results suggest that apixaban is as effective as the traditional regimen with a better safety profile in terms of bleeding risks.

### Presence of direct thrombin inhibitors can affect the results and interpretation of lupus anticoagulant testing [^1168QaDW]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

In vitro experiments were conducted to determine whether the direct thrombin inhibitors argatroban and lepirudin can interfere with the results of lupus anticoagulant (LA) testing. Concentration-response curves were generated to calculate the concentration of anticoagulant that prolongs the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to 75 seconds (2.5 times the baseline average). Corresponding concentrations of anticoagulant were added to plasma samples before running dilute Russell viper venom tests (DRVVTs) and LA-sensitive aPTTs (PTT-LAs).

The DRVVT test system contains an antiheparin agent, which means that DRVVT results were not prolonged in the presence of heparin. With argatroban added to normal plasma samples, neither the DRVVT percent correction of ratio nor the DRVVT test/confirm ratio were elevated. However, when added to LA-positive plasma, some false-negative results were observed. Lepirudin increased the DRVVT percent correction of ratio and the DRVVT test/confirm ratio into a range that could lead to false-positive identifications of LAs. In sharp contrast to the DRVVT test system, distinction between LA-positive and LA-negative plasma samples was maintained and possibly even enhanced in the platelet neutralization procedure correction phase of the PTT-LA test system.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^1145McAu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Savaysa), and betrixaban (Bevyxxa) are pharmacotherapy options used for the prevention of thrombosis in various cardiovascular contexts. DOACs are divided into two main classes: oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g. dabigatran). In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first DOAC, dabigatran, which was followed by the approval of rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban in subsequent years. DOACs are relatively new agents that have demonstrated superiority or non-inferiority compared to previous standards of care, such as anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA; e.g. warfarin) or low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), in reducing the risk of thromboembolic complications while offering similar or reduced bleeding risk.

Advantages of DOACs over VKAs include fewer monitoring requirements, less frequent follow-up, more immediate drug onset and offset effects — which are important for periprocedural and acute bleeding management — and fewer drug and food interactions. Consequently, DOAC prescriptions surpassed those for warfarin by 2013, with apixaban being the most frequently prescribed DOAC for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

Over the past decade, DOACs have been the focus of extensive investigation in many clinical scenarios. While guidelines and review articles offer detailed and comprehensive analyses of the vast literature base, they can sometimes be cumbersome.

### Neutralising rivaroxaban induced interference in laboratory testing for lupus anticoagulant (LA): A comparative study using DOAC Stop as well as andexanet alfa [^116y8xzW]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Low credibility.

Lupus anticoagulant (LA) investigation in patients on anticoagulant therapy is problematic. Rivaroxaban, in particular, causes significant interference by prolonging both LA screening and confirmation tests and falsely raising LA screen/confirm ratios, leading to potential false identification of LA. The Russell Viper Venom Time (RVVT) assay, which is key to the investigation of LA, is especially sensitive to rivaroxaban.

- **Materials and methods**: We assessed cross-laboratory (n = 82) testing of four samples to investigate whether rivaroxaban-induced interference in LA testing could be neutralised. Testing was performed blind to sample type. The samples comprised: (A) a pool of normal plasma (LA-negative control); (B) sample A spiked with rivaroxaban (200 ng/mL) to create rivaroxaban-induced interference (LA 'false' positive sample); (C) sample B subsequently treated with a commercial 'DOAC-neutraliser' (DOAC Stop); (D) sample B treated with andexanet alfa (200 μg/mL).

- **Results**: As expected, the rivaroxaban-spiked sample (B) caused prolongation of most LA-tests and generated a falsely prolonged RVVT screen/confirm ratio (median 1.37, compared to 0.97 for sample A). The sample (C) treated with DOAC Stop evidenced a correction in LA-test clotting times and neutralised the false positive LA (median RVVT screen/confirm ratio of 0.99). Although the andexanet alfa treated sample (D) also yielded a low median RVVT screen/confirm ratio of 0.88, it did not fully correct LA-test clotting times. Consistent with test findings, all laboratories interpreted samples A and C correctly.

### Direct oral anticoagulant dose selection: Challenging cases [^1165bg7H]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are administered in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring of their anticoagulant effect, based on the results of pivotal phase III trials. In some of these trials, patients were randomly allocated to receive a higher or lower dose of a DOAC, whereas in others, most patients were given a standard dose, and only a subset deemed to be at risk of drug accumulation was given a lower dose. Treatment guidelines recommend dosing DOACs according to how they were tested in the trials. However, for some patients, the optimal dosing remains uncertain.

One example is patients with atrial fibrillation who are perceived to have an unacceptably high risk of bleeding but do not meet the guideline criteria for dose reduction. Another example is patients with venous thromboembolism who have completed 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation and are eligible for extended treatment with a standard or reduced dose of DOAC. In this review, we present a case-based approach to DOAC dose selection in these two settings.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^115meMtu]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Rapid and accurate determination of anticoagulant drug levels is essential in critical clinical situations such as urgent surgery, planned thrombolysis, or major bleeding. Any anticoagulation treatment is inevitably associated with an increased risk of bleeding, which can be as high as 15% per year in certain patient populations. Furthermore, approximately 25% of intracranial hemorrhages, which are the most dangerous adverse events, are linked to anticoagulation treatment. The bleeding risk associated with anticoagulants is particularly significant in trauma patients because uncontrolled bleeding is the leading cause of death in these patients.

In any patient with massive bleeding, early and targeted treatment is the most critical measure to save lives because 80% of trauma deaths occur within the first hour after trauma. Laboratory tests that can rapidly verify the presence of a relevant anticoagulant drug level will support fast treatment with reversal agents. Additionally, knowledge of the anticoagulant drug level is essential in cases of urgent surgery and planned thrombolysis. Rapid intervention is required in both cases, but an increased bleeding risk exposes patients to high procedural risks. Therefore, simple laboratory tests that accurately determine the anticoagulant drug level would improve care in patients with anticoagulation treatment.

### A universal anti-xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: Method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^113EQKfx]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

The proportion of the population taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban is rapidly increasing, and critical clinical situations occur frequently. A simple and readily available laboratory test, accurately determining these anticoagulants' concentration in various healthcare settings, would improve care in this vulnerable population. Routine coagulation tests, which are widely available, are not suitable for determining DOAC drug levels. Anti-Xa assays, which are successfully used for the monitoring of heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), were introduced, and a nice linear relationship was demonstrated in samples spiked with rivaroxaban. DOAC-calibrated anti-Xa activity correlated well with drug concentrations when measured in healthy volunteers and even patients.

However, widespread implementation in clinical practice is hampered by two major problems. First, a large study investigating the accuracy of all Xa inhibitors over the full spectrum of concentrations in clinical practice is still missing. Second, providing different assays for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug levels in a '24/7' service is elaborate and expensive. It would be very convenient if laboratories could use a test that is already available in 24/7 service to determine all three Xa inhibitors. Such a universal anti-Xa assay for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug levels would simplify laboratory procedures and foster widespread implementation.

### Eliquis [^115a7p9B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Nonclinical toxicology**:

	- **Carcinogenesis**: Apixaban was not carcinogenic when administered to mice and rats for up to 2 years. The systemic exposures (AUCs) of unbound apixaban in male and female mice at the highest doses tested (1500 and 3000 mg/kg/day) were 9 and 20 times, respectively, the human exposure of unbound drug at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. Systemic exposures of unbound apixaban in male and female rats at the highest dose tested (600 mg/kg/day) were 2 and 4 times, respectively, the human exposure.

	- **Mutagenesis**: Apixaban was neither mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, nor clastogenic in Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro, in a 1-month in vivo/in vitro cytogenetics study in rat peripheral blood lymphocytes, or in a rat micronucleus study in vivo.

	- **Impairment of fertility**: Apixaban had no effect on fertility in male or female rats when given at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day, a dose resulting in unbound apixaban exposure levels that are 3 and 4 times, respectively, the human exposure.

		Apixaban administered to female rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day from implantation through the end of lactation produced no adverse findings in male offspring (F1 generation) at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day, a dose resulting in exposure to unbound apixaban that is 5 times the human exposure. Adverse effects in the F1-generation female offspring were limited to decreased mating and fertility indices at ≥ 200 mg/kg/day, a dose resulting in exposure to unbound apixaban that is ≥ 5 times the human exposure.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: Evidence and unresolved issues [^1155dUxX]. Lancet (2020). High credibility.

Currently licensed direct oral anticoagulants selectively target thrombin (e.g. dabigatran) or coagulation factor Xa (e.g. apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban). Designed for administration in fixed doses without routine monitoring, direct oral anticoagulants exhibit a lower propensity for food and drug interactions compared to vitamin K antagonists. In randomized controlled trials involving around 250,000 patients, these anticoagulants were found to be at least as effective for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis and were associated with a lower risk of life-threatening bleeding.

The absolute benefits of direct oral anticoagulants over vitamin K antagonists are modest; nonetheless, guidelines recommend them over vitamin K antagonists for most indications due to their ease of use and superior safety. The most significant benefits are likely observed in patients previously deemed unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy. The emergence of generic preparations is anticipated to increase the adoption of direct oral anticoagulants, especially in countries where their use has been limited due to cost.

Direct oral anticoagulants are contraindicated in patients with mechanical heart valves and should be used with caution or avoided in patients with advanced kidney or liver disease. This paper reviews the pharmacology of direct oral anticoagulants, summarizes the evidence leading to their approval and incorporation into treatment guidelines, and explores key unresolved issues. Additionally, future perspectives for their development are briefly discussed.

### ELIQUIS [^114dw672]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Approximately 25% of an orally administered apixaban dose is recovered in urine and feces as metabolites. Apixaban is metabolized mainly via CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2J2. O-demethylation and hydroxylation at the 3-oxopiperidinyl moiety are the major sites of biotransformation. Unchanged apixaban is the major drug-related component in human plasma; there are no active circulating metabolites.

- **Elimination**: Apixaban is eliminated in both urine and feces. Renal excretion accounts for about 27% of total clearance, while biliary and direct intestinal excretion contribute to the elimination of apixaban in the feces. Apixaban has a total clearance of approximately 3.3 L/hour and an apparent half-life of approximately 12 hours following oral administration. Apixaban is a substrate of transport proteins: P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein.

- **Drug interaction studies**: During in vitro apixaban studies at concentrations significantly greater than therapeutic exposures, no inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, or CYP2C19, nor induction effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5 were observed. Therefore, apixaban is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Apixaban is not a significant inhibitor of P-gp.

The effects of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban are summarized in the relevant sections of literature [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)].

### Eliquis [^113FUJ53]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Evidence for the efficacy and safety of Eliquis was derived from ARISTOTLE, a multinational, double-blind study in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) comparing the effects of Eliquis and warfarin on the risk of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) systemic embolism. In ARISTOTLE, patients were randomized to Eliquis 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in subjects with at least 2 of the following characteristics: age greater than or equal to 80 years, body weight less than or equal to 60 kg, or serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL) or to warfarin (targeted to an INR range of 2.0–3.0).

Patients had to have one or more of the following additional risk factors for stroke:

- **Prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)**
- **Prior systemic embolism**
- **Age greater than or equal to 75 years**
- **Arterial hypertension requiring treatment**
- **Diabetes mellitus**
- **Heart failure**: ≥ New York Heart Association Class 2
- **Left ventricular ejection fraction**: ≤ 40%

The primary objective of ARISTOTLE was to determine whether Eliquis 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily) was effective (noninferior to warfarin) in reducing the risk of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism. The superiority of Eliquis to warfarin was also examined for the primary endpoint (rate of stroke and systemic embolism), major bleeding, and death from any cause.

### Eliquis [^115TXNDu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Eliquis (apixaban), a factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor, is chemically described as 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-7-oxo-6-[4-(2-oxopiperidin-1-yl)phenyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-3-carboxamide. Its molecular formula is C25H25N5O4, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 459.5.

Apixaban appears as a white to pale-yellow powder. At physiological pH (1.2–6.8), apixaban does not ionize, with an aqueous solubility across the physiological pH range of approximately 0.04 mg/mL. Eliquis tablets are available for oral administration in strengths of 2.5 mg and 5 mg of apixaban.

- **Inactive ingredients**: Anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, sodium lauryl sulfate, and magnesium stearate.
- **Film coating components**:
	- 2.5 mg tablets: Lactose monohydrate, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, triacetin, and yellow iron oxide.
	- 5 mg tablets: Lactose monohydrate, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, triacetin, and red iron oxide.

### Lupus anticoagulant test persistence over time and its associations with future thrombotic events [^115AiVrS]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

In our cohort of LA+ patients rigorously followed for a long observation time, we found that most patients remain positive for LA over an extended period or only transiently test negative for LA. VKA use is associated with a negative LA test, probably due to methodological problems and, importantly, a negative LA test did not attenuate the risk of thromboembolism. We conclude that the decision for the duration of anticoagulation cannot be based on a negative LA test if a patient has previously been persistently positive. Additionally, based on our findings, there is no evidence for the clinical utility of routine monitoring of LA status in persistently positive patients.

### Andexxa [^113Fm9Eq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Thromboembolic and ischemic risks**: The thromboembolic and ischemic risks were assessed in 419 bleeding patients in the ANNEXA-4 study who received Andexxa and were treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban. There were 45 out of 419 (10.7%) patients who experienced a thrombotic event, with the median time to the first event being 10 days. Notably, 17 patients experienced the event within three days of treatment. Of the 419 patients who received Andexxa, 266 received at least one anticoagulation dose within 30 days after treatment as a prophylactic measure. Among these 266 patients, 14 (5.3%) experienced a thrombotic event after resumption [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- Monitor patients treated with Andexxa for signs and symptoms of arterial and venous thromboembolic events, ischemic events, and cardiac arrest. To reduce thromboembolic risk, resume anticoagulant therapy as soon as medically appropriate following treatment with Andexxa [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

	- The safety of Andexxa has not been evaluated in patients who experienced thromboembolic events or disseminated intravascular coagulation within two weeks before the life-threatening bleeding event requiring treatment with Andexxa. Additionally, the safety of Andexxa has not been evaluated in patients who received prothrombin complex concentrates, recombinant factor VIIa, or whole blood products within seven days before the bleeding event.

- **Unresponsiveness to unfractionated heparin**: Unresponsiveness to unfractionated heparin leading to non-prolongation of activated clotting times and serious thrombotic events has occurred following Andexxa treatment.

### Apixaban compared with warfarin to prevent thrombosis in thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome: a randomized trial [^112GL6FY]. Blood Advances (2022). High credibility.

Patient satisfaction with anticoagulation was assessed using the ACTS survey. Patients on apixaban had significantly higher scores compared with patients on warfarin from month 1 through month 12, indicating that patients reported higher satisfaction with apixaban over warfarin.

- **Figure assessment**: Figure 3 illustrates the assessment of patient satisfaction with anticoagulation treatment using ACTS among patients randomized to apixaban or warfarin. Shown is a comparison measured with a validated assessment tool (ACTS) at the specified time points. The midline in each box represents the median, while the top and bottom of each box indicate the cutoffs of the interquartile range. The whiskers represent 1.5 times the interquartile range, and outliers are shown as dots. Apixaban was significantly favored over warfarin at every interval assessment.

### Evaluation of apixaban in stroke and systemic embolism prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in clinical practice setting in France, rationale and design of the NAXOS: SNIIRAM study [^116wG5x9]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Patients will be included in the study if they are covered by the French national health insurance general scheme, with at least one reimbursement of anticoagulant treatment initiated with an index anticoagulant treatment (either naïve or experienced patients), aged 18 or older at their anticoagulant initiation, and diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the 24 months prior to the anticoagulant treatment initiation.

Patients will be excluded from the study cohorts if they had different types of anticoagulant treatment at the index date, were diagnosed with a valvular condition in the 24 months before their anticoagulant initiation, or were treated for an indication other than stroke prevention in AF in the 6 weeks before their first anticoagulant reimbursement, including the index date.

The study population will be identified in the database through consecutive steps as indicated in the global flow chart of the study population (Figure 2) and detailed in Supporting Information Appendix 2.

- **Figure 2**: Global flow chart of the study population. AC, anticoagulant; AF, atrial fibrillation; VKA, vitamin‐K antagonist.

Anticoagulant-naive patients will be defined as patients with no dispensation of anticoagulant treatment during the 24 months before the index date. Anticoagulant-experienced patients correspond to the others. Patients in the experienced group will only be included at their first entry. Therefore, all patients aged ≥ 18 years and covered by the French national health insurance general scheme, with at least one reimbursement for oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatments (VKAs, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran) between January 2014 and December.

### Lupus anticoagulant test persistence over time and its associations with future thrombotic events [^111VFEdw]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

In our cohort of patients persistently positive for lupus anticoagulant (LA), the majority remained positive throughout the observation period. However, over one-quarter had at least one negative test for LA during the observation period of almost 10 years. There was a clear association between vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment and experiencing a negative LA test. Most patients had transiently negative LA tests, as 68% of those with a negative result and follow-up turned positive again. Importantly, a negative test for LA did not impact a patient's future risk of thrombotic events (arterial thromboembolism (ATE), venous thromboembolism (VTE), or thrombotic events (TE)), and time-dependent VKA status did not explain the lack of association between LA status and thrombotic outcomes.

VKA use at baseline and factors likely associated with VKA exposure over time, including history of thrombosis, were the strongest predictors of experiencing a negative LA test. **Interpretation of LA tests**: For patients on VKA, it remains controversial, as VKA use is associated with false negative and false positive LA results. We hypothesize some of the negative LA tests for patients on VKAs may have been false negatives. Nevertheless, when an alternative definition of LA positivity was applied to all LA tests, independent of VKA status, no association between experiencing a negative LA test and subsequent thrombotic outcomes was found.

- **Recent guidance**: The most recent guidance from the SSC of the ISTH recommends testing patients for LA when they have stopped anticoagulation treatment whenever possible.

### Direct oral anticoagulant adsorption: Impact on lupus anticoagulant testing-review of the literature and evaluation on spiked and patient samples [^114BANwk]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) interfere with lupus anticoagulant (LAC) testing. DOAC-Stop (D-S) represents a preanalytical strategy to cope with this issue.

- **Objectives**: To assess D-S's ability to remove DOACs from plasma and overcome DOAC interference in LAC assays, and to evaluate D-S's applicability in a representative patient cohort with routine LAC requests.

- **Methods**: Apixaban (30–933 ng/mL), edoxaban (31–1060 ng/mL), rivaroxaban (35–1020 ng/mL), and dabigatran (20–360 ng/mL) were spiked into normal plasma. Aliquots were either treated with D-S or left untreated before DOAC and LAC testing. Patient samples containing DOACs (n = 43), vitamin K antagonists (n = 25), heparins (n = 21), or no anticoagulants (n = 63) were tested for LAC before and after D-S.

- **Results**: Spiking experiments revealed false-positive LAC results from low concentrations of DOACs, except for apixaban. Following D-S treatment, DOAC levels were below the lower limits of quantification, except for apixaban at the highest concentration, and no false-positive LAC results were obtained. DOAC levels were below lower limits of quantification after D-S in 39/43 DOAC-containing patient samples. For 23/29 LAC-positive DOAC-containing samples, LAC tests became negative after D-S, whereas 3/6 samples that remained positive were from patients with a high probability of antiphospholipid syndrome. In the non-DOAC-treated groups, LAC changed from positive to negative in 10 cases and vice versa in 2 cases.

- **Conclusions**: D-S limits DOAC interference in LAC assays. DOAC concentration measurement should be performed in D-S treated samples because of incomplete r…

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113iFX4a]. Chest (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of pulmonary embolism, specifically concerning the choice of anticoagulation, the ACCP 2016 guidelines recommend considering dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban as long-term anticoagulant therapy. This recommendation is for patients with DVT of the leg or PE who have no evidence of cancer, instead of using VKA therapy.

### Eliquis [^113CsqZT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Increased risk of thrombotic events after premature discontinuation**: Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including Eliquis, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation, increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from Eliquis to warfarin in clinical trials involving atrial fibrillation patients. If Eliquis is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Apixaban for extended treatment of provoked venous thromboembolism [^114FRCm3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The appropriate duration of anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients who have a transient provoking factor (e.g. surgery, trauma, or immobility) and concomitant enduring risk factors is uncertain.

- **Methods**: In this single-center, double-blind, randomized trial, adults with VTE after the occurrence of a transient provoking factor who had at least one enduring risk factor and had completed at least 3 months of anticoagulation were assigned to receive oral apixaban (at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was the first symptomatic reVTE. The primary safety outcome was the first episode of major bleeding according to the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis.

- **Results**: A total of 600 patients underwent randomization (mean age, 59.5 years; female sex, 57.0%; non-White race, 19.2%). The trial population had a broad range of provoking factors and enduring risk factors. Symptomatic reVTE occurred in 4 of the 300 patients (1.3%) in the apixaban group and in 30 of the 300 patients (10.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.36; P < 0.001). Major bleeding occurred in 1 patient in the apixaban group and none in the placebo group. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was observed in 14 of 294 patients (4.8%) in the apixaban group and in 5 of 294 patients (1.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.68; 95% CI, 0.96 to 7.43; P = 0.06). One patient in the apixaban group and 3 patients in the placebo group died, with no clear cause identified for death.

### Eliquis [^117H9wKn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effects of renal impairment, age, body weight, and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban are discussed.

- **Specific populations**:
	- ESRD subjects treated with intermittent hemodialysis reported pharmacokinetic findings following a single dose of apixaban post-hemodialysis.
	- Results reflect creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 15 mL/min based on regression analysis.
	- Dashed vertical lines illustrate pharmacokinetic changes that were used to inform dosing recommendations.
	- No dose adjustment is recommended for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients unless at least two of the following patient characteristics are present: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL.

- **Gender**: A study in healthy subjects comparing the pharmacokinetics in males and females showed no meaningful difference.

- **Race**: Results across pharmacokinetic studies in normal subjects showed no differences in apixaban pharmacokinetics among White/Caucasian, Asian, and Black/African American subjects. No dose adjustment is required based on race/ethnicity.

- **Hemodialysis in ESRD subjects**: Systemic exposure to apixaban, administered as a single 5 mg dose in ESRD subjects dosed immediately after the completion of a 4-hour hemodialysis session (post-dialysis), is 36% higher compared to subjects with normal renal function. The systemic exposure to apixaban administered 2 hours prior to a 4-hour hemodialysis session is not fully detailed here.

### Eliquis [^116vTjpY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

ELIQUIS (pronounced ELL eh kwiss), known scientifically as apixaban, is available in tablet form.

- **Most important information about ELIQUIS**: For individuals taking ELIQUIS for atrial fibrillation, it is critical to understand that this condition, characterized by an irregular heartbeat, increases the risk of forming a blood clot in the heart. Such clots may travel to the brain, leading to a stroke, or to other parts of the body. ELIQUIS reduces the likelihood of stroke by preventing the formation of these clots. However, discontinuing ELIQUIS may increase your risk of blood clot formation. Therefore, do not stop taking ELIQUIS without consulting your prescribing doctor, as this may elevate your stroke risk.

- **Before surgery or procedures**: ELIQUIS may need to be temporarily discontinued before surgery or certain medical or dental procedures. Consult the prescribing doctor about the appropriate timing for stopping and restarting ELIQUIS around these events. If it is necessary to stop taking ELIQUIS, your doctor might prescribe an alternative medication to minimize clot formation risk.

- **Risk of bleeding**: ELIQUIS has the potential to cause bleeding, which can be severe and, in rare cases, fatal. This risk is due to ELIQUIS's function as a blood thinner, which reduces clotting ability.

### Lupus anticoagulant test persistence over time and its associations with future thrombotic events [^111Ppc8R]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Using an alternative definition of lupus anticoagulant (LA) positivity that is based solely on the LA test and the Rosner Index, applied to patients regardless of their vitamin K antagonist (VKA) status (described in supplemental Paragraph 1), we found that 63 patients (38%) developed at least one negative LA test during follow-up. This corresponds to a 10-year cumulative incidence of 39% (95% CI, 31–47). However, even with this alternative classification, we did not observe evidence for an association between turning LA negative and subsequent thrombotic outcomes (supplemental Table 5).

### Lupus anticoagulant laboratory diagnosis by applying the 2020 ISTH-SSC guidelines [^116mzPhZ]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Low credibility.

The ISTH-SSC guidelines for lupus anticoagulant (LA) testing recommend using in-house determined cut-off values, pooled normal plasma (PNP) for ratio normalization, and a ratio for the mixing test interpretation. They strongly support the mixing step role in the diagnostic process.

- **Objectives**: To investigate and compare the LA testing results and interpretations obtained following the ISTH-SSC guidelines or the available alternatives.

- **Patients/Methods**: Blood samples for LA testing from 462 consecutive patients were evaluated for screening, mixing, and confirmatory tests. The analysis focused on the interpretation differences between using (1) the in-house cut-off values versus the manufacturer's cut-off values, (2) a normalized ratio calculated using PNP at each run versus the mean of the reference interval, (3) a normalized ratio versus the index of circulating anticoagulant to interpret the mixing step, and (4) a two-step versus three-step procedure.

- **Results**: LA testing outcomes were comparable when using the in-house and manufacturer's cut-off values. More positive dilute Russell's viper venom (DRVV) time results were obtained with the normalized ratio based on PNP than with the mean of the reference interval. Overall, the mixing test results obtained with the normalized ratio and the index of circulating anticoagulant showed a good agreement. Among the 97 DRVV Screen test-positive samples, 33 and 89 were classified as LA-positive with the 3-step and the 2-step procedure, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The cut-off value used and the way to normalize ratios had a significant impact on the results and interpretations of lupus anticoagulant testing.

### Lupus anticoagulant test persistence over time and its associations with future thrombotic events [^117BXFZ4]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

As there are no clearly defined criteria for LA positivity in patients on VKA treatment, and since it is not possible to interrupt VKA in patients with a history of thrombosis solely for study purposes, we employed the Rosner Index in addition to the predefined LA criteria. In this study, for patients receiving VKA therapy, an LA test was deemed positive if the confirmatory assay was positive and the mixing study had a Rosner Index of ≥ 15. The Rosner Index was calculated as 100× (clotting times of the 1:1 mixture of normal plasma/patient's plasma). For patients not receiving anticoagulation or those on unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with an anti-Xa level ≤ 1.0 internal unit (IU) per mL, an LA test was considered positive if either the confirmatory test or the mixing study was positive (again defined using the Rosner Index). Mixing and confirmatory tests were not conducted when patients receiving LMWH had an anti-Xa level > 1.0 IU per mL, and these LA tests were excluded from the analysis. Additionally, LA tests performed while patients were receiving direct oral anticoagulants were also excluded.

### Lupus anticoagulant detection in anticoagulated patients. Guidance from the Scientific and Standardization Committee for lupus anticoagulant/antiphospholipid antibodies of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [^116SCV5x]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

The laboratory detection of lupus anticoagulants (LA) in anticoagulated patients represents a challenge, and there is no consensus on the types of assays or procedures to be adopted.

- **Objectives**: This communication from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), Scientific and Standardization Committee (SSC), aims to provide guidance on the procedures to be adopted.

- **Methods**: Members of the ISTH-SSC on Lupus Anticoagulant/Antiphospholipid Antibodies reviewed the literature to search for evidence on the most appropriate assays or procedures to be adopted.

- **Results**: Anticoagulants can interfere with the tests used for LA detection, causing occasional false positives or false negatives. Some commercial tests include heparin-neutralizers in their composition, which can neutralize unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin up to 1.0 U/mL. Although LA tests are less affected by low molecular weight heparin, caution is needed in interpreting results. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) may affect LA detection. Diluting test plasma into pooled normal plasma is not reliable, as false negatives or false positives may occur. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) affect LA detection, thus it is not recommended to attempt LA detection in these patients. The use of DOAC adsorbents is a promising solution and should be further investigated in LA-positive and LA-negative patient populations. Taipan/Ecarin tests may offer a solution for VKAs and anti-FXa DOACs, but independent evidence on their value and standardized kits is required.
