## Question

Low urea creatinine ratio

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a low urea-to-creatinine ratio (UCR) and translate it into diagnostic and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and calculate the UCR correctly and confirm units. Then, I should verify what constitutes a "low" threshold in different clinical contexts. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology that drives a low UCR, followed by a prioritized differential diagnosis. After that, I need to check for confounders that can mislead interpretation. Then, I will correlate with clinical context and targeted labs. Next, I should review the diagnostic performance and limitations of UCR in AKI phenotypes. Finally, I will outline management strategies tailored to the likely etiologies and close with a concise synthesis and caveats for special populations.

> Let me first confirm the basics: the UCR is typically reported as BUN-to-creatinine in mg/dL in the U.S. or urea-to-creatinine in mmol/L elsewhere, and I need to ensure both components are in the same units before interpreting any ratio; to convert BUN to urea, I multiply by about 2.14, and to convert mg/dL to mmol/L for BUN I multiply by 0.357 and for urea by 0.166, so I should double-check the lab report's units before proceeding [^114DV2at].

> Now, what is "low"? Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — definitions vary by context. In general nephrology teaching, a BUN/Cr ratio less than about 10:1 is considered low and suggests intrinsic renal disease or postrenal obstruction, whereas in AKI phenotyping studies, a BUN/Cr ratio of 12 or less has been used to flag acute interstitial nephritis, so I should anchor the threshold to the clinical question at hand rather than a single universal cut point [^113GXEgH] [^112kJxys] [^114yrK72].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology that lowers the ratio. Wait, let me verify the mechanisms: a low UCR arises when urea is disproportionately low relative to creatinine, which can reflect decreased urea production (hepatic urea cycle dysfunction, low protein intake), impaired urea reabsorption (tubulointerstitial disease, osmotic diuresis, loop diuretics), or increased creatinine generation relative to urea (high muscle mass, exogenous creatine, lab interference), so I need to keep both numerator and denominator in mind when interpreting any single value [^113xuRsa] [^113RwLDi] [^1117isid].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis in order of likelihood. Let me think about intrinsic renal causes first: acute interstitial nephritis is classically associated with a BUN/Cr ratio ≤ 12 and has shown sensitivity around 76% and specificity around 81% in prospective cohorts, while acute tubular injury and other intrinsic nephritides can also lower the ratio via impaired urea reabsorption; postrenal obstruction can present similarly, so I should correlate with urine output, ultrasound, and medication history before concluding AIN [^112kJxys] [^114yrK72] [^113GXEgH].

> I need to check hepatic and nutritional contributors next. In cirrhosis, portosystemic shunting and hepatocellular dysfunction reduce ureagenesis, lowering BUN and thus the ratio; likewise, low protein intake or malnutrition can lower BUN and mimic a renal cause, so I should review dietary history, albumin, and markers of sarcopenia before attributing a low UCR to kidney disease alone [^115RV5Q8] [^111oDzB6].

> But wait, what if the creatinine side is driving the ratio down? Increased creatinine generation from higher muscle mass, exogenous creatine supplements, or assay interference (for example, with certain Jaffé methods) can artifactually depress the UCR; conversely, low muscle mass tends to raise the UCR, so I should confirm muscle mass context and, if needed, consider cystatin C–based eGFR to cross-check filtration estimates before overinterpreting the ratio [^115nZYPx] [^111nAck8].

> Next, I should review the clinical context and targeted labs to refine the pretest probabilities. I will now examine volume status, hemodynamics, and urine output for prerenal features; check urinalysis for pyuria, eosinophils, and protein to support AIN; obtain liver panel and ammonia if hepatic dysfunction is suspected; and consider a 24-hour urine collection for urea and creatinine excretion if I need to disentangle production from clearance effects, especially in cirrhosis or malnutrition [^115RV5Q8] [^117X84SA].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic performance of UCR in AKI phenotyping because I don't want to overstate its utility. Large ED cohorts show that BUN/Cr lacks discriminative capacity to separate prerenal from intrinsic AKI overall, whereas a low BUN/Cr (≤ 12) performs reasonably well for AIN in hospitalized AKI cohorts; thus, I should use UCR as a supportive clue rather than a standalone diagnostic arbiter and integrate it with FeUrea, FeNa, urinalysis, and imaging as indicated [^111JuxEs] [^114Pe6mf] [^112kJxys] [^114yrK72].

> Let me consider management pathways tailored to likely etiologies. If AIN is suspected, I should promptly discontinue potential offending drugs, avoid nephrotoxins, and consider early biopsy if there is no recovery, recognizing that a low BUN/Cr strengthens the case but does not replace histology; if hepatic dysfunction is the driver, I should manage the liver disease and reassess nutrition; if low protein intake or malnutrition is identified, I should coordinate dietary optimization and monitor for refeeding effects on urea generation; and if obstruction is on the table, I should obtain renal imaging and relieve the obstruction urgently [^112kJxys] [^115RV5Q8] [^111oDzB6].

> I should double-check special populations and caveats. In cirrhosis, both low urea production and altered creatinine handling invalidate UCR as a catabolic marker; in critical illness, UCR trends can track catabolism but are confounded by feeding strategy, RRT, and drugs; in pediatrics, age-appropriate norms differ and protein intake heavily influences urea, so I must interpret pediatric UCR with growth and nutrition context in mind [^115RV5Q8] [^113xuRsa] [^115mpgnb] [^111oDzB6].

> In summary, a low UCR most often signals intrinsic renal processes such as AIN or ATI, hepatic urea cycle impairment, or low protein intake, but I need to ensure I am not being misled by increased creatinine generation or unit confusion; integrating the ratio with urinalysis, volume status, liver function, and muscle mass context yields the most reliable clinical inference and guides appropriate management steps [^113RwLDi] [^112kJxys] [^113xuRsa] [^114DV2at].

---

A low urea-to-creatinine ratio (UCR) most often reflects **low urea production** (liver disease, low protein intake, or overhydration) or **increased creatinine generation** (high muscle mass, rhabdomyolysis, or exogenous creatine). It can also indicate **intrinsic renal disease** (acute interstitial nephritis, ATN) or tubular defects that reduce urea reabsorption. Evaluate with liver function tests, nutritional assessment, urinalysis, and imaging; interpret alongside clinical context and correct for confounders such as diuretics, pregnancy, and muscle mass before acting on the ratio alone [^113GXEgH] [^113xuRsa].

---

## Physiological basis of urea and creatinine

Urea is produced in the liver via the **urea cycle** and is excreted by the kidneys; its serum level reflects hepatic synthesis, protein intake, and renal handling. Creatinine is generated from muscle metabolism, filtered at the glomerulus, and minimally secreted; its serum level primarily reflects muscle mass and **glomerular filtration**. The UCR integrates these processes and is influenced by hepatic function, protein intake, hydration, and **renal tubular handling** [^113xuRsa].

---

## Causes of low urea-to-creatinine ratio

A low UCR results from **reduced urea production**, **increased creatinine generation**, or **altered renal handling**:

| **Category** | **Causes** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Reduced urea production | - Liver disease (cirrhosis, hepatitis) <br/> - Low protein intake (malnutrition, vegetarian diet) <br/> - Overhydration (dilutional effect) | - Impaired urea synthesis <br/> - Reduced protein substrate <br/> - Dilution of urea |
| Increased creatinine generation | - High muscle mass <br/> - Rhabdomyolysis <br/> - Exogenous creatine supplementation | - Increased creatinine production <br/> - Muscle breakdown <br/> - Supplement use |
| Altered renal handling | - Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) <br/> - Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) <br/> - Osmotic diuresis <br/> - Loop diuretics | - Reduced urea reabsorption <br/> - Tubular dysfunction <br/> - Increased urea excretion |

---

## Clinical significance of low urea-to-creatinine ratio

A low UCR is **clinically significant** and may indicate:

- **Liver disease**: Reduced urea synthesis lowers the numerator, decreasing the ratio [^113xuRsa].
- **Malnutrition**: Low protein intake reduces urea production [^111oDzB6].
- **Overhydration**: Dilutional effects lower urea concentration.
- **Intrinsic renal disease**: AIN or ATN reduce urea reabsorption, lowering the ratio [^113xuRsa].
- **Increased muscle breakdown**: Rhabdomyolysis or high muscle mass elevate creatinine, lowering the ratio.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When a low UCR is detected, a **structured evaluation** is recommended:

- **Confirm the abnormality**: Repeat testing to exclude laboratory error.
- **Assess liver function**: AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, albumin, INR.
- **Evaluate nutritional status**: Dietary history, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin.
- **Review medications**: Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs.
- **Perform urinalysis**: Proteinuria, hematuria, leukocytes, casts.
- **Assess renal function**: eGFR, electrolytes, urine output.
- **Imaging**: Renal ultrasound if obstruction or structural disease is suspected.

---

## Clinical implications and management

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Liver disease**: Treat the hepatic condition; monitor urea and ammonia.
- **Malnutrition**: Nutritional rehabilitation, dietary protein optimization [^notfound].
- **Overhydration**: Fluid restriction, diuretics as indicated.
- **Intrinsic renal disease**: Treat the cause (e.g. stop offending drugs for AIN), supportive care, and monitor renal function [^notfound].
- **Increased muscle breakdown**: Address the cause of muscle injury; monitor CK and renal function.

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors can confound UCR interpretation:

- **Age and sex**: Influence muscle mass and creatinine generation [^113JKcU3].
- **Medications**: Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs alter renal handling.
- **Hydration status**: Overhydration or dehydration affects urea concentration.
- **Diet**: High or low protein intake alters urea production [^111JuxEs].

---

## Prognostic significance

A low UCR has prognostic implications: in liver disease, it reflects **reduced synthetic capacity** and is associated with worse outcomes; in malnutrition, it signals **poor nutritional status** and higher morbidity; and in intrinsic renal disease, it may indicate **tubular injury** and a risk of progression.

---

A low urea-to-creatinine ratio signals reduced urea production, increased creatinine generation, or altered renal handling. Accurate interpretation requires **clinical context**, repeat testing, and targeted evaluation to guide management and prognostication.

Pitfalls of UCR as a catabolic biomarker in critical illness

It is important to note that there are certain pitfalls when using UCR as a catabolic biomarker in critical illness in clinical practice (Fig. 3). Firstly, since UCR is a ratio, it is essential to take into account variations in both urea and creatinine when assessing it as a metabolic signature. Furthermore, factors other than pronounced protein catabolism may also increase UCR. These include conditions that enhance urea reabsorption, such as activation the renin-angiotensin activating system (i.e. hypovolemia or heart failure), as well as factors that elevate urea production, such as high dietary protein intake and blood absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Conversely, the level of UCR can be reduced by liver dysfunction that affects the urea cycle metabolism. Similarly, renal factors, such as medications (e.g. loop diuretics) or damage to the renal tubules, may decrease urea reabsorption and lead to a decrease in UCR. The study by Haines et al. found that major trauma patients with severe AKI tended to have a lower UCR, while a single-centre retrospective study of ICU patients revealed no significant difference in UCR between patients with disparate AKI stages. Differences in AKI aetiology may explain discrepancies in these findings. One study observed an UCR > 20 at ICU admission, indicative of prerenal insufficiency, to reduce the risk of requiring RRT. In addition to this, evaluating UCR trajectory as a metabolic signature during RRT may be challenging since RRT removes both urea and creatinine from the blood, with a therapy-specific relationship between solute removal and clearance. Future studies are required to determine suitable catabolism biomarkers for AKI and RRT patients in the ICU, as they represent a challenging population.

### Blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio in the general population and in patients with acute heart failure [^1119E4Lu]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine (BUN/creatinine) ratio has been proposed as a useful parameter in acute heart failure (AHF), but data on the normal range and the added value of the ratio compared with its separate components in patients with AHF are lacking. The aim of this study is to define the normal range of BUN/creatinine ratio and to investigate its clinical significance in patients with AHF.

Methods

In 4484 subjects from the general population without cardiovascular comorbidities, we calculated age-specific and sex-specific normal values of the BUN/creatinine ratio, deriving a higher and lower than normal range of BUN/creatinine ratio (exceeding the 95% prediction intervals). Association of abnormal range to prognosis was tested in 2033 patients with AHF for the outcome of all-cause death through 180days, death or cardiovascular or renal rehospitalisation through 60days and heart failure (HF) rehospitalisation within 60days.

Results

In a cohort of patients with AHF, 482 (24.6%) and 28 (1.4%) patients with HF were classified into higher and lower than normal range groups, respectively. In Cox regression analysis, higher than normal range of BUN/creatinine ratio group was an independent predictor for all-cause death (HR: 1.86, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.66) and death or cardiovascular or renal rehospitalisation (HR: 1.37, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.82), but not for HF rehospitalisation (HR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.86) after adjustment for other prognostic factors including both creatinine and BUN.

Conclusions

In patients with AHF, BUN/creatinine higher than age-specific and sex-specific normal range is associated with worse prognosis independently from both creatinine and BUN. CLINICAL TRIALS: gov identifier NCT00328692 and NCT00354458.

### The urea-to-creatinine ratio as an emerging biomarker in critical care: a scoping review and meta-analysis [^117985Ds]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe protein catabolism is a major aspect of critical illness and leads to pronounced muscle wasting and, consequently, extended intensive care unit (ICU) stay and increased mortality. The urea-to-creatinine ratio (UCR) has emerged as a promising biomarker for assessing protein catabolism in critical illness, which is currently lacking. This review aims to elucidate the role of UCR in the context of critical illness.

Methods

This scoping review adhered to the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on the 3rd of September 2024, across Embase, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library to identify studies related to (1) critically ill adult patients and (2) reporting at least a single UCR value. A meta-analysis was conducted for ≥ 5 studies with identical outcome parameters.

Results

Out of 1,450 studies retrieved, 47 were included in this review, focusing on UCR's relation to protein catabolism and persistent critical illness (10 studies), mortality (16 studies), dietary protein interventions (2 studies), and other outcomes (19 studies), such as delirium, and neurological and cardiac adverse events. UCR is inversely correlated to muscle cross-sectional area over time and associated to length of ICU stay, emphasising its potential role in identifying patients with ongoing protein catabolism. A UCR (BUN-to-creatinine in mg/dL) of ≥ 20 (equivalent to a urea-to-creatinine in mmol/L of approximately 80) upon ICU admission, in comparison with a value < 20, was associated with a relative risk of 1.60 (95% CI 1.27–2.00) and an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.29 (95% CI 0.89–1.86) for in-hospital mortality.

Discussion

UCR elevations during critical illness potentially indicate muscle protein catabolism and the progression to persistent critical illness, and high levels at ICU admission could be associated with mortality. UCR increments during ICU stay may also indicate excessive exogenous dietary protein intake, overwhelming the body's ability to use it for whole-body or muscle protein synthesis. Dehydration, gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney and liver dysfunction, and renal replacement therapy may also influence UCR and are considered potential pitfalls when assessing catabolic phases of critical illness by UCR. Patient group-specific cut-off values are warranted to ensure its validity and application in clinical practice.

UCR and ICU admission

In addition to the UCR-related observations during ICU stay and post-ICU recovery, several studies have assessed the predictive value of UCR to become admitted to the ICU. A retrospective study demonstrated that UCR exhibits moderate predictive performance for the likelihood of ICU admission in emergency department patients (n = 914), with an AUC of 0.61 [95% CI: 0.58–0.64] and an optimal predictive value of 23.64. A tendency for UCR to predict the likelihood of ICU admission by 6% for each 5-unit UCR increase was observed (HR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.99–1.12, p = 0.085). Furthermore, a single-centre, retrospective case–control study among 95 adult COVID-19 patients also demonstrated that UCR was an independent predictor of admission to an ICU (Odds Ratio = 1.72, 95% CI 1.20–2.66). However, this was not applicable to hospitalised patients with chronic kidney disease. Additionally, UCR has been linked to disease severity, as demonstrated by a retrospective Indian study of hospitalised COVID-19 patients (n = 996), which found higher UCR levels in severe cases compared with mild cases (clinical severity classified according to peripheral oxygen saturation; AUC 0.62, 95% CI 0.56–0.67, optimal cut-off 14.5).

UCR and mortality in critically Ill patients

Seventeen studies have examined the association between UCR and mortality (see Table 2). Forest plots were generated to summarise the association between UCR and in-hospital mortality across studies included in the meta-analysis (Figs. 1 and 2). The forest plots for unadjusted relative risks (RR) exhibited higher in-hospital mortality in the higher UCR group (RR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.03). However, this trend diminished with adjusted hazard ratios (HR), where UCR was incorporated in multivariable Cox regression models (adjusted HR = 1.25, 95% CI: 0.77, 2.01). Additionally, several studies have indicated that the relationship between UCR and in-hospital mortality may not be linear. Both low and high UCR have been observed to be associated with an elevated risk of in-hospital mortality, indicating a U-shaped association.

The degree of heterogeneity was evaluated using the I² statistic.

This figure illustrated adjusted hazard ratios based on multivariable Cox regression models. Covariates adjusted for in the multivariable models are presented in Table 2

Furthermore, an association between UCR and long-term all-cause mortality is described in two studies. A high UCR (≥ 20.4) on hospital admission in cardiac ICU patients (n = 557) was associated with an increased likelihood of long-term mortality (HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.16–2.80, p = 0.009) in a retrospective analysis. A single-centre retrospective study also demonstrated that an elevated UCR at ICU admission was associated with an increased mortality risk within one year after ICU admission in 2098 patients that survived until at least the 10 th day of ICU and did not require renal replacement therapy (RRT). This association was observed consistently across increasing quintiles, with progressively lower survival rates.

Summary of included articles assessing the relation between UCR and protein intake in critically Ill patients

Overview of studies that have examined the effect of a protein intervention on UCR (urea-to-creatinine ratio) responses during critical illness. The table focuses on UCR and the most important inclusion and exclusion criteria; other possible study outcomes unrelated to UCR are not described. The table reports whether the studies used blood urea nitrogen to creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratios or urea-to-creatinine ratios, both of which are encompassed under the term UCR. Furthermore, in the event of a reported value, the unit of measurement utilised in the UCR is explicitly stated (mg/dL: mg/dL or mmol/L:mmol/L). For details regarding unit conversion, see Fig. 4. F female, HR hazard ratio, ICU intensive care unit, M male, RCT randomized controlled trial, REDOXS trial REducing deaths due to oxidative stress trial, Urea/Cr/UCR urea-to-creatinine ratio

In this review, the term UCR is used to refer to both the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)-to-creatinine ratio and the urea-to-creatinine ratio due to both measurements being reported as UCR in the studies under review. If values are referenced in the review, they pertain to the BUN-to-creatinine ratio in mg/dL:mg/dL, unless otherwise indicated. In instances where five or more studies employed the same outcome measure and sufficient event data were available to calculate risk ratios, post-hoc meta-analyses were conducted with a random effects model using R Studio version 2023.06.1 and R version 4.4.1 and presented in forest plots. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I 2 measure, and a P -value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The established cut-off values for UCR were maintained, as presented in the original studies, with the UCR cut-off value illustrated in the meta-analysis. In cases where multiple cut-off values were reported, the one most consistent with the other studies was used.

### Reconsidering the urea-to-creatinine ratio as a signal of muscle catabolism in patients with cirrhosis [^115RV5Q8]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Impact of cirrhosis on the interpretation of the urea-to-creatinine ratio (UCR). A In patients without cirrhosis, ammonia generated in the gut is efficiently converted to urea via the hepatic urea cycle and excreted by the kidneys, while creatinine production remains stable. Under these conditions, the UCR has been proposed as a helpful index of protein catabolism in critically ill patients [1]. B In patients with cirrhosis, both components of the UCR are altered by disease-specific mechanisms. On the creatinine side, sarcopenia and reduced hepatic creatine synthesis lower creatinine generation, while increased tubular secretion and analytical underestimation in hyperbilirubinemia further decrease measured levels. On the urea side, hepatocellular dysfunction and portosystemic shunting impair ureagenesis, resulting in lower plasma urea levels and increased systemic ammonia; the ammonia-to-urea ratio reflects this reduced cycle efficiency. Gastrointestinal bleeding delivers an exogenous nitrogen load that increases urea independently of proteolysis. Renal dysfunction, particularly hepatorenal syndrome, further increases creatinine levels. The combined effect is that both the numerator (urea) and the denominator (creatinine) are altered by processes unrelated to muscle catabolism, resulting in UCR values that may misrepresent metabolic state in patients with cirrhosis.

### Diagnostic value of the urea-to-creatinine ratio for gastrointestinal bleeding source: influence of renal function [^117QkxCE]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common cause of hospital admissions, accounting for approximately 1–2% of cases and ranking among the top ten causes of urgent GI-related admissions in developed countries. Clinical presentation varies depending on the bleeding's severity and location: upper GI bleeding typically manifests as melena or hematemesis, while lower GI bleeding often presents with hematochezia. However, overlap in symptoms is frequent. Importantly, upper GI bleeding is often more severe and associated with hemodynamic instability. Still, lower GI bleeding can also be life-threatening, particularly in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. History-taking, physical examination, and assessment of vital signs, as well as laboratory testing form the cornerstone of the diagnostic workup of suspected GI bleeding. Severity and extent of bleeding depend on various factors, including coagulation status, blood count, renal function, and volume status, and determine the necessity for transfusion of blood and coagulation products. In fact, differentiation of upper and lower GI bleeding is clinically relevant since the outcome differs significantly. While endoscopy remains the gold standard for localizing bleeding, it is not always immediately available. As a potential aid, the urea-to-creatinine ratio (UCR) has been proposed, with higher values suggesting upper GI bleeding. This may result from an increased digestion of hemoglobin in the upper GI tract and/or accumulation of urea resulting from renal hypoperfusion. It remains unclear, however, whether UCR is also applicable in patients with impaired kidney function. We therefore aimed to assess the effect of AKI and/or CKD on the UCR and its impact on predicting the localization of GI bleeding. This may be particularly of interest in severe renal hypoperfusion due to GI bleeding, which can in turn lead to prerenal AKI. An increase in UCR might occur independently of the location of the GI bleeding, solely due to increased urea reabsorption in the kidney.

### EGFR / eGFRratio [^112eaH4f]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Low-GFR cys /GFR cr is now recognized as an independent risk factor for long-term mortality in various populations and clinical settings and most of the authors acknowledge the lack of information on other renal biomarkers associated with low-GFR cys /GFR cr. We measured albuminuria as a marker of structural damage to the glomerulus, urinary NGAL indicating proximal tubular damage, where it should normally be reabsorbed, and serum urea, calculating the serum urea/creatinine ratio. In prerenal injury urea increases disproportionately to creatinine due to increased proximal tubular re-absorption. Neither albuminuria nor urinary NGAL were significantly higher in patients with low-GFR cys /GFR cr excluding glomerular and proximal tubular damage as underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. In addition, proximal tubular function in these patients was not impaired as shown by an increase in the urea and urea/creatinine ratio in the group. Increased urea/creatinine ratio could predict overestimation of creatinine-based eGFR. Overestimation is defined by relatively higher eGFR creatinine than eGFR cystatinC, which, in fact, is similar with a definition of low-GFR cys /GFR cr, suggesting overlap of two entities and might be one of the errors, when making diagnosis of SPS.

To evaluate urea/creatinine ratio, we must analyze possible mechanisms that could increase serum urea levels.

Higher catabolism in patients with low-GFR cys /GFR cr in association with comorbidities and higher mortality in the group.
Low-GFR cys /GFR cr patients might represent those with imminent prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI), as shown by signs of increased urea re-absorption and elevated serum cystatin C (an early indicator of renal endothelial damage) despite low serum creatinine.
Possible gastrointestinal bleeding, commonly observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients, could contribute to increased serum urea levels, although no significant difference in hematocrit levels was observed between low and high GFR cys /GFR cr groups.
Variations in tubular reabsorption phenotypes might partially explain differences in urea levels. However, given the significant increase in cystatin C (not reabsorbed or secreted in the renal tubule) in low-GFR cys /GFR cr patients, other mechanisms likely influence the changes in ratios. Future studies should explore the role of urinary cystatin C and other molecules (electrolytes, glucose, urea, and bicarbonates) normally reabsorbed in proximal tubules to better understand the role of tubular reabsorption in low-GFR cys /GFR cr and SPS.

Cross-sectional analyses in SKIPOGH 1 participants stratified by eGFR-EPI

According to the KDIGO classification, 34% of the SKIPOGH participants (N = 361) had an eGFR-EPI below 90 mL/min × 1.73 m². Table 4 shows the comparison between two subgroups of participants stratified according to their "CKD" status defined by this threshold (Supplementary data, Sheets S2 and S3). Those with a reduced renal function ("LOW participants") had a mean eGFR of 82 mL/min vs 113 mL/min for those with normal kidney function ("NORM participants"). LOW participants were significantly older, heavier, were more frequently diabetic and had a slightly higher plasma osmolarity than NORM participants. The plasma concentrations of urea, Na, K, uric acid and creatinine in LOW participants were higher than in NORM participants and plasma copeptin was also modestly higher. LOW participants had similar 24-h urine volume and osmolarity to NORM participants; however, they excreted about 10% less of all solutes except for potassium excretion that did not differ between the two subgroups. The U/P ratios for urea, Na, uric acid and creatinine were significantly lower in LOW participants than in NORM participants (and almost significantly lower for osmolarity). Of note, the U/P ratio was lower by 24% for urea, by only 7% for sodium, and was exactly the same in both subgroups for potassium.

### The urine-to-plasma urea concentration ratio is associated with eGFR and eGFR decline over time in a population cohort [^1176nJam]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Evaluation of renal function and factors associated with its decline are important public health issues given the high prevalence of silent chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the general population. Renal function is mainly evaluated by glomerular markers such as plasma creatinine or cystatin C concentrations to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and by the urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE) or albumin over creatinine ratio (ACR). Markers of tubular functions are not commonly evaluated in current clinical practice despite their association with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality as well as rapid eGFR decline.

The kidney's ability to concentrate urine is an important function that allows excretion of our daily load of urinary solutes with a significant water economy. Urea is the most abundant solute in the urine and is known to have a crucial role in the overall ability to concentrate urine. However, not often mentioned is the fact that most of the concentrating activity of the kidney is devoted to the concentration of urea itself.

### Blood urea nitrogen levels to verify estimated glomerular filtration rate, as derived from 2 commonly used equations [^115xgGfx]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) of 20 or greater indicates various physiological conditions. Whether glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimates obtained using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) study equations are affected by a high BCR remains unknown.

Methods

Patients who underwent urine creatinine clearance (CrCl) and serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine assessments on the same day were enrolled in our study. Those with BCR of 20 or greater and less than 20 were categorized into high- and low-BCR groups. The concordance on diagnosing chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages by using urine CrCl level and serum GFR estimates was assessed.

Results

More disagreement in CKD stage diagnosis was observed in the high-BCR group (weighted κ = 0.600 and 0.541 for the MDRD and CKD-EPI study equations, respectively) than in the low-BCR group (weighted κ = 0.816 and 0.758, respectively).

Conclusions

A BCR of 20 or greater caused misestimation of the CKD stage. GFR estimates for patients with high BCR should be interpreted cautiously.

### The urine-to-plasma urea concentration ratio is associated with eGFR and eGFR decline over time in a population cohort [^117RzS6d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Cross-sectional analyses

This study reveals that the baseline U/P urea ratio was strongly and positively associated with eGFR. No such relationship was observed with the ratio for osmolarity, sodium or potassium, but a positive association was also observed with the U/P ratio of uric acid, another nitrogenous end product, although of much weaker statistical significance. Strong positive correlations of U/P urea and GFR have already been observed in previous studies, but the U/P ratios of osmolarity or other electrolytes had not been evaluated.

In LOW participants (eGFR-EPI < 90 mL/min × 1.73 m 2), both eGFR and eGFR-EPI were positively associated with U/P urea and with U/P uric acid, whereas no association was observed in participants with normal renal function. Interestingly, in LOW participants, the U/P urea ratio was significantly reduced, while the U/P osmolarity ratio was within the normal range. The whole distribution curve of U/P urea in LOW participants was shifted down compared with that of NORM participants. This suggests that early CKD exhibits a "urea-specific" urinary concentrating defect, as already observed in patients with ADPKD and in some animal models. This shows that the U/P urea ratio is not a "marker of urine concentration" (as assumed in) because it declines significantly when urine osmolarity (or its U/P ratio) is still within a normal range. The decline in the kidney's ability to concentrate urea appears earlier than the decline in overall urine concentration. The U/P urea ratio is thus an earlier and more sensitive marker of kidney dysfunction.

### Diagnostic value of the urea-to-creatinine ratio for gastrointestinal bleeding source: influence of renal function [^111WJp8D]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study confirms previous findings that a high UCR may be useful in differentiating upper from lower GI bleeding. However, earlier studies often excluded patients with impaired renal function when assessing the diagnostic accuracy and utility of UCR. For instance, Ernst et al. reported an AUROC of 0.73 in their overall cohort, which is comparable to the AUROC of 0.69 we observed in patients with normal renal function. Importantly, our study demonstrates that patients with AKI have a significantly lower AUROC of 0.54 (p < 0.0001), a factor not considered in prior research. Given that a substantial proportion of hospitalized patients present with impaired kidney function, with over 40% of the present cohort diagnosed with AKI, our study filled this gap by systematically evaluating UCR performance across different renal function subgroups. Our findings highlight that while UCR retains some discriminatory value in patients with CKD, its diagnostic accuracy is significantly reduced in those with AKI.

### Diagnostic value of the urea-to-creatinine ratio for gastrointestinal bleeding source: influence of renal function [^115K68oP]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Serum creatinine and urea were both measured in mg/dL (normal range for creatinine 0.67–1.17 mg/dL and for urea 18–55 mg/dL). The UCR was calculated as the ratio of urea to creatinine.

Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism ® (version 10; Boston, MA, United States). The flow chart was created using BioRender (Toronto, Canada). Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and odds ratios (OR) are depicted with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Group differences for dichotomous variables were analyzed using Fisher's Exact Test. Group differences for continuous variables between characteristics were tested for significance using a two-sample t -test. Results were considered statistically significant with a. The effect size was calculated using Cohen's d. UCR cut-off values of ≥ 75 and ≥ 100 were derived from observed distributions in the dataset, rather than formal optimization methods (e.g. Youden index), as they aligned with clinically relevant clustering in upper GI bleeding cases. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess the diagnostic performance of the UCR in distinguishing upper from lower GI bleeding. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) with 95% confidence intervals and corresponding p-values were calculated for each subgroup. Statistical comparisons between ROC curves were performed using the DeLong method.

### Independent prognostic importance of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio in heart failure [^112U38s1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine ratio is associated with worse outcomes in acute heart failure (HF) but little is known about its importance in chronic HF.

Methods and Results

We combined individual patient data from clinical trials (HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]: PARADIGM-HF, ATMOSPHERE and DAPA-HF, and HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]: PARAGON-HF and I-PRESERVE). The primary outcome examined was a composite time to first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death; its components and all-cause death were also examined. Each HF phenotype was categorized according to median BUN/creatinine ratio, generating four groups that is, HFpEF ≤ and > median BUN/creatinine ratio and HFrEF ≤ and > median BUN/creatinine ratio. The association between BUN/creatinine ratio and outcomes was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazard models. Overall, 28820 patients were analysed. The median (IQR) BUN/creatinine ratio was 20.1 (Q1-Q3 16.7–24.7) in HFpEF and 18.7 (15.2–22.8) in HFrEF. In both HFpEF and HFrEF, higher BUN/creatinine ratio was associated with older age, female sex, and diabetes, but similar estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The risk of each outcome examined was significantly higher in patients with BUN/creatinine ratio ≥ median, compared to < median, even after adjustment for other prognostic variables, including N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and eGFR.

Conclusion

Higher BUN/creatinine ratio was associated with worse outcomes in patients with chronic HF across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction, independently of eGFR and NT-proBNP. BUN/creatinine ratio may reflect neurohumoral activation (especially increased arginine vasopressin), altered renal blood flow or other pathophysiologic mechanisms not incorporated in conventional prognostic variables.

### Residual renal function and mortality risk in hemodialysis patients [^114XoJBc]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Residual renal function, defined as the urinary clearance of urea and creatinine, is minimal in many patients treated with hemodialysis (HD) and tends to be ignored in most outcome studies involving HD patients. Recent studies showed that residual renal function, even at a low level, is influential in preventing mortality in the minority of patients with end-stage renal disease treated with peritoneal dialysis. This issue generally has not been examined in patients treated with HD. This prospective observational study of all 114 patients at a single community-based freestanding HD center is designed to examine the impact of residual renal function (defined as renal urea clearance and renal creatinine clearance derived from 24-hour urinary volumes) on mortality over a 2-year period. During that period, 50 deaths occurred in 114 patients. The presence of residual renal function was protective against mortality (odds ratio for death, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.81; P = 0.008), even after adjustment for duration of dialysis treatment, age, smoking, presence of diabetes, presence of cardiovascular disease, serum albumin level, and urea reduction rate. In conclusion, the presence of residual renal function, even at a low level, is associated with a lower mortality risk in HD patients.

### The fallacy of the BUN: creatinine ratio in critically ill patients [^1152Xg4Q]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and is associated with a high mortality rate. Pre-renal azotemia, suggested by a high blood urea nitrogen to serum creatinine (BUN:Cr) ratio (BCR), has traditionally been associated with a better prognosis than other forms of AKI. Whether this pertains to critically ill patients is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational study of two cohorts of critically ill patients admitted to a single center: a derivation cohort, in which AKI was diagnosed, and a larger validation cohort. We analyzed associations between BCR and clinical outcomes: mortality and renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Results

Patients in the derivation cohort (N = 1010) with BCR > 20 were older, predominantly female and white, and more severely ill. A BCR > 20 was significantly associated with increased mortality and a lower likelihood of RRT in all patients, patients with AKI and patients at risk for AKI. Patients in the validation cohort (N = 10228) with a BCR > 20 were older, predominantly female and white, and more severely ill. A BCR > 20 was associated with increased mortality and a lower likelihood of RRT in all patients and in those at risk for AKI, BUN correlated with age and severity of illness.

Conclusions

A BCR > 20 is associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients. It is also associated with a lower likelihood of RRT, perhaps because of misinterpretation of the BCR. Clinicians should not use a BCR > 20 to classify AKI in critically ill patients.

### A low BUN / creatinine ratio predicts histologically confirmed acute interstitial nephritis [^112kJxys]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In hospitalized patients with AKI, the presence of BCR ≤ 12 is a robust parameter that suggests the diagnosis of AIN. The BCR is obtained from a basic metabolic panel, and its low cost allows for longitudinal quantification. Additionally, if urinalysis and clinical course are atypical for AIN, a low BCR could provide additional support and allow for the avoidance of kidney biopsy in some patients.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is a clinical calculator used in the field of nephrology and internal medicine. BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen, a waste product generated in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, while Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle metabolism and also excreted by the kidneys.

This ratio is primarily used to differentiate between prerenal and renal causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). A high BUN/Creatinine ratio (> 20:1) is typically suggestive of a prerenal cause such as dehydration or decreased blood flow to the kidneys, while a low ratio (< 10:1) is more indicative of intrinsic renal disease or postrenal obstruction.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is applicable to patients with suspected kidney disease or injury, or those with known renal conditions where monitoring of renal function is necessary. It is also used in the evaluation of patients with altered mental status or suspected metabolic disorders.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the BUN/Creatinine ratio, but it should be interpreted with caution in patients with liver disease, malnutrition, or those on certain medications that can affect BUN or creatinine levels. It is also important to note that this ratio is

### Blood urea nitrogen, blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and incident stroke: the dongfeng-tongji cohort [^114N3R46]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

It remains unclear whether extreme levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and BUN to creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) can increase future risk of stroke. We conducted this study to investigate the associations of BUN and BUN/Cr with incident stroke and its subtypes.

Methods

A total of 26,835 and 26,379 participants with a mean follow-up of 7.9 years were included to investigate the associations of BUN and BUN/Cr with incident stroke, respectively. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident stroke and its subtypes.

Results

Compared with participants in the third quintile of BUN, the adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for participants in the lowest quintile were 1.21 (1.04–1.40), 1.41 (1.18–1.68) and 1.36 (0.97–1.91) for total, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, respectively; while for those in the highest quintile, the corresponding HRs (95% CIs) were 1.16 (1.01–1.32), 1.30 (1.11–1.53), and 1.24 (0.90–1.71). The associations remained robust when restricting the analyses to participants within clinically normal range of BUN. For BUN/Cr, compared with participants in the third quintile, participants in the lowest quintile had significant higher risks of stroke (HRs [95% CIs] were 1.19 [1.04–1.37], 1.26 [1.07–1.48], and 1.22 [0.90–1.67] for total, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke).

Conclusions

Both high and low levels of BUN were associated with higher risks of total and ischemic stroke. Low level of BUN/Cr was associated with excess risks of total and ischemic stroke.

### Association of the urine-to-plasma urea ratio with CKD progression [^114dN8hQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objectives

The urine-to-plasma (U/P) ratio of urea is correlated with urine-concentrating capacity and associated with progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. As a proposed biomarker of tubular function, we hypothesized that the U/P urea ratio would also be associated with progression of more common forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Study Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting & Participants

3,723 adults in the United States with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20–70 mL/min/1.73 m², enrolled in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study.

Exposure

U/P urea ratio, calculated from 24-hour urine collections and plasma samples at baseline.

Outcome

Associations of U/P urea ratio with eGFR slope, initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT), and CKD progression, defined as 50% decline in eGFR or incident KRT.

Analytical Approach

Multivariable linear mixed-effects models tested associations with eGFR slope. Cox proportional hazards models tested associations with dichotomous CKD outcomes.

Results

The median U/P urea ratio was 14.8 (IQR, 9.5–22.2). Compared with participants in the highest U/P urea ratio quintile, those in the lowest quintile had a greater eGFR decline by 1.06 mL/min/1.73 m² per year (P < 0.001) over 7.0 (IQR, 3.0–11.0) years of follow-up observation. Each 1-SD lower natural log-transformed U/P urea ratio was independently associated with CKD progression (HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.12–1.33]) and incident KRT (HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.10–1.33]). Associations differed by baseline eGFR (P interaction = 0.009). Among those with an eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², each 1-SD lower in ln(U/P urea ratio) was independently associated with CKD progression (HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.18–1.45]), but this was not significant among those with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² (HR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.84–1.20]).

Limitations

Possibility of residual confounding. Single baseline 24-hour urine collection for U/P urea ratio.

Conclusions

In a large and diverse cohort of patients with common forms of CKD, U/P urea was independently associated with disease progression and incident kidney failure. Associations were not significant among those with advanced CKD at baseline.

### A low BUN / creatinine ratio predicts histologically confirmed acute interstitial nephritis [^1117isid]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our retrospective study demonstrated that low BCR (BCR < 12) adequately predicts the diagnosis of histological AIN in patients with AKI. The diagnostic utility of low BCR was previously described in obstructive uropathy, in which low BCR correlated with elevated urea in hospitalized patients. Additionally, BCR < 10 identified AIN in Mesoamerican nephropathy. To our knowledge, there has been no other report on the diagnostic performance of BCR in a prospective study involving patients with AKI and AIN.

Creatinine is a product of muscle metabolism. Creatine is broken down into creatinine by a nonenzymatic mechanism. It is filtered in the glomerulus and secreted in the proximal tubule. At steady-state, the daily urinary creatinine that is excreted is equal to that produced, and this quantity is directly related to muscle mass. In contrast, urea is excreted at the same rate as creatinine in the glomerulus but is reabsorbed into the tubules. In the hemodynamic etiologies of AKI (prerenal), the activation by antidiuretic hormone causes preferential urea reabsorption, thus resulting in a BCR > 20. AIN is characterized by tubular dysfunction and an acute decrease in glomerular filtration rate. Edema, interstitial inflammation, and tubulitis are the main histopathological features of AIN. In AIN, the abnormal reabsorption of water and sodium leads to increased urea excretion and decreased reabsorption. The low BCR in patients with AIN can be explained by the combinatorial effects of the changes in urea excretion, filtration, and reabsorption with the reduction in creatinine secretion as the glomerular filtration rate declines.

### The urea-to-creatinine ratio as an emerging biomarker in critical care: a scoping review and meta-analysis [^114DV2at]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Lastly, recognising that the UCR is reported in disparate units is also crucial. In Europe, the urea/creatinine ratio is frequently used, whereas in the United States, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio is commonly reported. Conversion factors are available for calculating BUN, which is approximately one-half (28/60 or 0.446) of blood urea. It is essential to ensure that both BUN or urea and creatinine are reported in the same units to ensure the accuracy of the ratio calculation (Fig. 4). Standardisation in reporting facilitates comparison between studies and provides a uniform approach to assessing patient outcomes and formulating clinical decision-making.

Fig. 4
Conversion factors BUN and urea. The chemical formula of urea is CO(NH₂)₂, with a molecular weight of approximately 60. Each of the two nitrogen molecules has a weight of approximately 14 g/mol. The ratio 60/28 can be expressed as follows: To convert from BUN to urea, one must multiply by 2.14. Similarly, to convert from urea to BUN, one must divide by 2.14. To convert from mg/dL to mmol/L for BUN and urea, the value should be multiplied by the weight in mol and then multiplied by 10 to convert L to dL. For BUN, this is 2 × nitrogen (2 × 14 = 10/28 = 0.357), while for urea it is CO(NH₂)₂ (10/60 = 0.166). Both BUN and urea in mmol/L are molecular weight units and can be converted without the use of a conversion factor. All of these values are approximations and have been rounded for simplicity.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio increased the risk of coronary artery disease in patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111Se2m2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In recent years, owing to the environmental factors such as sedentary lifestyles and changing dietary habits, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has gradually become a global health problem. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) report, the age-standardized prevalence rate of diabetes in 2019 is 8.3%, which is expected to reach 9.6% in 2045. In China, T2DM has imposed a heavy economic burden on patients and society, and the total economic burden of T2DM and its complications reached 247.8 billion RMB in 2007. If patients living with T2DM do not take an active role in effectively controlling and treating their diseases, they are prone to a variety of diabetes-related complications that are responsible for the impaired quality of life, disability, and premature death. CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) is a cardiovascular complication of DM. In a systematic evaluation of 4,549,481 patients living with T2DM, the total incidence of macrovascular complications was 32.2%, and CAD was one of the most common cardiovascular diseases (21.2%).

The dysfunction of kidney not only implicates potential pathological changes of the kidney, but could also influence other organs and systems as a result of the impairments of body homoeostasis. Cardiovascular system is one of the most affected systems upon the impairment of renal function. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), a metabolic product of protein, is susceptible to external factors and is a very sensitive indicator of changes in haemodynamic and renal perfusion. Studies have shown that BUN is strongly associated with mortality in patients with heart failure. Haijing Jiang et.al found that a raised level of BUN might be associated with increased risk of incident CAD in Chinese populations. Serum creatinine (SCr) is mainly determined by the glomerular filtration capacity. Previous meta-analysis has observed that an impaired renal function, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate(eGFR) lower than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, was associated with an increased risk of incident CAD, independently of prevalent hypertension and diabetes. Emanuele Di Angelantonio et.al found that there was a moderate increase in CAD risk associated with very low eGFR in the general population. Furthermore, recently, the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (UCR) has emerged as an independent predictor of adverse clinical outcomes in various population settings, such as acute kidney injury, chronic heart failure, and ischemic stroke. However, epidemiological evidence that related UCR to risk of incident CAD in patients living with T2DM was still limited.

### The urine-to-plasma urea concentration ratio is associated with eGFR and eGFR decline over time in a population cohort [^1134qGh2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The present research extends to the general adult population the relationships reported previously in patients with overt kidney diseases. It suggests, for the first time, that the U/P urea ratio may be used widely as a marker of very early renal dysfunction (eGFR < 90 mL/min × 1.73 m²). However, this urea ratio may no longer be a valid marker in advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min × 1.73 m²).

In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that the U/P urea ratio is a marker of an early decline in renal function. It is more sensitive than the decline in urine osmolarity or the U/P ratio of osmolarity. Unlike other markers, this U/P urea ratio is not based on glomerular functions but reflects transport functions that occur along the renal tubule and collecting duct. This broadens our panel of markers available for evaluating renal function in epidemiological studies. Finally, and importantly, urea is easy to measure in routine facilities, with well-standardized techniques and at a low cost. Thus, the U/P urea ratio has the potential to become a widely used marker for evaluating the risk of renal function decline, even in its earliest phase.

### The ratio of measured to estimated glomerular filtration rate may be a marker of early mortality and dialysis requirement [^114nbj4C]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

It has been suggested that, in patients with CKD stage 5, measured GFR (mGFR), defined as the mean of urea and creatinine clearance, as measured by a 24-h urine collection, is a better measure of renal function than estimated GFR (eGFR), based on the CKD-EPI formula. This could be due to reduced muscle mass in this group. Its use is recommended in the ERBP guidelines. Unplanned dialysis initiation (DI) is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and reduced modality choice and is generally considered undesirable. We hypothesized that the ratio mGFR/eGFR (M/E) aids prediction of death and DI.

Methods

All 24-h measurements of urea and creatinine excretion were extracted from the clinical biochemistry databases in Zealand. Data concerning renal diagnosis, comorbidity, biochemistry, medical treatment, mortality and date of DI, were extracted from patient notes, the National Patient Registry and the Danish Nephrology Registry. Patients were included if their eGFR was < 30ml/min/1.73m 2. The last available value for each patient was included. Follow-up was 12months.

Results

One thousand two hundred sixty-five patients were included. M/E was median 0.91 ± 0.43. It was highly correlated to previous determinations. It was negatively correlated to eGFR, comorbidity, high age and female sex. It was positively related to albumin and negatively to C-reactive protein. M/E was higher in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and diuretics but no other treatment groups. On a multivariate analysis, M/E was negatively correlated with mortality and combined mortality/DI, but not DI. A post hoc analysis showed a negative correlation to DI at 3 months. For patients with an eGFR 10–15ml/min/1.73 m², combined mortality and DI at 3 months was for low M/E (< 0.75) 36%, medium (0.75–1.25) 20%, high (> 1.25) 8%. A low M/E predicted increased need for unplanned DI. A supplementary analysis in 519 patients where body surface area values were available, allowing BSA-corrected M/E to be analyzed, revealed similar results.

Conclusion

A low mGFR/eGFR ratio is associated with comorbidity, malnutrition, and inflammation. It is a marker of early DI, mortality, and unplanned dialysis initiation, independently of eGFR, age and comorbidity. Particular attention paid to patients with a low M/E may lower the incidence of unplanned dialysis requirement.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^111JuxEs]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study is the largest concerning the diagnostic performance of BCR for differentiating prerenal from intrinsic AKI. It is the first to specifically investigate BCR in an unselected population of patients admitted to the Emergency Department. We have found that BCR had no overall discriminative capacity in this setting, no matter what threshold of BCR is chosen.

Even though the rationale underlying the use of BCR is seducing, our results show that it simply doesn't work in the real world. Indeed, many factors are known to modify BCR independently of effective circulating volume. Gastro intestinal bleeding, a high protein diet, the catabolic effects of fever, trauma, infection, thyrotoxicosis, drugs such as tetracycline or corticosteroids, all increase protein turnover resulting in increased hepatic production of urea and increase BCR. Conversely, in osmotic diuresis and with the use of acetazolamide, proximal tubular reabsorption of salt and water is impaired leading to an increase in excreted urea and a decrease in BCR even in states of hypovolemia. BCR also decreases in patients with liver failure or protein malnutrition due to lower levels of BUN. One can also speculate that AKI is probably due to functional and intrinsic disease coexisting in different proportions, in a given patient at a given time. Indeed, it is assumed that a continuum exists which leads from prerenal to intrinsic AKI, the proportion of each changing over time. It can then easily be assumed that BCR would only be reliable if the underlying disease was 100% prerenal or 100% intrinsic, which is probably rarely the case.

We chose a "cut off creatinine" for inclusion of patients at 133 μmol/L. The reason for this was twofold: 1/ This threshold is recognized as the highest creatinine level one can have with a normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ie 75 mL/min per 1.73 m². Indeed, a young (20–29 years old) black male with a creatinine of 133 μmol/L would have a normal GFR. However, all creatinine levels above 133 μmol/L are associated with altered GFRs. By including only patients with creatinine levels greater than 133 μmol/L we were sure to only include patients with renal failure. 2/ If we had included all 26,229 patients with a measured creatinine, we would have selected many healthy individuals admitted to hospital for the first time. Many patients would have met our exclusion criteria because of a short hospital stay (< 48 h) and or no baseline creatinine.

### The ratio of measured to estimated glomerular filtration rate may be a marker of early mortality and dialysis requirement [^111cwWdr]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Exogenous clearance, as measured by radioactive isotopes, iohexol or iothalamate, is the gold standard of measuring GFR. These methods are cumbersome and expensive, and have generally been replaced in clinical practice by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation for estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR). This is based on age, sex, p-creatinine and race. The accuracy of the equation is low (confidence interval ± 30%). In recent years, the use of the equation in patients with CKD stage 5 (CKD5) (eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73m 2) has been questioned. Firstly, the equation is inaccurate when compared to gold standard measurements, overestimating GFR by 1–3 ml/min/1.73 m² with a confidence interval of ± 10 ml/min/1.73 m². Secondly, a number of large epidemiological studies have showed a paradoxical inverse relationship between eGFR at dialysis initiation (DI) and subsequent survival: the higher the eGFR, the higher the mortality. There are two possible explanations.
Patients with high comorbidity start dialysis earlier, due to non-specific symptoms ascribed to uraemia. In particular, patients with heart failure or diabetes will have difficulty controlling fluid balance. Patients with a low p-albumin caused by chronic disease and inflammation may erroneously be assumed to be malnourished. Lasalle et al. found early starters to be older, with more cardiac disease, diabetes and malnutrition. Others report similar findings. However, correction for comorbidity fails to completely remove the association.
CKD5 is characterized by a reduction in muscle mass and protein intake, with a consequent reduction in creatinine production. This will result in a misleading increase in eGFR. Thus, while creatinine clearance is greater than eGFR among well-nourished CKD5 patients, it is lower if the patient is malnourished. Urine-based measurements would a priori be expected to solve this problem. Urea excretion is a marker of protein intake, while creatinine excretion is a marker of muscular mass and overall nutritional status. Creatinine clearance is higher than true GFR due to tubular secretion, while urea clearance is lower due to tubular absorption. The measured GFR (mGFR), defined as the average of urea and creatinine clearance based on a 24-h urine collection, has been validated. For CKD3 & 4 patients, the mGFR underestimates true GFR by 10%. After correction for this, the equation is as accurate as eGFR. Grootenhorst et al. found that eGFR, but not mGFR, was negatively correlated to muscle mass. If mGFR was used instead of eGFR, the paradoxical association to mortality disappeared. The same result was seen in another study, where creatinine clearance was used to measure renal function. In the absence of exogenous clearance studies, mGFR seems therefore preferable to eGFR in patients with CKD5. For this reason, the European Renal Best Practice guidelines recommend mGFR as the preferred method of GFR estimation in CKD5.

### Association of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and long-term outcome among women with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: filling gaps in female [^117Tghi9]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have established an association between the BUN/Cr ratio and adverse outcomes in various cardiovascular conditions. Specifically, a higher admission BUN/Cr ratio predicts increased in-hospital mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, even after multivariable adjustment, and elevated ratios are independently associated with higher long-term all-cause mortality in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients. In contrast, our study identifies the BUN/Cr ratio as a valuable prognostic marker in female patients undergoing CABG, where a higher ratio is associated with reduced mortality. This apparent contradiction likely stems from divergent pathophysiological mechanisms reflected by the BUN/Cr ratio across different cardiovascular states. In female CABG patients, an elevated ratio primarily signifies effective perioperative volume management (achieved through active diuresis and fluid restriction), resulting in relative volume deficit. This contrasts with AMI and ADHF, where a high ratio typically indicates pathological renal hypoperfusion secondary to severe cardiac dysfunction.

We utilized RCS functions to analyze the dose-response relationship regarding long-term outcomes. Our findings reveal an L-shaped association between BUN/Cr levels and HRs for all-cause mortality (Turning point 17.308), when it is below the turning point (< 17.308), the low ratio reflects volume overload or renal tubular dysfunction (such as insufficient diuresis, chronic kidney disease), leading to increased cardiac burden, pulmonary edema, and increased risk of kidney injury. This may be due to surgical stress or postoperative pulmonary edema and kidney injury, which significantly increases the risk of death (HR 0.814, with an increase of 18.6% for every 1 unit decrease in risk); When the ratio is higher than the inflection point (≥ 17.308), the increase in the ratio is mainly due to successful volume management (strict fluid limitation and diuresis to achieve mild dehydration), avoiding damage to the heart caused by volume overload, and patients with good renal tubular function can tolerate this state, putting the risk of death into a safe plateau period (HR 0.985 showed no significant change), until the ratio is extremely high before it may turn harmful. The inflection point value of 17.308 has therefore become a key target for postoperative volume control. These results highlight the critical importance of managing BUN/Cr levels in the clinical care of female CABG patients.

### EGFR / eGFRratio [^113B59M4]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Since cystatin C is known as an early indicator of kidney injury, in further statistical analysis we excluded patients who developed AKI, thus limiting possible impact of AKI in low-GFR cys /GFR cr (Table 3). As before, low-GFR cys /GFR cr was calculated at the expense of significantly lower eGFR cystatinC (p < 0.001), with urea and urea/creatinine ratio remaining higher also in this group (p = 0.039 and p = 0.019, respectively).

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^1178DFgo]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

The decision to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and the optimal timing for commencement is a difficult decision faced by clinicians when treating acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care setting. Without clinically significant ureamic symptoms or emergent indications (electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload) the timing of RRT initiation remains contentious and inconsistent across health providers. Current trends of initiating RRT in the ICU are often based on isolated blood urea levels without clear guidelines demonstrating an upper limit for treatment. Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

### The urine-to-plasma urea concentration ratio is associated with eGFR and eGFR decline over time in a population cohort [^11568kZ3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Evaluation of factors associated with impaired renal function and its decline over time are important public health issues.
Most markers of chronic kidney disease progression studied presently [e.g. estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin excretion] are related to glomerular functions.
Markers of tubular functions are not commonly evaluated despite their association with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality as well as rapid eGFR decline.

This study adds:

This study proposes a novel marker that is based on the ability of the kidney to concentrate urea (the most abundant urinary solute) in the urine with respect to its concentration in plasma: the urine-to-plasma urea concentration ratio (U/P urea ratio). The U/P urea ratio is not representative of glomerular functions. It reflects transport functions that occur along the renal tubule and collecting duct.
The present epidemiology study concerns a general population cohort. In cross-sectional analyses, the study shows that the U/P urea ratio is strongly and positively associated with eGFR after multiple adjustments including copeptin, blood pressure, 24-h urinary albumin and urea excretions. This relationship is specific to urea because it is not observed with the ratios of the two other main urinary solutes, sodium and potassium.
In longitudinal analyses, the U/P urea ratio at baseline was significantly associated with the eGFR decline over a 3-year interval after appropriate adjustments. The lower the initial U/P urea ratio, the larger the eGFR decline, even after multiple adjustments including copeptin, blood pressure, 24-h urinary albumin and urea excretions.

Potential impact:

The U/P urea ratio adds an important marker for evaluating kidney disease and its progression, a marker of tubular functions, thus broadening the tools presently used that mostly address glomerular functions.
This marker brings useful information not only in people who are already known to have a chronic kidney disease but also even in a general population.
This marker is widely accessible at low cost because urea is easily measured in routine laboratories.

### Elevated urea-to-creatinine ratio provides a biochemical signature of muscle catabolism and persistent critical illness after major trauma [^115mpgnb]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Muscle wasting is common amongst patients with persistent critical illness and associated with increased urea production, but reduced creatinine production. We hypothesised that elevated urea:creatinine ratio would provide a biochemical signature of muscle catabolism and characterise prolonged intensive care (ICU) admissions after major trauma.

Methods

Using pre-specified hypotheses, we analysed two existing data sets of adults surviving ≥ 10 days following admission to ICU after major trauma. We analysed trauma-ICU admissions to the major trauma centre serving the North East London and Essex Trauma Network, with a verification cohort of trauma-ICU cases from the MIMIC-III database. We compared serum urea, creatinine, and urea:creatinine ratio (ratio of concentrations in mmol/L) between patients with persistent critical illness (defined as ICU stay of ≥ 10 days) and those discharged from ICU before day 10. In a sub-group undergoing sequential abdominal computerised tomography (CT), we measured change in cross-sectional muscle area (psoas muscle at L4 vertebral level and total muscle at L3 level) and assessed for relationships with urea:creatinine ratio and ICU stay. Results are provided as median [interquartile range].

Results

We included 1173 patients between February 1st, 2012 and May 1st, 2016. In patients with ICU stay ≥ 10 days, day 10 urea:creatinine ratio had increased by 133% [72–215], from 62 [46–78] to 141 [114–178], p < 0.001; this rise was larger (p < 0.001) than in patients discharged from ICU before day 10, 59% [11–122%], 61 [45–75] to 97 [67–128], p < 0.001. A similar separation in trajectory of urea:creatinine ratio was observed in 2876 trauma-ICU admissions from MIMIC-III. In 107 patients undergoing serial CTs, decrease in L4 psoas and L3 muscle cross-sectional areas between CTs significantly correlated with time elapsed (R² = 0.64 and R² = 0.59, respectively). Rate of muscle decrease was significantly greater (p < 0.001 for interaction terms) in 53/107 patients with the second CT during evolving, current or recent persistent critical illness. In this group, at the second CT urea:creatinine ratio negatively correlated with L4 psoas and L3 muscle cross-sectional areas (R² 0.39, p < 0.001 and 0.44, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Elevated urea:creatinine ratio accompanies skeletal muscle wasting representing a biochemical signature of persistent critical illness after major trauma. If prospectively confirmed, urea:creatinine ratio is a potential surrogate of catabolism to examine in epidemiological and interventional studies.

### Effect of intermittent or continuous feeding and amino acid concentration on urea-to-creatinine ratio in critical illness [^116Kpaoc]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We sought to determine whether peaks in essential amino acid (EAA) concentration associated with intermittent feeding may provide anabolic advantages when compared with continuous feeding regimens in critical care.

Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of data from a multicenter trial of UK intensive care patients randomly assigned to intermittent or continuous feeding. A linear mixed-effects model was developed to assess differences in urea-creatinine ratio (raised values of which can be a marker of muscle wasting) between arms. To investigate metabolic phenotypes, we performed k-means urea-to-creatinine ratio trajectory clustering. Amino acid concentrations were also modeled against urea-to-creatinine ratio from day 1 to day 7. The main outcome measure was serum urea-to-creatinine ratio (millimole per millimole) from day 0 to the end of the 10-day study period.

Results

Urea-to-creatinine ratio trajectory differed between feeding regimens (coefficient -.245; p = 0.002). Patients receiving intermittent feeding demonstrated a flatter urea-to-creatinine ratio trajectory. With k-means analysis, the cluster with the largest proportion of continuously fed patients demonstrated the steepest rise in urea-to-creatinine ratio. Neither protein intake per se nor serum concentrations of EAA concentrations were correlated with urea-to-creatinine ratio (coefficient = .088 [P = 0.506] and coefficient < .001 [P = 0.122], respectively).

Conclusion

Intermittent feeding can mitigate the rise in urea-to-creatinine ratio otherwise seen in those continuously fed, suggesting that catabolism may have been, to some degree, prevented.

### Effect of increased enteral protein intake on plasma and urinary urea concentrations in preterm infants born at… [^116kvr7G]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Feeding breast milk is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality, as well as improved neurodevelopmental outcome but does not meet the high nutritional requirements of preterm infants. Both plasma and urinary urea concentrations represent amino acid oxidation and low concentrations may indicate insufficient protein supply.

This study assesses the effect of different levels of enteral protein on plasma and urinary urea concentrations and determines if the urinary urea-creatinine ratio provides reliable information about the protein status of preterm infants.

Methods

Sixty preterm infants (birthweight < 1500 g; gestational age < 32 weeks) were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial and assigned to either a lower-protein group (median protein intake 3.7 g/kg/d) or a higher-protein group (median protein intake 4,3 g/kg/d). Half the patients in the higher-protein group received standardized supplementation with a supplement adding 1.8 g protein/100 mL milk, the other half received individual supplementation depending on the respective mother's milk macronutrient content. Plasma urea concentration was determined in two scheduled blood samples (BS1; BS2); urinary urea and creatinine concentrations in weekly spot urine samples.

Results

The higher-protein group showed higher plasma urea concentrations in both BS1 and BS2 and a higher urinary urea-creatinine-ratio in week 3 and 5–7 compared to the lower-protein group. In addition, a highly positive correlation between plasma urea concentrations and the urinary urea-creatinine-ratio (p < 0.0001) and between actual protein intake and plasma urea concentrations and the urinary urea-creatinine-ratio (both p < 0.0001) was shown.

Conclusions

The urinary urea-creatinine-ratio, just like plasma urea concentrations, may help to estimate actual protein supply, absorption and oxidation in preterm infants and, additionally, can be determined non-invasively. Further investigations are needed to determine reliable cut-off values of urinary urea concentrations to ensure appropriate protein intake.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^112ZrupL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy (CPG 2.3) — urea as a marker is justified because isolated solute levels can mislead, whereas urea clearance from concentration ratios sensitively reflects small‑solute diffusion, making urea Kt/V a sensitive measure of overall dialysis dose. Specifically, "measurement of isolated solute levels can be misleading if the solute measured is not representative of all uremic toxins", "Urea clearance determined from a ratio of concentrations, rather than from an absolute value, is a sensitive marker of small-solute diffusion across the dialyzer", and "urea Kt/V is a sensitive measure of the overall dialysis dose".

### Guanidinoacetate and creatine / creatinine levels in controls and patients with urea cycle defects [^1139JVpY]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

We established an analytical methodology for guanidinoacetate and creatine determination by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with the use of stable isotopes as internal standards. The method showed good precision and high sensitivity, and it requires minimal sample handling. We determined the reference values in urine and plasma. In urine both guanidinoacetate concentration and creatine/creatinine ratio decrease as age increases, but no significant differences were found in plasma. In addition, 15 patients with urea cycle defects were analysed and showed low guanidinoacetate concentrations when compared with age-matched controls. We concluded that guanidinoacetate concentration is a parameter to be considered in the follow-up of patients with urea cycle defects, and arginine should be supplemented in sufficient amounts, as the brain seems to be impermeable to creatine influx, but not to its precursor, arginine, which is needed for creatine, protein, and NO synthesis.

### Methylamine clearance by haemodialysis is low [^1131AjEg]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Dialysis adequacy is currently judged by measures of urea clearance. However, urea is relatively non-toxic and has properties distinct from large classes of other retained solutes. In particular, intracellularly sequestered solutes are likely to behave differently than urea.

Methods

We studied an example of this class, the aliphatic amine monomethylamine (MMA), in stable haemodialysis outpatients (n = 10) using an HPLC-based assay.

Results

Mean MMA levels pre-dialysis in end-stage renal disease subjects were 76 ± 15 microg/L compared to 32 ± 4 microg/L in normal subjects (n = 10) (P < 0.001). Mean urea reduction was 62% while the reduction ratio for MMA was 43% (P < 0.01). MMA levels rebounded in the 1 hour post-dialytic period to 85% of baseline, whereas urea levels rebounded only to 47% of baseline. MMA had a much larger calculated volume of distribution compared to urea, consistent with intracellular sequestration. Measures of intra-red blood cell (RBC) MMA concentrations confirmed greater levels in RBCs than in plasma with a ratio of 4.9:1. Because of the intracellular sequestration of MMA, we calculated its clearance using that amount removed from whole blood. Clearances for urea averaged 222 ± 41 ml/min and for MMA 121 ± 14 ml/min, while plasma clearance for creatinine was 162 ± 20 ml/min (P < 0.01, for all differences). Using in vitro dialysis, in the absence of RBCs, solute clearance rates were similar: 333 ± 6, 313 ± 8 and 326 ± 4 ml/min for urea, creatinine and MMA, respectively. These findings suggest that the lower MMA clearance relative to creatinine in vivo is a result of MMA movement into RBCs within the dialyser blood path diminishing its removal by dialysis.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we find that, in conventional haemodialysis, MMA is not cleared as efficiently as urea or creatinine and raise the possibility that RBCs may limit its dialysis not merely by failing to discharge it, but by further sequestering it as blood passes through the dialyser.

### The urea-to-creatinine ratio is predictive of worsening kidney function in ambulatory heart failure patients [^117YHNre]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Changes in kidney function in heart failure patients convey important prognostic information. We investigated the association of the urea-to-creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratio, the fractional excretion of urea (FeUr), and the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) and subsequent declines in kidney function in ambulatory heart failure patients.

Methods and Results

We prospectively enrolled adult patients with ejection fraction < 40% at a multidisciplinary heart failure clinic and measured serial measurements of laboratory values from September 2008 to July 2011. The study outcome was changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In 138 patients contributing 10,350 patient-hours of follow-up, we found that participants with a decline of > 25% in eGFR had higher mean BUN/Cr ratio (0.110 ± 0.043 vs 0.086 ± 0.026; p = 0.02) and no difference in the FeNa (1.81 vs 1.43; p = 0.2) or FeUr (32.3 vs 37.2; p = 0.9) compared with those with no change. There was an association of BUN/Cr ratio with the rate of change of eGFR (coefficient -25.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] -10.99 to -40.35; P < .0001). The BUN/Cr ratio was an independent predictor of eGFR drop > 25% (odds ratio 1.19, 95% CI 1.07–1.32) and improved model discrimination (c-statistic increased from 0.624 to 0.693) and reclassification (net reclassification index 11.38% [P < .0001], integrated discrimination improvement 5.24% [P = 0.02]).

Conclusions

The BUN/Cr ratio is associated with worsening kidney function and adds incremental risk prediction information relative to traditional predictive measures in outpatients with heart failure at risk for worsening kidney disease.

Other clinically important markers were compared between the groups of low and high-GFRcys/GFRcr (Table 2). Our data shows no difference in serum creatinine and eGFR creatinine values (p = 0.713 and p = 0.485, respectively), in contrast to strong association with cystatin C and eGFR cystatinC values (p < 0.001) in both groups, indicating the importance of relatively high cystatin C when calculating the eGFR cystatinC /eGFR creatinine ratio. Urea measured in patients' serum was significantly higher in patients with low-GFR cys /GFR cr (p = 0.020), hence a higher urea/creatinine ratio in the group (p < 0.001). It is important to note that other biomarkers linked to a kidney injury such as NGAL and proteinuria did not show a statistically significant difference.

BCR < 12 had good diagnostic performance for AIN (sensitivity = 76%, specificity = 81%, positive predictive value = 81%, and negative predictive value = 76%). Furthermore, BCR < 12 increased the probability of observing AIN in kidney histology (OR = 14.1, 95% CI = 2.6–75, p = 0.0021). In the multivariable analysis, BCR < 12 was the sole biomarker associated with histopathology-confirmed AIN. Individually, serum creatinine and BUN were not associated with AIN.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^117X84SA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy — creatinine generation variability and preferred GFR assessment notes that it is well established that creatinine generation may be unusually low or high; in these situations, GFR estimated by using creatinine and urea clearances may be substantially more accurate than creatinine-based estimating equations, and when endogenous creatinine generation is likely to be unusual, GFR should be estimated by methods independent of creatinine generation, such as urea or radionuclide GFR, rather than by using estimating equations.

### Increased protein intake augments kidney volume and function in healthy infants [^1144AVWE]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Protein intake has been directly associated with kidney growth and function in animal and human observational studies. Protein supply can vary widely during the first months of life, thus promoting different kidney growth patterns and possibly affecting kidney and cardiovascular health in the long term. To explore this further, we examined 601 healthy 6-month-old formula-fed infants who had been randomly assigned within the first 8 weeks of life to a 1-year program of formula with low-protein (LP) or high-protein (HP) contents and compared them with 204 breastfed (BF) infants. At 6 months, infants receiving the HP formula had significantly higher kidney volume (determined by ultrasonography) and ratios of kidney volume to body length and kidney volume to body surface area than did infants receiving the LP formula. BF infants did not differ from those receiving the LP formula in any of these parameters. Infants receiving the HP formula had significantly higher serum urea and urea to creatinine ratios than did LP formula and BF infants. Hence, in this European multicenter clinical trial, we found that a higher protein content of the infant formula increases kidney size at 6 months of life, whereas a lower protein supply achieves kidney size indistinguishable from that of healthy BF infants. The potential long-term effects of a higher early protein intake on long-term kidney function needs to be determined.

### Blood urea nitrogen / creatinine ratio identifies a high-risk but potentially reversible form of renal dysfunction in patients with decompensated heart failure [^113AJLgx]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Identifying reversible renal dysfunction (RD) in the setting of heart failure is challenging. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether elevated admission blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) could identify decompensated heart failure patients likely to experience improvement in renal function (IRF) with treatment.

Methods and Results

Consecutive hospitalizations with a discharge diagnosis of heart failure were reviewed. IRF was defined as ≥ 20% increase and worsening renal function as ≥ 20% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate. IRF occurred in 31% of the 896 patients meeting eligibility criteria. Higher admission BUN/Cr was associated with in-hospital IRF (odds ratio, 1.5 per 10 increase; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–1.8; P < 0.001), an association persisting after adjustment for baseline characteristics (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.8; P = 0.004). However, higher admission BUN/Cr was also associated with post-discharge worsening renal function (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.8; P = 0.011). Notably, in patients with an elevated admission BUN/Cr, the risk of death associated with RD (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45) was substantial (hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6–3.1; P < 0.001). However, in patients with a normal admission BUN/Cr, RD was not associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.67–2.0; P = 0.59; p interaction = 0.03).

Conclusions

An elevated admission BUN/Cr identifies decompensated patients with heart failure likely to experience IRF with treatment, providing proof of concept that reversible RD may be a discernible entity. However, this improvement seems to be largely transient, and RD, in the setting of an elevated BUN/Cr, remains strongly associated with death. Further research is warranted to develop strategies for the optimal detection and treatment of these high-risk patients.

### Catabolism in critical illness: a reanalysis of the REducing deaths due to OXidative stress (REDOXS) trial [^1113Z8Ni]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Ongoing risk of death and poor functional outcomes are important consequences of prolonged critical illness. Characterizing the catabolic phenotype of prolonged critical illness could illuminate biological processes and inform strategies to attenuate catabolism. We aimed to examine if urea-to-creatinine ratio, a catabolic signature of prolonged critical illness, was associated with mortality after the first week of ICU stay.

Design

Reanalysis of multicenter randomized trial of glutamine supplementation in critical illness (REducing Deaths due to OXidative Stress [REDOXS]).

Setting

Multiple adult ICUs.

Patients

Adult patients admitted to ICU with two or more organ failures related to their acute illness and surviving to day 7.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The association between time-varying urea-to-creatinine ratio and 30-day mortality was tested using Bayesian joint models adjusted for prespecified-covariates (age, kidney replacement therapy, baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, dietary protein [g/kg/d], kidney dysfunction, and glutamine-randomization). From 1,021 patients surviving to day 7, 166 (16.3%) died by day 30. After adjustment in a joint model, a higher time-varying urea-to-creatinine ratio was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.15; 95% credible interval, 1.66–2.82, for a two-fold greater urea-to-creatinine ratio). This association persisted throughout the 30-day follow-up. Mediation analysis was performed to explore urea-to-creatinine ratio as a mediator-variable for the increased risk of death reported in REDOXS when randomized to glutamine, an exogenous nitrogen load. Urea-to-creatinine ratio closest to day 7 was estimated to mediate the risk of death associated with randomization to glutamine supplementation (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04–1.38; p = 0.014), with no evidence of a direct effect of glutamine (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.62–1.30; p = 0.566).

Conclusions

The catabolic phenotype measured by increased urea-to-creatinine ratio is associated with increased risk of death during prolonged ICU stay and signals the deleterious effects of glutamine administration in the REDOXS study. Urea-to-creatinine ratio is a promising catabolic signature and potential interventional target.

### The urine-to-plasma urea concentration ratio is associated with eGFR and eGFR decline over time in a population cohort [^114ANMJT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Evaluation of renal function and of factors associated with its decline are important public health issues. Besides markers of glomerular function [e.g. glomerular filtration rate (GFR)], those of tubular functions are rarely evaluated. Urea, the most abundant urinary solute, is markedly concentrated in urine when compared with plasma. We explored the urine-to-plasma ratio of urea concentrations (U/P urea ratio) as a marker of tubular functions.

Methods

We evaluated the relationship of the U/P urea ratio with eGFR at baseline in 1043 participants (48 ± 17 years) from the Swiss Kidney Project on Genes in Hypertension (SKIPOGH) population-based cohort, using mixed regression. In 898 participants, we assessed the relation between U/P urea ratio and renal function decline between two study waves 3 years apart. We studied U/P ratios for osmolarity, Na, K and uric acid for comparison.

Results

In a transversal study at baseline, estimated GFR (eGFR) was positively associated with U/P-urea ratio [βscaled = 0.08, 95% CI (0.04; 0.13)] but not with the U/P ratio of osmolarity. Considering separately participants with renal function > 90 or ≤ 90 mL/min × 1.73 m², this association was observed only in those with reduced renal function. In the longitudinal study, eGFR declined at a mean rate of 1.2 mL/min per year. A significant association was observed between baseline U/P urea ratio and eGFR decline [βscaled = 0.08, 95% CI (0.01; 0.15)]. A lower baseline U/P urea ratio was associated with a greater eGFR decline.

Conclusion

This study provides evidence that the U/P urea ratio is an early marker of kidney function decline in the general adult population. Urea is easy to measure with well-standardized techniques and at low cost. Thus, the U/P urea ratio could become an easily available tubular marker for evaluating renal function decline.

### The urine-to-plasma urea concentration ratio is associated with eGFR and eGFR decline over time in a population cohort [^117CrtC4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In the present study, we examined whether the tubular handling of urea, evaluated by the U/P urea concentration ratio, might be an early marker of further renal function decline in a population-based cohort. First, in the cross-sectional analysis, we observed that the U/P urea ratio, but not the ratio for osmolarity, was strongly and positively associated with eGFR. This relationship was specific to urea because it was not observed with the ratios of the two other main urinary solutes, sodium and potassium. Second, in a 3-year longitudinal analysis we observed that the eGFR decline was inversely associated with the baseline U/P urea ratio. The lower the initial U/P urea ratio, the larger the eGFR decline, even after multiple adjustments including (among others) copeptin, blood pressure, 24-h urinary albumin and urea excretions.

Clinical outcomes

The median follow-up period was 2.66 years (range, 0–10.79 years), and 1173 CAD were recorded as having CAD for T2DM over 41,178.83 person-years follow-up, which yielded an event rate of 28.49 events per 1000 person-years. Of those, 358 CAD occurred in women and 815 CAD occurred in men. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were represented in Fig. 2, indicating that those at the high-level group of UCR tended to have a lower event-free survival than at the low level and the medium level groups (= 13.1; log-rank P = 0.027, df = 2).

Analysis of RCS curve and threshold effects

The RCS curve depicted in Fig. 2 clearly illustrates that the correlation between OSA and BUCR is nonlinear in nature. A delve into the threshold effect pinpoints a critical turning point at 10.86. Below this threshold, each unit decrease in BUCR index elevates OSA risk by 5% (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01–1.09, P = 0.014). Conversely, upon surpassing 10.86, this association loses statistical significance (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.996–1.02, P = 0.189), with the likelihood ratio test yielding a P -value of 0.068 (Table 3), Indicating that BUCR may no longer serve as a reliable marker of OSA risk above a certain threshold. This may be an important reference for clinicians to assess patients' susceptibility to OSA sensitivity.

Subgroup analysis

Multi-subgroup analyses and interaction tests, incorporating a diverse range of covariates, were conducted to rigorously evaluate the robustness of the BUCR-OSA correlation and to identify potential variations across diverse populations (Table 4). Within the majority of subgroups, a consistent and significant association between BUCR and OSA was observed. However, notable differences emerged among diabetic populations, with a P -value for interaction of 0.0221. Specifically, a stronger BUCR-OSA association was observed in non-diabetic individuals (OR = 0.999, 95% CI: 0.990–1.008, P = 0.7895) compared to diabetic patients (OR = 0.975, 95% CI: 0.954–0.995, P = 0.0165).

### Year in review 2013: critical care-nephrology [^116z8JUz]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of acute kidney injury

Apart from the specific issue of AKI classification, accurate assessment of kidney function in the critically ill patient plays an important role in diagnosing AKI as well as ensuring the appropriate prescription and dosing of drugs and the timely application of therapeutic strategies. sCr is used daily as a marker for kidney function, although it may not be suitable for this purpose as it is affected by factors other than kidney function. It is well known that creatinine is metabolized from creatine, which is released by the muscles; therefore, muscle mass and metabolic transformation of creatine have an impact on sCr concentration. In addition, age, gender and race all affect muscle mass and, in turn, sCr concentrations. In critically ill patients, creatinine production may be decreased because of immobilization and malnutrition or increased because of catabolic illness. Increases in total body water, common in these patients, increases the distribution volume of creatinine and attenuates the increase in sCr caused by AKI. Bragadottir and colleagues also showed that daily changes in serum creatinine as a surrogate of glomerular filtration rate poorly reflect changes in kidney function in patients with AKI. Other groups have investigated the use of urinary indices, such as the fractional excretion of sodium and the fractional excretion of urea (FeUrea), for the differential diagnosis of different forms of AKI. Pons and coworkers performed a prospective multicenter observational study enrolling 244 consecutive patients, including 97 without AKI, 54 with transient AKI and 93 with persistent AKI. Urinary sodium, urea and creatinine were measured at ICU admission (H0) and every 6 hours during the first 24 hours in the ICU (H6, H12, H18 and H24). Transient AKI was defined as AKI with a cause for renal hypoperfusion and reversal within 3 days. Even though significant increases from H0 to H24 were noted in FeUrea (median 31% (22 to 41%) at H0; 39% (29 to 48%) at H24; P < 0.0001), urinary urea/plasma urea ratio (median 15 (7 to 28) at H0; 20 (9 to 40) at H24; P < 0.0001), and urinary creatinine/plasma creatinine ratio (median 50 (24 to 101) at H0; 57 (29 to 104) at H24; P = 0.01), fractional excretion of sodium did not change significantly during the first 24 hours in the ICU (P = 0.13). Neither urinary index values at ICU admission nor changes in urinary indices between H0 and H24 performed sufficiently well to recommend their use in the clinical setting of critically ill patients (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ≤ 0.65). This study shows the poor performance of standard urinary indices at ICU admission for differentiating transient AKI from persistent AKI in unselected critically ill patients. Although changes over the first 24 hours and values at H24 performed slightly better than values at admission, their performance remained too low to be clinically useful. Together with other work, this study raises more fundamental questions about the value, meaning and pathophysiologic validity of the pre-renal AKI paradigm and suggests that AKI (like all other forms of organ injury) is a continuum of injury that cannot be neatly divided into functional (pre-renal or transient) or structural (acute tubular necrosis or persistent).

### Screening with blood urea nitrogen before intravenous contrast [^112LmUzo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

In some settings, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values are available well in advance of creatinine values. We wanted to determine whether BUN values can be used to screen for renal insufficiency for the purpose of intravenous contrast administration. From laboratory records, we derived and validated cutpoints for BUN values to detect creatinine values ≥ 2.0 mg/dL. "Sensitive" and "high-yield" cutpoints were derived using records from 5000 consecutive patients and validated using a random set of 2000 patients. BUN ≥ 15 mg/dL, the "sensitive" cutpoint, had sensitivity of 0.997 (95% confidence interval, 0.987–1.0) and specificity of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54–0.59). BUN ≥ 20 mg/dL, the "high-yield cutpoint", had sensitivity of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95–0.99) and specificity of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69–0.73). Negative likelihood ratios for these cutpoints were 0.005 and 0.03, respectively. BUN values < 15–20 mg/dL provide strong evidence against renal insufficiency.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^114Pe6mf]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) has been used since the early 1940s to help clinicians differentiate between prerenal acute kidney injury (PR AKI) and intrinsic AKI (I AKI). This ratio is simple to use and often put forward as a reliable diagnostic tool even though little scientific evidence supports this. The aim of this study was to determine whether BCR is a reliable tool for distinguishing PR AKI from I AKI.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational study over a 13 months period, in the Emergency Department (ED) of Nantes University Hospital. Eligible for inclusion were all adult patients consecutively admitted to the ED with a creatinine > 133 μmol/L (1.5 mg/dL).

Results

Sixty thousand one hundred sixty patients were consecutively admitted to the ED. 2756 patients had plasma creatinine levels in excess of 133 μmol/L, 1653 were excluded, leaving 1103 patients for definitive inclusion. Mean age was 75.7 ± 14.8 years old, 498 (45%) patients had PR AKI and 605 (55%) I AKI. BCR was 90.55 ± 39.32 and 91.29 ± 39.79 in PR AKI and I AKI groups respectively. There was no statistical difference between mean BCR of the PR AKI and I AKI groups, p = 0.758. The area under the ROC curve was 0.5 indicating that BCR had no capacity to discriminate between PR AKI and I AKI.

Conclusions

Our study is the largest to investigate the diagnostic performance of BCR. BCR is not a reliable parameter for distinguishing prerenal AKI from intrinsic AKI.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^116rTJcL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Urea reduction ratio (URR) — definition, correlation, limitations, and impact of ultrafiltration are described as follows: URR is defined as URR = (C₀ − C)/C₀; although URR correlates well with spKt/V in population studies, there is significant variability in individuals because URR does not include contraction in extracellular volume and urea generation, and for a given Kt/V URR may vary with the fraction of weight lost during dialysis; when outcomes, including death, are correlated with either metric, no difference in degree of correlation is detectable; as kidney replacement level increases, especially with daily treatment, URR approaches zero and is also zero in continuously dialyzed patients or those with normal kidney function; additional limitations include inability to adjust the prescription using modeling; the figure's modeling assumes a 3-hour dialysis, no RKF, and a volume of urea distribution that is 58% of BW, with ΔWt referring to net ultrafiltration losses as a fraction of final BW.

### The ratio of measured to estimated glomerular filtration rate may be a marker of early mortality and dialysis requirement [^115CAn3z]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

It could be argued that M/E is just a marker of comorbidity, which per se is known to be associated with early requirement of dialysis relative to eGFR. However, the relationship to outcomes remained after adjustment for comorbidity. The combined effects of comorbidities are difficult to quantify; M/E could perhaps replace it in assessing requirement for early dialysis.

eGFR at DI was lower in patients with a high M/E, who also had an improved survival after DI. This supports the hypothesis that the paradoxical positive correlation between eGFR at DI and mortality is due to insufficient correction for sarcopenia, and that mGFR is a better measure om the patient's clinical condition and prognosis. The beneficial relationship of M/E to survival may thus be due to it being a good marker of nutritional status.

M/E was higher in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and diuretics, but not any other class of drugs. Physiological explanations for these associations are unclear, and the lack of relationship to angiotensin 2 antagonist treatment argues against a causal relationship between the renin-angiotensin system activation and M/E. It cannot be argued from these findings that current medical treatment should be considered when assessing the M/E.

This study suffers from several limitations. As it was a retrospective registry study, some data was missing. In particular, BSA was only available in a minority of patients. mGFR and M/E should a priori be normalized for BSA, in order to compare with eGFR. However, the subgroup of patients with BSA measurements did not differ substantially from the group as a whole and the correlations to eGFR were similar. The paucity of BSA data may have skewed the survival analyses. The circumstances and reasons for measuring urea excretion, in addition to the more common creatinine excretion, were not available. If collections were primarily collected in acutely ill patients, then the findings may be less applicable to out-patients. The Cox proportional hazards model does not fully take into account competing hazards (death vs. dialysis); this will have been particularly relevant for patients with eGFR 5–10 ml/min/1.73 m². The relationship between DI and M/E was only present on a post hoc analysis of three-month results. eGFR (but not M/E) will probably have played a role in assessing requirement for DI, creating a factitious relationship. The hypothesis thus needs to be validated by an investigation of a population of CKD stage 4 and 5 patients prospectively followed in a specialist clinic.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen level as a predictor of mortality in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure [^115kXGju]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitalization for decompensated heart failure is associated with high mortality after discharge. In heart failure, renal function involves both cardiovascular and hemodynamic properties. We studied the relation between renal dysfunction and mortality in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure.

Methods

The prognostic importance of four measures of renal function-blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio, and estimated creatinine clearance-was evaluated in 541 patients (mean [± SD] age, 63 ± 14 years; 377 men [70%]) with a previous diagnosis of heart failure (96% with New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms) who were admitted for clinical decompensation.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 343 ± 185 days, 177 patients (33%) died. In multivariable Cox regression models, the risk of all-cause mortality increased with each quartile of blood urea nitrogen, with an adjusted relative risk of 2.3 in patients in the upper compared with the lower quartiles (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 to 4.1; P = 0.005). Creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance were not significant predictors of mortality after adjustment for other covariates. Blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio yielded similar prognostic information as blood urea nitrogen (adjusted relative risk = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.4 to 3.8; P = 0.0007 for patients in the upper compared with the lower quartiles).

Conclusion

Blood urea nitrogen is a simple clinical variable that provides useful prognostic information in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure. In this setting, elevated blood urea nitrogen levels probably reflect the cumulative effects of hemodynamic and neurohormonal alterations that result in renal hypoperfusion.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio increased the risk of coronary artery disease in patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^11633j3G]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

High Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and high Serum Creatinine (SCr) levels are risk factors for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). However, the relationship between the Blood Urea Nitrogen to Creatinine (BUN/SCr) ratio (UCR) and the risk of CAD in patients living with new-onset diabetes is unclear. This study aimed to examine the relationship between blood UCR and the risk of CAD in patients living with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

We analyzed the data from the cohort of 12,299 patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Primary endpoints were the events of CAD. The ANOVA test (continuous indicators) and χ 2 test (categorical indicators) were used to assess the differences of baseline characteristics across the groups of UCR. In order to understand the correlation between variables, we performed correlation analysis on variables that have significant differences between CAD group and non-CAD group. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to estimate the association of the blood UCR with the risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM. The Kaplan–Meier survival function plotting and the log-rank test were used to evaluate the event-free survival according to the groups of UCR. The restricted cubic spline model was used to show the adjusted association between blood UCR and risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM.

Results

During a median follow-up of 2.66 years, 1173 CAD were recorded with an event rate of 28.49 events per 1000 person-years. In multivariate-adjusted Cox regression models, elevated blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (UCR) was associated with higher risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM [hazard ratio (HR), 1.782; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.237–2.567]. The Kaplan–Meier survival curves indicated that the high group of UCR tended to have a lower event-free survival than the low group and medium group. There was a nonlinear trend toward increasing risk of CAD across the groups of UCR. And cubic spline function graph suggested that the influence of UCR level on HR for CAD increased significantly at UCR levels above 6.67.

Conclusions

An elevated UCR was significantly associated with an increased risk for CAD in patients living with T2DM.

### Association between urea trajectory and protein dose in critically ill adults: a secondary exploratory analysis of the effort protein trial (RE-EFFORT) [^114pFcMW]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Ureagenesis

While endogenous and exogenous amino acids can be used for ATP generation in starvation (e.g. via the Cahill cycle) this is not necessarily true in multi-organ dysfunction. Intramuscular hypoxia and inflammatory signalling, impaired GLUT-4 translocation and insulin resistance either divert key processes or provide negative feedback loops to prevent this. The end result is an accumulation of toxic intermediary metabolites such as ammonia from an overburdened urea cycle. Multi-organ dysfunction can include subtle liver dysfunction, which may affect such pathways in the absence of overt hepatic failure. Quantifying the effect of hepatic dysfunction on urea cycle flux (and indeed Cahill cycle flux) was outside the scope of the reanalysis, though the retention of the signal for harm following correction for persistent organ dysfunction implies that this may have been accounted for. In previous work, ourselves and others have demonstrated the relationship between mortality, morbidity, and persistent critical illness with the urea-to-creatinine ratio. Urea-to-creatinine ratio increased in patients randomised to higher protein suggesting an increase in catabolism. However, loss of creatinine generation related to muscle wasting was not assessed in this reanalysis, as the focus was on the much closer relationship between protein dose and urea metabolism.

Although AKI is an independent cause of uraemia, the fact that randomisation to higher protein was associated with higher urea and that harm associated with high-dose protein was associated with presence of AKI suggests that the two causes of uraemia (decreased elimination and increased production) may potentiate in their associations with adverse outcome. By contrast, clinical need to commence RRT is triggered by a supply demand imbalance with respect to renal function and metabolic burden and thus also reflects both excess urea generation and inadequate elimination. In this study, effective randomisation to higher urea production allows the effect of ureagenesis to be specifically examined. Our analyses suggest considerations for protein loading in critical illness may equally apply to patients with AKI, with or without RRT.

### A combined-biomarker approach to clinical phenotyping renal dysfunction in heart failure [^112Jqy1B]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Differentiating heart failure (HF) induced renal dysfunction (RD) from intrinsic kidney disease is challenging. It has been demonstrated that biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BUN/creat) can identify high- vs low-risk RD. Our objective was to determine if combining these biomarkers could further improve risk stratification and clinical phenotyping of patients with RD and HF.

Methods and Results

A total of 908 patients with a discharge diagnosis of HF were included. Median values were used to define elevated BNP (> 1296 pg/mL) and BUN/creat (> 17). In the group without RD, survival was similar regardless of BNP and BUN/creat (n = 430, adjusted P = 0.52). Similarly, in patients with both a low BNP and BUN/creat, RD was not associated with mortality (n = 250, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6–1.6, P = 0.99). However, in patients with both an elevated BNP and BUN/creat those with RD had a cardiorenal profile characterized by venous congestion, diuretic resistance, hypotension, hyponatremia, longer length of stay, greater inotrope use, and substantially worse survival compared with patients without RD (n = 249, adjusted HR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2–2.7, P = 0.008, P interaction = .005).

Conclusions

In the setting of decompensated HF, the combined use of BNP and BUN/creat stratifies patients with RD into groups with significantly different clinical phenotypes and prognosis.

### Elevation of blood urea nitrogen is predictive of long-term mortality in critically ill patients independent of "normal" creatinine [^112fJuei]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We hypothesized that elevated blood urea nitrogen can be associated with all-cause mortality independent of creatinine in a heterogeneous critically ill population.

Design

Multicenter observational study of patients treated in medical and surgical intensive care units.

Setting

Twenty intensive care units in two teaching hospitals in Boston, MA.

Patients

A total of 26,288 patients, age ≥ 18 yrs, hospitalized between 1997 and 2007 with creatinine of 0.80–1.30 mg/dL.

Interventions

None.

Measurements

Blood urea nitrogen at intensive care unit admission was categorized as 10–20, 20–40, and > 40 mg/dL. Logistic regression examined death at days 30, 90, and 365 after intensive care unit admission as well as in-hospital mortality. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated by multivariable logistic regression models.

Main Results

Blood urea nitrogen at intensive care unit admission was predictive for short- and long-term mortality independent of creatinine. Thirty days following intensive care unit admission, patients with blood urea nitrogen of > 40 mg/dL had an odds ratio for mortality of 5.12 (95% confidence interval, 4.30–6.09; p < .0001) relative to patients with blood urea nitrogen of 10–20 mg/dL. Blood urea nitrogen remained a significant predictor of mortality at 30 days after intensive care unit admission following multivariable adjustment for confounders; patients with blood urea nitrogen of > 40 mg/dL had an odds ratio for mortality of 2.78 (95% confidence interval, 2.27–3.39; p < .0001) relative to patients with blood urea nitrogen of 10–20 mg/dL. Thirty days following intensive care unit admission, patients with blood urea nitrogen of 20–40 mg/dL had an odds ratio of 2.15 (95% confidence interval, 1.98–2.33; < .0001) and a multivariable odds ratio of 1.53 (95% confidence interval, 1.40–1.68; p < .0001) relative to patients with blood urea nitrogen of 10–20 mg/dL. Results were similar at 90 and 365 days following intensive care unit admission as well as for in-hospital mortality. A subanalysis of patients with blood cultures (n = 7,482) demonstrated that blood urea nitrogen at intensive care unit admission was associated with the risk of blood culture positivity.

Conclusion

Among critically ill patients with creatinine of 0.8–1.3 mg/dL, an elevated blood urea nitrogen was associated with increased mortality, independent of serum creatinine.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio increased the risk of coronary artery disease in patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1122X9eD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates that UCR is an independent risk factor for CAD in patients living with new-onset T2DM. Moreover, the results suggested that the influence of UCR level on HR for CAD increased significantly at UCR levels above 6.67. According to our study, an elevated UCR can increase the risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM. This study provides a theoretical basis for tertiary prevention in the T2DM population.

An important component in the development of kidney disease in SCD patients is inflammation. The significant pathophysiological effects of SCD include haemolytic events and the formation of inflammatory processes that ultimately lead to vaso-occlusion. One biomarker for inflammation and coagulation is serum fibrinogen (FIB). Fibrinogen levels are elevated in both chronic low-grade inflammation and acute and tissue-damaging inflammation. Uadia and Gadzama reported that increasing levels of urea and creatinine were linked to elevated FIB levels in patients with SCD who had renal impairment. Albumin (ALB) possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic kidney disease, low albumin levels are linked to a worse prognosis for their kidneys. The most abundant plasma protein, human serum albumin, is produced in the liver and discharged into the vascular space, where it travels throughout the body. It is critical for maintaining homeostasis and balancing hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures within vessels. A significant relationship between blood ALB levels and renal prognosis was discovered by Zhang et al. in 2019. Serum ALB levels are inversely correlated with glomerular lesions and proteinuria, two established risk factors for the development of diabetic nephropathy, which may account for the relationship between renal prognosis and hypoalbuminemia. Participants with type 2 diabetes and diabetic renal disease had a worse prognosis when their albumin level was low. According to Zhang et al. (2020), in a cancer trial, the fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR) was a more significant predictive factor of cancer than each single marker itself. Combining these two inflammation markers and using their ratios would be best for detecting renal inflammation in SCD patients. The diagnostic significance of FAR in SCD patients with kidney disease has not yet been studied.

Identifying progressive renal injury with traditional parameters, including creatinine and urea, is often misleading. Hence, there is a need to consider markers such as sNGAL and FAR, which can predict and facilitate early diagnosis of renal impairment in SCD patients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether sNGAL and FAR could be used as indicators of kidney disease in SCD patients.

In the unadjusted Model 1, in comparison to the low-BCR cohort, the high-BCR cohort was shown to have a 1.28-fold higher CHF risk [HR = 1.28, 95% CI (1.15–1.44), p < 0.001]. In Model 2, after adjustments of age, gender, race, as well as marital status, the high-BCR group continue to exhibit an elevated likelihood of CHF in contrast to the low-BCR cohort[HR = 1.21, 95% CI (1.08–1.36), p < 0.001]. After all factors were adjusted in Model 3, similar results were noted, with BCR also being linked to an elevated risk of CHF [HR = 1.20 95% CI (1.04–1.39), p = 0.014] (Table 1).

### A low BUN / creatinine ratio predicts histologically confirmed acute interstitial nephritis [^113yXQnB]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In hospitalized patients with acute renal injury (AKI), acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (AIN) constitutes one of the leading etiologies. The objective of this study was to identify clinical and biochemical variables in patients with AKI associated with kidney biopsy-confirmed AIN.

Methods

For our prospective study, we recruited hospitalized patients aged 18 years and older who were diagnosed with AKI based on biochemical criteria. Prior to enrollment, each patient was assessed with a complete metabolic panel and a kidney biopsy.

Results

The study consisted of 42 patients (with a mean age of 45 years) and equal numbers of male and female patients. Diabetes and hypertension were the main comorbidities. Nineteen patients had histological findings consistent with AIN. There was a correlation between histology and the BUN/creatinine ratio (BCR) (r = -0.57, p = 0.001). The optimal Youden point for classifying AIN via a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was a BCR ≤ 12 (AUC = 0.73, p = 0.024). Additionally, in diagnosing AIN, BCR had a sensitivity of 76%, a specificity of 81%, a positive predictive value of 81%, a negative predictive value of 76%, and OR of 14 (95% CI = 2.6 to 75.7, p = 0.021). In the multivariable analysis, BCR was the sole variable associated with AIN.

Conclusion

A BCR ≤ 12 identifies AIN in patients with AKI. This study is the first to prospectively assess the relationship between renal biopsy results and BCR.

### Blood urea nitrogen to albumin ratio is a predictor of in-hospital mortality in older emergency department patients [^1136W4Nx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the first measured blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/albumin ratio in the emergency department (ED) as a predictor of in-hospital mortality in older ED patients.

Methods

This retrospective observational study was conducted at a university hospital ED. Consecutive patients aged 65 and over who visited the ED in a three-month period were included in the study. The BUN, albumin, creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of patients were recorded. The primary end point of the study was in-hospital mortality.

Results

A total of 1253 patients were included in the statistical analyses of the study. Non-survivors had increased BUN levels (32.9 (23.3–55.4) vs. 20.2 (15.4–28.3) mg/dL, p < 0.001), decreased albumin levels (3.27 (2.74–3.75) vs. 3.96 (3.52–4.25) g/dL, p < 0.001), and increased BUN/albumin ratios (10.19 (6.56–18.94) vs. 5.21 (3.88–7.72) mg/g, p < 0.001) compared to survivors. An increased BUN/albumin ratio was a powerful predictor of in-hospital mortality with an area under the curve of 0.793 (95% CI: 0.753–0.833). Malignancy (OR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.59–3.74, p < 0.001), albumin level < 3.5 g/dL (OR: 2.75; 95% CI: 1.74–4.36, p < 0.001), and BUN/albumin ratio > 6.25 (OR: 2.82; 95% CI: 1.22–6.50, p < 0.015) were found to be independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in older ED patients.

Conclusion

According to our findings, older patients with a BUN level > 23 mg/dL, an albumin level < 3.5 g/dL, and a BUN/albumin ratio > 6.25 mg/g in the ED have a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Additionally, the BUN/albumin ratio is a more powerful independent predictor of in-hospital mortality than the BUN level, albumin level, creatinine level, and eGFR in older ED patients.

### Relation between renal function and response to cardiac resynchronization therapy in multicenter automatic defibrillator implantation trial – cardiac resynchronization therapy (MADIT-CRT) [^112AmCVs]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiorenal interactions have been shown to affect outcome in heart failure patients but were not related to response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to test our hypothesis that assessment of markers of prerenal failure may help identify mildly symptomatic HF patients with diminished effective circulating blood volume who will benefit from CRT.

Methods

The benefit of CRT with a defibrillator (CRT-D) as compared with defibrillator-only therapy in reducing the risk of HF or death was assessed by renal function parameters (including serum creatinine [SCr], blood urea nitrogen [BUN], and the ratio of BUN to SCr [BUN:SCr], dichotomized at median values and into approximate quartiles) among 1,803 patients enrolled in the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy.

Results

Multivariate analysis showed that the benefit of CRT-D was inversely related to SCr levels and directly related to BUN levels. Combined assessment of the two renal function parameters showed a significant difference in the benefit of CRT-D between patients with low (≤ 18 mg/dL, HR = 0.85, P = 0.28) and elevated (> 18 mg/dL, HR = 0.46, P < .001) BUN:SCr (P-value for interaction = .005). Consistently, the benefit of CRT-D was significantly increased with increasing quartiles of BUN:SCr (Q(1): HR = 1.06 [P = 0.79], Q(2): HR = 0.64 [P = 0.04], Q(3): HR = 0.47 [P < .001], Q(4): HR = 0.44 [P < .001]; P-value for trend = .005).

Conclusions

In MADIT-CRT, patients with an elevated ratio of BUN to SCr experienced a significantly greater reduction in the risk of HF or death with CRT-D therapy as compared with patients with a low ratio. These findings suggest an association between prerenal function and response to CRT.

Baseline characteristics of the study cohort

Median presenting creatinine in all patients was 1.3 mg/dL (0.98–1.93), corresponding to a mean presenting eGFR of 68.4 ± 37.9 mL/min/1.73 m². One hundred and seventy-three (26.4%) patients had normal renal function and 482 (73.6%) patients had kidney disease (subsequent diagnosis at day 7 of AKI = 130, 19.9%; AKD = 343, 52.2%; and CKD = 10, 1.5%). AKI was stage 1 in 71 (54.6%) patients, stage 2 in 25 (19.2%) and stage 3 in 34 (26.2%). Median presenting creatinine in patients with kidney disease was 1.5 mg/dL (1.2–2.5) and mean eGFR was 53.3 ± 33.2 mL/min/1.73 m².

SUN measurements

A total of 1479 SUN measurements were made across the observation time points (655 at enrolment, 384 at day 7, 246 at 1 month, 124 at 3 months and 70 at 6 months). Creatinine and eGFR according to SUN result are outlined in table 3 and figure 2. There were significant differences in both measures according to SUN result (p < 0.0001 for both). SUN, transformed to a continuous variable using the midpoint of each test pad range, correlated with creatinine and eGFR when analysed across all SUN tests undertaken, and in those undertaken specifically at enrolment, at 7 days and at 1 month (table 4). SUN also correlated with proteinuria (Spearman's r = 0.27 (0.18–0.36); p < 0.0001), and there were significant differences in SUN according to proteinuria as measured by dipstick (p < 0.0001).

### Nutrition support of children with chronic liver diseases: a joint position paper of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^111oDzB6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

Protein requirements and assessment in pediatric chronic and end-stage liver disease — protein needs are typically increased due to protein loss, increased amino acid oxidation, and poor nutritional status. Albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, and retinol-binding protein (RBP) may be used to assess protein status, but these markers have variable utility in chronic liver disease and inflammation. Blood urea nitrogen is affected by hydration and hepatic urea synthesis; in the absence of dehydration or liver failure a low blood urea nitrogen can be used as an indirect marker of suboptimal protein intake. Nitrogen balance studies and serum creatinine should be interpreted with caution because of comorbidities in end-stage liver disease, and measures of sarcopenia may be more useful indirect indicators though their utility has not yet been adequately studied.

Relationship between BUN/CR and clinical outcomes of female patients with CABG

Cox regression models (Table 2) were used to assess the independent effects of BUN/Cr on mortality. BUN/Cr was categorized into five groups, with the Q4 group serving as the reference. After adjusting for confounders, In Model 5 of the fully adjusted Cox regression analysis, a significant association between the BUN/Cr and mortality was observed across various time points. The continuous variable for BUN/Cr demonstrated a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91–0.98, p = 0.002) for one-year mortality, indicating that each unit increase in BUN/Cr is associated with a 5% decrease in mortality risk. Participants in the lowest BUN/Cr category (Q1, ≤ 15) exhibited a markedly higher risk of mortality (HR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.36–5.27, p = 0.004) compared to the reference group (Q4). This trend persisted over two to five years, with continuous BUN/Cr values consistently showing protective effects against mortality (HRs ranging from 0.95 to 0.97) and Q1 maintaining a significant association with increased mortality risk (HRs between 2.17 and 2.61).

### New classification for the combined assessment of the fractional excretion of urea nitrogen and estimated plasma volume status in acute heart failure [^116TxTfB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

With regard to the laboratory parameters, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and albumin in the high‐FEUN/low‐ePVS and low‐FEUN/low‐ePVS groups were significantly higher compared with those of the high‐FEUN/high‐ePVS and low‐FEUN/high‐ePVS groups. BUN in the low‐FEUN/high‐ePVS group was significantly higher compared with that of the other 3 groups. Creatinine in the high‐FEUN/high‐ePVS and low‐FEUN/high‐ePVS groups were significantly higher compared with that of the high‐FEUN/low‐ePVS group. BUN/creatinine ratio in the low‐FEUN/low‐ePVS and low‐FEUN/high‐ePVS groups was significantly higher compared with that of the high‐FEUN/low‐ePVS and high‐FEUN/high‐ePVS groups.

### Impaired hydration status in acutely admitted older patients: prevalence and impact on mortality [^115utEEc]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

impaired hydration is common in the older people, however studies of its effects on outcome in the acute setting are limited.

Objectives

to assess (i) the prevalence of impaired hydration, (ii) its relationship with laboratory markers of altered hydration and with (iii) short- and long-term mortality.

Design

retrospective cohort study.

Setting

University Hospital-Internal Medicine Department.

Subjects

a total of 5,113 older patients consecutively acutely admitted from October 2015 to July 2016.

Methods

according to calculated serum osmolarity at admission hydration status was stratified in: low osmolarity (< 275 mmol/L), euhydration (275–295 mmol/L), impending (296–300 mmol/L) and current dehydration (> 300 mmol/L). Relationships with serum sodium, potassium, glucose, urea, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), haematocrit, urea/creatinine ratio (Urea/Cr) and urine specific gravity (USG) were determined. Charlson Comorbidity Index, Modified Early Warning Score, Glasgow Prognostic Score, Norton score and Nutritional Risk Screening-2002 were calculated.

Results

current and impending dehydration, euhydration and low-osmolarity were detected in 51.7, 17.1, 28.5 and 2.7% of the patients, respectively. Osmolarity correlated with urea (r = 0.846). Associations with serum sodium, creatinine, eGFR and urea/Cr were low but significant, being negligible that with USG and haematocrit. Serum sodium and urea increased in the transition from low- to high-osmolarity (P < 0.001 in all pairwise comparisons). In multivariate modelling current dehydration, functional dependence, clinical instability and high nutritional risk were associated (P < 0.001) with reduced short- and long-term survival.

Conclusions

impaired hydration is common in older people acutely admitted to medical care and is associated with poor outcome. Early assessment of calculated serum osmolarity is mandatory to target dehydration and hypoosmolar disorders.

### Diagnostic value of urinary sodium, chloride, urea, and flow [^1133HscU]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Up to 30% of hospitalized critically ill patients may have a rise in serum creatinine concentration. In addition to history and physical examination, there is diagnostic value in assessing urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in these patients. The correct interpretation of these urinary parameters can avoid unnecessary volume overload and mechanical ventilation, risk factors for increased mortality in patients with rising serum creatinine. The present article also discusses the role of arterial underfilling in causing prerenal azotemia in the presence of an increase in total body sodium and extracellular fluid expansion. As with extracellular fluid volume depletion, arterial underfilling secondary to impaired cardiac function or primary arterial vasodilation can delay or prevent recovery from ischemic or toxic acute tubular necrosis. The present brief review discusses the various aspects of the correct interpretation of urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in the setting of a rising serum creatinine concentration.

The bivariate analysis showed that patients with AIN had greater creatinine (6.6 mg/dL vs. 3.5 mg/dL) and BUN (62 mg/dL vs. 40 mg/dL) concentrations. The BCR was significantly lower in the AIN group (11.2 ± 3.8 vs. 21.4 ± 8.7, p = 0.001) (Fig. 2). The remaining clinical and biochemical variables were equally distributed between the groups, except for blood glucose concentrations, which were higher in the group with no AIN. The results of the multivariate analysis, BCR had an inverse correlation with the histological finding of AIN (Spearman rho = -0.57, p = 0.001). Table 3 shows the results of the multivariate analysis, with the variables suspected of being risk factors for AIN. Furthermore, the ROC analysis (Fig. 3) showed that the optimal Youden point for identifying AIN was at a BCR lower than 12 (sensitivity = 81%, specificity = 83%, and AUC = 0.73; p = 0.024).

The ROC plot shows the optimal Youden point discriminating AIN from non-AIN patients with AKI as having a BCR value of 12. BCR = BUN to creatinine ratio

The coexistence of AIN and acute tubular injury was observed in 12 patients, with a mean BCR of 12.1 ± 3. Nine patients had isolated acute tubular injury (without AIN), with a mean BCR of 17.5 ± 7. This difference was significant (p = 0.001). However, we did not identify an association between AIN and acute tubular injury (p = 0.2). In patients with glomerular disease, low BCR was observed only 13%; whereas in that with AIN, it was found in 84% (X² = 21, p = 0.001).

### The complexity of kidney disease and diagnosing it-cystatin C, selective glomerular hypofiltration syndromes and proteome regulation [^111nAck8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The missing piece of the puzzle – shrunken or elongated pore syndrome representing selective glomerular hypofiltration syndromes

As stated above the best way of estimating GFR is to calculate separate values for eGFR creatinine and eGFR cystatin C and then, in the absence of non‐renal factors influencing the estimates, use the average value as the best GFR estimate. This procedure has been used in different laboratories since 2010, and it has then been observed that a significant number of patients display discordant values of eGFR creatinine and eGFR cystatin C, although no non‐renal causes for the discrepancies are found. In virtually all these cases, eGFR cystatin C was lower than eGFR creatinine. These discrepancies soon led to the hypothesis of a set of kidney disorders in which the glomerular filtration of 5–30 kDa molecular mass is selectively decreased compared to that of the low molecular mass substances dominating in urine like water, 0.018 kDa, urea, 0.060 kDa or creatinine, 0.113 kDa. Such kidney disorders could thus tentatively be labelled selective glomerular hypofiltration syndromes.

This mechanism was first suggested in an article published in 2015 showing that in patients with an eGFR cystatin C /eGFR creatinine ‐ratio significantly below 1, and thus an increased cystatin C/creatinine‐ratio, the ratios among several other 11–29 kDa proteins and creatinine were also increased. According to the pore model for glomerular filtration, these observations could be explained by a shrinking (or elongation) of the pores. Almost immediately after this observation, the presence of shrunken pore syndrome and/or an eGFR cystatin C /eGFR creatinine ‐ratio significantly below 1 was found to be strongly correlated to mortality, morbidity, heart failure and end‐stage renal disease. Similar observations between an abnormally low eGFR cystatin C /eGFR creatinine ‐ratio and morbidity have recently been described in an American study, although it used the difference between eGFR cystatin C and eGFR creatinine to identify a specific reduction in the excretion of 5–30 kDa molecules.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation of albuminuria, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected on less accurate methods:

- confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible (quantify the albumin-to-creatinine ratio or protein-to-creatinine ratio if initial semiquantitative tests are positive)

- confirm albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent first morning void in the urine sample.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^116XvJ8c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy — limitations of Kt/V measurement and denominator choice: "To accurately measure Kt/V from the decrease in BUN levels during dialysis, the decrease must be significant, ie, the 2 concentrations (C0 and C) must be significantly different from one another (ratio > ~1.5)", implying the schedule "must be truly intermittent", and "As the frequency and duration increase, measurement of Kt/V becomes less precise". Measurement sessions can be biased because "modeled or measured dialysis may differ from the typical dialysis" and a study found "a higher average blood volume processed during the measured dialysis"; "In 20% of their patients, the difference was clinically significant", altering prescription elements. Regarding denominators, "The ideal denominator for dialysis dosage among patients of varying size is the generation rate of uremic toxins", and "the increase in Kt/V caused by weight loss (lower V)… likely is a false improvement". There are "No universally accepted adjustments", so nephrologists "should be aware of the pitfall and consider offering additional dialysis for patients with evidence of malnutrition". Using V avoids obesity-related errors but "does not eliminate the potential error in malnourished patients".

All randomized controlled trials of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in contrast media-induced nephropathy used creatinine as a marker of renal function. However, it has been suggested that NAC may lower plasma creatinine levels independent of any effects on glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Methods

At a tertiary hospital 110 cardiac surgical patients were randomly allocated to peri-operative infusion of NAC (300 mg/kg over 24 h, N = 30) or placebo (N = 80). We compared the plasma concentrations of creatinine, cystatin C and urea, the plasma creatinine/plasma cystatin C ratio and the estimated GFR at baseline and at 24 and 72 h after commencement of the infusion. We measured urinary creatinine concentration at 24 h.

Results

At baseline, the plasma creatinine/plasma cystatin C ratio did not differ between the NAC and placebo group (0.90 versus 0.92; P = 0.94). There was no significant difference in the plasma creatinine/plasma cystatin C ratio for the NAC and placebo group either during or after NAC infusion at 24 h (1.03 versus 1.00; P = 0.78) and 72 h (0.94 versus 0.89; P = 0.09). Those allocated to NAC showed no difference in urinary creatinine excretion when compared to placebo (P = 0.24).

Conclusions

The results of our study do not demonstrate that NAC artifactually lowers creatinine measured using the Jaffé method. (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00332631, NCT00334191).

### Urea-creatinine ratio in obstructive uropathy and renal hypertension… [^116cwPmm]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

An elevated ratio of blood urea nitrogen to serum creatinine was found in patients with severe urinary tract obstruction, and a lower ratio of urinary urea to creatinine was found in cases of renal ischemia. These findings are believed to be secondary, for the most part, to the slowing of the flow of urine through the renal tubule, with a resultant greater reabsorption of urea; this slowing, with obstruction, is from hydrostatic back pressure and, with renal ischemia, from a decrease in glomerular filtration rate. These ratios may be of practical value both in determining the relative role of obstruction in cases of impaired renal function and in differential function studies for renal hypertension.

### The decreased serum urea nitrogen-creatinine ratio… [^113RwLDi]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Sometimes, readily available laboratory data can provide valuable hidden information. Such is the case with the serum urea nitrogen–creatinine ratio. A normal ratio is 8: 1 to 10:

1. It is well known that an elevated ratio is seen in cases of prerenal or postrenal uremia. Less appreciated are the diagnostic possibilities suggested by a decreased serum urea nitrogen–creatinine ratio. Several clinical circumstances can lead to a decreased serum urea nitrogen–creatinine ratio. Jurado R, Mattix H. The Decreased Serum Urea Nitrogen–Creatinine Ratio.

### Even low levels of albumin in urine tied to worsened kidney disease… [^112qAEsd]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

For decades, researchers characterized normal albuminuria as a urine albumin-creatinine ratio of less than 30 mg/g. That has led some clinicians to believe that patients with lower ratios don't need additional treatment. But a new study in Annals of Internal Medicine challenges that assumption by showing that even low levels of albuminuria are a risk factor for kidney failure in people with chronic kidney disease. People with urine albumin-creatinine ratios of 15 mg/g or more had about a 5% to 6% greater absolute risk of kidney failure than those who had ratios of 5 to less than 15 mg/g and of 0 to 5 mg/g, respectively. The findings are based on data from more than 1600 participants across 7 US centers. Harris E. Even Low Levels of Albumin in Urine Tied to Worsened Kidney Disease. JAMA. 2024;
