## Question

when do you do naloxone iv 0.4mg vs 2mg for opioid reversal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to use IV naloxone 0.4 mg versus 2 mg for opioid reversal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial assessment of overdose severity and likely opioid involved. Then, I should verify how patient opioid tolerance affects dose selection. Next, I will review the FDA-labeled IV dosing range, onset, and titration principles. After that, I need to map indications to start at 0.4 mg versus 2 mg, including fentanyl-era considerations. Then, I will outline titration, monitoring, and infusion strategies. Finally, I should consider special populations, observation to prevent re-narcotization, and a concise algorithm that balances reversal efficacy with withdrawal risk [^115aT8vt].

> Let me first confirm the labeled framework so I do not anchor on tradition rather than evidence. The FDA labeling for IV naloxone in adults specifies an initial dose range of 0.4 to 2 mg IV, with repeat dosing and potential infusion as needed, noting IV provides the most rapid onset in emergencies and that opioid duration may exceed naloxone, requiring ongoing surveillance and redosing [^115npDGW] [^112eLD53] [^115aT8vt].

> Now, rapid bedside triage matters before committing to the starting dose. I need to check respiratory severity, distinguishing somnolence with hypoventilation from frank apnea or peri-arrest, and I should consider the opioid class and potency, including high-affinity synthetic opioids like fentanyl, and the patient's opioid tolerance or dependence, because both receptor affinity and dependence materially change dose-response and withdrawal risk [^113NTrfx].

> Wait, I almost said the FDA minimum initial dose is 0.04 mg, but that is not correct for labeled adult overdose management; the label states 0.4–2 mg IV as the initial range, whereas ultra-low dosing strategies like 0.04–0.1 mg come from case series and ED practice patterns aiming to avoid precipitated withdrawal in dependent patients, not from the adult overdose label per se [^115aT8vt] [^111Z69RV] [^114GksWL].

> When should I start with 0.4 mg IV. Let me think about scenarios where partial and gentle reversal is preferred. In opioid-dependent or tolerant patients, in post-operative settings where the goal is to restore ventilation while preserving analgesia, and in mild-to-moderate respiratory depression with some spontaneous respirations, starting at 0.4 mg IV and titrating every 2–3 minutes to effect minimizes abrupt withdrawal and cardiovascular stress, consistent with labeled guidance to titrate in small increments post-operatively and to the clinical target of adequate ventilation without full arousal [^111cNJot] [^111vrGa9] [^115aT8vt]. I should double-check that lower-than-label microdosing has clinical support; yes, small ED series and a systematic review suggest lower doses can restore ventilation with fewer adverse events, though the evidence quality is limited and dosing remains individualized [^111Z69RV] [^114GksWL].

> Conversely, when should I start with 2 mg IV. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to weigh time-critical hypoxia and receptor kinetics. In severe apnea or peri-arrest, when high-potency synthetic opioid exposure is likely, or when there is no response to a timely 0.4 mg trial, a 2 mg IV bolus is reasonable within the labeled range to achieve faster displacement at the receptor and restore ventilation, particularly in fentanyl-prevalent settings where low-dose initial strategies often fail and higher cumulative doses are commonly required [^115aT8vt] [^114dNgLU] [^113NTrfx]. But wait, what if I over-antagonize. In such time-sensitive cases, saving life takes precedence, with the understanding that withdrawal risk is managed after ventilatory recovery, as supported by emergency labeling and outbreak data [^115npDGW] [^114dNgLU].

> Next, I should review administration and immediate monitoring to ensure I titrate to a physiologic endpoint. IV naloxone acts within about 1–2 minutes; I will reassess respirations, oxygenation, mental status, and airway protection continuously, anticipating repeat dosing because naloxone's effect may wane before the opioid has cleared, which is emphasized in labeling across formulations [^112eLD53] [^115npDGW]. I need to ensure I am targeting adequate ventilation rather than full arousal, since over-reversal increases withdrawal, agitation, and refusal of care, a concern highlighted in clinical and policy discussions of over-antagonism [^111nZKSX].

> For titration and escalation, let me confirm the practical cadence. If I start at 0.4 mg IV, I should reassess after 2–3 minutes and repeat 0.4 mg increments until achieving adequate ventilation, commonly up to 2 mg total, with further escalation as needed in suspected synthetic opioid exposures where cumulative requirements of 4–10 mg or more have been documented in outbreaks, always paired with airway support and consideration for infusion when repeated redosing is needed [^114dNgLU] [^115npDGW]. If I start at 2 mg IV due to severity, I should similarly reassess every 2–3 minutes and repeat 2 mg if partial response, transitioning to a continuous infusion when recurrent sedation occurs or long-acting opioids are suspected, titrating the infusion to maintain ventilation per labeled guidance and buprenorphine reversal data [^115npDGW] [^115dLBrP].

> I will now examine special populations because they materially change the opening move. In opioid-dependent patients, I should consider ultra-low starting doses such as 0.04–0.1 mg IV with slow titration if time allows and ventilation is present, to reduce precipitous withdrawal, acknowledging this is off-label but supported by case series and ED practice reviews favoring fewer adverse events with lower initial doses [^111Z69RV] [^114GksWL]. In the post-operative context, labeled guidance supports 0.1–0.2 mg IV increments every 2–3 minutes to reverse respiratory depression while avoiding loss of analgesia or hemodynamic stress, so I should titrate carefully in small steps rather than giving 2 mg upfront unless the patient is apneic and unresponsive to smaller doses [^111cNJot]. For pediatric overdose, I should confirm weight-based dosing, with 0.01 mg/kg IV initially and 0.1 mg/kg if needed, recognizing this differs from adult fixed-dose strategies [^111cNJot]. For buprenorphine-related respiratory depression, I need to remember its high receptor affinity; bolus 2–4 mg may be required, and best reversal often uses a bolus followed by infusion, with awareness that responses can be incomplete and slower than with full agonists [^115dLBrP].

> Let me consider route issues briefly to ensure IV-specific decisions remain aligned with broader evidence. If IV access is delayed, IM naloxone provides rapid and reliable reversal and may outperform IN for speed to adequate ventilation in controlled studies, whereas IN can be effective with repeated dosing but often has a slower onset; once IV is available, the same 0.4 mg versus 2 mg decision logic applies, anchored to severity, potency, and tolerance [^112H64YY] [^115navMz] [^112eLD53]. I should confirm that these route comparisons do not change the core IV dosing rationale, which they do not; they mainly reinforce the principle of titrating to respiratory effect while considering pharmacokinetic onset differences by route [^112eLD53].

> I should confirm observation and re-narcotization planning, since naloxone is shorter-acting than many opioids. The label emphasizes continued surveillance and redosing or infusion as required, and ED data suggest that after heroin reversal, a two-hour observation captures most delayed intervention needs, though longer monitoring is prudent with long-acting or sustained-release opioids and in polysubstance exposures, with 4–6 hours commonly used when methadone or extended-release formulations are suspected [^115npDGW] [^113ZF96s] [^115cKhFY]. Hold on, I should verify that discharge criteria prioritize stable respirations without recurrent sedation for several hours, which aligns with these sources and standard practice [^113ZF96s].

> Putting this together as a bedside algorithm, I will start with 0.4 mg IV and titrate in small increments every 2–3 minutes for conventional opioid exposures with some spontaneous respirations, especially if opioid dependence is likely or if this is a post-operative patient where partial reversal is desired, and I will start with 2 mg IV when severe apnea or high-potency synthetic opioid exposure is likely or when 0.4 mg fails promptly, escalating to cumulative higher doses and infusion as needed while prioritizing ventilation as the endpoint, not full arousal [^115aT8vt] [^111cNJot] [^114dNgLU]. Throughout, I need to ensure airway and supportive measures, anticipate withdrawal particularly in dependent patients, and educate the team that over-antagonism can complicate engagement, but reversal of life-threatening hypoventilation takes priority with subsequent harm-reduction engagement once the patient is stabilized [^112eLD53] [^111vrGa9] [^111nZKSX].

Use **IV naloxone 0.4 mg** [^115aT8vt] as the initial dose for most opioid overdoses, titrating every 2–3 minutes [^115npDGW] to restore breathing while minimizing withdrawal [^111Z69RV]. Use **IV naloxone 2 mg** [^115aT8vt] when there is severe respiratory depression or suspected high-potency synthetic opioids (e.g. fentanyl) [^114dNgLU] that may require higher doses for reversal [^115npDGW]. Always titrate to effect [^115npDGW] and monitor for recurrence, as naloxone's duration may be shorter than the opioid's [^111vrGa9] [^115cKhFY].

## Clinical scenarios for 0.4 mg IV naloxone

Use the **0.4 mg IV dose** in the following scenarios:

- **Standard opioid overdose**: Typical heroin, morphine, or oxycodone overdoses with moderate respiratory depression [^115aT8vt].

- **Opioid-dependent patients**: To avoid precipitated withdrawal, start low and titrate [^111Z69RV] [^11227LeZ].

- **Postoperative opioid reversal**: Titrate 0.1–0.2 mg increments every 2–3 minutes to adequate ventilation and alertness [^111cNJot].

- **General titration strategy**: Start low and titrate every 2–3 minutes until adequate ventilation is achieved [^115npDGW].

---

## Clinical scenarios for 2 mg IV naloxone

Use the **2 mg IV dose** in the following scenarios:

- **Severe respiratory depression**: Apnea or near-apnea requiring rapid reversal [^115aT8vt].

- **High-potency synthetic opioids**: Suspected fentanyl or analogs that often need higher doses [^114dNgLU] [^115navMz].

- **Unknown opioid exposure**: Severe depression when the opioid is unknown and rapid reversal is critical [^115npDGW].

- **Partial agonist overdose**: Buprenorphine or pentazocine may require higher or repeated doses [^111vrGa9] [^11227LeZ] [^115dLBrP].

## Risks and benefits of 0.4 mg vs. 2 mg doses

| **Aspect** | **0.4 mg** | **2 mg** |
|-|-|-|
| Benefits | - Lower withdrawal risk <br/> - Preserves analgesia <br/> - Suitable for opioid-dependent patients [^111Z69RV] [^114GksWL] | - Rapid reversal of severe depression <br/> - Effective for potent synthetics [^115aT8vt] [^115navMz] |
| Risks | - May be insufficient for potent synthetics <br/> - May require repeated dosing [^114dNgLU] [^113ZF96s] | - Higher withdrawal risk <br/> - Potential cardiovascular stress [^111vrGa9] [^11227LeZ] |

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Initial dose**: 0.4–2 mg IV, titrated every 2–3 minutes to effect [^115npDGW] [^115aT8vt].

- **Opioid-dependent patients**: Start at 0.04–0.1 mg and titrate to avoid withdrawal [^111Z69RV] [^111vrGa9].

- **High-potency synthetics**: Consider higher initial doses (up to 2 mg) and repeat as needed [^114dNgLU] [^115navMz].

- **Postoperative reversal**: Titrate 0.1–0.2 mg increments every 2–3 minutes [^111cNJot].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dose selection

Opioid tolerance can necessitate higher **naloxone doses**, whereas dependence favors lower, carefully titrated dosing [^111Z69RV] [^113NTrfx]. Cardiovascular comorbidities warrant cautious titration to avoid stress [^111vrGa9] [^11227LeZ]. Elderly patients may require lower, carefully titrated doses because of comorbidities and sensitivity [^111cNJot]. High-potency synthetic opioid exposures often require higher initial doses [^114dNgLU] [^115navMz].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Continuous monitoring is essential to detect **recurrent respiratory depression**, because naloxone's effect may be shorter than the opioid's [^115npDGW] [^115cKhFY]. If respiratory depression recurs, administer additional doses or initiate an infusion [^115npDGW] [^111cNJot]. Also monitor for and treat withdrawal symptoms, especially in opioid-dependent patients [^111vrGa9] [^11227LeZ].

---

Use **0.4 mg IV naloxone for most overdoses** [^115aT8vt], titrating to effect [^115npDGW], and **reserve 2 mg IV for severe depression or suspected high-potency synthetics** [^115aT8vt] [^114dNgLU] [^115navMz]; always titrate and monitor for recurrence and withdrawal [^111vrGa9] [^111Z69RV].

### Reversal of opioid-induced ventilatory depression using low-dose naloxone (0.04 mg): a case series [^111Z69RV]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Naloxone is commonly administered in the emergency department (ED) to reverse opioid intoxication. Several naloxone dose recommendations exist for the acute management of opioid intoxication based on limited published clinical data. A case series of ED patients with opioid-induced ventilatory depression that was reversed using low-dose naloxone (0.04 mg with titration) is presented.

- **Methods**: ED patients with opioid-induced ventilatory depression requiring naloxone administration were identified through medical toxicology consultation. A retrospective review of medical records was performed. Collected data included patient history, as well as pre- and post-naloxone data, including respiratory rate (RR), pulse oximetry (pulse ox), end-tidal CO2 level (ET-CO2), and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS).

- **Results**: Fifteen ED patients with moderate to severe opioid-induced ventilatory depression (median RR, 6 breaths/min) who were managed using a low-dose naloxone strategy were identified. Twelve of the 15 patients reported ingestion of methadone (range, 30 to 180 mg). The median naloxone dose of 0.08 mg (range, 0.04 to 0.12 mg) effectively reversed opioid-induced ventilatory and CNS depression. However, two patients experienced acute opioid withdrawal after receiving 0.08 mg.

- **Conclusion**: ED patients with moderate to severe opioid-induced ventilatory depression can be effectively reversed using 0.04 mg IV naloxone with appropriate dose titration.

### Misuse of novel synthetic opioids: A deadly new trend [^114dNgLU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Naloxone is a competitive μ-opioid receptor antagonist that serves as an effective antidote for opioid overdose. The recommended initial dose of naloxone is 0.4 to 2 mg; however, it is known that doses of 10 to 20 mg may be required to reverse the effects of potent synthetic opioids.

Emergency department data from a fentanyl outbreak in Chicago during 2005 to 2006 revealed that the standard 0.4 mg naloxone dose was only successful in reversing 15% of cases, and the mean naloxone dose required for rescue was 3.36 mg. Despite initial naloxone doses exceeding 2 mg, no withdrawal symptoms or other adverse effects were noted in this study. Given these data and the increasing prevalence of IMF and NSO, it seems logical to increase the standard initial naloxone dose from 0.4 to 2 mg.

Currently, there are two forms of naloxone available for emergency use in community settings — an intramuscular autoinjector manufactured by Kaléo Pharma and a 4 mg nasal spray manufactured by Adapt Pharma. Kaléo received US FDA approval on October 19, 2016, to begin manufacturing a 2 mg autoinjector, and this has recently replaced its 0.4 mg formulation. Concerns have been raised regarding the efficacy of intranasal naloxone in reversing overdose from synthetic opioids. However, the basis for such concerns involved a 2 mg dosage, and the formulation for intranasal delivery is 4 mg.

A randomized controlled trial comparing intranasal and intramuscular naloxone of the same dosage for suspected heroin overdose concluded similar efficacy, and both routes could be used as first-line treatment.

### Naloxone hydrochloride [^115npDGW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Naloxone hydrochloride injection may be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. The most rapid onset of action is achieved by intravenous administration, which is recommended in emergency situations. Since the duration of action of some opioids may exceed that of naloxone, the patient should be kept under continued surveillance. Repeated doses of naloxone should be administered as necessary.

- **Intravenous infusion**: Naloxone hydrochloride injection may be diluted for intravenous infusion in normal saline or 5% dextrose solutions. The addition of 2 mg of naloxone in 500 mL of either solution provides a concentration of 0.004 mg/mL. Mixtures should be used within 24 hours. After 24 hours, the remaining unused mixture must be discarded. The rate of administration should be titrated in accordance with the patient's response.

Naloxone hydrochloride injection should not be mixed with preparations containing bisulfite, metabisulfite, long-chain or high molecular weight anions, or any solution having an alkaline pH. No drug or chemical agent should be added to naloxone hydrochloride injection unless its effect on the chemical and physical stability of the solution has first been established.

- **General**: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

- **Usage in adults**: Opioid overdose — known or suspected: an initial dose of 0.4 mg to 2 mg of naloxone hydrochloride may be administered intravenously. If the desired degree of c

### Naloxone counseling for harm reduction and patient engagement [^114b3pq1]. Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid-related deaths. Naloxone, the drug of choice for reversing acute opioid overdose, is not routinely prescribed for outpatient use. The aims of this project were to improve naloxone awareness, increase naloxone prescribing, and prevent opioid overdoses.

- **Methods**: A naloxone counseling intervention was implemented in three family health centers by an interprofessional team of providers including family medicine physicians, clinical pharmacists, and social workers. An outreach letter was designed with provider input, an electronic order set was developed to facilitate prescribing, and intranasal naloxone kits were assembled for free dispensing. Providers and staff received education about opioid overdose and naloxone prescribing. Faculty and resident physicians were surveyed before and after the intervention to assess their attitudes. Patients who received naloxone kits were surveyed to assess their attitudes and use of opioids and naloxone.

- **Results**: Over 16 months, 71 outreach letters were distributed and 97 naloxone kits were dispensed. The majority of kits were prescribed for illicit opioid use. Faculty and resident physician surveys indicated improved knowledge about naloxone prescribing and increased professional satisfaction in caring for patients requesting opioids. Surveyed patients endorsed high levels of comfort discussing opioid use with their primary care physician. Five successful opioid overdose reversals were reported.

- **Conclusions**: An interprofessional naloxone counseling intervent.

### New formulation of sustained release naloxone can reverse opioid induced constipation without compromising the desired opioid effects [^1153YCw5]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

An international double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of four doses of a new sustained release naloxone capsule to treat opioid-induced constipation (OIC).

- **Methods**: Forty patients taking opioids for non-cancer-related pain and experiencing OIC were randomized into four cohorts of ten patients each. A multiple ascending dose design was used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg naloxone sustained release (NSR) capsules compared to placebo. The drug was administered once daily for three weeks, followed by twice-daily (bid) dosing between weeks four and six.

- **Results**: The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was highest in the placebo group. The incidence of adverse events among the four active treatment groups was similar. No serious adverse events were reported, and the number of severe events was low overall, but highest in the placebo group. Significant improvements in spontaneous bowel movements were observed with 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg NSR capsules. Mean changes in SBM from baseline of 2.21 (P = 0.052), 2.37 (P = 0.032), 4.11 (P = 0.0005), and 5.19 (P < 0.0001) were noted with NSR at 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg, respectively, compared with 1.38 (P = 0.2) for patients on placebo therapy. No changes in subjective or objective measures of opioid withdrawal, as measured by the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale or Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale, were observed. There was no increase in patient-reported pain as measured daily using a visual analogue scale.

- **Conclusions**: This Phase II study has shown that using a new sustained release naloxone formulation can effectively reverse opioid-induced constipation without compromising the desired opioid effects.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^115dM434]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Our particular focus has been the study of concentrated naloxone nasal spray to identify a dose and formulation comparable to intramuscular (i.m.) 0.4 mg and similarly appropriate for dose titration, as currently recommended for the i.m. dose. Our exploratory dose simulations indicate that a 2 mg intranasal (i.n.) dose provides an opportunity for titration, with administration of a second 2 mg i.n. dose resulting in naloxone exposure similar to a series of five i.m. 0.4 mg doses (i.e. 2 mg i.m. in total). Such an i.n. schedule would straddle the overall dose range of an 'initial [injectable] dose between 0.4 mg–2 mg', as recommended by the WHO.

The possibility of incremental dose titration presents distinct advantages, as it could significantly reduce the risk of adverse reactions. High initial naloxone doses may trigger severe sudden-onset opioid withdrawal. A recent qualitative analysis of cases of heroin/opioid overdose reversals identified apparent excessive naloxone dosing ('over-antagonism'), sometimes triggering patient self-discharge and active further drug-seeking behavior. In addition to pharmacological toxicity, such 'behavioral toxicity' needs to be considered. Withdrawal symptoms can be particularly challenging for overdose witnesses to manage in a community setting. Simulation of repeat administration of the 2 mg i.n. dose produced roughly equivalent plasma naloxone levels to a single 4 mg i.n. dose. Administering a single 2 mg i.n. dose at first and following up with a second 2 mg i.n. dose only if needed could lower the risk of naloxone 'over-antagonism' and improve safety.

### Narcan naloxone HCl [^11227LeZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Additional supportive and/or resuscitative measures may be helpful while awaiting emergency medical assistance.

- **Dosage forms and strengths**: Nasal spray: 2 mg and 4 mg of naloxone hydrochloride in 0.1 mL.

- **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity to naloxone hydrochloride.

- **Warnings and precautions**:

	- **Risk of respiratory and CNS depression**: Due to the duration of action of naloxone relative to the opioid, keep the patient under continued surveillance and administer repeat doses of naloxone using a new nasal spray with each dose, as necessary, while awaiting emergency medical assistance.

	- **Risk of limited efficacy with partial agonists or mixed agonists/antagonists**: Reversal of respiratory depression caused by partial agonists or mixed agonists/antagonists, such as buprenorphine and pentazocine, may be incomplete. Larger or repeat doses may be required.

	- **Precipitation of severe opioid withdrawal**: Use in patients who are opioid dependent may precipitate opioid withdrawal. In neonates, opioid withdrawal may be life-threatening if not recognized and properly treated. Monitor for the development of opioid withdrawal.

	- **Risk of cardiovascular (CV) effects**: Abrupt postoperative reversal of opioid depression may result in adverse CV effects. These events have primarily occurred in patients who had pre-existing CV disorders or received other drugs that may have similar adverse CV effects. Monitor these patients closely in an appropriate healthcare setting after use of naloxone hydrochloride.

### Pentazocine and naloxone [^115ucYYH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There are no standard opioid tapering schedules suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates creating a patient-specific plan to gradually taper the opioid dose. For patients on pentazocine and naloxone tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small increment (e.g. no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods may tolerate a more rapid taper.

It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms may also develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper.

Additionally, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period and/or with high doses for chronic conditions, careful monitoring is essential.

### Revex [^1153Xrjb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2007). Low credibility.

The recommended doses for the reversal of postoperative opioid depression and management of known or suspected opioid overdose are detailed below.

- **Reversal of postoperative opioid depression**: Use 100 µg/mL dosage strength (blue label) and refer to Table 2 for initial doses. The goal of treatment with Revex in a postoperative setting is to reverse excessive opioid effects without inducing a complete reversal and acute pain. This is best accomplished with an initial dose of 0.25 µg/kg, followed by 0.25 µg/kg incremental doses at 2–5 minute intervals, stopping as soon as the desired degree of opioid reversal is obtained. A cumulative total dose above 1.0 µg/kg does not provide additional therapeutic effect. In cases where the patient is known to be at increased cardiovascular risk, it may be desirable to dilute Revex 1:1 with saline or sterile water and use smaller initial and incremental doses of 0.1 µg/kg.

- **Management of known or suspected opioid overdose**: Use 1.0 mg/mL dosage strength (green label). The recommended initial dose of Revex for non-opioid dependent patients is 0.5 mg/70 kg. If needed, this may be followed by a second dose of 1.0 mg/70 kg, 2–5 minutes later. If a total dose of 1.5 mg/70 kg has been administered without clinical response, additional Revex (nalmefene hydrochloride injection) is unlikely to have an effect. Patients should not be given more Revex than is required to restore the respiratory rate to normal, thus minimizing the likelihood of cardiovascular stress and precipitated withdrawal syndrome. If there is a reasonable suspicion of opioid dependency, a challenge dose of Revex 0.1 mg/70 kg should be administered initially.

### A comparison of intramuscular (Zimhi) and intranasal naloxone (Narcan) in reversal of fentanyl-induced apnea: a randomized, crossover, open-label trial [^113NP722]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In this randomized, open-label trial, we compared the number of required intramuscular (IM) versus intranasal (IN) naloxone doses in their ability to effectively reverse fentanyl-induced apnea. We studied healthy individuals and a small exploratory sample of participants who use a daily average of 200 morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs).

- **Effectiveness of IM and IN naloxone**: In both populations, IM naloxone was more effective in reversing fentanyl-induced apnea compared to IN naloxone, without a need for intravenous rescue naloxone. The median times to restoration of ventilation to baseline levels were similar: 2.3 minutes in opioid-naïve individuals and 2.4 minutes in chronic opioid users following IM naloxone. In contrast, IN naloxone administration was less effective; one extra dose was needed. Intravenous rescue naloxone was required to restore adequate breathing activity in 1 healthy participant (6.3%) and 2 participants who use daily opioids (40%), with median recovery times of 3.4 minutes (healthy volunteers) and 7.3 minutes (chronic opioid users).

- **Consequences of opioid-induced apnea**: Opioid-induced apnea followed by cardiac arrest results from hypoxia and possibly direct opioid effects on the heart through an opioid effect on potassium channels. This leads to significant mortality and morbidity given the large number of individuals who abuse potent opioids, particularly in the US and Canada, but also in other countries. In the US alone, 80,000 people died from an opioid overdose in 2023. Dealing with potent opioid-induced respiratory depression, apnea, and cardiac arrest poses a significant challenge due to the recent substantial increase in the strength of illegally consumed opioids.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^115usEHY]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Study participants**: Thirty-eight subjects (age 20–54 years) were randomized, with 27 males and 11 females. Prior to period 2 dosing, there were four subject discontinuations: three subjects tested positive for drugs of abuse, and one subject withdrew consent. The protocol allowed for the substitution of subjects, leading to the randomization of three additional participants to the next scheduled treatment sequence, thereby exceeding the original enrollment target of 35 subjects. Overall, six subjects did not complete the study. Specifically, six missed the 0.4 mg i.m. session; five missed the 1 mg i.n. session; four missed the 4 mg i.n. and 0.4 mg i.v. sessions; and two missed the 2 mg i.n. session. These 21 sessions were classified as missing data. Consequently, sample sizes were as follows: n = 32 (0.4 mg i.m.), n = 33 (1 mg i.n.), n = 34 (4 mg i.n. 0.4 mg i.v.), and n = 36 (2 mg i.n.), unless specified otherwise.

- **Safety**: No severe adverse events (AEs) occurred. In total, 17 of the 38 subjects experienced 24 AEs, with 11 AEs in nine subjects assessed as naloxone-related. AE occurrence did not appear to be dose-related; seven subjects experienced AEs following a 2 mg i.n. dose, while only three subjects experienced AEs following a 4 mg i.n. dose.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^112Ryg16]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

The 2 mg intranasal (i.n.) dose produced a speed of onset and early exposure comparable to a 0.4 mg intramuscular (i.m.) dose, while maintaining plasma levels for the next 2 hours at twice the level of the i.m. reference. Plasma concentrations from 2 mg i.n. exceeded those from 0.4 mg i.m. within 6 minutes post-dosing on average. The focus on this 2 mg i.n. dose may be particularly applicable to emergency administration using a dose-escalation schedule as recommended with i.m. doses 16, 18, 19, starting at 0.4 mg and increased at intervals (e.g. 3-minute intervals) to a total of 2 mg. A comparable i.n. dose-escalation schedule would involve an initial 2 mg dose to achieve onset comparable to i.m. 0.4 mg, followed by a second 2 mg i.n. dose 3 minutes later; this is the hypothetical schedule examined in the repeat-dosing simulation. As the second i.n. dose is given to the unused nostril, absorption from both administrations should be equal, and the similarity between the simulation and the 4 mg tested dose supports this assumption. Furthermore, the sustained plasma concentrations for the 2 mg i.n. dose compared with the i.m. reference may benefit post-resuscitation care. Given that the half-life of some opioids exceeds substantially that of naloxone (1–1.5 h), sustained plasma naloxone concentrations from i.n. administration would probably reduce the risk of rebound toxicity when naloxone concentrations drop following intravenous (i.v.) or i.m. administration.

- **Strengths and limitations of the study**: Further investigations are required to confirm these findings across different patient populations and emergency contexts.

### Suboxone [^115SUwwf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine in intravenous (2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, and 16 mg) and sublingual (12 mg) doses has been administered to non-dependent subjects to examine cardiovascular, respiratory, and subjective effects at doses comparable to those used for treatment of opioid dependence. Compared with placebo, there were no statistically significant differences among any of the treatment conditions for blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, O2 saturation, or skin temperature across time. Systolic blood pressure was higher in the 8 mg group than placebo (3-hour AUC values). Minimum and maximum effects were similar across all treatments. Subjects remained responsive to low voice and responded to computer prompts. Some subjects showed irritability, but no other changes were observed.

The respiratory effects of sublingual buprenorphine were compared with the effects of methadone in a double-blind, parallel group, dose-ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg) and oral methadone (15, 30, 45, or 60 mg) in non-dependent, opioid-experienced volunteers. In this study, hypoventilation not requiring medical intervention was reported more frequently after buprenorphine doses of 4 mg and higher than after methadone. Both drugs decreased O2 saturation to the same degree.

Physiologic and subjective effects following acute sublingual administration of Suboxone and Subutex tablets were similar at equivalent dose levels of buprenorphine. Naloxone, in the Suboxone formulation, had no clinically significant impact on results.

### Naloxone dosing in the era of synthetic opioids: Applying the Goldilocks principle [^116nZA5q]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

The opioid overdose epidemic remains a critical public health crisis. In recent years, synthetic opioids like fentanyl and nitazenes have driven a sharp rise in deaths. Naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, has been established as a key intervention for reversing opioid overdoses and saving lives. However, there remains a critical need to optimize naloxone dosing strategies. This article examines the challenges of both under-dosing and over-antagonism in naloxone administration, emphasizing the importance of a tailored approach to overdose management. A 'just the right dose' approach is essential for minimizing the risks of over-antagonism while still reversing opioid overdose. This involves starting with a modest naloxone dose and carefully titrating it based on the patient's response, considering factors such as opioid type, overdose severity, and opioid tolerance. A tailored approach to naloxone dosing may present challenges for non-medically trained responders, but it can ensure that as many people as possible receive the right dose of naloxone when they need it. Training programs should also emphasize the importance of first aid and supportive care, including airway management and alerting emergency services, as well as careful monitoring of the patient's response.

### A comparison of intramuscular (Zimhi) and intranasal naloxone (Narcan) in reversal of fentanyl-induced apnea: a randomized, crossover, open-label trial [^115navMz]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The mode (frequency) and median (interquartile range, IQR) number of IM naloxone doses to achieve return to baseline ventilation were 1 (50%) and 1.5 (IQR 1 to 2), respectively, versus 2 (56%) and 2 (IQR 1 to 3) for intranasal naloxone, with a median difference of 1 (0.5 to 1.5, p = 0.0002). In one subject, reversal with 2 IN doses of naloxone was insufficient, and 0.4 mg intravenous naloxone was administered due to a significantly increased PCO2 level in the absence of adequate breathing activity. In none of the subjects was rescue IV naloxone indicated following administration of IM naloxone. Arithmetically adding the IV dose as a regular IN dose resulted in a change in the mode and median dose to 2 (50%) and 2.5 (IQR 1.5 to 3.5, IN vs. IM: p = 0.0001).

Time to full reversal is presented in the Kaplan-Meier curve in Fig. 3. It shows that 2 minutes after the first naloxone dose, full reversal of OIRD was achieved in seven subjects (44%) after IM, but only in one subject (6%) following IN naloxone administration. After 4 minutes, full reversal was observed in 100% (n = 16) of IM and 63% (n = 10) of IN-treated subjects. Complete reversal with IN naloxone was observed in all subjects after 9.2 minutes (n = 16), with significant differences between the two administration forms (IM: 3.9 minutes; log-rank test: p = 0.0002). On average, the time to reversal was 2.2 ± 0.8 minutes (mean ± SD; n = 16) after IM naloxone and 4.0 ± 2.0 minutes after IN naloxone, with a mean difference of 2.0 minutes (95% CI 1.1 to 2.9 minutes, p = 0.002). Median reversal times were 2.3 (IQR 0.9) minutes after IM and 3.4 (1.6) minutes after IN naloxone.

### Comparison of intranasal and intramuscular naloxone in opioid overdoses managed by ambulance staff: a double-dummy, randomised, controlled trial [^112Jz7Y8]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

In conclusion, this study showed that 1.4 mg/0.1 mL intranasal (IN) naloxone was less efficient, owing to a slower onset, than 0.8 mg intramuscular (IM) naloxone in terms of return of spontaneous breathing within 10 minutes in participants with serious opioid overdoses, and that 0.8 mg IM naloxone had an almost 100% success rate. However, notably, 1.4 mg/0.1 mL IN naloxone restored breathing in 80% of participants after one dose and was associated with few and mild adverse reactions, allowing for titration.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115oyzQ8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend allowing 7–14 days to elapse between the last dose of buprenorphine and the start of naltrexone. This period is crucial when considering a transition from buprenorphine to naltrexone to ensure that the patient is not physically dependent on opioids before starting naltrexone.

### Naloxone hydrochloride [^111vrGa9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings**: Naloxone hydrochloride should be administered cautiously to individuals, including newborns of mothers known or suspected to be physically dependent on opioids. In such cases, an abrupt and complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome.

- **Drug dependence**: The signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal in a patient physically dependent on opioids may include, but are not limited to, the following:
	- **General symptoms**: body aches, diarrhea, fever, sweating, yawning, nausea or vomiting, weakness, increased blood pressure
	- **Respiratory or nasal symptoms**: runny nose, sneezing
	- **Neurological symptoms**: tachycardia, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, shivering or trembling, piloerection, abdominal cramps
	- **In neonates**: convulsions, excessive crying, hyperactive reflexes

- **Repeat administration**: The patient who has satisfactorily responded to naloxone hydrochloride should be kept under continued surveillance. Repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride should be administered as necessary, since the duration of action of some opioids may exceed that of naloxone hydrochloride.

- **Respiratory depression due to other drugs**:
	- Naloxone hydrochloride is not effective against respiratory depression due to non-opioid drugs and in managing acute toxicity caused by levopropoxyphene.
	- Reversal of respiratory depression by partial agonists or mixed agonist/antagonists, such as buprenorphine and pentazocine, may be incomplete or require higher doses of naloxone.
	- If an incomplete response occurs, respirations should be mechanically assisted as clinically indicated.

### Characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder associated with performing overdose reversals in the community: An opioid treatment program analysis [^112TiH3D]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Our prior study suggests that providing opioid overdose education and take-home naloxone to opioid treatment program (OTP) patients can significantly increase overdose reversals in the community. In this study, characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) who had significantly greater odds of performing naloxone overdose reversals included younger age, previously witnessing an opioid overdose, receiving emergency room care for overdose, and having positive urine toxicology screens. By targeting certain patients based on their characteristics and supplying this patient population with additional support, overdose reversals may be increased substantially more in the community. It is possible that this targeted subset of patients might be interested in being trained as "harm reduction peer educators" within their community, which could help further reduce opioid overdose deaths and bridge the gap between clinical and public health efforts related to naloxone distribution.

The findings in this analysis may differ in other regions of the U.S. or internationally. Because our findings seem to be partly dependent on social variables and connectivity, it may be valuable for other regions around the country to investigate their own OTP populations to discover which characteristics increase the likelihood of people performing overdose reversals in their community.

In future studies, we plan to ask study participants ethnographic, qualitative interview questions regarding their thoughts and feelings about performing overdose reversals.

### An innovative model for naloxone use within an OTP setting: A prospective cohort study [^1176oPK8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

As a pure opioid antagonist, naloxone safely reverses the effects of opioid overdose and has been used for decades to resuscitate patients in hospital settings. Since 1996, naloxone has been an integral harm reduction tool for community-based overdose education and naloxone distribution programs. In fact, the epidemic of drug overdoses among people who inject drugs (PWID) using heroin is worldwide, and there is growing evidence to support the provision of naloxone to patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). In the US, opioid overdose is the single greatest cause of mortality among PWID and accounts for more than half of all deaths among people who inject opioids.

Many community studies suggest that PWID rarely overdose while alone and consistently report a high frequency of witnessing overdose events. Moreover, the highest risk for future overdose among PWID seems to be a history of one's own prior overdose. PWID also report reluctance to contact emergency medical services (EMS) upon witnessing an overdose, and most fatal overdoses occur in private locations such as homes and hotels. Qualitative research with PWID indicates that fear of police is a significant barrier to calling EMS during an overdose event. Even when EMS is called to the scene of an opioid overdose, there are significant regional (rural vs. urban) differences regarding response times, and overdose reversal outcomes directly correspond to the level of first responder training. Previous community outreach studies with naloxone have shown that opioid overdose education and distribution of naloxone significantly improve outcomes.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^116X7Yhe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Very low dose**: A 1 mg solution would be less than a tablet dose of 2 mg.
- **Low dose**: A 4 mg solution approximates a 6 mg tablet dose.
- **Moderate dose**: An 8 mg solution approximates a 12 mg tablet dose.
- **High dose**: A 16 mg solution approximates a 24 mg tablet dose.

The safety of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film during treatment induction is supported by a clinical trial using 16 patients treated with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film and 18 treated with a buprenorphine-only sublingual film. Few differences in the adverse event profiles were noted between buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film and the buprenorphine-only sublingual film.

The most common adverse event occurring during treatment induction and the three days following induction using buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film was restlessness. Other adverse events included anxiety, piloerection, stomach discomfort, irritability, headache, rhinorrhea, cold sweat, arthralgia, and increased lacrimation.

Four subjects left the study early on the first day of sublingual film administration. However, there was no evidence to suggest that any of the four subjects experienced precipitated withdrawal secondary to the administration of buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual films.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a context.

### Low-dose naloxone does not improve morphine-induced nausea, vomiting, or pruritus [^114NW5Zs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We tested the hypothesis that low-dose naloxone delivered with intravenous (IV) bolus morphine to emergency department patients in pain would reduce nausea.

- **Methods**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients receiving 0.10 mg/kg morphine IV bolus rated pain, nausea, and pruritus on 100-mm visual analog scales at enrollment and 20 minutes. Patients were randomized to 0.25 microg/kg naloxone or an equal volume placebo administered with IV morphine.

- **Results**: One hundred thirty-one enrolled, 99 (76%) treated according to protocol with sufficient data for analysis. At 20 minutes, the difference between groups (naloxone-placebo) was 1 mm (95% CI [confidence interval], -9 to 11) for nausea, 1 mm (95% CI, -3 to 3) for pruritus, 4% (95% CI, -1 to 9) for vomiting, and 0% (95% CI, -5 to 5) for rescue antiemetics. Pain was significantly reduced in both groups.

- **Conclusion**: Addition of 0.25 microg/kg naloxone to bolus morphine does not improve nausea, pruritus, vomiting, or reduce use of rescue antiemetics when administered to emergency department patients in pain.

### Characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder associated with performing overdose reversals in the community: An opioid treatment program analysis [^111oj2fV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The primary outcome of this study is to identify characteristics of study participants in a large opioid treatment program (OTP) for opioid use disorder (OUD) who used take-home naloxone to perform one or more opioid overdose (OD) reversals in the community.

This 6-month prospective cohort study provided take-home naloxone and opioid OD education to 287 study participants with OUD. Characteristics associated with the use of the take-home naloxone were determined from among 16 variables using multivariable logistic regression.

The study participants who had greater odds of using the take-home naloxone to perform OD reversals, compared to those who did not use the take-home naloxone, were:

- **Received emergency room care for OD themselves**: OR = 4.89, 95% CI 1.54–15.52, P = 0.007.
- **Previously witnessed someone else OD**: OR = 5.67, 95% CI 1.24–25.87, P = 0.025.
- **Tested positive for two or more illicit substances at their 6-month urine analysis**: OR = 5.26, 95% CI 1.58–17.54, P = 0.007.
- **Missing their 6-month urine analysis**: OR = 3.46, 95% CI 1.42–8.43, P = 0.006.
- **Less than 30 years old**: OR = 2.80, 95% CI 1.02–7.66, P = 0.045.
- **Hispanic**: OR = 3.98, 95% CI 1.41–11.21, P = 0.009.

This study prospectively identified several characteristics of patients enrolled in an OTP with increased odds of using take-home naloxone in their social networks. Future harm reduction efforts may benefit by using targeted characteristics to identify those most likely to use naloxone in their communities.

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^113qC5Ck]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

For the efficacy study (Fig. 5g–i; antagonists administered at 60 µmol kg−1; single i.v. dose), while both treatments reversed opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) after the first fentanyl dose, naloxone-treated rats experienced significant hyperventilation and severe convulsions, unlike AG10-L-E2-Naloxone-treated animals (Fig. 5g). Four rats died in the vehicle group. Both treatments showed high plasma naloxone concentrations at 6 h (750 nM for naloxone and 60 nM for naloxone released from AG10-L-E2-Naloxone) and at 24 h (395 nM and 44 nM, respectively). However, neither treatment effectively protected against OIRD after the second (6 h) and third (24 h) fentanyl doses (Fig. 5h, i). These findings suggest that very high initial naloxone levels may harm animals or alter the μ-opioid receptors, reducing the effectiveness of naloxone over time. There have been rare reports of fatal naloxone-induced pulmonary edema in humans at high doses. We believe prodrugs like AG10-L-E2-Naloxone could help investigate these effects further.

AG10-L-E2-Naloxone is a potential preventive and prophylactic agent against fentanyl-induced mortality and OIRD. To compensate for the lower efficacy of AG10-L-E2-Naloxone in the first 30 min after dosing, we combined the prodrug with a small amount of free naloxone. A single s.c. dose of AG10-L-E2-Naloxone (60 µmol kg−1) and naloxone (3 µmol kg−1; equivalent to 1 mg kg−1) provided excellent efficacy, fully reversing OIRD after all three fentanyl doses without causing severe hyperventilation or convulsions, indicating a low risk of withdrawal symptoms (Fig. 6a–d).

### Prescribe to prevent: Overdose prevention and naloxone rescue kits for prescribers and pharmacists [^112ZoppE]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Medical providers and pharmacists should understand, explain to patients, and take actions to reduce overdose risk. The following should be considered when assessing a patient's risk.

- **Previous overdose history**: A previous nonfatal overdose is associated with future overdose risk.

- **Opioid dosage and formulation changes**: Higher opioid doses, such as daily doses higher than 50 morphine milliequivalents, and changes in dose or formulations increase overdose risk. People who use heroin are often at risk due to unpredictable changes in substance purity, such as adulteration with fentanyl.

- **Polypharmacy and substance mixing**: Mixing substances contributes to overdose risk, as opioid overdoses commonly involve other substances. Psychoactive medications of particular concern include barbiturates, stimulants, and benzodiazepines. Other medications that can have synergistically central nervous system depressive effects include clonidine, promethazine, and gabapentin.

- **Social isolation**: Socially isolated individuals who use prescription opioids or heroin alone have little chance of being rescued. Isolation is also associated with depression, which is itself associated with overdose.

- **Chronic medical illnesses**: Chronic illnesses affecting organs such as the lungs, liver, kidney, and brain — primarily responsible for metabolizing substances and respiration — can compromise the body's ability to handle opioids.

- **Periods of abstinence**: Periods of abstinence, such as during incarceration, hospitalization, and medical detoxification, cause reduced opioid tolerance and thus increased overdose risk.

### Comparisons of analgesic potency and side effects of buprenorphine and buprenorphine with ultra-low-dose naloxone [^112imYwP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Opioids are the most effective pain medication available, yet concerns about their safety may limit their administration to those in need. In efforts to identify analgesics with lower potential for abuse and dependence, recent evidence suggests that combinations of opioids with ultra-low doses of the opioid antagonist naloxone may enhance the analgesic effect with increased safety. This study investigated the use of buprenorphine (0.3 mg) plus ultra-low-dose naloxone (0.02 mg) (BUP + ULDN) as compared with buprenorphine alone (0.3 mg) (BUP) for the treatment of pain.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over design, 12 study participants with lingering, noncancer pain received each medication intravenously for 5 days of dosing, separated by an intertrial interval of at least 7 days to avoid possible carryover effects.

- **Results**: We found no order effects and no differences between medications in pre- to postdose pain ratings, side effects, or adverse events.

- **Conclusions**: These findings suggest that BUP + ULDN is not more effective in reducing pain than BUP.

### Comparison of intranasal and intramuscular naloxone in opioid overdoses managed by ambulance staff: a double-dummy, randomised, controlled trial [^112H64YY]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

A single dose of 1.4 mg/0.1 mL intranasal (IN) naloxone was inferior to 0.8 mg intramuscular (IM) naloxone in terms of return to spontaneous breathing at 10 minutes after administration. In the IM naloxone group, 97% of cases achieved the primary endpoint, which outperformed our expectation of 88%. After a single 1.4 mg/0.1 mL spray, 80% achieved satisfactory respiration within 10 minutes. This likely resulted from an average slower uptake of naloxone in the IN group. After 3 minutes, the stronger effect of IM became evident, and within the follow-up of 10 minutes, the effect of naloxone was 2.3 minutes slower in the IN group than in the IM group.

The nasal effect curve was linear from about 3 minutes until censoring at 10 minutes, where non-responders were administered additional IM naloxone according to protocol. Previous pharmacokinetic studies have shown that IN serum concentration continues to rise after 10 minutes, and measurement beyond 10 minutes would likely show an overall similar potency between IM and IN. Both 0.8 mg IM and 1.4 mg/0.1 mL IN naloxone showed few and mostly mild adverse reactions, with no difference in the overall risk of adverse reactions, overdose complications, follow-up after treatment, or notable opioid overdose recurrence.

However, more drug withdrawal reactions occurred in the IM group in the safety set. This is not a trivial matter because over-antagonism is associated with physical reactions, aggression, refusal of treatment, and premature self-discharge. To avoid over-antagonism and triggering opioid withdrawal, naloxone should be titrated.

### Moving naloxone over the counter is necessary but not sufficient [^111nZKSX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist available in various formulations, and it can be easily administered to avert death from opioid overdose. Amid a historic overdose crisis in the United States, naloxone plays a crucial role in preventing loss of life. However, it remains largely inaccessible to the public. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the approval of the first over-the-counter formulation of naloxone.

Although this historic change provides an important opportunity to increase the distribution of naloxone, we must take careful steps during this transition so that it does not paradoxically threaten overall access to this life-saving medication. Specifically, we must ensure that a larger supply of naloxone will meet the newly increased demand at a sustainable price for consumers who are most in need.

Furthermore, we must continue to prioritize comprehensive methods of distribution, such as overdose education and naloxone distribution programs, which serve as essential tools to reach the most vulnerable populations. In addition, simultaneous investment in harm-reduction strategies, such as supervised consumption spaces, is critical to ensure that naloxone is available in settings where its life-saving potential can be most fully realized.

### Heroin overdose resuscitation with naloxone: Patient uses own prescribed supply to save the life of a peer [^113rFEHT]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Opiate overdose is the primary cause of death among injection-drug users, representing a major public health concern worldwide. Opiate overdose can be reversed through the timely administration of naloxone, and users have expressed willingness to carry the antidote for emergency use (take-home naloxone). In November 2014, new WHO guidelines identified that naloxone should be made available to anyone at risk of witnessing an overdose. We present the case of a 46-year-old man in opioid-maintenance treatment who used take-home naloxone to rescue an overdose victim. This is the first-ever account of a patient using dose titration of naloxone to restore respiratory function while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. To improve the safety of take-home naloxone, the authors call for clinicians involved in the treatment of opiate users to prescribe take-home naloxone to all patients, forewarn patients of potential side effects, and instruct patients in naloxone dose titration.

### Do higher doses of naloxone increase the risk of pulmonary complications [^112Vv7XM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Although naloxone has proven to be an effective opioid reversal agent, concern that high doses of naloxone can cause pulmonary edema may prevent health care providers from administering it in initial high doses.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to determine whether increased doses of naloxone are correlated with an increase in pulmonary complications in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) after an opioid overdose.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study of patients treated with naloxone by emergency medical services (EMS) or in the ED at an urban level I trauma center and three associated freestanding EDs. Data were queried from EMS run reports and the medical record and included demographic characteristics, naloxone dosing, administration route, and pulmonary complications. Patients were grouped by naloxone dose received, defined as low (≤ 2 mg), moderate (> 2 mg to ≤ 4 mg), and high (> 4 mg).

- **Results**: Of the 639 patients included, 13 (2.0%) were diagnosed with a pulmonary complication. There was no difference in the development of pulmonary complications across groups (p = 0.676). There was no difference in pulmonary complications based on the route of administration (p = 0.342). The administration of higher doses of naloxone was not associated with longer hospital stays (p = 0.0327).

- **Conclusions**: Study results suggest that the reluctance of many health care providers to administer larger doses of naloxone on initial treatment may not be warranted. In this investigation, there were no poor outcomes associated with an increase in naloxone administration.

### A comparison of intramuscular (Zimhi) and intranasal naloxone (Narcan) in reversal of fentanyl-induced apnea: a randomized, crossover, open-label trial [^111xVT5Q]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We studied fentanyl as the opioid of choice. In the abuse setting, fentanyl is often used together with other illicit substances, such as tranquilizers, that negatively affect respiration. This will likely decrease naloxone efficacy, although it remains unknown to what extent future studies should address this issue.

Finally, the high doses of naloxone in both formulations that were tested may trigger acute precipitated withdrawal in people with an opioid use disorder. While this could lead to reluctance in administering an opioid antagonist, we believe that saving a life outweighs the concern of inducing withdrawal. Nevertheless, the high-dose naloxone formulation remains a valuable medical countermeasure in public health emergencies, such as large-scale deployment of weaponized synthetic opioids.

In conclusion, in this small and descriptive study, we compared the efficacy of IM vs. IN naloxone following high-dose fentanyl-induced apnea. The study was performed in 16 healthy volunteers, and we also conducted an exploratory adjunct study in 6 participants who chronically use opioids. In healthy volunteers, we observed greater efficacy in reversal of apnea after IM compared to IN naloxone, with the need for lesser IM doses and no need for rescue naloxone. The decreased IN naloxone efficacy was replicated in the small set of participants who use opioids on a daily basis. While our results are relevant, further larger studies are required, particularly in participants who chronically use opioids, focusing not only on respiration but also on muscle rigidity and withdrawal.

### Percocet [^115cKhFY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist.

Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in Percocet, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.

In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of withdrawal symptoms will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.

Acetaminophen: Gastric decontamination with activated charcoal should be administered just prior to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to decrease systemic absorption if acetaminophen ingestion is known or suspected to have occurred within a few hours of presentation. Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained immediately if the patient presents 4 hours or more after ingestion to assess potential risk of hepatotoxicity.

### Vital signs: Pharmacy-based naloxone dispensing - United States, 2012–2018 [^114PAPoZ]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

The CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain recommends considering prescribing naloxone when factors that increase the risk for overdose are present (e.g. history of overdose or substance use disorder, opioid dosages ≥ 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day [high-dose], and concurrent use of benzodiazepines). In light of the high numbers of drug overdose deaths involving opioids — 36% of which in 2017 involved prescription opioids — improving access to naloxone is a public health priority. The CDC examined trends and characteristics of naloxone dispensing from retail pharmacies at the national and county levels in the United States.

- **Methods**: CDC analyzed 2012–2018 retail pharmacy data from IQVIA, a healthcare data science and technology company, to assess U.S. naloxone dispensing by U.S. Census region, urban/rural status, prescriber specialty, and recipient characteristics, including age group, sex, out-of-pocket costs, and method of payment. Factors associated with naloxone dispensing at the county level were also examined.

- **Results**: The number of naloxone prescriptions dispensed from retail pharmacies increased substantially from 2012 to 2018, including a 106% increase from 2017 to 2018 alone. Nationally, in 2018, one naloxone prescription was dispensed for every 69 high-dose opioid prescriptions. Substantial regional variation in naloxone dispensing was found, including a twenty-fivefold variation across counties, with the lowest rates in the most rural counties. A wide variation was also noted by prescriber specialty.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^111AHsCn]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Exploratory analyses were conducted additionally to consider early exposure relative to the i.m. reference and repeat naloxone administration.

- **Early naloxone absorption**: Given that Tmax may not fully describe the early absorption curve, three exploratory pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were introduced to assess early exposure from i.n. relative to 0.4 mg i.m. naloxone: t50% (defined as the time taken to achieve blood levels of 50% of Cmax, or C50%); AUCp (partial AUC from time of dosing to median Tmax of i.m. naloxone); and, for i.n. administration, T50% ref (time taken to reach the C50% of the primary reference 0.4 mg i.m.).

- **Simulation of repeat administration**: In emergency medicine, naloxone doses may be repeated to achieve overdose reversal. Therefore, simulations of repeat administrations were performed using the superposition approach. Superposition relies upon linear pharmacokinetics and employs a simple overlay technique, assuming that observed plasma concentrations following a single dose can be used to predict plasma concentrations after multiple dosing. Opioid overdose management guidelines typically recommend initial administration of 0.4 mg naloxone, repeated every 2–3 minutes if necessary. Consequently, we simulated repeat administration of five doses of the 0.4 mg i.m. reference at 3‐minute intervals (simulating the upper limit of the recommended dose range, 2 mg i.m.) versus two doses of 2 mg i.n. at 3‐minute intervals (simulating similar naloxone exposure, assuming 50% i.n. bioavailability).

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^112MZPqy]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Overdose deaths from heroin and other opioids represent a significant international public health concern, accounting for approximately 106,000 deaths annually. In 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched guidelines recommending that "people likely to witness an opioid overdose should have access to naloxone". However, pre-provision has been difficult because naloxone is usually available only in injectable form.

The development of nasal naloxone spray for layperson use was first mooted in the late 1990s. During the 2000s, various groups began introducing improvised nasal spray kits, consisting of a syringe pre-filled with the most concentrated injectable naloxone solution available (1 mg/ml) and a mucosal atomisation device. While their use has been criticized for the absence of supporting pharmacokinetic (PK) data, it undoubtedly established the potential worth of nasal naloxone.

In the United States, a step-change occurred in 2012 with the joint initiative of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to encourage non-injectable naloxone formulations. The FDA clarified the regulatory benchmark: one or multiple doses of a non-injectable formulation must result in similar or greater naloxone exposure than a 0.4 mg intramuscular (i.m.) reference. Intramuscular naloxone reverses opioid overdose rapidly, with adequate respiration resuming typically within 3–7 minutes.

### Naloxone reversal of buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression [^115dLBrP]. Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this investigation was to examine the ability of the opioid antagonist naloxone to reverse respiratory depression produced by the mu-opioid analgesic, buprenorphine, in healthy volunteers. The studies were designed in light of the claims that buprenorphine is relatively resistant to the effects of naloxone.

- **Methods**: In a first attempt, the effect of an intravenous bolus dose of 0.8 mg naloxone was assessed on 0.2 mg buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression. Next, the effect of increasing naloxone doses (0.5–7 mg, given over 30 min) on 0.2 mg buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression was tested. Subsequently, continuous naloxone infusions were applied to reverse respiratory depression from 0.2 and 0.4 mg buprenorphine. All doses are per 70 kg. Respiration was measured against a background of constant increased end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration.

- **Results**: An intravenous naloxone dose of 0.8 mg had no effect on respiratory depression from buprenorphine. Increasing doses of naloxone given over 30 min produced full reversal of buprenorphine effect in the dose range of 2–4 mg naloxone. Further increasing the naloxone dose (doses of 5 mg or greater) caused a decline in reversal activity. Naloxone bolus doses of 2–3 mg, followed by a continuous infusion of 4 mg/h, caused full reversal within 40–60 min of both 0.2 and 0.4 mg buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression.

- **Conclusions**: Reversal of buprenorphine effect is possible but depends on the buprenorphine dose and the correct naloxone dose window.

### Prescribe to prevent: Overdose prevention and naloxone rescue kits for prescribers and pharmacists [^1149abW4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

What are Naloxone Rescue Kits?

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that displaces opioids from brain receptors and restores breathing and consciousness. Naloxone is a prescription medication, but not a controlled substance. It usually takes 2 to 5 minutes to take effect and wears off after 30 to 90 minutes, so patients on long-acting opioids like methadone and extended-release oxycodone may experience reduced respirations and overdose. Overdose responders should be encouraged to stay with the person overdosing after administration of naloxone. In cases of polysubstance or high-potency fentanyl-related overdose, standard doses of naloxone may be insufficient, and thus rescue breathing and help from emergency medical providers may be necessary to reverse the overdose. Administering naloxone may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in the victim.

There are multiple reasons to equip people in the community with a naloxone rescue kit. First, most opioid users do not use drugs alone and thus have people around them who can intervene should an overdose occur. Second, risk factors for overdose have been identified as discussed above. Third, the extent of hypoxic brain injury is time-dependent, so the sooner hypoxia is reversed, the better. Fourth, bystanders can be trained to recognize and respond effectively to overdoses with naloxone. Finally, the fear of being arrested sometimes discourages bystanders from calling for medical assistance, making naloxone an important tool for people hesitant to call for help.

Naloxone rescue kits have been endorsed by numerous organizations and are considered a critical component in reducing opioid overdose deaths.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^111sgCfd]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Taken together with other recently published data, the results of this study lend strong support to the potential value of concentrated intranasal (i.n.) naloxone spray for opioid overdose reversal. Across all three i.n. doses, naloxone exposure was dose-proportional, with approximately 50% absolute bioavailability. We identified the 2 mg/0.1 mL i.n. dose as most similar to the 0.4 mg intramuscular (i.m.) reference, producing comparable early naloxone concentrations. The 2 mg i.n. dose had the added feature of effective maintenance of plasma levels for the next 2 hours. In September 2017, following acceptance of this manuscript but before publication, the European Medicines Agency gave a positive opinion on the application for a product license for a 1.8 mg/0.1 mL concentrated naloxone nasal spray under the trade name Nyxoid; 1.8 mg naloxone in Nyxoid is equivalent to 2 mg naloxone hydrochloride.

Clinicians and policymakers will need to consider the potential merits of the different time-course profiles, including speed of onset and duration of effect, of i.n. versus injectable naloxone. They may also see implementation advantages with i.n. naloxone for broad-based take-home naloxone provision.

### Retrospective review of need for delayed naloxone or oxygen in emergency department patients receiving naloxone for heroin reversal [^113ZF96s]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Emergency departments (EDs) are experiencing an increasing number of heroin overdose visits. Currently, there is no generally agreed-upon ED observation period for heroin overdose patients who receive naloxone.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to determine the safety of a two-hour observation period for heroin overdose patients who receive naloxone.

- **Methods**: We performed a chart review of all patients who presented with any opioid-related complaint between 2009 and 2014 to our urban academic trauma center. Subset analysis of patients with isolated heroin overdose who received naloxone was performed, with the intent of excluding patients intoxicated with long-acting/enteral opioids. The primary outcome was the number of patients who required delayed intervention — specifically, additional naloxone or supplemental oxygen.

- **Results**: Between 2009 and 2014, we recorded 806 visits to our ED for heroin use after receiving naloxone. Twenty-nine patients (3.6%) received a repeat dose of naloxone, and 17 patients (2%) received oxygen ≥ 2 hours after initial naloxone administration. Our two-hour intervention rate was 4.6% (N = 37). This decreased to 1.9% (N = 15) after three hours and 0.9% (N = 7) after four hours. Patients with polysubstance use were more likely to receive repeat naloxone (p < 0.01), but not oxygen (p = 0.10). Preexisting cardiopulmonary conditions did not correlate with a need for supplemental oxygen (p = 0.24) or repeat naloxone (p = 0.30).

- **Conclusions**: A two-hour ED observation period for heroin overdose patients reversed with naloxone resulted in a delayed intervention rate of 5%. Clinicians may…

### Narcan naloxone HCl [^112eLD53]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**:
	- **Mechanism of action**: Naloxone hydrochloride is an opioid antagonist that antagonizes opioid effects by competing for the same receptor sites. It reverses the effects of opioids, including respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. Additionally, it can reverse the psychotomimetic and dysphoric effects of agonist-antagonists such as pentazocine.

	- **Pharmacodynamics**: When naloxone hydrochloride is administered intravenously, the onset of action is generally apparent within two minutes. The onset time is shorter for intravenous compared to subcutaneous or intramuscular routes of administration. The duration of action is dependent upon the dose and route of administration of naloxone hydrochloride.

	- **Pharmacokinetics**: In a pharmacokinetic study involving 30 healthy adult subjects, the relative bioavailability (BA) of one nasal spray in one nostril — consisting of a 2 mg total dose (0.1 mL of 20 mg/mL naloxone hydrochloride solution) — and a 4 mg total dose (0.1 mL of 40 mg/mL naloxone hydrochloride solution), as well as two nasal sprays administered as one nasal spray in each nostril — consisting of a 4 mg total dose (0.1 mL of 20 mg/mL naloxone hydrochloride solution in each nostril) and an 8 mg total dose (0.1 mL of 40 mg/mL naloxone hydrochloride solution in each nostril) — were compared to a single dose of 0.4 mg naloxone hydrochloride intramuscular injection. For intranasal administration, the subjects were instructed not to breathe through the nose during administration of the nasal spray and remained fully supine for application.

### Comparison of intranasal and intramuscular naloxone in opioid overdoses managed by ambulance staff: a double-dummy, randomised, controlled trial [^117Rs7FH]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

Opioid overdose remains a global epidemic, with an annual death toll of more than 100,000. In response, naloxone, the main opioid antagonist, has been made available to laypeople through Take Home Naloxone (THN) Programmes since the late 1990s. THN was never meant to replace callouts to and treatment by emergency medical services. It serves as a head start at the scene to shorten the time to the administration of the antidote while awaiting professional management and post-overdose follow-up.

The route of administration and dosing of naloxone in opioid overdoses in the community are debated, not least in the fentanyl era in North America. Recommendations range from 0.04 to 2.0 mg via the intravenous or intramuscular routes, with titration to the desired effect. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends starting at the lower end of that spectrum to avoid eliciting withdrawal. In THN programs, off-label, unapproved, dilute nasal sprays have been used. Nasal administration is preferred by laypeople owing to its ease of use. Since 2015, several nasal naloxone products with single doses ranging from 0.9 mg to 8.0 mg have entered the market. These formulations were approved based on phase I pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers alone. The lack of clinical trials of these high concentration/low volume sprays and the lack of trials comparing different naloxone regimens leave an important knowledge gap in best practice for managing opioid overdoses in the community. Previous trials of intranasal (IN) naloxone have shown promise.

### Vital signs: Pharmacy-based naloxone dispensing - United States, 2012–2018 [^111XAQKu]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). High credibility.

Counties with the greatest need for overdose reversal, such as those with high rates of drug overdose death and high-dose opioid dispensing, tend to have a higher rate of pharmacy-based naloxone dispensing. The highest county-level naloxone dispensing rates were observed in some of the states hit hardest by opioid overdose mortality, such as Florida and Massachusetts, and in states that have implemented requirements for naloxone coprescribing, such as Arizona and Virginia. Improved access to naloxone holds promise for opioid overdose reversals and provides the opportunity to link survivors to treatment to prevent future overdoses.

Variation in pharmacy naloxone dispensing rates cannot be fully explained by factors linked to the need for naloxone. Many states have only recently implemented laws requiring coprescription; thus, sufficient time has not passed to examine their full impact. Compared with metropolitan counties, rural counties had a higher likelihood of having low rates of naloxone dispensing, even when controlling for other relevant factors. This is concerning given slower EMS response times and the underuse of naloxone by EMS in rural areas relative to the overdose prevalence, which may be attributable to resource, certification, and practice constraints. Harm-reduction programs are more limited in rural areas, and a smaller proportion of rural programs distribute naloxone. Thus, pharmacy naloxone dispensing holds great promise for making a positive impact in rural communities.

Clinicians have reported a lack of knowledge and low levels of self-efficacy in counseling patients about naloxone access and use.

Regarding the medical management of opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend providing naloxone for the reversal of opioid overdose in patients being treated for, or with a history of, opioid use disorder. Patients and their family members or significant others should be trained in the use of naloxone in the event of an overdose.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^117AX8X4]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Take-home naloxone can prevent death from heroin/opioid overdose, but pre-provision is difficult because naloxone is usually given by injection. Non-injectable alternatives, including naloxone nasal sprays, are currently being developed. To be effective, the intranasal (i.n.) spray dose must be adequate but not excessive, and early absorption must be comparable to intramuscular (i.m.) injection. We report on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a specially produced concentrated novel nasal spray. The specific aims were to:

- **Estimate PK profiles**: Estimate pharmacokinetic profiles of intranasal (i.n.) naloxone.

- **Comparison of early systemic exposure**: Compare early systemic exposure with i.n. versus i.m. naloxone.

- **Estimate i.n. bioavailability**: Estimate the bioavailability of intranasal naloxone.

- **Design**: Open-label, randomized, five-way cross-over PK study.

- **Setting**: Clinical trials facility in Croydon, UK.

- **Participants**: Thirty-eight healthy volunteers (age 20–54 years; 11 female).

- **Intervention and comparator**: Three doses of i.n. (1 mg/0.1 ml, 2 mg/0.1 ml, 4 mg/0.2 ml) versus 0.4 mg i.m. (reference) and 0.4 mg intravenous (i.v.) naloxone.

- **Measurements**: Regular blood samples were taken, with high-frequency sampling during the first 15 minutes to capture early systemic exposure. PK parameters were determined from plasma naloxone concentrations. Exploratory analyses involved simulation of repeat administration.

- **Findings**:

Mean peak concentration (C max) values for 1 mg (1.51 ng/ml), 2 mg (2.87 ng/ml), and 4 mg (6.02 ng/ml) i.n. exceeded 0.4 mg i.m. (1.27 ng/ml) naloxone. All three i.n. doses rapidly achieved plasma levels greater than 50% of peak concentrations (T50%) by 10 minutes, peaking at 15–30 minutes.

### Naloxone use by emergency medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic: A national survey [^114xQCbn]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is transmitted via droplets and secretions and may present a risk to emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians who perform procedures such as overdose reversal with intranasal naloxone. COVID-19 in the United States (US) has occurred in the midst of an opioid crisis that averages 128 overdose deaths per day. Anecdotal reports cite an increase in opioid overdoses during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to responses from the American Medical Association and loosening of regulations regarding access to medications for opioid use disorder by federal entities. Notably, some law enforcement jurisdictions have banned the administration of intranasal naloxone to avoid potential exposure of their personnel to SARS-CoV-2.

Guidelines for EMS clinicians recommend the use of intranasal over intramuscular naloxone, whereas recent guidance from the Substance Abuse Mental Health and Services Administration (SAMHSA) favors intramuscular use if sufficient personal protective equipment is not available. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide information on one aspect of the effect of the pandemic on frontline EMS practices, we sought to determine the effect of COVID-19 on the perceived prevalence of opioid overdoses and the use of intranasal naloxone by EMS in the US.

### Characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder associated with performing overdose reversals in the community: An opioid treatment program analysis [^116r5RQQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The opioid crisis is a US public health epidemic. Drug overdose (OD) deaths exceed all other causes of injury, including motor vehicle accidents and gun-related violence. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates there are 91 US deaths per day involving opioids. Approximately 3 million Americans suffer from opioid use disorder (OUD), a condition manifested by escalating physical and psychological cravings for opioid analgesics.

People begin using opioid analgesics for many different reasons. Some initially obtain prescription opioids from a medical provider for a diagnosis of acute or chronic pain. Others may begin to use prescription opioids from a friend, relative, or stranger for the psychoactive feeling of well-being. Ultimately, the majority of people who develop OUD will switch to heroin because of the lower cost and accessibility. Polydrug use among people who use heroin, especially the use of alcohol and benzodiazepines, is an important contributor to drug OD.

Although self-administration of naloxone is not possible during an OD event, people who OD, especially from heroin, are usually not alone. Community members present, when trained and supplied with naloxone, can serve as first responders by performing OD reversals on others in their community. Community members who perform OD reversals are often reluctant to call emergency medical services due to fear of police. Other barriers to naloxone access include cost, inadequate first responder training, and lengthy response times, especially in rural communities.

### Low-dose oral naloxone reverses opioid-induced constipation and analgesia [^1121qr9s]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

The most common side effect of opioid therapy is constipation, which is often difficult to treat and is primarily believed to be a peripheral effect. Single large doses of oral naloxone have been shown to be efficacious in reversing opioid-induced constipation; however, they often cause the unwanted side effect of analgesia reversal. This study evaluated the effects on constipation and analgesia of low doses of oral naloxone given three times daily. Patients taking stable doses of opioids with complaints of constipation were recruited for this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients were administered 4 mg or 2 mg of oral naloxone, or a placebo, three times daily. Stool frequency and symptoms related to constipation were recorded daily. Additionally, patients recorded the daily amount of analgesics required to maintain pain control.

Nine patients were recruited for the study. All patients who received oral naloxone experienced some improvement in bowel frequency. Three of the patients also experienced reversal of analgesia, including one who had a complete reversal of analgesia. This study demonstrates that reversal of analgesia still occurred, despite dividing the oral naloxone into very low doses relative to the total dose of opioid used. Patients using high doses of opioids appear to be the most vulnerable to the analgesic effect of oral naloxone.

### Incidence, reversal, and prevention of opioid-induced respiratory depression [^113NTrfx]. Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Opioid treatment of pain is generally safe, with respiratory depression occurring in 0.5% or fewer cases. However, fatalities are regularly reported. The only treatment currently available to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression is naloxone infusion. The efficacy of naloxone depends on its own pharmacological characteristics and on those, including receptor kinetics, of the opioid requiring reversal. Short elimination of naloxone, biophase equilibration half-lives, and rapid receptor kinetics complicate the reversal of high-affinity opioids. An opioid with high receptor affinity will necessitate greater naloxone concentrations and/or a continuous infusion before reversal compared with an opioid with lower receptor affinity. The clinical approach to severe opioid-induced respiratory depression is to titrate naloxone to effect and continue treatment by continuous infusion until the chances for renarcotization have diminished. New approaches to prevent opioid respiratory depression without affecting analgesia have led to the experimental application of serotonin agonists, ampakines, and the antibiotic minocycline.

### Systematic review of naloxone dosing and adverse events in the emergency department [^114GksWL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Experts recommend using the lowest effective dose of naloxone to balance the reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression and avoid precipitated opioid withdrawal. However, there are no established dosing standards within the emergency department (ED).

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review was to determine naloxone dosing practice in the ED and their association with adverse events.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review by searching PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and EBSCO from 2000–2021. Articles containing patient-level data for the initial ED dose and patient outcome had data abstracted by two independent reviewers. Patients were divided into subgroups depending on the initial dose of i.v. naloxone: low dose (LD; < 0.4 mg), standard dose (SD; 0.4–2 mg), and high dose (HD; > 2 mg). Our outcomes were the dose range administered and adverse events per dose. We compared groups using chi-squared difference of proportions or Fisher's exact test.

- **Results**: The review included 13 articles with 209 patients in the results analysis: 111 patients in LD (0.04–0.1 mg), 95 in SD (0.4–2 mg), and 3 in HD (4–12 mg). At least one adverse event was reported in 37 SD patients (38.9%) compared with 14 in LD (12.6%, p < 0.0001) and 2 in HD (100.0%, p = 0.16). At least one additional dose was administered to 53 SD patients (55.8%) compared with 55 in LD (49.5%, p < 0.0001) and 3 in HD (100.0%, p = 0.48).

- **Conclusions**: Lower doses of naloxone in the ED may help reduce related adverse events without increasing the need for additional doses. Future studies should evaluate the optimal dosing strategies for naloxone in this setting.

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^113Q96KT]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

The reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) in rats is crucial to addressing systemic side effects of opioid toxicity, which include life-threatening OIRD that can be fatal, particularly in opioid-naïve patients. We tested the ability of our prodrugs (15 µmol kg−1; single subcutaneous dose, n = 6) to reverse OIRD caused by a high dose of fentanyl (LD50 of 3 mg kg−1; single subcutaneous dose) in naïve male rats using non-invasive whole-body plethysmography. This high dose of fentanyl, over 10 times higher than literature reports, was used to mimic the OIRD of potent synthetic opioid analogues.

After the first fentanyl dose, neither the vehicle nor the lipidated naloxone prodrug, C12-E2-Naloxone, reversed OIRD, despite showing hydrolysis in rat plasma. This outcome was expected as lipidation slows the release of the prodrug from subcutaneous tissue. We also encountered difficulty formulating C12-E2-Naloxone, which necessitated doubling the dosing vehicle volume. Two out of six rats in each group died, and therefore, we did not proceed with further testing of the C12-E2-Naloxone prodrug.

Naloxone and the alkyl ester AG10-L-E1-Naloxone provided rapid reversal of OIRD within 5 minutes. For AG10-L-E2-Naloxone, recovery began at 65 minutes, but the Minute Volume did not reach normal levels (55.2 ± 16.6% of baseline at 90 minutes).

### Naloxone hydrochloride [^111cNJot]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For the partial reversal of opioid depression following the use of opioids during surgery, smaller doses of naloxone hydrochloride are usually sufficient. The dose of naloxone hydrochloride should be titrated according to the patient's response. For the initial reversal of respiratory depression, naloxone hydrochloride should be injected in increments of 0.1 to 0.2 mg intravenously at two- to three-minute intervals to the desired degree of reversal, i.e. adequate ventilation and alertness without significant pain or discomfort. A larger than necessary dosage of naloxone may result in significant reversal of analgesia and an increase in blood pressure. Similarly, too rapid reversal may induce nausea, vomiting, sweating, or circulatory stress.

Repeat doses of naloxone may be required within one- to two-hour intervals depending on the amount, type (i.e. short or long acting), and time interval since last administration of an opioid. Supplemental intramuscular doses have been shown to produce a longer lasting effect.

- **Septic shock**: The optimal dosage of naloxone hydrochloride or duration of therapy for the treatment of hypotension in septic shock patients has not been established (see Clinical Pharmacology).

- **Usage in children - Opioid overdose — known or suspected**: The usual initial dose in children is 0.01 mg/kg body weight given intravenously. If this dose does not result in the desired degree of clinical improvement, a subsequent dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight may be administered. If an intravenous route of administration is not available, naloxo
