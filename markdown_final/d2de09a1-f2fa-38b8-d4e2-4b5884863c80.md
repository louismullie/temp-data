## Question

Anti diabetic drugs safer in liver failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antidiabetic drugs are safest in liver failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "liver failure" clinically, distinguishing compensated versus decompensated cirrhosis and acute liver failure. Then, I should verify the key safety risks in liver failure that constrain drug choice, especially hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and hepatotoxicity. Next, I will appraise each drug class against these risks and the available evidence, including guidelines and pivotal studies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stage-based recommendation and highlight monitoring and caveats, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "liver failure" spans compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B/C with ascites, encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding), and acute liver failure. Drug safety differs markedly across these states, so I need to keep the stage in mind as I proceed [^3c8c08f5] [^1b83705a].

> I need to check the dominant safety risks that shape therapy in liver failure: hypoglycemia from impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis and altered drug clearance, lactic acidosis risk with metformin when hepatic lactate clearance is impaired, and direct hepatotoxicity or drug accumulation in advanced liver disease. These risks will anchor my class-by-class appraisal [^3c8c08f5] [^e68be64d].

> Now, insulin: I initially thought insulin is universally the safest option in liver failure because it does not rely on hepatic metabolism, but wait, let me verify that assumption. Large observational cohorts in compensated cirrhosis show insulin users have higher risks of hypoglycemia, cardiovascular events, decompensation, and mortality than nonusers, even after excluding hypoglycemia episodes, so I should not overstate insulin's safety in cirrhosis despite its pharmacologic plausibility [^954b1cfb] [^a9bd693b]. Hold on, I should also reconcile this with guidelines: contemporary standards advise insulin as preferred in decompensated cirrhosis due to limited safety/efficacy data for other agents, but in compensated cirrhosis, noninsulin options can be considered with caution, which aligns with the observational signal of excess hypoglycemia and adverse outcomes with insulin in compensated disease [^4ec98f59] [^3c8c08f5].

> Next, metformin: I should confirm the lactic acidosis risk. Metformin is contraindicated in advanced liver disease and decompensated cirrhosis because hepatic lactate clearance is impaired and renal dysfunction is common, increasing lactic acidosis risk; in compensated cirrhosis, case series and expert opinion suggest it may be used cautiously if renal function is preserved, but I need to ensure close monitoring and low thresholds to stop in acute illness or deterioration [^e68be64d] [^2b919052] [^a0a2b623].

> Sulfonylureas and meglitinides: I should double-check the hypoglycemia risk. These secretagogues are contraindicated in hepatic decompensation due to impaired hepatic inactivation and reduced gluconeogenesis, which magnify hypoglycemia; even in compensated cirrhosis, they should be avoided or used only with extreme caution and dose reduction, given prolonged and unpredictable hypoglycemia risk [^3b71cf5c] [^5af9ea0b] [^ba447111].

> Thiazolidinediones: let me consider pioglitazone carefully. Pioglitazone has evidence for NASH histologic benefit but carries risks of fluid retention, heart failure exacerbation, bone loss, and idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity; it is contraindicated in decompensated cirrhosis and should be avoided in those with heart failure or high fracture risk, so I need to ensure careful selection and monitoring if considered in compensated cirrhosis [^d31f9e59] [^5e89bae0] [^ae9b20e3].

> GLP-1 receptor agonists: I should review both efficacy and safety signals. Phase 2 trials show semaglutide and liraglutide improve NASH resolution, and observational emulations suggest lower risks of major adverse liver outcomes with adherent GLP-1 RA use in chronic liver disease; in compensated cirrhosis, they appear reasonably safe with low hypoglycemia risk, though I need to acknowledge limited dedicated cirrhosis RCTs and monitor for GI effects and gallstone risk [^ad268bea] [^1e62201d] [^0a22e750].

> SGLT2 inhibitors: hold on, I should verify hepatic outcomes data. Observational cohorts and meta-analyses associate SGLT2 inhibitors with lower risks of hepatic decompensation and adverse liver-related outcomes versus several comparators, and FDA labeling does not mandate dose adjustment in hepatic impairment, though severe hepatic disease has limited specific safety data; given low hypoglycemia risk and cardiorenal benefits, they are attractive in compensated cirrhosis, with vigilance for volume depletion and genitourinary infections [^3c2cb67e] [^f20e0ca1] [^6f719d2c].

> DPP-4 inhibitors: I need to check hepatic metabolism and outcomes. Linagliptin is hepatically cleared and requires no dose adjustment in renal or hepatic impairment, and pooled analyses suggest safety in patients with hepatic disorders; however, some observational data in cirrhosis link DPP-4 inhibitors with increased decompensation or variceal bleeding, so I should use them cautiously in compensated cirrhosis and avoid in decompensation, balancing low hypoglycemia risk against uncertain hepatic safety signals [^00a92d12] [^01f8c4ea] [^b92349ea].

> Acarbose: let me verify its niche. Acarbose is minimally systemically absorbed and has been studied in cirrhosis with improvements in postprandial glucose and no clear liver enzyme signals, but gastrointestinal intolerance is common and it offers modest A1C lowering; it may be considered when other options are unsuitable, with counseling on GI effects [^376c1794].

> I will now synthesize by stage, but I should confirm alignment with guidelines. In decompensated cirrhosis, insulin is preferred given limited safety data for noninsulin agents and high hypoglycemia risk with secretagogues; in compensated cirrhosis, GLP-1 RAs, SGLT2 inhibitors, and carefully selected metformin (if renal function allows) are reasonable first-line options, with DPP-4 inhibitors as alternatives when others are contraindicated, while avoiding sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and pioglitazone in patients with heart failure or fracture risk; across all stages, prioritize agents with low hypoglycemia risk and monitor renal and hepatic function closely [^4ec98f59] [^3c8c08f5] [^c3c25604].

> But wait, what if the patient has acute liver failure or is critically ill? In ALF or ACLF, insulin is the mainstay for glycemic control with targets of 110–180 mg/dL to balance hypo- and hyperglycemia risks, and noninsulin agents should generally be avoided until hepatic function stabilizes, so I need to ensure a conservative, insulin-focused approach in this setting [^87bf7910] [^1b83705a].

> Finally, I should double-check practical monitoring steps. Before initiating or adjusting therapy in cirrhosis, obtain baseline liver enzymes, bilirubin, and renal function; reassess liver tests if symptoms suggest injury; avoid metformin in acute illness or hypoperfusion; and in older adults or those with malnutrition, start low and go slow with any hypoglycemia-prone agent, reinforcing sick-day rules and hypoglycemia recognition given blunted counterregulation in liver disease [^e68be64d] [^ac3592e6].

In liver failure, **insulin is the safest antidiabetic therapy** because it does not rely on hepatic metabolism and has no hepatotoxicity, though hypoglycemia risk is higher and requires close monitoring [^4ec98f59] [^3c7b160b]. Metformin is **contraindicated in advanced liver disease** due to lactic acidosis risk, and sulfonylureas should be avoided because of prolonged hypoglycemia from impaired hepatic clearance [^e68be64d] [^3b71cf5c]. GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors can be considered in compensated cirrhosis with caution, but data in decompensated disease are limited; DPP-4 inhibitors are generally safe in mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, though linagliptin is preferred for its hepatic metabolism and minimal renal clearance [^4ec98f59] [^00a92d12] [^01f8c4ea]. Overall, **individualize therapy by liver disease stage**, prioritize insulin in decompensated cirrhosis, and avoid hepatotoxic or hypoglycemia-prone agents.

## Pharmacokinetic considerations in liver failure

Liver failure alters drug metabolism, clearance, and safety, so **hepatic metabolism and clearance** are critical: many antidiabetic agents are metabolized or cleared by the liver, and impairment can increase exposure and toxicity. Hypoglycemia risk is magnified in liver failure due to reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis and altered drug kinetics, and **lactic acidosis risk** is a concern with metformin when hepatic lactate clearance is impaired [^e68be64d].

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Insulin**: Preferred in decompensated cirrhosis due to safety and efficacy; monitor for hypoglycemia [^4ec98f59] [^3c8c08f5].
- **Metformin**: Contraindicated in advanced liver disease; use cautiously in compensated cirrhosis with close monitoring [^e68be64d] [^2b919052].
- **Sulfonylureas**: Avoid in liver failure due to prolonged hypoglycemia [^3b71cf5c] [^3c7b160b].
- **GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors**: Emerging options for compensated cirrhosis; limited data in decompensated disease [^4ec98f59] [^ad268bea].
- **DPP-4 inhibitors**: Linagliptin is preferred in hepatic impairment due to hepatic metabolism and minimal renal clearance [^01f8c4ea] [^00a92d12].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Decompensated cirrhosis**: Use insulin as first-line therapy; avoid metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones [^4ec98f59] [^3c8c08f5].
- **Compensated cirrhosis**: Consider insulin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, or DPP-4 inhibitors (prefer linagliptin) with close monitoring [^4ec98f59] [^01f8c4ea].
- **Monitor**: Frequent glucose monitoring, renal function, and liver enzymes are essential in all patients with liver failure [^e68be64d].

---

Insulin is the **safest option in liver failure**, especially in decompensated cirrhosis, while metformin and sulfonylureas should be avoided. GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and DPP-4 inhibitors may be considered in compensated cirrhosis with caution and close monitoring.

Antidiabetic therapy in patients with liver dysfunction

Liver dysfunction, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and type 2 diabetes frequently coexist. Indeed, 49–62% of type 2 diabetes patients have NAFLD. NAFLD may be a marker of cardiovascular risk and mortality in type 2 diabetes patients.

Treatment of type 2 diabetes in patients with liver dysfunction is complex as many OADs may be contraindicated because the risk of hypoglycemia may be magnified, and therefore doses may also need to be adjusted. There are only a few reported cases of hepatotoxic side effects for metformin, but there may be an increased risk of developing lactic acidosis in the setting of impaired liver function. Therefore, metformin is contraindicated for patients with advanced liver disease. Nevertheless, the risk of lactic acidosis associated with metformin seems to accentuate in patients with multiple comorbidities, particularly when there is an acute deterioration. If a patient has stable liver dysfunction and few comorbidities, metformin is likely to be reasonably safe, but the dose should be reduced to 1500 mg daily maximum and it should be discontinued if renal or liver function worsens.

Insulin therapy is probably the safest and most effective therapy in patients with liver dysfunction, with the limitation that increased risk of hypoglycemia in such patients requires extra care with insulin dosage. Regarding SU and glinides, the existence of increased risk of hypoclycemia due to reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis should also be considered. Indeed, glinides are contraindicated in the setting of liver dysfunction because they are mostly cleared through the liver, and SU are contraindicated in advanced liver failure.

Data regarding the use of DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with liver disease are currently lacking.

Patients with moderate liver dysfunction can take sitagliptin or exenatide. Vildagliptin is contraindicated in patients with liver dysfunction as clinical studies showed that high doses of this drug increased hepatic transaminases in some patients.

Expert opinion

Type 2 diabetes patients with liver dysfunction are at increased risk of cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Identification and tight control of metabolic risk factors remains the mainstay of treatment. Although based on the available literature no conclusive recommendations can be derived, given that OADs are contraindicated in patients with advanced liver disease, insulin treatment remains the available option for glycemic control.

### Type 2 diabetes and your liver… [^0e7b9f17]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Your liver also plays a key role in balancing your blood sugar levels. When you eat, a hormone called insulin removes extra sugar from your bloodstream. This sugar is stored in your liver for future use. Between meals and overnight, your liver releases that sugar back into your bloodstream so your body has the energy it needs. metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. This is when you have MASLD and also have swelling, inflammation, and liver damage. About 20% to 30% of people with MASLD also develop MASH. MASLD and MASH can lead to more serious complications like liver cirrhosis, which is scarring and permanent damage to your liver. This damage could eventually lead to liver failure and the need for a liver transplant. The type 2 diabetes and liver connection There is an often-overlooked connection between type 2 diabetes and your liver.

Research on this connection is relatively new, but it's becoming clear that each condition increases the risk for the other. When your blood sugar is high over a long time, it can damage your internal organs, including your liver. Similarly, MASLD and MASH increase the risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. A buildup of fat and damage in your liver can increase your blood sugar levels. Prevent or manage liver disease There are no medicines available yet that cure MASLD or MASH. But there's good news. Many of the same lifestyle changes that help manage prediabetes and type 2 diabetes also help with liver diseases, including MASLD and MASH. With healthy lifestyle changes, you can prevent, slow down, or even reverse the buildup of extra fat in your liver. Healthy eating, including balancing your carbohydrate intake and limiting sweets, is important for diabetes. It also matters for liver health since extra carbohydrates and sugars are stored in your liver.

Limiting the amount of saturated fats in your diet helps protect your liver from fat buildup. Being physically active helps improve the way your body uses blood sugar. It also helps reduce the amount of fat stored in your liver. Try getting at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week, but every active minute counts. Limiting alcohol can also reduce the stress on your liver and slow the development of liver damage. Limit alcohol as much as you can if you have liver disease or are at risk for it.

Diabetes with cirrhosis — antihyperglycemic selection by liver disease stage. "Insulin is the preferred glucose-lowering agent for the treatment of hyperglycemia in adults with type 2 diabetes with decompensated cirrhosis", given limited safety/efficacy data for other agents, although "a recent 48-week study suggested that GLP-1 RAs are safe in individuals with MASH and compensated cirrhosis".

### Is insulin the preferred treatment in persons with type 2 diabetes and liver cirrhosis? [^ae994848]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although insulin is the recommended treatment for persons with T2DM and liver cirrhosis, few clinical studies have evaluated its long-term effects and safety. In this retrospective cohort study, insulin use in people with T2DM and compensated cirrhosis was associated with higher risks of hypoglycemia, cardiovascular events, liver-related complications, and mortality than insulin nonusers. Therefore, in persons with compensated liver cirrhosis, the use of insulin may require special attention.

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. However, the benefit-risk for the use of dapagliflozin in patients with severe hepatic impairment should be individually assessed since the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin have not been specifically studied in this population [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### The role of co-morbidity in the selection of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy in type-2 diabetes [^646b4e20]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Metformin is, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, usually preferred over other antidiabetic drugs for the first line treatment of type-2 diabetes. The particular decision on which antidiabetic agent to use is based on variables such as efficacy, cost, potential side effects, effects on weight, comorbidities, hypoglycemia, risk, and patient preferences. However, there is no guidance how to consider these in the selection of antidiabetic drug treatment. In this work, we aimed to summarize available evidence and tried to give pragmatic treatment recommendations from a clinical practice perspective. There are clear contraindications for some drugs in those with impaired renal and liver function and precautions in those with heart failure for the use of metformin (NYHA III-IV) and glitazones. On the other hand, GLP-1 analogs, DPP-4 inhibitors and acarbose are generally less critical and can be used in the majority of patients. We identified the following gaps with respect to the selection of antidiabetic drug treatment in patients with co-morbid disease conditions: 1) Guidelines fail to give advice on the use of specific antidiabetic drugs in patients with co-morbidity. 2) The literature is deficient in studies documenting antidiabetic drug use in patients with severely impaired renal function, diabetic retinopathy, cerebrovascular disease and systolic heart failure. 3) Further there are no specific data on patients with multiple of these co-morbid disease conditions. We postulate that differential use of antidiabetic drugs in patients with co-morbid disease constellations will help to reduce treatment related complications and might improve prognosis.

### Comparison of pioglitazone with other antidiabetic drugs for associated incidence of liver failure: no evidence of increased risk of liver failure with pioglitazone [^1f6ac418]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of liver failure in association with antidiabetic treatment using pioglitazone vs. other oral antidiabetic medications.

Methods

The study was a retrospective analysis of claim data from the PharMetrics Patient-Centric Database that had over 1.12 million enrollees with type 2 diabetes. All patients, ≥ 18 years of age with type 2 diabetes, who had initiated treatment either with a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone), sulfonylurea or metformin were identified and matched on the basis of propensity scores, which served as a proxy for severity of disease. The primary measure of interest was the incidence of liver failure or hepatitis post-index date. In addition to unadjusted comparisons, Cox proportional hazard models were employed to estimate the risk of developing liver failure or hepatitis.

Results

There was no significant difference in the 1- and 2-year incidence rates of liver failure or hepatitis (primary and secondary diagnoses) between the pioglitazone monotherapy group and the respective comparator groups. In Cox proportional hazard models controlling for age, pre-index total healthcare costs, Charlson comorbidity index, procedures and a hospitalization or Emergency room (ER) visit for pre-index hyperglycaemia, and pioglitazone were not associated with an increased risk of liver failure or hepatitis, compared to all other defined groups. Furthermore, no primary or secondary diagnosis of liver failure was reported in the pioglitazone group during the follow-up period.

Conclusions

Results of retrospective data analysis demonstrate no evidence of increased risk of liver failure or hepatitis for patients initiating therapy on pioglitazone, compared to other oral antidiabetic agents. Pioglitazone therapy was not associated with an increased risk of liver failure at 2 years relative to other oral antidiabetic therapies.

### Pharmacological management of type 2 diabetes: the potential of incretin-based therapies [^74913a0f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Management guidelines recommend metformin as the first-line therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled by diet and exercise. Efficacy with metformin therapy is usually of limited duration, which necessitates the early introduction of one or two additional oral agents or the initiation of injections, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists or insulin. Although safe and effective, metformin monotherapy has been associated with gastrointestinal side effects (≈20% of treated patients in randomized studies) and is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency or severe liver disease. Patients treated with a sulphonylurea are at increased risk for hypoglycaemia and moderate weight gain, whereas those receiving a thiazolidinedione are subject to an increased risk of weight gain, oedema, heart failure or fracture. Weight gain and hypoglycaemia are associated with insulin use. Thus, there is an unmet need for a safe and efficacious add-on agent after initial-therapy failure. Evidence suggests that incretin-based agents, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, can successfully achieve glycaemic targets and potentially provide cardiovascular and β-cell-function benefits. This review will examine current approaches for treating type 2 diabetes and discuss the place of incretin therapies, mainly GLP-1 agonists, in the type 2 diabetes treatment spectrum.

### Applications of SGLT2 inhibitors beyond glycaemic control [^373e5c4a]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were initially developed for their glucose-lowering effects and have shown a modest glycaemic benefit in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the past decade, a series of large, robust clinical trials of these therapies have demonstrated striking beneficial effects for various care goals, transforming the chronic disease therapeutic landscape. Cardiovascular safety studies in people with T2DM demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure. Subsequent trials in participants with heart failure with reduced or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors have beneficial effects on heart failure outcomes. In dedicated kidney outcome studies, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the incidence of kidney failure among participants with or without diabetes. Post hoc analyses have suggested a range of other benefits of these drugs in conditions as diverse as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, kidney stone prevention and anaemia. SGLT2 inhibitors have a generally favourable adverse effect profile, although patient selection and medication counselling remain important. Concerted efforts are needed to better integrate these agents into routine care and support long-term medication adherence to close the gap between clinical trial outcomes and those achieved in the real world.

### Current position of gliclazide and sulfonylureas in the contemporary treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes: a scoping review [^644b55e7]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Use of Gliclazide in Special Populations

Patients with Renal or Hepatic Diseases

In mild-to-moderate renal impairment, newer-generation SUs may be used, preferably at lower doses. Long-term intensive use of gliclazide was reported to prevent end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in ADVANCE and ADVANCE-ON studies, while the GUIDE study also indicated that even mild impairment of renal function increases the incidence of hypoglycemia on glimepiride but not on gliclazide MR.

Gliclazide, as eliminated mainly by the kidneys (60–70%) and mostly excreted as unchanged drug or inactive metabolite, is suggested to produce less hypoglycemia in patients with renal impairment and therefore can be used with proper dose adjustment and monitoring in patients with renal insufficiency. Nonetheless, while dose adjustment is not necessary for gliclazide in case of impaired renal function, it is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 due to hypoglycemia risk, and the dose should be reduced in those with eGFR of 30–60 ml/min/1.73 m 2.

SUs should be cautiously used in patients with liver diseases. As most of the SUs are inactivated in the liver, they may accumulate in the body during liver dysfunction and ultimately cause hypoglycemia. Reductions of SU dose and/or longer intervals between dosing are recommended in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, and gliclazide can be used in mild-to-moderate hepatic failure but not in severe hepatic failure.

Elderly Population

Elderly populations with T2D are considered to be at a higher risk of hypoglycemia as well as the adverse consequences of hypoglycemia (i.e. serious acute vascular events in case of severe hypoglycemia or morbidity with physical and cognitive dysfunction, frailty, and disability in case of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia) due to multiple comorbidities, poor nutritional status, and polypharmacy. Newer-generation SUs (gliclazide MR and glimepiride) can be used in elderly patients as they are associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia. Use of gliclazide MR alone or in combination with another OAD over 2 years was reported to be an effective and safe option in the elderly and in patients with impaired renal function. In the GUIDE study, gliclazide MR was reported to significantly improved HbA1c levels (from 8.4% to 7.2% at 27 weeks) in the subgroup of patients aged > 65 years.

### Is insulin the preferred treatment in persons with type 2 diabetes and liver cirrhosis? [^954b1cfb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Insulin is highly recommended for diabetes management in persons with liver cirrhosis. However, few studies have evaluated its long-term effects in these persons. We conducted this study to compare the risks of mortality, liver-related complications, and cardiovascular events in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and compensated liver cirrhosis.

Methods

From January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2012, we selected 2047 insulin users and 4094 propensity score-matched nonusers from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the risks of outcomes.

Results

The mean follow-up time was 5.84 years. The death rate during the follow-up period was 5.28 and 4.07 per 100 person-years for insulin users and nonusers, respectively. In insulin users, the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all-cause mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatic failure, major cardiovascular events, and hypoglycemia were 1.31 (1.18–1.45), 1.18 (1.05–1.34), 1.53 (1.35–1.72), 1.26 (1.42–1.86), 1.41 (1.23–1.62), and 3.33 (2.45–4.53), respectively.

Conclusions

This retrospective cohort study indicated that among persons with T2DM and compensated liver cirrhosis, insulin users were associated with higher risks of death, liver-related complications, cardiovascular events, and hypoglycemia compared with insulin nonusers.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and risk of major adverse liver outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease and type 2 diabetes [^cce3baf2]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk estimates for the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses at 2, 4, 6 and 8 years are presented in table 3. At 2 years follow-up, a more plausible duration of a clinical trial than 10 years, the risk of MALO was 2.3% in the initiators and 3.2% in the non-initiators (overall event probability of 2.7%) when analysed by the intention-to-treat principle (RD = −0.9, 95% CI = −2.2 to 0.4; RR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.31 to 1.13). A clinical trial of GLP1 agonists on the risk of MALO with 2 years of follow-up would need enrolment of at least 10 776 patients per arm to provide evidence for such effect.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

QTERN may be used in patients with hepatic impairment. However, the benefit-risk for the use of QTERN in patients with severe hepatic impairment should be individually assessed since safety and efficacy have not been studied in this population [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^c3c25604]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Use of glucose-lowering medications in adults with type 2 diabetes — risk-focused and goal-directed algorithm is presented as follows: In high-risk individuals identified by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), indicators of high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD), the pathway emphasizes outcome-benefit agents. For ASCVD/indicators of high CVD risk, the figure lists GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) with proven CVD benefit, and if A1C is above goal it advises considering adding the complementary class or pioglitazone. For HF, it specifies an SGLT2i with proven HF benefit. For CKD (defined by eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or albuminuria thresholds), on maximally tolerated ACE inhibitor or ARB, it lists an SGLT2i with primary evidence of reducing CKD progression, which can be started with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², continued until dialysis or transplantation, with reduced glucose-lowering efficacy when eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or a GLP-1 RA with proven CKD benefit. The algorithm also calls for regular treatment reassessment to avoid inertia and includes liver comorbidity considerations by listing agents with potential benefit in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) or steatohepatitis (MASH), including GLP-1 RA, dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, and pioglitazone (or combination), with insulin use in decompensated cirrhosis. For achieving glycemic goals, it notes metformin or other agents (including combinations) that provide adequate efficacy to meet and maintain targets while prioritizing avoidance of hypoglycemia in high-risk individuals, and it states that in people with HF, CKD, established CVD, or multiple CVD risk factors, choosing a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i with proven benefit should be made irrespective of background metformin or A1C use.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^3c7b160b]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Most insulin secretagogues undergo significant renal clearance (exceptions include repaglinide and nateglinide) and the risk of hypoglycemia is therefore higher in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). For most of these agents, extreme caution is imperative at more severe degrees of renal dysfunction. Glyburide (known as glibenclamide in Europe), which has a prolonged duration of action and active metabolites, should be specifically avoided in this group. Pioglitazone is not eliminated renally, and therefore there are no restrictions for use in CKD. Fluid retention may be a concern, however. Among the DPP-4 inhibitors, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, and saxagliptin share prominent renal elimination. In the face of advanced CKD, dose reduction is necessary. One exception is linagliptin, which is predominantly eliminated enterohepatically. For the GLP-1 receptor agonists exenatide is contraindicated in stage 4–5 CKD (GFR < 30 mL/min) as it is renally eliminated; the safety of liraglutide is not established in CKD though pharmacokinetic studies suggest that drug levels are unaffected as it does not require renal function for clearance.

More severe renal functional impairment is associated with slower elimination of all insulins. Thus doses need to be titrated carefully, with some awareness for the potential for more prolonged activity profiles.

Liver dysfunction.

Individuals with type 2 diabetes frequently have hepatosteatosis as well as other types of liver disease. There is preliminary evidence that patients with fatty liver may benefit from treatment with pioglitazone. It should not be used in an individual with active liver disease or an alanine transaminase level above 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. In those with steatosis but milder liver test abnormalities, this insulin sensitizer may be advantageous. Sulfonylureas can rarely cause abnormalities in liver tests but are not specifically contraindicated; meglitinides can also be used. If hepatic disease is severe, secretagogues should be avoided because of the increased risk of hypoglycemia. In patients with mild hepatic disease, incretin-based drugs can be prescribed, except if there is a coexisting history of pancreatitis. Insulin has no restrictions for use in patients with liver impairment and is indeed the preferred choice in those with advanced disease.

### Pioglitazone [^ae9b20e3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Congestive Heart Failure

Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone must be considered [see Boxed Warning, and].

5.2 Hypoglycemia

Patients receiving pioglitazone in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see].

5.3 Hepatic Effects

There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date [see].

Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone should be initiated with caution.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.

Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone can be used with caution.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis: short of evidence, plenty of potential [^b92349ea]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in patients with compensated cirrhosis is challenging due to hypoglycemic risk, altered pharmacokinetics, and the lack of robust evidence on the risk/benefit ratio of various drugs. Suboptimal glycemic control accelerates the progression of cirrhosis, while the frequent coexistence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with T2D highlights the need for a multifactorial therapeutic approach.

Methods

A literature search was performed in Medline, Google Scholar and Scopus databases till July 2023, using relevant keywords to extract studies regarding the management of T2D in patients with compensated cirrhosis.

Results

Metformin, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are promising treatment options for patients with T2D and compensated liver cirrhosis, offering good glycemic control with minimal risk of hypoglycemia, while their pleiotropic actions confer benefits on NAFLD and body weight, and decrease cardiorenal risk. Sulfonylureas cause hypoglycemia, thus should be avoided, while in specific studies, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors have been correlated with increased risk of decompensation and variceal bleeding. Despite the benefits of thiazolidinediones in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, concerns about edema and weight gain limit their use in compensated cirrhosis. Insulin does not exert hepatotoxic effects and can be administered safely in combination with other drugs; however, the risk of hypoglycemia should be considered.

Conclusions

The introduction of new hepatoprotective diabetes drugs into clinical practice, including tirzepatide, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RA, sets the stage for future trials to investigate the ideal therapeutic regimen for people with T2D and compensated cirrhosis.

### Lessons from the glitazones: a story of drug development [^253be168]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Troglitazone, the first in the thiazolidinedione class of oral hypoglycaemic agents, was launched in the USA in March, 1997. It reached Europe later that year, only to be withdrawn within weeks on the grounds of liver toxicity. Meanwhile it went on to generate sales of over $2 billion in the USA, and caused at least 90 cases of liver failure (70 resulting in death or transplantation) before it was withdrawn in March, 2000. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone reached the US market in 1999 as first-line agents to be used alone or in combination with other drugs, but in Europe the same dossiers were used one year later to apply for a limited licence as second-line agents restricted to oral combination therapy. How should we use the glitazones? And how did they achieve blockbuster status without any clear evidence of advantage over existing therapy?

### Evaluation of liver function in type 2 diabetic patients during clinical trials: evidence that rosiglitazone does not cause hepatic dysfunction [^9709ac51]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Troglitazone treatment has been associated with idiosyncratic hepatic reaction leading to hepatic failure and death in some patients. This raises questions regarding whether all thiazolidinediones or peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists are hepatotoxic and whether data from clinical trials are adequate to detect a signal of potentially serious drug-related hepatotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the idiosyncratic liver toxicity reported with troglitazone is molecule-specific or a thiazolidinedione class effect, based on liver enzyme data collected prospectively during phase 2/3 clinical trials with rosiglitazone, a new, potent, and specific member of the thiazolidinedione class.

Research Design and Methods

This is an analysis of liver function in type 2 diabetic patients at baseline and serially in 13 double-blind, 2 open-label active-controlled, and 7 open-label extension studies of rosiglitazone treatment conducted in outpatient centers throughout North America and Europe. The study comprised > 6,000 patients aged 30–80 years with type 2 diabetes. Patients underwent baseline liver function studies and were excluded from clinical trials if they had an alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or alkaline phosphatase value 2.5 times greater than the upper limit of the reference range. The main outcome measures were liver enzyme levels, which were assessed at screening, at baseline, and every 4 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment and at 6- to 12-week intervals thereafter. Patients with at least one on-therapy ALT value > 3 times the upper limit of the reference range were identified, and their case records examined in detail.

Results

At baseline, 5.6% of the patients with type 2 diabetes (mean HbA(1c) 8.5–9.0%) had serum ALT values between 1.0 and 2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range. On antidiabetic therapy, most of those patients (approximately 83%) had a decrease in ALT values, many into the normal range. The percentages of all patients with an on-therapy ALT value > 3 times the upper limit of the reference range during double-blind and open-label treatment were as follows: rosiglitazone-treated 0.32%, placebo-treated 0.17%, and sulfonylurea-, metformin-, or insulin-treated 0.40%. The respective rates of ALT values > 3 times the upper limit of the reference range per 100 person-years of exposure were 0.29, 0.59, and 0.64.

Conclusions

No evidence of hepatotoxic effects was observed in studies that involved 5,006 patients taking rosiglitazone as monotherapy or combination therapy for 5,508 person-years. This is in keeping with hepatic data from clinical trials of another member of the class, pioglitazone, and in contrast to the clear evidence of hepatotoxic effects observed during the troglitazone clinical trial program. These findings suggest that the idiosyncratic liver toxicity observed with troglitazone is unlikely to be a thiazolidinedione or a PPAR-gamma agonist class effect. Poorly controlled patients with type 2 diabetes may have moderate elevations of serum ALT that will decrease with improved glycemic control during treatment with rosiglitazone or other antihyperglycemic agents.

### Pioglitazone and glimepiride (Duetact) [^c870ec93]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommendations for All Patients

DUETACT should be taken once daily with the first main meal.

DUETACT tablets are available as a 30 mg pioglitazone plus 2 mg glimepiride or a 30 mg pioglitazone plus 4 mg glimepiride tablet. If therapy with a combination tablet containing pioglitazone and glimepiride is considered appropriate the recommended starting dose is:

30 mg/2 mg or 30 mg/4 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,
for patients inadequately controlled on glimepiride monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg or 30 mg/4 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,
for patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,
for patients who are changing from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus glimepiride as separate tablets: DUETACT should be taken at doses that are as close as possible to the dose of pioglitazone and glimepiride already being taken,
for patients currently on a different sulfonylurea monotherapy or switching from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus a different sulfonylurea (e.g., glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, acetohexamide): 30 mg/2 mg once daily and adjusted after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response. Observe for hypoglycemia for one to two weeks due to the potential overlapping drug effect.
for patients with systolic dysfunction, the lowest approved dose of DUETACT should be prescribed only after titration from 15 mg to 30 mg of pioglitazone has been safely tolerated.

After initiation of DUETACT or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for hypoglycemia and adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating DUETACT. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with DUETACT is not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of DUETACT or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking DUETACT should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Diabetes medications and risk of HCC [^0791eaa6]. Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

It is worth emphasizing that most of the studies assessing the effects of various diabetic medications on HCC incidence did not adjust for the same confounders (i.e. cirrhosis, diabetes duration and severity, etiology of liver disease, and nature of comparator group) and for the degree of metabolic control of diabetes. As the presence of diabetes may predict more severe liver dysfunction, treatment of diabetes (and treatment with some drugs) may just represent a proxy of more advanced liver disease, and most studies have not truly adjusted for the competing mortality related to liver failure. Moreover, most diabetic patients were on multiple glucose‐lowering agents simultaneously; hence, the nature of the control group for each drug consisted of patients treated with multiple diabetic medications, each one with an inherent cancer‐modifying effect. Diabetes duration and severity may increase the risk of HCC, and the prescription of multiple antidiabetic agents and insulin is reflective of more severe glycemic impairment. Finally, although some studies tried to adjust their analyses for co‐prescription of other drugs with a putative effect on HCC development such as statins, it is difficult to truly rule out the potential effect attributable to the use of diabetic medications alone. Thus, notwithstanding the increasing evidence in this field, it is difficult to interpret whether the risk modification for any one agent is real or confounded by diabetes severity, exposure to different glucose‐lowering medications, or various of other medications commonly used in patients affected by the metabolic syndrome. However, based on the current evidence, we could argue that metformin may be considered the first‐line treatment option for patients with advanced compensated chronic liver disease, and that in case of unsatisfactory glycemic control, it would be prudent to avoid sulfonylureas and insulin in favor of newer glucose‐lowering drugs such as TZDs, SGLT‐2 inhibitors, DDP4‐inhibitors and GLP1‐RAs, particularly in light of the data supporting their potential protective effect against HCC development. However, in the case of the selection of SGLT‐2 inhibitors, special attention should be paid to the potential occurrence of urinary tract infections, which are a common complication of these drugs due to their intrinsic mechanism of action that causes glycosuria, and that actually represent one the most frequent infections in patients with cirrhosis. GLP1‐RAs may be preferred in patients needing to lose weight, as these drugs favor weight loss, whereas TZDs should be avoided in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events. Conversely, in the case of patients with decompensated liver disease, insulin remains the safest option, as consistent evidence has shown its efficacy and safety in this subpopulation, and these patients are often candidates to liver transplantation independently of the presence of HCC, thus decreasing the potential HCC risks associated with long‐term treatment. With regard to non‐insulin agents, until specific guidelines are created, use of these classes of drugs may be considered in compensated and mildly decompensated cirrhosis (i.e. Child‐Pugh class A or B), with the recommendation of caution and strict monitoring of liver and renal function tests, whereas all of them should be avoided in cases of severely decompensated cirrhosis (i.e. Child‐Pugh class C or score > 9), in which insulin is the sole safe treatment option.

### Semaglutide 2. 4 mg once weekly in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Dash_related cirrhosis: a randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial [^ad268bea]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis are at particularly high risk of developing potentially life-threatening liver-related morbidities, such as portal hypertension, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related mortality, and cardiovascular events. – By 2030, advanced liver disease amongst patients with NASH is expected to rise by 160% to nearly 8 million cases in the USA, leading to an estimated 3·5 million cases of cirrhosis and more than 100 000 cases of decompensated disease. This increase in prevalence is associated with an ageing population and increased incidence of metabolic syndrome related to the epidemic rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Indeed, approximately 71% of patients with NASH-related cirrhosis have type 2 diabetes, and suboptimal glycaemic control is a marker of advanced disease and adverse clinical outcomes.

Patients with NASH-related cirrhosis have a high unmet need for effective pharmacotherapies to improve the natural history of this disease, including the associated increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, yet there are currently no approved pharmacotherapies for the treatment of NASH. Currently, first-line treatment in patients with compensated cirrhosis and overweight or obesity involves lifestyle interventions to safely achieve weight loss and treat comorbidities (eg, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and diabetes). Despite this, there is limited evidence that lifestyle modification or treating comorbidities in patients with cirrhosis improves liver-related morbidity or mortality. From a liver perspective, the main aim of treatment is to prevent progression of cirrhosis to end-stage liver disease (hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure, which are increasingly likely with increasing fibrosis), for which liver transplantation remains the only curative treatment option. Unfortunately, due to obesity and metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities, many patients may not be listed for liver transplantation.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) exert multiorgan effects and have been shown to lower HbA 1c in people with type 2 diabetes and reduce bodyweight in individuals with overweight or obesity, and are associated with a reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. – It has been suggested that GLP-1RAs may have hepatoprotective effects. In a previous placebo-controlled trial, the GLP-1RA semaglutide improved metabolic parameters and NASH resolution and was well tolerated in patients with NASH without cirrhosis (fibrosis stage [F] 1–3). However, there are at present no data with semaglutide in patients with NASH-related cirrhosis. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis.

### Combination therapy using metformin or thiazolidinediones and insulin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus [^1baa6a2c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The biguanide, metformin, sensitizes the liver to the effect of insulin, suppressing hepatic glucose output. Thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone enhance insulin-mediated glucose disposal, leading to reduced plasma insulin concentrations. These classes of drugs may also have varying beneficial effects on features of insulin resistance such as lipid levels, blood pressure and body weight. Metformin in combination with insulin has been shown to significantly improve blood glucose levels while lowering total daily insulin dose and body weight. The thiazolidinediones in combination with insulin have also been effective in lowering blood glucose levels and total daily insulin dose. Triple combination therapy using insulin, metformin and a thiazolidinedione improves glycaemic control to a greater degree than dual therapy using insulin and metformin or insulin and a thiazolidinedione. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of metformin or thiazolidinediones in type 1 diabetic patients. Although these agents are largely well tolerated, some subjects experience significant gastrointestinal problems while using metformin. Metformin is associated with a low risk of lactic acidosis, but should not be used in patients with elevated serum creatinine or those being treated for congestive heart failure. The thiazolidinediones are associated with an increase in body weight, although this can be avoided with careful lifestyle management. Thiazolidinediones may also lead to oedema and are associated with a low incidence of hepatocellular injury. Thiazolidinediones are contraindicated in patients with underlying heart disease who are at risk of congestive heart failure and in patients who have abnormal hepatic function. The desired blood glucose-lowering effect and adverse event profiles of these agents should be considered when recommending these agents to diabetic patients. The potential for metformin or the thiazolidinediones to impact long-term cardiovascular outcomes remains under investigation.

### Occurrence of liver injury with use of pioglitazone… [^5b723d0a]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Thiazolidinedione agents decrease blood sugar by lowering insulin resistance. The thiazolidinedione agent troglitazone has been removed from the market because of its association with severe liver injury. Rosiglitazone, another compound in this class, has been associated with a few cases of liver injury. Pioglitazone, the newest of these agents, has been associated with liver damage in only one previous case report. May and associates describe a patient who developed acute, reversible, mixed hepatocellular–cholestatic liver damage while taking pioglitazone. The authors conclude that pioglitazone is potentially hepatotoxic and, especially during the first year of therapy, patients should be closely monitored for liver dysfunction. As with troglitazone and rosiglitazone, damage to the liver is probably idiosyncratic, although many more cases were reported with troglitazone.

It remains unclear whether the concomitant use of other glucose-lowering or antihypertensive medications exacerbates the potential liver toxicity of pioglitazone. In an editorial in the same journal, Nierenberg notes that although pioglitazone probably causes hepatic injury, the reporting of only two cases makes a definite conclusion difficult to reach. He notes that infrequent drug toxicities may not be identified until a very large number of people have used the drug. Monitoring of liver function tests as recommended, both before drug administration and every two months during the first year of use, will allow early drug termination if liver enzyme levels increase to more than three times the upper limit of normal or if clinical hepatitis develops. Physicians can help by reporting all acute drug reactions to the manufacturer and/or the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. Nierenberg concludes that pioglitazone appears to be significantly safer than troglitazone, but the frequency of severe liver side effects of pioglitazone may not be known until more patients have used the drug.

### A cohort study of the incidence of serious acute liver injury in diabetic patients treated with hypoglycemic agents… [^1e73969f]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Results We identified 35 cases of acute liver failure or injury not clearly attributable to a known cause other than use of hypoglycemic agents. The age- and sex-standardized incidence per 1000 person-years was 0. 15 for insulin users,
0. 08 for sulfonylurea users, 0. 12 for metformin users, and
0. 10 for troglitazone users. The incidence was higher during the first 6 months of exposure to all hypoglycemic agents. The overall age-and sex-standardized incidence in the study cohort, regardless of drug exposure, was 0. 07 per 1000 person-years for probable or possible acute liver failure and
0. 1 per 1000 person-years for acute liver failure or injury. Considering only cases of acute liver failure, age- and sex-standardized incidence is approximately 1 per 10 000 person-years or less for each drug exposure group.

We reexamined the incidence of acute liver failure and acute liver injury by restricting follow-up to the first 6 months of exposure to each drug group #1Table 4). The incidence was larger, indicating increased risk during the early course of therapy, but again similar across the 4 drug groups. An analysis of all hospitalized acute liver events, regardless of their disposition, did not materially affect the relative order of the incidence. With adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidity, the hazard ratios did not differ substantially across the 4 drug groups. The hazard ratio for insulin was largest, whereas the hazard ratios for the other 3 drug groups were nearly identical. We then fitted these models without the chronic disease score so that all study patients and liver events could be included.

Results did not change substantially except that the hazard ratios for insulin and metformin increased and the 95% confidence intervals excluded the null value. The incidence in patients exposed to different oral hypoglycemic drugs seemed to be similar, and patients with concomitant chronic diseases were at higher risk of developing an acute liver event. This is crucial information in the risk-benefit profiles of hypoglycemic agents that will help physicians select specific drugs to treat patients with diabetes mellitus.

### Guidelines for the management of adult acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure in the ICU: cardiovascular, endocrine, hematologic, pulmonary and renal considerations: executive summary [^87bf7910]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Adult acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ALF/ACLF) — glycemic control in critically ill patients with hyperglycemia is directed as follows: We recommend targeting a serum blood glucose of 110–180 mg/dL in patients with ALF or ACLF (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence), in response to the question comparing very tight (80–109 mg/dL) with conventional (110–180 mg/dL) glycemic control. Evidence does not suggest the benefit of very tight glucose control as compared with conventional glucose control, very tight glucose control is associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia, patients with ALF/ACLF are at risk for hypoglycemia and the risks of hypoglycemia in this population may be underestimated, and glycemic management in these patients should incorporate the prevention of hypoglycemia to optimize outcomes.

### Drug-induced liver disease [^b80b4e58]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the pertinent case reports, case series and clinical studies that described clinical, histological, epidemiological and mechanistic features of drug-induced liver disease in 2005.

Recent Findings

Acetaminophen, highly active antiretroviral therapy and drugs for tuberculosis retained their preeminent position as the most commonly reported agents causing drug-induced liver disease, with acetaminophen continuing to be the leading cause of acute liver failure in the USA. While the frequency of drug-induced liver disease remains low, a large case-series of acute drug-induced liver disease from Spain and Sweden supported the observation that acute hepatocellular jaundice from a drug is associated with death or the need for transplant in at least 10% (known as Hy's Law). With respect to using potentially hepatotoxic medications in patients with underlying liver disease, statins and second-generation thiazolidinediones were shown to be safe when used in patients with elevated baseline alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels.

Summary

Drug-induced liver disease remains an important cause of acute liver failure, and research efforts by the National Institutes of Health and others are underway to better determine the risk factors and other host susceptibilities that will allow for the safer use of drugs in the future.

### Is insulin the preferred treatment in persons with type 2 diabetes and liver cirrhosis? [^a9bd693b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study indicated that in people with T2DM and compensated cirrhosis, insulin users showed higher risks of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, HCC, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and hypoglycemia than insulin nonusers, even after excluding persons with hypoglycemia.

Insulin treatment is frequently used in persons with diabetes and liver cirrhosis. Elkrief et al. reported that of 348 persons with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis, 62% were on insulin therapy. Gentile et al. found that acarbose significantly improved fasting and postprandial glucose levels in 100 persons with compensated cirrhosis and insulin-treated T2DM. They also compared the metabolic profiles of lispro and regular human insulin in persons with diet-unresponsive T2DM and compensated nonalcoholic liver disease and found that lispro caused lower postprandial glucose levels and hypoglycemic rates. Insulin requirements in persons with liver cirrhosis vary; persons with decompensated cirrhosis may need less insulin compared with persons diagnosed as having compensated cirrhosis. Therefore, insulin therapy in people with liver cirrhosis requires close monitoring of blood glucose levels to avoid the risks of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Our study disclosed that the use of insulin was associated with a significantly higher risk of severe hypoglycemia in persons with compensated cirrhosis compared with oral antidiabetic agents.

People with liver cirrhosis have a 5–10 times higher risk of death than the general population, and diabetes can increase their mortality risk. Insulin was reported to be associated with a high risk of mortality in persons with T2DM; our study also showed that among persons with compensated liver cirrhosis, insulin users demonstrated a higher risk of all-cause mortality than insulin nonusers. Although hypoglycemia may increase the risk of death, we observed similar results even after excluding persons with hypoglycemia. Moreover, because insulin users in this study showed increased risks of major cardiovascular events, cirrhotic decompensation, and liver failure, these conditions may also increase the risk of death.

People with liver cirrhosis were reported to have a low prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, which may be because of their short life expectancy and low levels of clotting factors in their blood. Coexisting T2DM may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases; however, their prevalence is still lower than that of general population with T2DM only. Insulin therapy was reported to increase the risk of cardiovascular complications in persons with T2DM. Our study also illustrated that insulin use in persons with compensated liver cirrhosis was associated with a higher risk of MACE, and these hazards persisted even after excluding persons with hypoglycemia. Excess exposure to insulin and hyperinsulinemia are thought to increase basal insulin signaling, which can contribute to insulin resistance and cause atherosclerosis.

3.2 Warnings and contraindications

The triple combination of metformin, DPP‐4i, and SGLT2i has an overall incidence of adverse events comparable to that of metformin monotherapy or dual therapy with metformin plus DPP‐4i or SGLT2i. The risk of severe hypoglycaemia is very low. No pharmacokinetic interactions are reported among the three medications. However, the use of this regimen (including FDCs) is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity or contraindications to any component. FDCs are not suitable for patients requiring dose adjustment of any single component.

This regimen is not recommended for patients with serum transaminase levels > 3× ULN or with clinical or laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction. Kidney dysfunction may cause metformin‐associated lactic acidosis. The triple regimen is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Kidney function is recommended to be assessed before treatment initiation, with subsequent annual monitoring in patients with normal kidney function and 2–4 times per year in patients with impaired kidney function. Recommended dose adjustments for patients with liver or kidney dysfunction are summarized in Table 4.

TABLE 4
Dose adjustments of metformin, DPP‐4i, and SGLT2i in T2DM patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

For older adults with T2DM, metformin, DPP‐4i, and SGLT2i are the first‐recommended medication.SGLT2i are preferred for older patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or those with high‐risk factors, heart failure, and/or chronic kidney disease. Older adults often have multiple comorbidities, and thus polypharmacy (concurrent use of ≥ 5 medications) is common, increasing the risk of drug–drug interactions and hypoglycaemia. In addition, this population has poor perception and tolerance to hypoglycaemia. Therefore, anti‐diabetic regimens with a low risk of hypoglycaemia (e.g. metformin + DPP‐4i + SGLT2i) and simplified regimens (e.g. FDCs) are preferred for older patients. Given the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency during long‐term use of metformin, regular monitoring of vitamin B12 levels is advised, especially in older adults.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with several comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, hyperlipidaemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide. NAFLD is common among people with T2DM, demonstrating a global prevalence of approximately 55% in this population, with the highest prevalence rates, 70%, reported in Europe. 1 An elevated risk for progression to more severe liver diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis, as well as end‐stage liver disease, is evident. 2, 3 Recently, a population‐based cohort study found a significant increase in the indication for liver transplantation associated with NAFLD from 2.0% to 6.2% over the last three decades. 4 Facing these complications of NAFLD, interventions that are able to effectively and safely reduce excess hepatocellular lipids (HCLs) need to be identified urgently.

Recent national and international clinical practice guidelines recommend new drug classes, such as sodium‐glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) as the main treatment options in high‐risk CVD patients, based on their cardiovascular and renal benefits. 5, 6, 7 Moreover, disease‐modifying effects on NAFLD were reported for several glucose‐lowering drugs, including some GLP‐1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors. Indeed, more and more patients in clinical routine are using combined GLP‐1RA and SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, showing strong glucose‐lowering potential and weight reduction. 8, 9 Whether treatment combinations also have synergistic cardiovascular or renal effects, are more beneficial in patients with heart failure, or are able to reduce HCLs more effectively is not well investigated and thus needs further examination in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Metformin overdose, but not lactic acidosis per se, inhibits oxygen consumption in pigs [^11163cab]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metformin is the drug of choice for adults with type 2 diabetes. It is a safe drug although lactic acidosis rarely develops as a side effect. In most of the cases, drug use is only coincidental and lactic acidosis is due to concomitant hypoxia, tissue hypoperfusion or liver failure (metformin-associated lactic acidosis). Less frequently, no other major risk factor can be identified and drug accumulation, prompted by renal failure for instance, is the most probable cause of the syndrome (metformin-induced lactic acidosis).

The pathogenesis of metformin-induced lactic acidosis remains unclear. Some authors even question whether metformin per se can cause lactic acidosis. Some others mainly attribute it to changes in liver lactate metabolism. Metformin readily accumulates in hepatocytes, that express the organic cation transporter 1, and inhibits their mitochondrial respiration in a dose-dependent manner. As a possible result, liver lactate output increases and uptake decreases (along with gluconeogenesis). However, critically ill metformin-intoxicated patients may have a 30 to 60% decrease in their global oxygen extraction and consumption, as for generalized (and not solely hepatic) mitochondrial dysfunction. Lactate overproduction from tissues other than the liver may then occur.

The aim of the present study was to clarify whether metformin intoxication inhibits whole-body respiration and alters mitochondrial function in the liver and other tissues.

### Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor translational research and clinical experience [^d6146e91]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Since the early 1970s, pharmaceutical biochemists have sought to exploit the scientific findings that were uncovered when they studied the basis for the function and mode of action of fibric acid derivatives. In the early 1970s, little was known of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), even in concept. Since then, however, the development of bioactive small molecules in medicinal science has resulted in tools developed to be inserted into the PPAR-binding domain, which has resulted in the recognition of literally thousands of possible biological effects of binding configurations. In diabetes care, the first of the marketed agents from these discoveries and developments was introduced in 1996. It was potent and did its job well. However, the use of this early form of thiazolidinedione sometimes, although rarely, led to fulminant liver failure, and ultimately the drug was removed from the market. Subsequent thiazolidinediones have been developed, and 2 have been relatively successful. However, they are not without their problems. This article describes the history of the development of these drugs, identifies the valuable attributes that they possess, and gives a clear rationale as to why a quest for a "safer" PPAR agonist is still being sought.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In the VICTOZA treatment arms of the glycemic control trials, a total of 832 (19.3%) of the patients were 65 to 74 years of age and 145 (3.4%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In the VICTOZA treatment arm of the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], a total of 1738 (37.2%) patients were 65 to 74 years of age, 401 (8.6%) were 75 to 84 years of age, and 17 (0.4%) were 85 years of age or older at baseline.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness for VICTOZA have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger patients.

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment of VICTOZA is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The safety and efficacy of VICTOZA was evaluated in a 26-week clinical study that included patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m2) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

In the VICTOZA treatment arm of the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], 1,932 (41.4%) patients had mild renal impairment, 999 (21.4%) patients had moderate renal impairment and 117 (2.5%) patients had severe renal impairment at baseline. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were seen in these patients compared to patients with normal renal function.

There is limited experience with VICTOZA in patients with end stage renal disease.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

There is limited experience in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, VICTOZA should be used with caution in this patient population. No dose adjustment of VICTOZA is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Reduced mortality and morbidity associated with metformin and SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis [^42a33d30]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metformin is a standard initial treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), though some patients require additional glucose-lowering agents due to disease progression. Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-I) have been recommended as part of stepwise combination therapy for T2DM patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), kidney disease, or those who are at risk for cardiorenal comorbidities. Newer guidelines now recommend using SGLT2-I as part of a first-line glucose-lowering regimen in consideration of person-specific factors.

Cirrhosis is the third leading cause of death in adults aged 45–65 years. It is a common comorbidity of T2DM, which is thought to be related to the progression of fatty liver and steatohepatitis. Over time, patients with cirrhosis can develop decompensation, characterized by ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding, all of which in turn increase mortality risk.

Moreover, other studies suggest that chronic hyperglycemia exacerbates liver disease and increases cirrhosis-related complications. Currently, there is scarce evidence for the utility of anti-diabetic medications in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with T2DMand cirrhosis. Evidence for the use of SGLT2-I in patients with liver disease has been limited to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), previously called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), respectively. Preclinical and clinical data showed that SGLT2-I treatment may improve liver histology and lab testing in MASH and MASLD patients. Furthermore, SGLT2-I promotes osmotic diuresis and targets neurohormonal pathways that benefit blood pressure. There is reason to believe that SGLT2-I may also target pathways in patients with cirrhosis that slow fibrosis progression and reduce the risk for complications such as decompensation events and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

We sought to determine whether patients with cirrhosis and T2DM had a mortality benefit and reduced risk for complications such as decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma when on dual therapy with metformin and an SGLT2-I versus on metformin alone.

KDOQI narrative — Thiazolidinediones and dosing oversight in CKD: Rosiglitazone is cleared by the liver and does not have to be reduced with impaired kidney function, and therefore rosiglitazone does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with CKD, but it has the potential, along with pioglitazone, to worsen fluid retention. Doses are not specified by level of kidney function, but should be adjusted based on frequent monitoring to balance goals of glycemic control with avoiding hypoglycemia, and other considerations include avoiding or minimizing the occurrence of interactions with drugs used to lower blood glucose.

Discussion

The novel results of this large nationwide cohort study suggest an association between SGLT-2i treatment and a lower risk of hepatic decompensation events, including ascites, oesophageal varices with bleeding, and hepatic failure, and liver transplant in patients with MASLD when compared with TZD treatment. Notably, the hepatic effectiveness of SGLT-2i was greater in female than male patients, and in patients aged less than 65 years. Importantly, there was no significant difference in the risk of hepatic effectiveness when comparing SGLT-2i to GLP-1RA and the robustness of these findings remained consistent across sensitivity analyses.

Elimination of lixisenatide is also through the kidneys. Caution is advised with moderate renal impairment, and lixisenatide is not recommended in patients with ESRD or severe renal impairment 55.

Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized, with no single organ providing the major route of elimination 61. Liraglutide exposure is not elevated in patients with renal impairment but is not currently recommended in patients with severe renal impairment, including ESRD, because of limited clinical experience in this population (Table S1). Ongoing and recently completed clinical trials are investigating liraglutide use in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (NCT01620489, NCT01394341 and NCT01179048).

Albiglutide and dulaglutide are metabolized and do not require dose adjustment with moderate renal impairment, but are not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment, including ESRD 57, 58.

Limited data exist regarding the use of GLP‐1RAs in patients with hepatic functional impairment 62, 63. Although hepatic functional impairment is not anticipated to adversely affect exposure levels, GLP‐1RAs are not recommended in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment because of limited clinical experience.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed in these studies according to renal function [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3, 14.4)].

In a clinical pharmacology study in patients with renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), no clinically relevant change in dulaglutide pharmacokinetics (PK) was observed. In the 52-week trial in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe renal impairment, the PK behavior of TRULICITY 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg once weekly was similar to that demonstrated in previous clinical studies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment including end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions. Use TRULICITY with caution in patients with ESRD [see Warning and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

In a clinical pharmacology study in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, no clinically relevant change in dulaglutide PK was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. However, there is limited clinical experience in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, use TRULICITY with caution in these patient populations.

Results

We included 1026 initiators of GLP1 agonists and 15 633 non-initiators, who participated in up to 123 target trials. The patient characteristics at baseline before and after weighting are summarised in table 2. After IPTW, all baseline characteristics were well balanced (SMD < 0.1). Kernel density plots also indicated good balance (online supplemental figure 1). Of the initiators, 635 (61.9%) started treatment with liraglutide, 231 (22.5%) semaglutide, 120 (11.7%) dulaglutide, 25 (2.4%) exenatide and 15 (1.5%) lixisenatide at baseline.

Table 2
Patient characteristics at baseline before and after inverse-probability of treatment weighting

In the intention-to-treat analysis, initiators and non-initiators were followed for a median (p25–p75) of 64 (36–96) and 76 months (50–100), respectively. 350 of 605 (57.9%) initiators still at risk at 2 years were continuous users at this time. The corresponding numbers at 4, 6, 8 and 10 years were 143 of 331 (43.2%), 64 of 188 (34.0%), 24 of 98 (24.5%) and 5 of 19 (26.3%), respectively. In the per-protocol analysis, where the patients were censored if they deviated from their assigned treatment strategy, the median follow-up was 43 (21–75) and 76 months (50–100), respectively. After a median of 14 months (8–26) follow-up, 517 (50.4%) initiators stopped the treatment; 21 (2.1%) initiators stopped the treatment after developing a contraindication, and 496 (48.3%) stopped the treatment without one of the prespecified contraindications. Of the 1026 initiators, 361 (35.2%) were censored in the per-protocol analysis because they stopped the treatment with a prespecified contraindication the first 2 years, another 92 (9.0%) between 2 and 4 years, 28 (2.7%) between 4 and 6 years, 11 (1.1%) between 6 and 8 years, and 4 (0.4%) between 8 and 10 years. Among the non-initiators, 2357 (15.1%) started treatment with a GLP1 agonist after a median follow-up of 31 months (14–52).

QUESTION 4: DOES INPATIENT MANAGEMENT OF HYPERGLYCEMIA REPRESENT A SAFETY CONCERN?

Overtreatment and undertreatment of hyperglycemia represent major safety issues in hospitalized patients with and without diabetes. Fear of hypoglycemia, clinical inertia, and medical errors are major barriers to achieving optimal blood glucose control (,–). In most clinical situations, safe and reasonable glycemic control can be achieved with appropriate use of insulin, adjusted according to results of bedside glucose monitoring.

Clinical situations that increase the risk for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the hospital include the following:
Changes in caloric or carbohydrate intake ("nothing by mouth" status, enteral nutrition, or parenteral nutrition)
Change in clinical status or medications (for example, corticosteroids or vasopressors)
Failure of the clinician to make adjustments to glycemic therapy based on daily BG patterns
Prolonged use of SSI as monotherapy
Poor coordination of BG testing and administration of insulin with meals
Poor communication during times of patient transfer to different care teams
Use of long-acting sulfonylureas in elderly patients and those with kidney or liver insufficiency
Errors in order writing and transcription

Hypoglycemia is a major safety concern with use of insulin and insulin secretagogues. Hypoglycemia can occur spontaneously in patients with sepsis orin patients who receive certain medications, including quinolone antibiotics and β-adrenergic agonists. Although not all hypoglycemic episodes are avoidable, the use of nurse-driven hypoglycemia treatment protocols that prompt early therapy for any BG levels < 70 mg/dl (< 3.9 mmol/l) can prevent deterioration of potentially mild events — for example, BG values of 60–69 mg/dl (3.3–3.8 mmol/l) — to more severe events — for example, BG concentrations < 40 mg/dl (< 2.2 mmol/l). Particular attention is required in high-risk patients, including those with malnutrition; advanced age; a history of severehypoglycemia; or autonomic, kidney, liver, or cardiac failure.

Clinical inertia can be defined as not adjusting glycemic therapy in response to persistently abnormal results on BG determination. Often, there is a lack of ownership for diabetes management, particularly in hospitalized patients admitted with a primary diagnosis other than diabetes. This inaction may be due in part to insufficient knowledge or confidence in diabetes management. Improvements in care can be achieved by ongoing education and training.

Reduce the starting dose to 2.5 mg daily in elderly patients and in patients with hepatic impairment or receiving other hypoglycemic agents.

### Diabetes medications and risk of HCC [^6001a115]. Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conversely, other studies have demonstrated that TZDs may not be associated with a reduced risk of HCC and may in fact be associated with increased cardiovascular adverse events in patients with cirrhosis. For example, a study compared the risks for all‐cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and hepatic outcomes in 1705 patients with T2DM and cirrhosis based on TZD use. For the patients on TZD, the aHRs (95% CIs) for stroke, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure were 1.81 (1.28–2.55), 1.59 (1.03–2.44), and 2.09 (1.22–3.60), respectively. Conversely, all‐cause mortality, HCC, decompensated cirrhosis, and hepatic failure risks did not differ significantly between TZD users and nonusers. Therefore, given the lack of hepatic benefit with TZD use, the authors expressed caution in prescribing TZDs to patients with T2DM and cirrhosis, given the higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular complications. It is worth noting, however, that because TZDs are at best second‐line for T2DM, there is a risk of bias in observational studies, because patients treated with TZDs will be the ones who have not achieved adequate glycemic control with first‐line therapy. In addition, socioeconomic factors may play a role, as TZD are far cheaper than sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP1), and dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) modulating drugs.

Overall, there is insufficient evidence to recommend against or in favor of the use of TZDs in patients with comorbid T2DM and cirrhosis, as the potential benefit on liver‐related outcomes has yet to be consistently demonstrated. Moreover, because there is evidence of increased cardiovascular complications in patients with cirrhosis treated with TZDs, these drugs should be prescribed with caution in subjects who have significant risk factors for, or history of, cardiovascular disease. Note, however, that the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) currently recommends the use of TZDs to treat patients with biopsy‐proven NASH, which is a common complication in patients with T2DM.

### Safety and efficacy of linagliptin in type 2 diabetes patients with common renal and cardiovascular risk factors [^faa20df3]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitors have become an important orally active drug class for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as second-line therapy after metformin failure or as monotherapy or combination therapy with other drugs when metformin is not tolerated or contraindicated. DPP-4 inhibitors act mainly by increasing endogenous incretin hormone concentrations. They stimulate insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner with a significantly lower risk for hypoglycaemia than sulfonylureas. Furthermore, DPP-4 inhibitors are weight neutral. Linagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that is eliminated by a hepatobiliary route, whereas the other DPP-4 inhibitors available today show a renal elimination. Therefore, it can be used in normal kidney function as well as in all stages of chronic kidney disease to stage 5 (glomerular filtration rate < 15 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) without dose adjustments. Linagliptin was noninferior to metformin and sulfonylureas in clinical studies. In recent studies, it showed a superior safety profile over sulfonylurea treatment regarding hypoglycaemia and weight gain. More patients reached an HbA1c < 7% without hypoglycaemia and weight gain with linagliptin compared with glimepiride. The safety profile with respect to a composite cardiovascular endpoint and stroke was also favourable for linagliptin, most likely due to a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia associated with glimepiride therapy and titration. This review gives an overview on the efficacy and safety of linagliptin in comparison with other antidiabetic drugs in type 2 diabetes patients with renal and cardiovascular risk factors as well as an outlook on the perspective for linagliptin in this patient population in the future.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and risk of major adverse liver outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease and type 2 diabetes [^1e62201d]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Phase II trials suggest glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1) agonists resolve metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis but do not affect fibrosis regression. We aimed to determine the long-term causal effect of GLP1 agonists on the risk of major adverse liver outcomes (MALO) in patients with any chronic liver disease and type 2 diabetes.

Design

We used observational data from Swedish healthcare registers 2010–2020 to emulate a target trial of GLP1 agonists in eligible patients with chronic liver disease and type 2 diabetes. We used an inverse-probability weighted marginal structural model to compare parametric estimates of 10-year MALO risk (decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation or MALO-related death) in initiators of GLP1 agonists with non-initiators. We randomly sampled 5% of the non-initiators to increase computational efficiency.

Results

GLP1 agonist initiators had a 10-year risk of MALO at 13.3% (42/1026) vs 14.6% in non-initiators (1079/15 633) in intention-to-treat analysis (risk ratio (RR) = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.50 to 1.32). The corresponding 10-year per-protocol risk estimates were 7.4% (22/1026) and 14.4% (1079/15 633), respectively (RR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.14 to 0.88). The per-protocol risk estimates at 6 years were 5.4% (21/1026) vs 9.0% (933/15 633) (RR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.29 to 0.90) and at 8 years 7.2% (22/1026) vs 11.7% (1036/15 633) (RR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.21 to 1.01).

Conclusion

In patients with chronic liver disease and type 2 diabetes who adhered to therapy over time, GLP1 agonists may result in lower risk of MALO. This suggests that GLP1 agonists are promising agents to reduce risk of chronic liver disease progression in patients with concurrent type 2 diabetes, although this needs to be corroborated in randomised trials.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use is associated with a lower risk of major adverse liver-related outcomes: a meta-analysis of observational cohort studies [^0a22e750]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have shown promising effects on liver histology in phase 2 trials enrolling patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. However, the impact of GLP-1RAs on the long-term risk of major adverse liver-related outcomes (MALOs) remains uncertain.

Objective

We performed a meta-analysis of observational cohort studies to quantify the magnitude and direction of the association between GLP-1RA use and MALOs in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Design

We systematically searched eligible cohort studies comparing GLP-1RA new users versus users of other glucose-lowering medications. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence rates of MALOs. Secondary outcomes included hepatic decompensation events, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related mortality. Random-effects models were used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs).

Results

11 retrospective cohort studies with aggregate data on 1 467 220 patients with T2D (647903 GLP-1RA new users, 819317 non-users) were included. GLP-1RA use was significantly associated with a lower risk of MALOs (IRR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88) and hepatic decompensation (IRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94). Association with reduced risk of HCC was also observed (IRR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11). Compared with other antidiabetic medications, GLP-1RAs showed superior effectiveness versus SGLT2 inhibitors in preventing MALOs (IRR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.99), versus DPP-4 inhibitors in preventing hepatic decompensation (IRR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.83) and versus insulin therapy in preventing HCC (IRR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.80).

Conclusions

GLP-1RA use is associated with a lower risk of liver-related complications and hepatic decompensation in people with T2D. These findings suggest a role of GLP-1RAs in preventing liver-related complications beyond their beneficial cardiometabolic effects.

Conclusion

In conclusion, long-term use of DPP-4 inhibitors in elderly diabetic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can effectively reduce HbA1C without weight gain, and has good safety of liver and kidney. However, it should be noted that DPP-4 inhibitors should adjust the dosage based on eGFR level in order to ensure the safety of drug use in the population with renal insufficiency. More clinical studies are expected to confirm the benefits of DPP-4 inhibitors.

There is uncertainty regarding effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on the risk of major adverse liver-related outcomes (MALOs).

Purpose

We performed a meta-analysis of observational cohort studies to quantify the magnitude of the association between SGLT2 inhibitor use and risk of developing MALOs for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Data Sources

We systematically reviewed three large electronic databases from inception to January 2025.

Study Selection

We included active-comparator, new-user cohort studies with comparison of SGLT2 inhibitors versus other glucose-lowering medications in patients with T2DM.

Data Extraction

The primary outcome was incidence rate of MALOs defined as a composite of hepatic decompensation events, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, or liver-related deaths. Secondary outcomes included each of the above as individual events. Meta-analysis was performed with random-effects models.

Data Synthesis

We identified eight cohort studies with aggregate data on 626,104 patients with T2DM (397,806 SGLT2 inhibitor new users and 228,298 new users of other glucose-lowering agents). During a median of 2.7 years, SGLT2 inhibitor use was associated with significantly lower risk of MALOs (random-effects hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95; I2 = 83.1%) and liver-related deaths (0.64, 0.50–0.82; I2 = 0%). The significant risk reduction in MALOs was observed in comparisons of SGLT2 inhibitors with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, metformin, or pioglitazone but not glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists. Sensitivity analyses did not modify these results. A funnel plot did not show significant publication bias.

Limitations

Observational design of the cohort studies and high level of heterogeneity are the main limitations.

Conclusions

SGLT2 inhibitor use was associated with lower risk of MALOs for patients with T2DM.

### A perfect MASH comparing resmetirom and GLP-1 agonists for metabolic-associated steatohepatitis: what does the current evidence suggest? [^78308518]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease recently due to the rise of metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. It will continue to have a major impact on health care systems globally given its association with cardiovascular disease and liver-related complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, promising pharmacotherapies have emerged to address MASLD and fibrosis, such as resmetirom and glucagon-like-1 receptor agonists. There are ongoing studies to better understand resmetirom, glucagon-like-1 receptor agonists, and other possible pharmacotherapies. We discuss the current available literature on resmetirom, glucagon-like-1 receptor agonists, their safety and efficacy among patients with MASLD. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to guide clinicians on which currently available pharmacological therapy to select for effective management of MASLD.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^fc0824f2]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment — therapy review and modification in adults with type 2 diabetes state that combination therapy with pioglitazone plus a GLP-1 RA can be considered for the treatment of hyperglycemia in adults with biopsy-proven MASH or those at high risk of liver fibrosis; medication plan and medication-taking behavior should be reevaluated at regular intervals (e.g., every 3–6 months) and adjusted as needed; treatment modification for adults not meeting individualized treatment goals should not be delayed; the choice of glucose-lowering therapy modification should take into consideration individualized glycemic and weight goals, presence of comorbidities (cardiovascular, kidney, liver, and others), safety risks of hypoglycemia; when initiating a new glucose-lowering medication regimen, consider lower starting dosing and/or dose of medications with higher hypoglycemia risk (i.e., sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and insulin) to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia and treatment burden; and concurrent use of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors with a GLP-1 RA or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA is not recommended due to lack of additional glucose lowering beyond that of a GLP-1 RA alone.

### Is insulin the preferred treatment in persons with type 2 diabetes and liver cirrhosis? [^5b807dae]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Study design

T2DM was diagnosed based on ICD-9-CM code 250.xx with at least 2 outpatient claims within 1 year or one hospitalization. Persons with ICD-9-CM code 571.5, 571.2, or 571.6 for at least 2 outpatient claims within 1 year or one hospitalization were defined as having liver cirrhosis. This method of defining T2DM and liver cirrhosis using ICD-9-CM codes has been validated by studies; the diagnostic accuracy of diabetes and cirrhosis is 74.6% and 82.6%, respectively. Persons with liver cirrhosis and esophageal varices with bleeding (456.0 and 456.2), ascites (789.59 and 789.5), hepatic encephalopathy (572.2), or jaundice (782.4) were defined as having decompensated liver cirrhosis and were initially excluded from this study. Patients without these cirrhotic complications were defined as having compensated liver cirrhosis. We excluded persons who were diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes mellitus (ICD-9-CM code 250.1); who did not receive antidiabetic medications; who were younger than 18 years or older than 80 years; who lacked gender information; who died or had renal failure, stroke, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, HCC, esophageal varices with bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice, or hepatic failure before the index date or within 6 months after the index date; and who were diagnosed as having T2DM or cirrhosis during 1997–1999.

### More studies are needed on the link between metformin and decreased mortality in diabetic COVID-19 patients [^a0a2b623]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Dear Sir,

We would like to congratulate Luo et al.for their study about the association between metformin and decreased mortality in patients with COVID-19 and diabetes. Their findings are very interesting. However, the study by Luo et al.raises a number of issues that should be addressed.

More than 60 years after its introduction for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, metformin remains among the most widely prescribed drugs worldwide. Beyond its antidiabetic, cardiovascular, and reno-protective actions, metformin has pleiotropic effects, including cell protection, cancer prevention, immunomodulatory properties, anti-inflammatory effects, and adjuvant antimicrobial benefits in multiple infectious diseases. Interestingly, metformin has been used to treat influenza. However, metformin has some adverse effects and contraindications. It should be stopped in patients with concomitant kidney and liver failure because kidney failure leads to metformin accumulation and liver failure reduces lactate elimination, increasing the risk of lactic acidosis. Therefore, diabetic patients who do not take metformin are likely those with organ failure (heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal failure, or cirrhosis) precluding its administration. These patients are also at high risk of developing severe and critical COVID-19 characterized by respiratory and multi-organ failure, mechanical ventilation, and death. Current guidelines also recommend withdrawing metformin during periods of suspected tissue hypoxia.

### Cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of acarbose therapy in prediabetes and established type 2 diabetes [^376c1794]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

Acarbose is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream, and has a low systemic availability of less than 2%. As a result, the risk of any toxic reaction is very low and, to date, no interactions have been reported between acarbose and β-blockers, sulphonylureas, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or warfarin therapy. Some other antidiabetes agents are contraindicated with other treatments; for example, concomitant use of repaglinide with gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering agent that acts by inhibiting cytochromes, can cause prolonged hypoglycaemia.

Acarbose has been associated with rare cases of hepatotoxicity and increased liver enzyme levels, but these have not been confirmed in major trials. A few cases of fulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome have been reported; but a causal relationship with acarbose treatment has not been clearly established. A trial of 20 patients with diabetes and either chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis found that acarbose significantly decreased the level of HbA 1c, from 7.2% at entry to 6.3% (P < 0.05) after 8 weeks. More recently, a larger trial of 107 cirrhotic patients with diabetes found that, over 8 weeks, acarbose reduced postprandial glucose levels by about 50%, with no changes in liver function. By contrast, sulphonylureas, metformin and some thiazolidinediones are contraindicated in patients with moderate-to-severe liver dysfunction.

### Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride [^d17a5b0f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 642 patients who received glyburide and metformin hydrochloride in double-blind clinical studies, 23.8% were 65 and older while 2.8% were 75 and older. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Elderly patients are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of anti-diabetic agents. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in these patients.

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

8.6	Renal Impairment

Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7	Hepatic Impairment

Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Glipizide (glucotrol XL) [^a25d553a]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

General

Macrovascular Outcomes

There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with GLUCOTROL XL or any other anti-diabetic drug.

Renal and Hepatic Disease

The pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of glipizide may be affected in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. If hypoglycemia should occur in such patients, it may be prolonged and appropriate management should be instituted.

GI Disease

Markedly reduced GI retention times of the GLUCOTROL XL Extended Release Tablets may influence the pharmacokinetic profile and hence the clinical efficacy of the drug.

Hypoglycemia

All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe hypoglycemia. Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Renal or hepatic insufficiency may affect the disposition of glipizide and the latter may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious hypoglycemic reactions. Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering drugs. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more than one glucose-lowering drug is used. Therapy with a combination of glucose-lowering agents may increase the potential for hypoglycemia.

Loss of Control of Blood Glucose

When a patient stabilized on any diabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a loss of control may occur. At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue glipizide and administer insulin.

The effectiveness of any oral hypoglycemic drug, including glipizide, in lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients over a period of time, which may be due to progression of the severity of the diabetes or to diminished responsiveness to the drug. This phenomenon is known as secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is ineffective in an individual patient when first given. Adequate adjustment of dose and adherence to diet should be assessed before classifying a patient as a secondary failure.

Hemolytic Anemia

Treatment of patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to hemolytic anemia. Because GLUCOTROL XL belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered. In post marketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and risk of major adverse liver outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease and type 2 diabetes [^6a228e2f]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

In the intention-to-treat analysis, MALO occurred in 42 initiators and 1079 non-initiators. The events in non-initiators corresponded to 486 distinct events (since participation in multiple target trials was allowed, some contributed with events to more than one target trial). The 10-year risk of MALO was 13.3% (95% CI = 7.4% to 19.2%) in the initiators and 14.6% (95% CI = 13.1% to 16.1%) in the non-initiators (RD = −1.3, 95% CI = −7.2 to 4.6, RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.50 to 1.32) (table 3, figure 2A).

Table 3
Risk of major adverse liver outcomes according to intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses

In per-protocol analysis, we observed 22 events of MALO in the initiators and 1079 in the non-initiators. The 10-year MALO risk was 7.4% (95% CI = 2.1% to 12.6%) in the initiators and 14.4% (95% CI = 12.9% to 15.9%) in the non-initiators (RD = −7.1, 95% CI = −12.5 to –1.6; RR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.14 to 0.88) (table 3, figure 2B). This corresponds to a number needed to treat (initiate and continue with the GLP1 agonist treatment strategy) to avoid one event of MALO over the course of 10 years of 14 (95% CI = 8 to 63).

### Outcomes of various classes of oral antidiabetic drugs on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease… [^6f719d2c]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

eFigure 11. Cumulative incidence function of liver-related outcomes according to oral anti-diabetic drug classes in the subgroups: A) males and B) females aged ≥ 50. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were associated with greater rates of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease regression compared with other oral antidiabetic drug classes. Less adverse liver-related outcomes were also observed for the SGLT2 inhibitor class. DPP-4 indicates dipeptidyl peptidase-4. Findings In this nationwide cohort study involving 80 178 patients diagnosed with T2D and concurrent NAFLD in Korea, spanning 219 941 person-years, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a higher likelihood of NAFLD regression and lower incidence of adverse liver-related outcome parameters when compared with other OADs. Only SGLT2 inhibitors, not thiazolidinediones or DPP-4 inhibitors, were significantly associated with lower incidence rates of adverse liver-related outcomes when compared with sulfonylureas. Conclusions and Relevance. Across the study population, 276 patients presented with adverse liver-related outcomes: 12 for SGLT2 inhibitors, 8 for thiazolidinediones, 191 for DPP-4 inhibitors, and 65 for sulfonylureas. The number of events per 100 000 person-years was 52, 118, 122, and 157 for patients using an SGLT2 inhibitor, thiazolidinedione, DPP-4 inhibitor, or sulfonylurea, respectively. The information on censored patients is documented in eTable 3 in Supplement 1. Only SGLT2 inhibitors but neither thiazolidinediones nor DPP-4 inhibitors were significantly associated with a lower incidence of adverse liver-related outcomes when compared with sulfonylureas.

### Efficacy and safety of cotadutide, a dual glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon receptor agonist, in a randomized phase 2a study of patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^b5b8559f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Cotadutide (MEDI0382) is a balanced GLP‐1 and glucagon receptor dual agonist, with a ratio of approximately 5:1 GLP‐1 to glucagon activity. This balance of agonistic activity at each receptor is designed to leverage benefits of dual agonism on liver health and bodyweight loss, and to offset glucagon receptor‐driven increases in hepatic glucose production. Indeed, cotadutide showed robust glucose‐lowering and bodyweight loss effects in patients with type 2 diabetes. Cotadutide is under development for the treatment of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis and type 2 diabetes with CKD. Beneficial liver‐specific effects of cotadutide have been attributed to glucagon receptor signaling. Cotadutide has been shown to promote a reduction in liver glycogen after short‐term treatment, providing suggestive evidence of target engagement of the glucagon receptor in the liver. Larger improvements in lipid and liver parameters have been shown with cotadutide versus liraglutide. Both the liver and kidney have high levels of glucagon receptor expression, and glucagon acts directly and indirectly to influence GFR. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of cotadutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD, including those treated with insulin therapy.

### Real-world evidence for metformin use in solid organ transplant recipients living with diabetes [^4fd6a287]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Metformin is a widely used, safe, and effective antidiabetic agent; However, its use in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients has been limited. We aimed to evaluate the safety, cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic outcomes associated with metformin use in a large, real-world cohort of SOT recipients living with diabetes.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective matched-cohort study of adult SOT recipients (kidney, liver, lung, heart) with pre-existing type 2 diabetes using data from a large healthcare organization. Metformin users (≥ 2 prescriptions post-transplant) were 1:1 matched to non-users by age, sex, and organ type. Primary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), heart failure, all-cause mortality, and severe renal dysfunction (eGFR ≤ 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2). Secondary outcomes included metabolic changes and safety endpoints.

Results

We included 938 matched patients (66% kidney, 14% liver, 16% lung, 4% heart). Metformin use was associated with a lower risk of MACE (adjusted HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61–0.98, p = 0.031) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38–0.71, p < 0.001). In kidney recipients, metformin was associated with reduced risk of graft dysfunction (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73m 2, initiation of dialysis, kidney biopsy or rejection; HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45–0.77, p < 0.001). Glycemic and lipid parameters improved significantly in metformin users. No increased risk of lactic acidosis was observed.

Conclusion

In SOT recipients living with diabetes, metformin use was associated with improved survival, cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and favorable metabolic effects without compromising safety. These findings support the cautious use of metformin in selected transplant recipients. Prospective studies are warranted.

### The current role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus management [^544272f6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic, complex metabolic disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemia causing from insufficient insulin signaling because of insulin resistance or defective insulin secretion, and may induce severe complications and premature death. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are oral drugs used to reduce hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM, including empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, dapagliflozin and canagliflozin. The primary objective of this article is to examine the clinical benefit, safety, and tolerability of the four SGLT2 inhibitors approved by the US FDA. SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion via inhibiting SGLT2 to decrease renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and reduce the renal threshold for glucose. Rather than stimulating insulin release, SGLT2 inhibitors improve β-cell function by improving glucotoxicity, as well as reduce insulin resistance and increase insulin sensitivity. Early clinical trials have confirmed the beneficial effects of SGLT2 in T2DM with acceptable safety and excellent tolerability. In recent years, SGLT2 inhibitors has been successively approved by the FDA to decrease cardiovascular death and decrease the risk of stroke and cardiac attack in T2DM adults who have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, treating heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction, and treat diabetic kidney disease (DKD), decrease the risk of hospitalization for HF in T2DM and DKD patients. SGLT2 inhibitors are expected to be an effective treatment for T2DM patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease. SGLT2 inhibitors have a similar safety profile to placebo or other active control groups, with major adverse events such as Ketoacidosis or hypotension and genital or urinary tract infections.

### Troglitazone-induced liver failure: a case study [^6723f750]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Troglitazone was removed from the U.S. market because its use was associated with an increased risk of liver failure. We evaluated the clinical features of all cases reported to the Food and Drug Administration and estimated the duration and magnitude of the risk of liver failure associated with continued use of the drug.

Methods

Data from cases of liver failure associated with troglitazone use were abstracted and analyzed. The extent of troglitazone use was determined from national marketing data, and the duration of use was estimated with data from a large, multistate, health care company. Survival analysis was performed to estimate monthly incidence rates and the cumulative risk of liver failure.

Results

Ninety-four cases of liver failure (89 acute, 5 chronic) were reported. Of the acute cases, 58 (67%) were women and only 11 (13%) recovered without liver transplantation. Progression from normal hepatic functioning to irreversible liver injury occurred within 1 month in 19 patients who were indistinguishable clinically from the 70 patients who had an unknown time course to irreversibility, except for the post hoc observation that prior cholecystectomy was less common in those with rapid onset. The incidence of liver failure was elevated from the first through at least the 26th month of troglitazone use. Accounting for case underreporting, the number needed to harm from troglitazone use was between 600 to 1500 patients at 26 months.

Conclusion

The progression to irreversible liver injury probably occurred within a 1-month interval in most patients, casting doubt on the value of monthly monitoring of serum aminotransferase levels as a means of preventing troglitazone-induced acute liver failure. The cumulative risk of hepatic failure increased with continued use.

### Pharmacokinetics of dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors [^01f8c4ea]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a complex disease combining defects in insulin secretion and insulin action. New compounds have been developed for improving glucose-induced insulin secretion and glucose control, without inducing hypoglycaemia or weight gain. Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are new oral glucose-lowering agents, so-called incretin enhancers, which may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic compounds. Sitagliptin, vildaglipin and saxagliptin are already on the market in many countries, either as single agents or in fixed-dose combined formulations with metformin. Other DPP-4 inhibitors, such as alogliptin and linagliptin, are currently in late phase of development. The present paper summarizes and compares the main pharmacokinetics (PK) properties, that is, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination, of these five DPP-4 inhibitors. Available data were obtained in clinical trials performed in healthy young male subjects, patients with T2DM, and patients with either renal insufficiency or hepatic impairment. PK characteristics were generally similar in young healthy subjects and in middle-aged overweight patients with diabetes. All together gliptins have a good oral bioavailability which is not significantly influenced by food intake. PK/pharmacodynamics characteristics, that is, sufficiently prolonged half-life and sustained DPP-4 enzyme inactivation, generally allow one single oral administration per day for the management of T2DM; the only exception is vildagliptin for which a twice-daily administration is recommended because of a shorter half-life. DPP-4 inhibitors are in general not substrates for cytochrome P450 (except saxagliptin that is metabolized via CYP 3A4/A5) and do not act as inducers or inhibitors of this system. Several metabolites have been documented but most of them are inactive; however, the main metabolite of saxagliptin also exerts a significant DPP-4 inhibition and is half as potent as the parent compound. Renal excretion is the most important elimination pathway, except for linagliptin whose metabolism in the liver appears to be predominant. PK properties of gliptins, combined with their good safety profile, explain why no dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients or in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. As far as patients with renal impairment are concerned, significant increases in drug exposure for sitagliptin and saxagliptin have been reported so that appropriate reductions in daily dosages are recommended according to estimated glomerular filtration rate. The PK characteristics of DPP-4 inhibitors suggest that these compounds are not exposed to a high risk of drug-drug interactions. However, the daily dose of saxagliptin should be reduced when coadministered with potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors. In conclusion, besides their pharmacodynamic properties leading to effective glucose-lowering effect without inducing hypoglycaemia or weight gain, DPP-4 inhibitors show favourable PK properties, which contribute to a good efficacy/safety ratio for the management of T2DM in clinical practice.

### The role of vildagliptin in the therapy of type 2 diabetic patients with renal dysfunction [^f63efdb1]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Complications may arise when choosing a second antihyperglycemic agent in a patient with low GFR. The issues to be taken into account are: increased risk for hypoglycemia (due to decreased drug renal clearance, impaired renal gluconeogenesis, malnutrition, and comorbidities), increased risk for drug–drug interactions and adverse drug events (increased drug plasma concentration, advanced age, multiple drug therapies), contraindications related to comorbidities (high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, liver dysfunction, heart failure), and increased cardiovascular risk. On top of these challenging factors, many agents are not extensively studied in patients with CKD.

Among the major drug classes available, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and insulins carry an increased risk of hypoglycemia and their use requires more intensive home blood glucose monitoring to adjust their dosage. This not only increases costs of treatment but is also a major burden to patients' lives. Because these patients are often frail with multiple comorbidities, their quality of life drastically worsens.

Although pioglitazone may also be used without need of dose reduction in any stage of CKD, its use is limited by the risk of bone fractures (all patients with CKD are at increased risk of osteoporosis) and by the risk of fluid retention and heart failure.

It has been recently shown that sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, by reducing renal tubular glucose reabsorption, are able to decrease intraglomerular pressure and albuminuria and to slow GFR loss through mechanisms that appear independent of glycemia. Their efficacy, however, in lowering glucose levels is related to the filtration rate in the kidneys, so it has shown no efficacy in reducing HbA1c levels in patients with severe renal impairment, ESRD, and patients on dialysis, as well as some moderate renal impairment. For this reason, this drug class has to be prescribed with caution in patients with severe renal disease. Ongoing studies will soon clarify the role of this new class of antihyperglycemic agents in the treatment of patients with chronic renal disease.

### Effective utilization of oral hypoglycemic agents to achieve individualized HbA1c targets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1accef3e]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Thiazolidinedione

Pioglitazone is the only thiazolidinedione currently prescribable in Europe. It acts directly at the cellular level, increasing the sensitivity of the hepatic and muscle tissue to endogenous insulin, and is particularly efficacious in patients whose underlying pathophysiology is insulin resistance. As pioglitazone does not impact on insulin secretion, the hypoglycemia risk is low unless used in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin. Pioglitazone should be initiated at 15 mg, increasing to 30 mg after 3 months if there has not been a response. Increasing to 45 mg would only be indicated if there was a reduction in HbA1c with 30 mg but the target HbA1c was not reached. If no additional response is noted with 45 mg, the dose should be reduced back to 30 mg. If a 6 mmol/mol drop is not achieved after 6 months on 30 mg it should be stopped. Due to an increased risk of fluid retention, which could exacerbate or precipitate heart failure, pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with or a history of heart failure. Advice in relation to signs and symptoms of heart failure such as edema should be part of the patient consultation on initiating treatment, and treatment should be stopped if any symptoms develop. Liver function tests should be carried out prior to initiation and periodically thereafter due to a rare potential risk of liver toxicity. If the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level remains more than three times the upper limit of normal, pioglitazone should be discontinued. Suggestions have been made that pioglitazone potentially increases the risk of bone fractures and bladder cancer in a recent multi-population pooled cumulative-exposure analysis; however, it showed that there was no association with the cumulative use of pioglitazone and the associated incidence of bladder cancer. Recent studies in individuals without diabetes but with diagnosed insulin resistance and a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attacks treated with pioglitazone showed a significant reduction in the relative risk of nonfatal heart attack or fatal and nonfatal stroke, suggesting that addressing insulin resistance though treatment with pioglitazone could improve cardiovascular outcomes.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and risk of major adverse liver outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease and type 2 diabetes [^d617e3c0]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Results from the intention-to-treat subgroup analyses are summarised in table 4. In patients with MASLD, the 10-year risk of MALO was 15.8% in the initiators and 11.2% in the non-initiators (RR = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.53 to 2.30). The 10-year risk in patients with compensated cirrhosis was 36.5% and 34.6% in initiators and non-initiators, respectively (RR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.20 to 1.91).

Table 4
Risk of major adverse liver outcomes at 10 years according to intention-to-treat analyses in subgroups

The risk estimates from a sensitivity analysis that allowed patients to have a lower dose of metformin at baseline were similar to the main analyses (intention-to-treat RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.58 to 1.30; per-protocol RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.27 to 0.99) (online supplemental table 6). The per-protocol estimates were also similar when restricting the gap between two successive prescriptions to ≤ 30 days (RR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.11 to 0.85) (online supplemental table 7). In addition, similar per-protocol estimates were found when the non-initiators were censored if they initiated a GLP1 agonist during follow-up (RR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.92) (online supplemental table 8). Both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol estimates were similar to the main analyses when the weights were truncated (intention-to-treat RR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.48 to 1.20; per-protocol RR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.93) (online supplemental table 9). Moreover, results were similar to the main analysis when using standardisation to adjust for confounders at baseline (intention-to-treat RR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.53 to 1.22; per-protocol RR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.97) (online supplemental table 10). Point estimates were similar to the main analysis when including all non-initiators (n = 312 661) (intention-to-treat RR = 1.01, per-protocol RR = 0.53) (online supplemental table 11). The E-value for the RRs in the main per-protocol analysis was 3.33 for the point estimate and 1.53 for the 95% CI, suggesting how strong an unmeasured confounder needs to be to fully explain the estimated per-protocol effect and shift the 95% CI to include the null.

### Is insulin the preferred treatment in persons with type 2 diabetes and liver cirrhosis? [^407f41d6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Procedures

The day of concomitant diagnosis of liver cirrhosis and diabetes was defined as the comorbid date. Persons who underwent insulin therapy for at least 28 days after the comorbid date were defined as insulin users, and those who never took insulin during the whole study period were defined as insulin nonusers. We defined the first date of insulin use as the index date. Variables considered as potential confounders in this study included age, sex, age at the diagnosis of diabetes, the duration of diabetes, antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications, statins, and aspirin. Comorbidities status before the index date included HCV (ICD-9-CM codes 070.41, 070.44, 070.51, 070.54, 070.70, 070.71, and V02.62) and HBV infections (ICD-9-CM codes 070.2, 070.3, and V02.61). We also calculated the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI; a weighted index that consider the number and seriousness of comorbid heart, vascular, chronic pulmonary, connective tissue, mild and moderate liver, ulcer disease, diabetes and related complication, any original or metastatic disease, and AIDS) and Diabetes Complication Severity Index (DCSI; including cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, neuropathy, and metabolic diabetes complications) scores to assess the severity of diabetes.

Main outcomes

We investigated the outcomes of all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), HCC, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and hypoglycemia. Death was defined as being discharged from the hospital with a death certificate (discharge date was defined as the death date) or termination of NHI coverage after being discharged from hospital due to a critical illness and no further healthcare use for more than 1 year (the end of NHI coverage was defined as the death date). We calculated the incidence rate of MACE, including ischemic heart disease (410–414), stroke (430–437), and heart failure (428); HCC (155.x); decompensated cirrhosis (the composite of esophageal varices with bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and jaundice); variceal bleeding; ascites; hepatic encephalopathy; and hepatic failure (570, 572.2, 572.4, and 572.8), to evaluate liver-related complications. We also investigated the incidence of emergency department visited or admitted hypoglycemia (251.0x, 251.1x, or 251.2x) to evaluate the probable complications of treatments.

Eligibility criteria

All adult new users of GLP1RA and pioglitazone with T2D managed in HA between January 2008 (when GLP1RA first became available locally in HA) and December 2022 were identified. In addition to the prescription of oral anti-diabetic medication, T2D was also identified by using the International Statistical Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes of '250. × 0' and '250. × 2' or by physician diagnosis based on clinical history, biochemical findings, or immunological evidence. The baseline date was defined as that of the first GLP1RA or pioglitazone prescription. Patients were excluded if they had: (i) co-initiation of GLP1RA and pioglitazone. (ii) prescription of other drugs within the class of thiazolidinedione within 12 months before baseline; (iii) end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2, or history of kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation) on or before baseline; (iv) contraindications of GLP1RA or pioglitazone, including pancreatitis and heart failure (HF), respectively, on or before baseline; (v) cirrhosis, HCC, liver failure or liver transplantation on or before baseline.

Treatment strategies

Two treatment strategies were compared: i) initiation of GLP1RA which was continued during follow-up; and ii) initiation of pioglitazone which was continued during follow-up. Continuous drug exposure was defined as consecutive drug prescriptions without a prescription gap of more than 60 days, a commonly used definition in diabetes research as recommended by the checklist for medication compliance and persistence studies.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^e68be64d]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Older adults with type 2 diabetes — metformin use, renal thresholds, monitoring, and tolerability are outlined: Metformin may be used safely in some people with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, and lower doses may be used in those with an eGFR 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m2, with eGFR monitored every 3 to 6 months in those at risk for decline in kidney function; it is contraindicated in advanced renal insufficiency and should be used with caution in hypoperfusion, hypoxemia, impaired hepatic function, or heart failure due to lactic acidosis risk; metformin may be temporarily discontinued before iodinated-contrast procedures, during hospitalizations, and when acute illness may compromise renal or liver function; the daily dose should be slowly increased to minimize gastrointestinal side effects, reduction or elimination may be needed for persistent gastrointestinal side effects, and monitoring for vitamin B12 deficiency should be considered for long-term use; an extended-release formulation may be used as an alternative to immediate-release in older adults with difficulties maintaining medication plans or with gastrointestinal effects.

### Diabetes medications and risk of HCC [^2b919052]. Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The bidirectional relationship between diabetes and chronic liver diseases is well established. Indeed, advanced liver disease may favor the onset of T2DM, while T2DM is a recognized risk factor for cirrhosis and its complications, including HCC. Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown that diabetic medications may influence the risk of HCC development, as summarized in Table 1. Most available clinical data have evaluated the effects of metformin, TZD, sulfonylureas and insulin, whereas data on the more novel glucose‐lowering agents (i.e. DDP‐4 inhibitors, SGLT‐2‐inhibitors, and GLP1‐RAs) are preliminary and lack large clinical studies. Notably, to date there are still no large multicenter randomized clinical trials for any class of diabetic medications. Metformin is the first‐line treatment option for T2DM. Considering that metformin has consistently been reported to reduce the risk of HCC in diabetic patients while also potentially improving the prognosis of patients with an established HCC diagnosis at early stages, this drug can be considered the first‐line option for patients with advanced liver disease. Moreover, the available evidence suggests that metformin can be safely administered in well‐selected patients with T2DM and cirrhosis, with limited risk of lactic acidosis. However, due to the reported cases of this complication, and to the frequent incidence of renal impairment in patients with chronic liver disease, it seems reasonable to implement caution while prescribing metformin in patients with decompensated liver disease, particularly considering the recent addition of numerous effective therapeutic options to the anti‐diabetes arsenal. Additionally, given the potential for metformin to induce resistance to sorafenib and portend a worse survival in patients co‐treated with these medications, caution again must be implemented when considering use in patients with advanced HCC under consideration of sorafenib treatment. Evidence regarding the effects of metformin when used in combination with other systemic therapies, including other tyrosine‐kinase inhibitors or ICIs, is still needed. Although data obtained in other oncological settings do not appear to support a positive effect of concomitant metformin and ICI treatment, there is still no solid evidence in patients with HCC.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: a network meta-analysis [^f824619b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), encompasses a spectrum of liver disorders marked by excessive fat accumulation in hepatocytes, in the absence of significant alcohol consumption.MASLD is strongly linked to metabolic dysfunctions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance, which collectively drive its development and progression. The disease ranges from simple steatosis to more severe stages, including steatohepatitis, fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis, which can significantly impair liver function and overall health. The global prevalence of MASLD is rising steadily, mirroring the increasing rates of metabolic disorders. It is estimated that approximately 25% of the global population is affected by MASLD, with the prevalence even higher among individuals with obesity or diabetes. This growing burden underscores the urgent need for targeted therapeutic interventions. MASLD is not only a leading cause of chronic liver disease but also a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which remains the primary cause of mortality in these patients. Addressing liver steatosis and fibrosis is essential for halting disease progression and preventing life‐threatening complications such as cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, effective management can help mitigate extra‐hepatic complications, including cardiovascular morbidity.

### Use of metformin for cardiometabolic risks in psychiatric practice: need-to-know safety issues [^7ae011c7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin, a biguanide drug, is emerging as an important treatment option for the prevention or treatment of weight gain, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome in psychiatric patients, especially those who require or receive antipsychotic drugs. Metformin treatment is commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects; the risk of these is reduced by gradual dose uptitration, administration of the drug with meals, and use of a time-release formulation. Lactic acidosis, a potentially fatal complication of biguanide therapy, is very rare with metformin; the risk can be reduced by avoidance of its prescription in patients with impaired renal function, impaired liver function, cardiac failure, and certain other conditions. Long-term metformin use is associated with decreased vitamin B₁₂ levels, and even with biochemical B₁₂ deficiency; this complication can detected early by annual assessments of serum B₁₂ levels and prevented by annual intramuscular B₁₂ administration.

### Pathophysiologic approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^0b5754d6]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In combination with metformin (inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis), pioglitazone (improves insulin sensitivity in liver/muscle and preserves β-cell function) offers an effective, durable, and additive therapy that retards progressive β-cell failure with little risk of hypoglycemia. In a 6-month trial comparing fixed-dose combination with pioglitazone (30 mg)/metformin (1,700 mg) in 600 drug-naïve T2DM patients, HbA 1c declined by 1.8% (from baseline HbA 1c 8.6%) and was significantly greater than the 1.0% reduction observed with metformin alone or pioglitazone alone. Similar results were reported by Rosenstock et al. using initial combination therapy with rosiglitazone (8 mg)/metformin (2,000 mg).

Combining pioglitazone with GLP-1 analog curbs weight gain associated with the TZD. Further, the natriuretic effect of GLP-1 analogs mitigates against fluid retention observed with TZDs. Therefore, we advocate combined GLP-1 analog/pioglitazone therapy with or without metformin in newly diagnosed T2DM patients.

Intensive therapy with insulin plus metformin: reversal of metabolic decompensation.

Newly diagnosed T2DM patients who present in poor metabolic control are markedly resistant to insulin and have severely impaired β-cell function. Glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and multiple metabolic abnormalities play an important role in the insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. Institution of intensive insulin therapy with or without other antidiabetes agents to correct these many metabolic abnormalities, therefore, represents a rational approach to therapy based upon pathophysiology. After a period of sustained metabolic control, the insulin therapy can be continued or the patient can be switched to a noninsulin therapeutic regimen. This approach has recently been examined by Harrison et al. Fifty-eight newly diagnosed T2DM patients in poor metabolic control (HbA 1c 10.8%) initially were treated for 3 months with metformin plus insulin to reduce the HbA 1c to 5.9%. Subjects then were randomized to continued therapy with insulin-metformin combination therapy with pioglitazone/metformin/glyburide. During 3 years of follow-up, both groups maintained the reduction in HbA 1c, but the insulin dose had to be increased, indicating that, despite excellent glycemic control, β-cell failure continued in this group. Further, glycemic control in both groups was achieved at the expense of a relatively high rate of hypoglycemia and weight gain in the insulin/metformin group, consistent with multiple studies demonstrating a high incidence of hypoglycemia in sulfonylurea-treated and insulin-treated subjects.

### Flavonoids, alkaloids and terpenoids: a new hope for the treatment of diabetes mellitus [^5a2ba405]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic syndrome characterized by a hyperglycemic state and multi-organ failure. Millions of people worldwide are suffering from this deadly disease taking a hit on their pocket and mental health in the name of its treatment. Modern medical practices with new technological advancements and discoveries have made revolutionary changes in the treatment. But, unfortunately, Glucose-lowering drugs used have many accompanying effects such as chronic vascular disease, renal malfunction, liver disease and, many skin problems. These complications have made us think about alternative treatments for diabetes with minimum or no side effects. Nowadays, in addition to modern medicine, herbal treatment has been suggested to treat diabetes mellitus. These herbal medicines contain biological macromolecules such as flavonoids, Terpenoids, glycosides, and alkaloids, which show versatile anti-diabetic effects. These phytochemicals are generally considered safe, and naturally occurring compounds have a potential role in preventing or controlling diabetes mellitus. The underlying mechanism of their anti-diabetic effects includes improvement in insulin secretion, decrease in insulin resistance, enhanced liver glycogen synthesis, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In this review, we have focused on the mechanism of various phytochemicals targeting hyperglycemia and its underlying pathogenesis.

### Risk of hepatic events associated with use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors versus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and thiazolidinediones among patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^d5dcfb24]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become a significant global health concern, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes, where its prevalence is more than 60%. Given the asymptomatic nature of MASLD and its potential for adverse hepatic and extrahepatic outcomes, comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to its management is crucial. The efficacy of glucose-lowering drugs, such as metformin, is observed to be limited in addressing the challenges posed by MASLD. However, several randomised controlled trials (RCT) have explored the potential benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) or thiazolidinediones (TZD), which are commonly used in the management of type 2 diabetes, in ameliorating hepatic steatosis among patients with MASLD. Although these agents have shown positive effects in the treatment of MASLD and are recommended by guidelines, there is inconclusive evidence in hepatic outcomes among patients with MASLD.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) restrain glucose reabsorption at the proximal tubule of the kidney and have demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits beyond lowering glycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Data from several RCTs have shown that SGLT-2i may have promising effects on fibrosis or steatosis, based on biological mechanisms of glucagon signalling pathways or insulin use reduction. However, these trials had short follow-up or a small number of patients to generate clinically meaningful evidence on this issue. One observational study, which included patients with type 2 diabetes and liver cirrhosis, found an 11% reduced risk of hepatic decompensation events (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.26) among new users of SGLT-2i compared with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i). Moreover, our previous cohort study found that use of SGLT-2i versus DPP-4i was significantly associated with a lower risk of major hepatic events, a composite endpoint of liver-cause death, liver transplant and hepatic decompensation events (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.72). A recent study that reported the hepatic effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in patients with MASLD did not include GLP-1RA, a class that is highly likely to be effective. Taken together, the hepatic benefits of SGLT-2i among patients with MASLD are inconclusive, warranting further investigations.

### Key takeaways from the updated multidisciplinary European MASLD guidelines [^22c11302]. Egastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological therapy

The high frequency of comorbid conditions in the spectrum of cardiometabolic risk factors often necessitates pharmacological interventions, for example, to treat diabetes and dyslipidaemia. Accumulating evidence suggests that adjustments of such pharmacological therapy can have positive effects on the progression of MASLD and consequently are an essential component in disease management. Depending on the stage of the disease and the presence of coexisting cardiometabolic disease conditions, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonists and co-agonists, sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), metformin and statins should be prioritised for their respective indications. These drug classes are associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and can positively influence the disease activity of MASH and potentially reduce the risk of developing HCC.

Incretin mimetics are used for pharmacological weight reduction and for the treatment of T2D. Depending on the specific compound, they lead to a weight reduction of approximately 10–20% (over 1 year), are typically injected subcutaneously once a week and mainly have gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation). They are the only drug class already approved (for obesity and T2D) outside of the USA with existing positive histological endpoint data on MASH. The two GLP1 receptor agonists liraglutide and semaglutide showed positive effects on the resolution of MASH in phase II studies, and phase III data on MASH resolution and improvement in the degree of fibrosis compared with placebo after 72 weeks of treatment are available for semaglutide. Positive data on MASH resolution and fibrosis reduction from phase II studies are also available for the GLP1 receptor co-agonists tirzepatide and survodutide.

No histological outcome data are currently available for the use of SGLT2i, metformin or statins in people with MASLD. Still, positive effects on transaminases, liver fat and risk of hepatic decompensation or HCC argue for their use for their respective indications in MASLD: SGLT2i are used to treat T2D, heart failure and chronic kidney disease and some SGLT2i are effective in reducing liver fat and serum transaminases (eg, empagliflozin); the use of metformin for the treatment of T2D is associated with higher transplant-free survival, fewer hepatic decompensations and a lower risk of HCC in patients with advanced, compensated MASH; the use of statins for lipid lowering in compensated liver cirrhosis is associated with a lower rate of HCC; and statin use is also associated with a lower risk of developing MASLD, MASH and liver fibrosis in population-based studies.

### Glycemic control and hypoglycemia: is the loser the winner? [^e0512616]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Interacting effects of multiple treatment methods

Additionally, several medications have been shown to increase the risk of hypoglycemia. A selective review of the literature indicates that levothyroxine was associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia in Japanese patients with liver impairment. ACE inhibitors may increase the risk of hypoglycemia in diabetic individuals compared with other antihypertensive drugs, possibly by increasing insulin sensitivity. Short-acting insulin analogues (lispro, aspart, and glulisine) have better postprandial glycemic control without intensifying the risk of hypoglycemia compared with human insulin. Finally, the insulin pump appears to improve glycemic control, reduce episodes of hypoglycemia, and increase quality of life more effectively than multiple-daily-injection therapy.

Oral antihyperglycemic agents, especially sulfonylureas, increase the risk of hypoglycemia. However, third-generation sulfonylureas have decreased the risk of hypoglycemia to 0.8 episodes/1,000 patient-years down from the 5.6 episodes/1,000 patient-years rate associated with second-generation sulfonylureas. Combination therapy with sulfonylureas and insulin remains risky.

High-risk nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH) management emphasizes cardiometabolic care and specific medication guidance. In high-risk patients, we recommend following standards of care for managing diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, and when possible, preference should be given to diabetes medications with known efficacy in NASH (ie, GLP-1RAs and pioglitazone). Of note, pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and among SGLT2 inhibitors randomized controlled trials have reported a placebo-subtracted reduction in steatosis of approximately 20% with unknown effects on liver histology. Statins can be prescribed to patients with F2–F3 and Child A or B cirrhosis, and a meta-analysis including 13 studies and 121,058 patients showed a 46% reduction in hepatic decompensation (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46–0.62) and 46% lower mortality (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.47–0.61). However, statins do not appear to extend survival in Child class C cirrhosis and, because data in decompensated cirrhosis remain limited, use in these patients should be avoided. There is no safe threshold for alcohol intake in patients with advanced fibrosis.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by a gradual loss of β‐cell function that necessitates continued advancement of therapy to maintain glycaemic control 1. Along with lifestyle modifications, at diagnosis, patients with T2D are often initiated on metformin therapy as per current treatment guidelines 2; however, many patients experience significant gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) with metformin, and up to 10% of patients are ultimately unable to tolerate it 3. Relative contraindications to metformin therapy, such as chronic kidney disease, symptomatic heart failure or liver disease, are very common in ambulatory patients 4, 5, 6, 7. For these patients, treatment with a sulphonylurea (SU) may be considered first‐line therapy. If the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) target is not achieved with an SU, recent treatment guidelines suggest adding a thiazolidinedione, a dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitor, a sodium glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitor, a glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist or basal insulin, as a patient‐centred approach, individualized to concurrent medical history and patient preference 3. In general, combination therapy with drugs that use complementary mechanisms of action provide additive benefit, but occasionally they may unveil compensatory mechanisms that limit the effects of each individual drug 8. With increasing options for therapy, it is important to evaluate individual drug combinations in order to appropriately target therapies to individuals.

Dulaglutide, a once‐weekly GLP‐1 receptor agonist approved for the treatment of T2D, is a fusion protein that combines two identical human GLP‐1 receptor analogues, modified to resist DPP‐4 inactivation, with soluble human IgG4 Fc 9. The larger size of the molecule slows injection site absorption and minimizes renal clearance 9. Dulaglutide has a half‐life of ∼5 days and therefore is suitable for once‐weekly injection 10.

The Assessment of Weekly Administration of LY2189265 (Dulaglutide) in Diabetes‐8 (AWARD‐8) study was conducted to understand the safety and efficacy profile of dulaglutide in combination with an SU.

Liver disease is highly prevalent among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We evaluated the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin in subjects with T2DM and hepatic disorders.

Methods

Data were pooled from 17 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of linagliptin in T2DM subjects that included individuals with self-reported history of hepatic disorders at baseline. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24.

Results

Of the 7009 participants (56% white, 39% Asian), 574 had hepatic disorders, most commonly hepatic steatosis (60%). At week 24, adjusted mean ± standard error (SE) change in HbA1c from baseline in those with hepatic disorders was -0.75% ± 0.05 with linagliptin and -0.20% ± 0.08 with placebo [treatment difference: -0.54% (95% confidence interval-0.72 to -0.36); P < .0001]. There was no significant difference in HbA1c reduction between subjects with or without baseline hepatic disorders (P = 0.4042). Among subjects with hepatic disorders, 13.5% and 14.8% of the linagliptin and placebo groups, respectively, reported drug-related adverse events while 10.4% and 15.9%, respectively, reported hypoglycemia. Overall, adverse event rates were similar in individuals with or without hepatic disorders.

Conclusions

This large pooled analysis suggests that linagliptin is effective and well tolerated in people with T2DM and liver disease.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^5e89bae0]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus pharmacotherapy — TZD drug class lists key precautions, adverse effects, and dosing notes: contraindications or precautions include HF or evidence of fluid overload, history or high risk of fracture, active liver disease (liver transaminases > 2.5 times above the upper reference limit) unless NASH is known to be the underlying cause of the elevation, active or history of bladder cancer, pregnancy, and macular edema; adverse effects include weight gain, fluid retention, HF, macular edema, bone fractures, and might increase risk of bladder cancer (pioglitazone); dosing and administration note taken orally without regard to meals, full glycemic effect takes several weeks, and HF risk is increased with concurrent insulin.

### Durability of glycaemic control with dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, compared with saxagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor, in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes [^94dcbc6d]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

2.2 Long term: indirect statistical comparison of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin

Patients receiving either dapagliflozin (10 mg/day) or saxagliptin (5 mg/day) or corresponding placebo plus a stable dose of metformin (≥ 1500 mg/day) for more than 8 weeks, with HbA1c between 7% and 10%, inclusive (53–86 mmol/mol), C‐peptide greater than 1.0 ng/mL, body mass index of 45 kg/m 2 or less for dapagliflozin or 40 kg/m 2 or less for saxagliptin, and serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL or less in men and 1.4 mg/dL or less in women were assessed. Metformin up‐titration was not permitted in either study. Patients with a lack of glycaemic control from Week 4 to Week 102 were eligible to receive open‐label rescue medication. Rescue criteria were similar in both studies (Table S1). Data concerning patients who received rescue medication prior to Week 20 and those who received it after Week 20 were excluded from CoF analysis. Data proximal to initiation of treatment, prior to Week 20, were also excluded to allow time for glycation of haemoglobin under treatment. There were at least three ΔHbA1c observed values at three different visits available for the patients included in the CoF analysis for the long‐term study of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin (Weeks 20–102). Patients were excluded if they had symptoms of poorly controlled diabetes or a history of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma; if they had used any other antihyperglycaemic medication 8 weeks prior to the study or insulin 1 year prior to the study; if they experienced a cardiovascular event within 6 months of study entry or NYHA stage III/IV congestive heart failure and/or had a known left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less; if they underwent chronic or repeated intermittent corticosteroid treatment or treatment with potent systemic cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors or inducers; if they had active liver disease and/or clinically significant abnormalities on screening tests of hepatic, renal, endocrine, metabolic or haematologic function; or if they had received assessment of an immunocompromised state. The endpoints assessed were: (a) time to study discontinuation (TTSD) because of lack of glycaemic control or rescue medication usage because of failure to achieve the glycaemic target up to 102 weeks, and (b) durability of glycaemic control between Weeks 20 and 102, with assessed differences in the placebo‐adjusted dapagliflozin and placebo‐adjusted saxagliptin slopes obtained from random coefficient models of ΔHbA1c over Weeks 20 to 102, excluding data following rescue medication usage. Exploratory endpoints included changes in FPG, SBP, and body weight in the 20‐ to 102‐week CoF population.
