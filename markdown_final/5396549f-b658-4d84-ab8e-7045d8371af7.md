## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), specifically seeking a stepwise expert narrative with explicit self-verification and citations throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology and how it shapes the clinical phenotype. Then, I should verify the diagnostic framework, including clinical suspicion, laboratory criteria, and ADAMTS13 testing. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and how to distinguish TTP from other thrombotic microangiopathies. After that, I need to examine immediate management priorities, including plasma exchange, corticosteroids, rituximab, and caplacizumab. I will then consider special populations and scenarios, followed by monitoring and response criteria. Finally, I should address long-term follow-up, prevention of relapse, and emerging therapies, while double-checking areas of controversy and uncertainty.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic foundation, because everything else flows from it. TTP is classically due to severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, typically less than 10% of normal activity, which allows ultra-large von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers to persist and drive platelet-rich microthrombi in the microcirculation, producing microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), thrombocytopenia, and organ ischemia, particularly neurologic and cardiac involvement [^11473bnD] [^115VBC4F] [^1123wBQV].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical phenotype before I anchor on ADAMTS13. The classic pentad of fever, MAHA, thrombocytopenia, neurologic deficits, and renal dysfunction is historically described but incomplete and not required for diagnosis; many patients present with thrombocytopenia and MAHA alone, and neurologic or cardiac features signal severity rather than being universal, so I should not over-rely on the pentad when suspecting TTP [^11473bnD] [^112tdtbh].

> I need to check the diagnostic framework next. Diagnosis remains primarily clinical, anchored by thrombocytopenia and MAHA with schistocytes on smear, while excluding alternative causes. ADAMTS13 activity less than 10% strongly supports TTP in the right clinical context, but many centers lack rapid assays, so early management must proceed on clinical grounds with ADAMTS13 sent urgently when available [^115zsjG4] [^11473bnD] [^116adeDq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ADAMTS13 testing strategy. I initially thought we should always wait for ADAMTS13 before starting plasma exchange, but that would be unsafe in high-suspicion cases. ISTH recommends initiating plasma exchange without waiting for ADAMTS13 when suspicion is high, while in settings with timely access to ADAMTS13, obtaining activity and anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies before exchange can be considered, and pretest probability tools like PLASMIC or the French score can help triage urgency and likelihood of severe deficiency [^113TAd2M] [^112w5ida] [^116adeDq].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis carefully, because misclassification changes therapy. STEC-HUS typically follows diarrheal illness and is complement-driven, aHUS reflects complement dysregulation with normal ADAMTS13, DIC shows coagulation abnormalities, and drug-induced TMAs (e.g., quinine, calcineurin inhibitors, gemcitabine) require a careful exposure history. Distinguishing these entities matters because TTP responds to plasma exchange and immunomodulation, whereas aHUS requires complement blockade and TPE is not routinely indicated for STEC-HUS [^notfound].

> I should double-check the immediate management priorities, because time-to-treatment drives survival. Plasma exchange (PEX) is the cornerstone and should be initiated within 4–8 hours of suspected diagnosis whenever possible, ideally daily until platelet count normalizes for at least 48–72 hours; delays beyond 24 hours are associated with increased mortality and complications, so I need to ensure rapid transfer to a center with apheresis capability if necessary [^1121AvPj] [^115W3VYh] [^116JMXAd].

> Next, I should review adjunctive immunosuppression. Corticosteroids should be started promptly in immune-mediated TTP, typically prednisone 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent, without waiting for ADAMTS13 confirmation when suspicion is high. Rituximab is recommended during the acute episode, often around day 3–5 of PEX, to reduce relapse risk. And caplacizumab, an anti-VWF nanobody, should be initiated early in acute iTTP and continued for about 30 days after PEX completion, with consideration of extension if ADAMTS13 remains severely low [^1128psvE] [^114TCXSb] [^114jMCbH] [^115W3VYh].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the patient is refractory. I need to ensure I escalate appropriately: increase PEX frequency to twice daily, consider bortezomib for autoantibody-mediated disease, and reserve salvage options such as cyclophosphamide, vincristine, or splenectomy for refractory cases. Importantly, platelet transfusion is generally contraindicated unless there is life-threatening bleeding or invasive procedures, given the risk of exacerbating microthrombosis [^113s7qG2].

> Let me think about special populations and scenarios. In pregnancy, treat suspected iTTP with PEX and corticosteroids, and consider rituximab and caplacizumab when indicated. For cTTP, prophylactic plasma infusion is recommended during pregnancy, and recombinant ADAMTS13 is now available and preferred over plasma infusion for prophylaxis in remission. In pediatrics, neonatal jaundice with thrombocytopenia should prompt evaluation for cTTP, and siblings of confirmed cTTP cases should undergo ADAMTS13 and genetic screening [^1173f4sQ] [^11437cYT] [^117JYDM6] [^114Cf5W8] [^117S5T8e].

> I should confirm monitoring and response criteria to guide de-escalation. Clinical response is typically defined by rising platelet count toward normalization for at least 48–72 hours with improving LDH and hemolysis markers. ADAMTS13 recovery to above 20% supports withdrawal of PEX, and caplacizumab can be stopped once sustained ADAMTS13 recovery is achieved. I need to ensure I do not stop too early before biochemical remission is secured [^114jMCbH] [^115W3VYh].

> Hold on, I should verify long-term follow-up and relapse prevention. Lifelong surveillance with periodic ADAMTS13 monitoring, typically every 3 months initially, allows preemptive rituximab when activity falls below about 10–20% to prevent relapse; patients remain at elevated cardiovascular risk, so I should address modifiable risk factors and screen for neuropsychiatric sequelae, which are common even after hematologic remission [^112E4Jne] [^115VBC4F] [^115W3VYh].

> Let me reconsider emerging therapies and controversies so I don't overstate current standards. Recombinant ADAMTS13 is now available and guideline-supported for cTTP prophylaxis, and its role in acute iTTP is under active study; there is an evolving discussion about a "third form" of TTP (uTTP) characterized by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency without detectable antibodies in inflammatory contexts, which may represent non-immune consumption or proteolytic degradation — this affects classification and trial eligibility, so I should be cautious in labeling such cases definitively [^117JYDM6] [^1157CuU7] [^115oPteW].

> In summary, I need to ensure my approach remains time-critical and mechanism-informed: suspect TTP with thrombocytopenia and MAHA, exclude mimics, initiate PEX within hours, add corticosteroids and rituximab in iTTP, start caplacizumab early, tailor management for pregnancy and pediatrics, and commit to long-term ADAMTS13-guided surveillance to prevent relapse. Delays in PEX worsen outcomes, so I should prioritize rapid transfer and standardized pathways to minimize time-to-treatment [^1121AvPj] [^115W3VYh] [^116JMXAd].

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a **life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy** caused by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, most often due to autoantibodies [^113s53AA], leading to platelet-rich microthrombi and organ ischemia [^115VBC4F]. It presents with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurologic deficits, and renal dysfunction; without treatment, mortality exceeds 90% [^116CGTkW]. Immediate therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) [^113TAd2M] with corticosteroids is essential [^1128psvE]; rituximab and caplacizumab are added in immune-mediated TTP to reduce relapse and mortality [^114TCXSb] [^114jMCbH]. Early diagnosis and rapid TPE within 4–8 hours [^1121AvPj] are critical to outcomes [^116JMXAd]; ADAMTS13 activity < 10% confirms the diagnosis [^117NgZt3] and guides therapy [^1154mCCY].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **ADAMTS13 deficiency**: Severe deficiency (< 10% activity) [^113nC6kB] allows ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers to drive platelet aggregation and microthrombi [^112Npjsn].

- **Immune-mediated TTP**: Autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 cause acquired deficiency [^113s53AA]; congenital TTP results from ADAMTS13 gene mutations [^111rSfmS].

- **Microthrombi**: Platelet-rich clots cause microvascular occlusion, ischemia, and organ dysfunction [^113s53AA].

---

## Clinical presentation

Classically described by a pentad, TTP presents with **thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), neurologic deficits, renal dysfunction, and fever** [^1112K5FS]; however, the full pentad is present in only a minority of cases [^111vqFkC]. Common features include:

| **Clinical feature** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Thrombocytopenia | 100% |
| MAHA (schistocytes, elevated LDH) | 100% |
| Neurologic symptoms (confusion, seizures, focal deficits) | 60–90% |
| Renal dysfunction (proteinuria, hematuria, elevated creatinine) | 50–80% |
| Fever | 20–50% |

---

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Platelet count < 150,000/µL [^111vhhHQ].

- **MAHA**: Schistocytes on peripheral smear, elevated LDH, decreased haptoglobin, increased indirect bilirubin [^notfound].

- **ADAMTS13 activity**: < 10% confirms TTP; inhibitors/anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies support immune-mediated TTP [^1146x1q2] [^11473bnD].

- **Differentiation**: Distinguish from HUS, DIC, and other TMAs using clinical context and ADAMTS13 [^112gNMRE] [^116XFCCU].

---

## Treatment

### First-line therapy

First-line therapy is **therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE)** — daily until platelet count normalizes for 2–3 days — plus **corticosteroids** (prednisone or methylprednisolone) to suppress autoimmunity [^113TAd2M] [^1128psvE].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

- **Rituximab**: Reduces relapse; use in first episodes and relapses [^114TCXSb].

- **Caplacizumab**: Anti-VWF nanobody; rapidly reduces thrombosis and improves outcomes [^1123wBQV].

- **Refractory cases**: Consider bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, or splenectomy [^113s7qG2].

---

### Special populations

In pregnancy, treat as immune-mediated TTP with **TPE and corticosteroids** [^1173f4sQ]; consider rituximab and caplacizumab if needed. For congenital TTP, use **plasma infusion** for acute episodes and prophylaxis; recombinant ADAMTS13 is an emerging option [^1146bqzN].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Mortality has fallen from > 90% to ~10–20% with modern therapy, though early mortality remains significant [^116CGTkW] [^111QpSPh]. Relapse occurs in **30–50%**, particularly with persistent ADAMTS13 deficiency; long-term risks include cognitive impairment, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease [^113nC6kB] [^115VBC4F].

---

## Current research and emerging therapies

Recombinant ADAMTS13 is in trials for congenital and immune TTP and may enable **enzyme replacement** [^117JYDM6]. Novel immunotherapies targeting B cells and complement are under investigation, and improved ADAMTS13 assays aim to enable faster, more accurate diagnosis [^116adeDq].

---

TTP is a **medical emergency** defined by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and microvascular thrombosis; **rapid TPE plus immunosuppression** is lifesaving, and emerging targeted therapies are reshaping care [^1123wBQV].

Proposal for a prospective study to establish the existence and search for pathomechanisms of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura of unidentified pathophysiology

If the underlying pathophysiology in uTTP cases were indeed to involve a non-immune mechanism, one may imagine several possibilities resulting in severely deficient ADAMTS13 activity. As suggested by Simon et al. non-immune destruction or consumption of ADAMTS13, deficient synthesis in liver failure, proteolytic degradation or catalytic inhibition of ADAMTS13, e.g. by interleukin-6, may be considered. I fully agree with Knöbl that carefully planned prospective studies will be needed and Table 1 in his Commentlists many important items to be applied: prospective patient enrollment at hospital admission is mandatory. A strict protocol must be in place for clinical monitoring, blood sampling, laboratory analyses and biomaterial sample storage for future investigations, e.g. citrated plasma, EDTA plasma, serum and samples for DNA- and/or RNA-based analyses. A professional biobank set-up, as reported for a prospective cohort study on elderly patients with venous thrombosis, should be established. Necessarily, this needs to be a multicenter study with dedicated TTP specialist centers and all included patients should be followed-up, optimally for several years. This will allow to determine whether, similarly to the cohort reported by Simon et al.some 20% of patients will later receive a revised diagnosis of iTTP when autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 become positive and/or clinical relapses occur.

Such a proposed study needs broad academic input from many centers and needs to be funded. The International Working Group on TTP, may be optimally positioned to set up a Steering Committee preparing a study protocol and I would hope that, besides academically acquired funding, industry will substantially support such an investigation.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a moving target [^114UEcnc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

Almost 80 years after Eli Moschcowitz published the first description of the disease, most patients with idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) were found to have acquired autoantibody inhibitors of the ADAMTS13 metalloprotease. Plasma ADAMTS13 normally cleaves von Willebrand factor within nascent platelet-rich thrombi, and ADAMTS13 deficiency allows unchecked thrombus growth to cause microangiopathic hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and tissue infarction. At present, ADAMTS13 deficiency with a high-titer inhibitor level appears to be associated with an increased risk of early death and subsequent relapse. Thus, acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency identifies a specific mechanism of TTP and is a potential biomarker of disease activity or risk. At present, two major clinical questions in the field may be summarized as follows. First, by emphasizing TTP caused by ADAMTS13 deficiency, are we in danger of neglecting other causes that should be treated with plasma exchange? Second, should we treat asymptomatic patients who have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency to prevent future disease, and if so, how?

### Recognizing and managing hereditary and acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in infants and children [^115BAx8z]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

We describe how infants and children with hereditary and acquired autoimmune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) initially present and how they can be promptly diagnosed and effectively managed. These are uncommon disorders that are commonly misdiagnosed and can be rapidly fatal. TTP is caused by a severe deficiency of the plasma protease, A disintegrin and Metalloprotease with a ThromboSpondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13). Measurement of ADAMTS13 activity is becoming easily accessible. A common presentation of hereditary TTP is neonatal severe hemolysis and hyperbilirubinemia. However, the median age of diagnosis is not until 5.5 years. Plasma is effective treatment for exacerbations and for prophylaxis. Plasma may be replaced by recombinant ADAMTS13 when it becomes available. Acquired TTP is more frequent in older children, in whom it is more common in girls and is commonly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. For acquired TTP, plasma exchange and immunosuppression are the current treatment for acute episodes; caplacizumab is now commonly used in adults and may replace plasma exchange.

### Is there a shared pathophysiology for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic-uremic syndrome? [^116KoikB]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy is characterized by microvascular thrombosis coupled with thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and red blood cell fragmentation. Familiar to nephrologists and hematologists alike, classically associated with thrombotic microangiopathy are the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), the histories and presentations of which are closely intertwined. Not surprising, these two disorders are considered by many to be manifestations of the same disease process, whereas others consider HUS and TTP to be distinct clinical and pathologic entities. Herein are reviewed HUS and TTP along with recent progress shedding new light on possible shared pathophysiologic mechanisms for these two intriguing disorders.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is quite rare in infancy and must be treated intensively as a life-threatening disease. Diffuse vascular thromboses may occur, and neurologic involvement is a cornerstone of the diagnosis of TTP. We describe a case of an infant who presented with a sudden cerebral hemorrhage and subsequently developed the typical clinical features of TTP. Emergency treatment in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) consisted of plasma therapy and exchange-transfusion (EXT) to arrest the intravascular process and the exsanguinating blood loss. Exchange-transfusion is a life-saving procedure that is rarely performed after the neonatal age.

### TTP and ADAMTS13: when is testing appropriate? [^114KctnU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

The last 10 years witnessed the publication of many studies on the pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a life-threatening disease characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and multiorgan failure. The most important finding was the identification of a novel metalloprotease, named ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motives), that is involved in the regulation of the size of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a major modulator of platelet adhesion and aggregation in the microcirculation. Inherited or acquired deficiencies of ADAMTS13 impair VWF cleavage, leading in turn to the disseminated formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the micro-circulation and to symptoms of end-organ ischemia. By measuring ADAMTS13 in plasma, it has been clearly shown that patients with inherited TTP have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. However, patients with acquired TTP present with clinical and laboratory heterogeneity, and there are unequivocal cases of acquired TTP with measurable plasma levels of ADAMTS13. This heterogeneity poses a challenge for understanding the pathogenesis of TTP and selecting appropriate therapies.

### What's new in the diagnosis and pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^111jJUed]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Severe ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) deficiency causes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and the absence of oliguric or anuric renal failure. However, some patients with this constellation of findings do not have ADAMTS13 deficiency, and some patients with ADAMTS13 deficiency have renal failure or relatively normal blood counts. Consequently, many investigators and clinicians have incorporated severe ADAMTS13 deficiency into the case definition of TTP. This change has facilitated the timely initiation of treatment for patients with atypical clinical features who otherwise would not be recognized as having TTP. Conversely, excluding severe ADAMTS13 deficiency focuses attention on the diagnosis and treatment of other causes of thrombotic microangiopathy that require different treatment. The rapid return of ADAMTS13 data is important to make the best use of this information.

### Unresponsive thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in critically ill adults [^116zkTNr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The prognosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has considerably improved since the introduction of plasma exchange (PEX) therapy. However, unresponsive thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (Un-TTP) still carries high morbidity and mortality rates, indicating a need for early specific treatments.

Patients and Methods

In a retrospective study including consecutive adults with TTP admitted between January 1997 and January 2011 in a teaching hospital intensive care unit (ICU), our objective here is to identify early clinical and laboratory features predicting Un-TTP. Patients who responded to plasma exchange and steroids (N = 49) were compared with patients with unresponsive TTP defined as requirement for other treatments, protracted course, or death (N = 37, 43%).

Results

Hospital mortality was 24.3% in the Un-TTP group. Variables associated with Un-TTP on univariate logistic regression were older age, cardiac involvement, neurological involvement, higher anti-a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS13) immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer, lower platelet counts starting on day 2, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores starting on day 3, need for higher plasma volumes to obtain remission, and greater use of adjuvant treatments and life-sustaining interventions. Multivariate logistic regression identified four factors independently associated with Un-TTP: age over 60 years [odds ratio (OR) 7.90; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.06–78.34], cardiac (OR 5.17; 95% CI 1.63–16.39) or neurological (OR 8.04; 95% CI 1.27–51.03) manifestations at diagnosis, and day 2 platelet count less than 15 G/l (OR 3.88; 95% CI 1.30–11.62).

Conclusion

Therapeutic intensification starting on day 3 or even earlier in patients with the independent risk factors for unresponsive TTP identified in our study deserves evaluation in a multicenter prospective study.

### Time from suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura to initiation of plasma exchange and impact on survival: a 10-year provincial retrospective cohort study [^116JMXAd]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) with significant morbidity and mortality. Guidelines recommend initiating plasma exchange within 4–8 h of suspected diagnosis. It is unclear what are real-world practice patterns and whether delays > 8 h increases mortality.

Objectives

To determine if delayed initiation of plasma exchange is associated with increased risk of death and complications.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the time from suspected diagnosis to plasma exchange in all adults presenting with suspected TTP to apheresis centres in Alberta, Canada (2008–2018). Among patients with acquired TTP, the association between delayed plasma exchange and risk of death was evaluated using Cox regression.

Results

Overall 190 episodes of suspected TTP were included among 163 individuals. Acquired TTP was confirmed in 61 patients. Inappropriate Emergency Department triage occurred in 59%. The median time from suspected diagnosis to first plasma exchange was 10.7 h; 59% had delayed plasma exchange > 8 h, among whom plasma infusion was administered in only 45%. 36% of suspected TTP and 13% of confirmed TTP patients died. Delayed plasma exchange between 8 and 24 h was not associated with a significantly higher risk of death (adjusted hazards ratio; aHR 0.63, 95% CI 0.08–4.83) in confirmed TTP. On the other hand, the risks of death (aHR 1.40, 95% CI 0.20–9.79) and major thrombotic events (aHR 2.9, 95% CI 0.6–12.8) were markedly increased with > 24 h delay.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated that TTP care in a real-world setting is discordant with expert guidelines due to multiple barriers. There is a gradient of increased mortality risk and thrombotic complications with longer treatment delays, although the study is likely underpowered.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura… [^1112K5FS]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THROMBOTIC thrombocytopenic purpura is an unusual disease manifested clinically by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, renal involvement and neurologic manifestations, and characterized pathologically by occlusion of small blood vessels in many organs by an homogenous, eosinophilic matter. While the disease is unusual and its etiology is unknown, the condition can no longer be considered rare. Table 1 is a summary of the number of patients with TTP reported since 1925 when the disease was first described. 1 The last review2 of TTP, published in March 1966, collected 271 cases from the literature. Since then we have found more than 30 new published cases. Neurologic involvement occurs in over 90% of patients with TTP, 2 and the illness begins as a neurologic one in 47%12 to 60%3 of patients with TTP. Since 1947, 5 almost all reviewers of this interesting disease have reported that the initial neurologic Silverstein A.

### Ipilimumab-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) [^117Di2s1]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Background

CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) was the first immune checkpoint receptor clinically targeted for use in cancer treatment. It is expressed exclusively on T-cells where its primary role is to regulate the amplitude of the early stages of T-cell activation.1 Ipilimumab, a CTLA-4 blocking antibody, has been widely used for the treatment of patients with high risk and metastatic melanoma. Given its mechanism of action and consequent immune activation, the side effect profile of this drug greatly differs from that of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. Adverse events are from the most part immune-mediated, ranging from the more common, such as rash and fatigue, to the less common, such as immune endocrinopathy and colitis.

Case presentation

We describe a case of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in a 68 year-old woman with high risk, stage III melanoma occurring after 3 cycles of adjuvant treatment with ipilimumab as part of a clinical trial.

Conclusion

The range of immune-mediated adverse events during treatment with ipilimumab is wide and varied and clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion when managing these patients.

### More on the pathogenesis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. comment on "Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura without detectable Anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies: a possible underlying autoimmune mechanism" and on "The different faces of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura" [^112Npjsn]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent decades, many publications have clarified the pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a life-threatening disease characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and multiorgan failure.TTP is a clinical entity caused by the deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13). ADAMTS13, also known as von Willebrand factor (VWF) cleaving protease, is responsible for cleaving VWF multimers, thereby quenching the heightened activity of ultra-large VWF multimers in binding to Gp1b receptors on platelets. In the absence of ADAMTS13 (i.e. in TTP), ultra-large VWF multimers accumulate in plasma, resulting in the widespread formation of VWF- and platelet-rich microthrombi.

Congenital TTP is caused by defects in the ADAMTS13 gene, leading to decreased or absent enzyme activity. In contrast, in most patients with immune-mediated TTP (iTTP), ADAMTS13 deficiency is an acquired disorder due to the development of antibodies against ADAMTS13, which promote the clearance of ADAMTS13 from the circulation or inhibit its activity. Mariotte et al. reported that TTP can also occur without anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies as an acquired form of unknown cause (uTTP) and unclear mechanism. The same group reported that 20% of the cases in their national cohort were uTTP, although 21% of them needed to be revisited because anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies were actually detected during follow-up. In the remaining cases, the absence of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, searched for using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, excluded the presence of ADAMTS13 activity inhibition, as confirmed by the Bethesda method or plasma mixing assay. Therefore, the authors suggested a non-immune mechanism involving the destruction or consumption of ADAMTS13, and concluded that the absence at baseline of detectable anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies in patients with typical features of iTTP (such as young age, cerebral involvement, severe thrombocytopenia, and severe ADAMTS13 deficiency) should not rule out a diagnosis of iTTP.

### TTP: from empiricism for an enigmatic disease to targeted molecular therapies [^115epCSv]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

The 100th anniversary of the first description of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) as a disease by Dr. Eli Moschcowitz approaches. For many decades, TTP remained mostly a mysterious fatal condition, where diagnosis was often post-mortem. Initially a pentad of symptoms was identified, a pattern that later revealed to be fallible. Sporadic observations led to empiric interventions that allowed for the first impactful breakthrough in TTP treatment, almost 70 years after its first description: the introduction of plasma exchange and infusions as treatments. The main body of knowledge within the field was gathered in the latest three decades: patient registries were set and proved crucial for advancements; the general mechanisms of disease have been described; the diagnosis was refined; new treatments and biomarkers with improvements on prognosis and management were introduced. Further changes and improvements are expected in the upcoming decades. In this review, we provide a brief historic overview of TTP, as an illustrative example of the success of translational medicine enabling to rapidly shift from a management largely based on empiricism to targeted therapies and personalized medicine, for the benefit of patients. Current management options and present and future perspectives in this still evolving field are summarized.

### Atypical thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in a middle-aged woman who presented with a recurrent stroke [^114u27X8]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

An atypical clinical presentation makes TTP diagnosis difficult, which prevents prompt management of TTP. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of TTP in patients with atypical presentations who may not have the expected clinical or laboratory findings. The level of suspicion should be especially high in young and middle-aged patients with strokes or acute coronary syndrome who do not have other risk factors for cardiovascular events. This is particularly so for those patients who have a previous episode of TTP or patients with subtle laboratory abnormalities, which may suggest the potential existence of a thrombotic microangiopathic process.

### The complex differential diagnosis between thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome: laboratory weapons and their impact on treatment choice and monitoring [^113totvJ]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia are the hallmark of the thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). TTP, inherited or autoimmune, is mainly caused by the plasma deficiency of the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease ADAMTS13, owing to gene mutations or autoantibodies. Typical HUS is often caused by infections with Shiga-Toxin-producing Escherichia coli and thus is called STEC-HUS. The rarer atypical form of HUS is often associated with complement dysregulation, owing to the inherited deficiency or dysfunction of factor H or other complement proteins. In the past the distinction between these TMAs was almost exclusively based on clinical grounds, the term TTP being used for cases with predominant neurological involvement, STEC HUS for cases presenting with bloody diarrhea and atypical HUS identifying patients with severe renal damage. However the clinical presentation may not easily distinguish TTP from atypical HUS. A more accurate differential diagnosis has clinical implications, because plasma exchange (the treatment of choice in TTP) is much less effective in atypical HUS, which shows dramatic short- and long-term therapeutic benefits from eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits complement activation. This article will point out that the measurement of ADAMTS13 is able to diagnose accurately the majority of TTP cases, and that very simple tests such as the platelet count and serum creatinine can predict the deficiency of the protease with a good degree of accuracy. In atypical HUS, new methods were recently developed that not only demonstrate the activation of the complement system, i.e., the main disease mechanism, but also help to tailor the short- and long-term treatment with eculizumab.

There are so few true haematological emergencies that they are often way down the list as a differential diagnosis. Those that do exist, however, can prove devastatingly fatal if left untreated and a case is presented of one such possible diagnosis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which falls into the remit of many possible presenting conditions. Particularly prevalent in young adults, this condition must always be thought of in any patient presenting with confusion, renal impairment, fever or other neurological abnormalities.

Since the last review in 2007 of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia in the Clinics, further understanding of the nature of TTP and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) has led to increasing use of rituximab in the treatment of TTP and the approval in 2011 of eculizumab for the treatment of aHUS. With this new armamentarium, distinction of aHUS from TTP has become more critical than ever. This article updates the new knowledge, highlights the difference between aHUS and TTP, and presents a scheme for their diagnosis and management.

### How I treat patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: 2010 [^113nC6kB]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is the common name for adults with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, with or without neurologic or renal abnormalities, and without another etiology; children without renal failure are also described as TTP. The diagnosis of TTP is an indication for plasma exchange treatment, but beginning treatment requires sufficient confidence in the diagnosis to justify the risk of plasma exchange complications. Documentation of a severe deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13 activity, defined as less than 10% of normal, is not essential for the diagnosis of TTP. Some patients without severe ADAMTS13 deficiency may benefit from plasma exchange treatment; in addition, some patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency may subsequently be diagnosed with another cause for their clinical features. However, severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency does define a subgroup of patients who appear to benefit from treatment with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents in addition to plasma exchange but who have a high risk for relapse. Approximately 80% of patients survive their acute episode, a survival rate that has not changed since the introduction of plasma exchange treatment. Although recovery may appear to be complete, many patients have persistent minor cognitive abnormalities. More effective as well as safer treatment for TTP is needed.

Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

The consensus guideline introduced by Scully et al. in 2017 and reports of several other groups offered a comprehensive update on the management and classification of TTP by addressing both acquired and inherited forms of TTP, including the diagnostic criteria and the importance of ADAMTS13 testing for TTP diagnosis. A major clue to our understanding of ADAMTS13 was introduced by Roose et al. who showed that this protease usually circulates in an open conformation during the acute phase of iTTP but remains primarily closed during remission, with ADAMTS13 activity higher than 50% and undetectable anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. All in all, despite major advances in recent years in the understanding of the disease, many aspects of its pathophysiology still remain unclear. TTP remains primarily a clinical diagnosis, which must be confirmed by the presence of severely reduced ADAMTS13 activity (< 10%) with or without the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies.

### Definition of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura… [^11552f4B]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. A rare condition in which blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. These clots can block the flow of blood and oxygen to the body's organs, which leads to a lower-than-normal number of platelets in the blood. Signs and symptoms of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura include purple bruises or tiny red or purple spots on the skin, bleeding problems, anemia, fever, chest pain, nervous system problems, and kidney problems. acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura occurs when the body starts producing antibodies that block an enzyme called ADAMTS13, which is involved in blood clotting. It may be brought on by certain diseases or conditions, certain medicines, or certain procedures.

acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura usually occurs in adults. Also called aTTP.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: diagnostic criteria, clinical features, and long-term outcomes from 1995 through 2015 [^111vqFkC]. Blood Advances (2017). Low credibility.

Our objective was to describe new observations from the Oklahoma Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) Registry experience (November 1995 through December 2015) on the diagnosis of TTP along with patients' clinical features and their outcomes. Among 363 patients with an initial episode of clinically suspected TTP, the diagnosis of TTP was supported by both ADAMTS13 activity < 10% and clinical features in 78 patients (21%). ADAMTS13 activity was measured in all 363 patients by 2 methods: fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and immunoblotting (IB). Sixty patients had ADAMTS13 activity < 10% by both methods, 15 had ADAMTS13 < 10% only by FRET, and 3 had ADAMTS13 < 10% only by IB. Five patients with ADAMTS13 activity < 10% by 1 method had an alternative clinical diagnosis, not TTP. Two patients with characteristic clinical features of TTP (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, no alternative diagnosis) and multiple relapses initially had ADAMTS13 activity > 10% by both measurements. ADAMTS13 inhibitor titers were not associated with presenting features or outcomes. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia were not severe in all patients. Forty-seven percent of patients had no or minor neurologic abnormalities; 95% had no or minor serum creatinine abnormalities. Ten patients (13%) died, 2 before completing 1 plasma exchange (PEX); 3 deaths were attributed to PEX complications. For patients presenting after we began using rituximab in some patients (December 2003), fewer PEX treatments were required and fewer relapses occurred. Patients with their first relapse presented with higher platelet counts and hematocrits and lower lactate dehydrogenase levels and required fewer PEX treatments compared with their initial episodes.

Diagnosis of TTP and aHUS

The underlying pathophysiology of TTP is the presence of widespread microthrombi that are platelet‐ and VWF‐rich. aHUS is associated with platelet fibrin thrombi, but other TMAs have varying amounts of lymphocytic or neutrophil infiltration as part of, or related to, the microthrombi (Hosler et al, 2003).

Previously, TTP was diagnosed as a pentad (thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA), neurological features, fever and renal involvement) and HUS was classified by the presence or absence of bloody diarrhoea. Indeed, the relevance of 'diarrhoea negative' HUS was unclear. This has now changed, and central to the diagnosis of TMAs is thrombocytopenia, MAHA and the clinical or histological effects of microvascular thrombosis. The degree of thrombocytopenia at initial presentation of TTP and aHUS is, broadly, < 50 × 10⁹/L for TTP and usually > 50 × 10⁹/L for aHUS. However, this is only a general rule and TTP cases with platelet counts > 50 × 10⁹/L and aHUS cases with platelet counts < 50 × 10⁹/L can be recalled and are not anecdotal. Therefore, a clinical suspicion and full diagnostic work up is required. Presentation may not be 'classic'. In patients presenting with neurological, cardiac or bleeding symptoms (such as haematuria) as an emergency, and is associated with thrombocytopenia, TTP should be considered. The presence of neurological and cardiological involvement signifies severe disease and should be considered, especially in young patients. At least 10% of presenting TTP patients require intubation and ventilation. Identification of subgroups of TTP, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)‐associated, pregnancyand drug‐related cases, require associated treatment of the underlying condition as well as plasma exchange (PEX).

### The remarkable diversity of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a perspective [^111fw24t]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Understanding the autoimmune etiology of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has provided precision for the diagnosis and a rationale for immunosuppressive treatment. These advances have also allowed recognition of the remarkable clinical diversities of patients' initial presentations and their long-term outcomes. These diversities are illustrated by the stories of patients from the Oklahoma TTP Registry. The initial presentation of TTP may be the discovery of unexpected severe thrombocytopenia in a patient with minimal or no symptoms. The patient may remain asymptomatic throughout treatment or may die suddenly before treatment can be started. ADAMTS13 activity may be reported as normal in a patient with characteristic clinical features of TTP, or the unexpected report of ADAMTS13 deficiency in a patient with another established disorder may lead to the discovery of TTP. ADAMTS13 activity during clinical remission is unpredictable. ADAMTS13 activity may recover and remain normal, it may remain severely deficient for many years, or it may become normal only many years after recovery. Our treatment of initial episodes and management of patients after recovery and during remission continue to change. The addition of rituximab to the treatment of acute episodes and preemptive rituximab for patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency during remission are reported to prevent relapse. Because TTP is uncommon, there are few data to guide these changes. Therefore our patients' stories are profoundly influential. Their stories are the foundation of our experience, and our experience is the guide for our decisions.

### TTP: from empiricism for an enigmatic disease to targeted molecular therapies [^113HftC5]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

The main advances in the understanding of the century‐old disease Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) pathophysiology took place during the last three decades, and were successfully translated into diagnostic and therapeutic improvements.
Today, innovative technologies are driving profound changes in the diagnosis and treatment standards for TTP, making TTP an illustrative success of translational medicine.
In a foreseeable future, historical treatments such as therapeutic plasma exchange and plasma therapy for TTP may become obsolete with the upcoming inception of rhADAMTS13 for clinical use, the introduction of caplacizumab, and the extensive use of rituximab.
Knowledge gaps still exist, as it is yet not fully known how TTP patients develop cognitive impairments, and we must reinforce measures against cardiovascular risk factors and premature death, which are still prevalent in TTP patients.

### A classification of hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and related disorders [^114e9sTj]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnostic terms hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are based on historical and overlapping clinical descriptions. Advances in understanding some of the causes of the syndrome now permit many patients to be classified according to etiology. The increased precision of a diagnosis based on causation is important for considering logical approaches to treatment and prognosis. It is also essential for research. We propose a classification that accommodates both a current understanding of causation (level 1) and clinical association in cases for whom cause of disease is unclear (level 2). We tested the classification in a pediatric disease registry of HUS. The revised classification is a stimulus to comprehensive investigation of all cases of HUS and TTP and is expected to increase the proportion of cases in whom a level 1 etiological diagnosis is confirmed.

### The third form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura shows up again: what is it, does it even exist, how to find out? Comment on "Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura without detectable Anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies: a possible underlying autoimmune mechanism" and on "The different faces of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura" [^1146bqzN]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Haematologica a Letter by Delphine Simon et al. on behalf of the French Centre National de Référence des Microangiopathies Thrombotiques (CNR-MAT), again brings up the existence and characteristics of a third form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), labeled as TTP of unidentified pathophysiology (uTTP). This reiterated important insight is accompanied by a comment by a TTP specialist, Paul Knöbl. Many questions concerning this potentially important but so far incompletely understood variant of TTP remain and I will try to put this uTTP variant into perspective and propose further steps to confirm its existence and unravel its secrets.

TTP was first described in 1924 by Moschcowitzand the history of extensive research, elucidation of the pathophysiology, and the enormous therapeutic advances for this rare - and during half a century universally fatal - disease has been reviewed by many groups. In all these reviews two separate forms of TTP are generally distinguished: (i) a rare congenital or hereditary form (cTTP or hTTP) caused by biallelic variants of the ADAMTS13 gene giving rise to a severe constitutional deficiency of ADAMTS13 (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin type 1 motifs, number 13), the specific von Willebrand factor (VWF)-cleaving metalloprotease and (ii) a still rare but more common acquired form of TTP caused by autoantibodies inhibiting and/or clearing ADAMTS13 from plasma, generally termed autoimmune TTP (iTTP). In both forms of TTP, cTTP and iTTP, the defective proteolytic processing of VWF multimers results in accumulation of highly adhesive, unusually large VWF multimers leading to microvascular clumping of platelets and ischemia of multiple organs. Treatment of acute cTTP episodes consists of plasma infusions and many patients need regular plasma prophylaxis to avoid recurring acute bouts. More recently, recombinant human ADAMTS13 has become available for improved and facilitated treatment and prophylaxis of cTTP. Acute iTTP episodes are managed by daily plasma exchanges with plasma replacement, immunosuppression with corticosteroids and rituximab, and the anti-VWF nanobody caplacizumab. The International Working Group on TTP has proposed consensus definitions of the disease TTP, outlined the differential diagnosis between TTP and other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), and defined response to treatment and outcomes. Moreover, under the auspices of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, recommendations and guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of TTP have been established. In sum, TTP, both cTTP and iTTP, have been transformed from a generally deadly condition without any effective therapy until the 1960s to 1970s to two pathophysiologically well understood separate diseases, which can be effectively managed provided they are recognized promptly and diagnosed in a timely manner.

### A third form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura? [^115oPteW]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Haematologica a highly provocative letter by B.S. Joly et al. on behalf of the French Reference Center for Thrombotic Microangiopathies (CNR-MAT), reiterates the existence of a so-far largely disregarded - not to say «scotomized» - form of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). In the hundred years since its first description by Moschcowitz in 1924, TTP has attracted the interest of numerous clinicians and researchers; the development of our knowledge on the pathophysiology and more recently new therapeutic advances in this previously mostly fatal disease are a major success story of modern scientific medicine.

TTP specialists usually distinguish two pathophysiologically distinct forms of TTP: (i) a very rare hereditary or congenital TTP (cTTP) or Upshaw-Schulman syndrome caused by biallelic mutations of the ADAMTS13 gene leading to a severe constitutional deficiency of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving metalloprotease ADAMTS13 and (ii) an acquired, autoimmune TTP (iTTP) associated with autoantibody-mediated severe ADAMTS13 deficiency.

### How I treat refractory thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^113s7qG2]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is characterized by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) without an obvious cause, and may include fever, mild renal failure, and neurologic deficits. It is characterized by a deficiency of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) cleaving enzyme, ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase, with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), resulting in formation of microthrombi in the high sheer environment of the microvasculature. This causes microvascular occlusion, MAHA, and organ ischemia. Diagnosis is based on the presence of clinical symptoms, laboratory aberrations consistent with MAHA, decreased ADAMTS13 activity, and possibly presence of anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. Upfront treatment of acute TTP includes plasma exchange and corticosteroids. A significant number of patients are refractory to this treatment and will require further interventions. There are limited data and consensus on the management of the refractory TTP patient. Management involves simultaneously ruling out other causes of thrombocytopenia and MAHA, while also considering other treatments. In this article, we describe our management of the patient with refractory TTP, and discuss use of rituximab, increased plasma exchange, splenectomy, and immunosuppressive options, including cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and cyclosporine. We also review recent evidence for the potential roles of bortezomib and N-acetylcysteine, and explore new therapeutic approaches, including recombinant ADAMTS13 and anti-VWF therapy.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in childhood [^116XJ5iX]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disease, especially in childhood, and has a high mortality rate in the absence of appropriate treatment. It is characterised by microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and consumptive thrombocytopenia. TTP may be difficult to distinguish from haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) because of similar clinical manifestations and laboratory findings. In the past, TTP and HUS have often been considered to represent variable expressions of a single entity. Our increased understanding of the pathogenesis of TTP has in turn resulted in significant improvements in its treatment and outcomes. Several immunomodulating agents are currently being used with variable outcomes.

### Does hemolytic uremic syndrome differ from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura? [^117B5rWb]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

Both hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), affecting mainly the kidney and brain, respectively. Diagnosis of HUS or TTP has been complicated by the fact that these disorders share several clinical characteristics, and by the dearth of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of TMA. Advances in the identification of pathogenic features — deficiency of the metalloprotease ADAMTS13 in TTP and association of mutated complement proteins with atypical HUS — have gone some way towards improving clinicians' ability to distinguish between the two diseases. Here, we pose the following question: is it important to patient management that HUS be distinguished from TTP? By discussing what is known about the pathogenesis, clinical features and treatment of these two conditions we address this question, and propose a new nomenclature for TMA.

### A descriptive analysis of fatal outcomes in immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in the USTMA TTP registry [^111QpSPh]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Kaplan-Meier survival curve of patients with iTTP since the time of first diagnosis.

Over the past 3 decades, the mortality rate during the first episode of iTTP decreased over time, with an estimated risk reduction of 6.8% per year (95% CI, 2.1%-10.8%; p = 0.003) based on log-binomial regression, assuming a linear relationship between time and mortality rate. The mortality rate decreased from 14.3% between 1990 and 1994 to 6.4% in the final 5 years of the (2015–2019; Figure 2). Within the same cohort, the number of new iTTP diagnoses increased over time, most notably in the last decade.

Figure 2.
The number of new iTTP diagnoses and the death rate at first presentation between 1990 and 2019 per 5-year intervals.

The overall acute iTTP-related mortality rate of 6.6% in our cohort was similar to other recent reports. The overwhelming majority (73%) of deaths occurred during the first episode, two-thirds of which occurred before achieving a clinical response. This is consistent with previous findings that suggest the highest risk of mortality at the first presentation. A quarter of all death events were due to disease relapse, occurring more than a year after the initial diagnosis. This highlights the importance of vigilant laboratory and clinical monitoring after achieving the first remission and during long-term follow-up, and considerations such as pre-emptive immunosuppression, as needed.

The mortality rate of iTTP at first presentation decreased with time, from 14% to 6% over the past 3 decades, by an annual rate of 6.8% of the previous year, based on log-binomial regression that met statistical significance. During the same period, new diagnoses of iTTP increased. This is likely attributable to several developments, such as the availability of the ADAMTS13 assay, as well as clinical diagnostic scores, guidelines, and education efforts. We could not analyze whether the introduction of rituximab in iTTP management had an impact. We observed a small uptick in mortality in the last interval (6.4%), which we attributed to the fluctuating rates of iTTP mortality that may potentially vary with baseline risk factors, especially because the sample size of fatal outcomes was small. With the advancement of novel iTTP therapies, death rates may drop further.

Questions raised concerning thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura of unidentified pathophysiology

Most published series of TTP patients distinguish two forms of TTP, cTTP and the more common iTTP. Similarly, reviews, and guidelines on diagnosis and management, mention these two disease variants. One may wonder, therefore, why this uTTP disease variant has only been identified in the large French TMA reference center registry. An initial diagnosis of uTTP in the abovementioned reports from the CNR-MAT, affected roughly 25% of TTP patients. Even though some 20% of initial uTTP diagnoses may be revised to iTTP when autoantibodies become detected during long-term follow-up, either in remission or at an acute relapse, it nevertheless remains difficult to explain why uTTP has so far not been identified in other major cohorts. How can this entity of uTTP, rather common in non-idiopathic TTP, be overlooked in other experienced TMA centers?

Could different sensitivities of assays for measuring anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies or using variable cut-offs for positivity of the same ELISA give an explanation? The commercial Technozym ® ADAMTS13-INH-ELISA used by the French centers is commonly also used by other groups. It should be realized that this ELISA only detects free autoantibodies of the IgG class and may miss IgM and/ or IgA antibodies. Moreover, if all antibodies are bound to ADAMTS13 and circulate in plasma as immune complexes with the protease, no free autoantibodies can be detected. Therefore, a negative assay for free anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies in plasma or serum does not strictly rule out an iTTP. Measuring functional inhibitors using Bethesda-like assaysis not done by many groups and is not expected to give positive results in the absence of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies by ELISA.

### Expert statement on the ICU management of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^116CGTkW]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is fatal in 90% of patients if left untreated and must be diagnosed early to optimize patient outcomes. However, the very low incidence of TTP is an obstacle to the development of evidence-based clinical practice recommendations, and the very wide variability in survival rates across centers may be partly ascribable to differences in management strategies due to insufficient guidance. We therefore developed an expert statement to provide trustworthy guidance about the management of critically ill patients with TTP. As strong evidence was difficult to find in the literature, consensus building among experts could not be reported for most of the items. This expert statement is timely given the recent advances in the treatment of TTP, such as the use of rituximab and of the recently licensed drug caplacizumab, whose benefits will be maximized if the other components of the management strategy follow a standardized pattern. Finally, unanswered questions are identified as topics of future research on TTP.

Abstract

Background

Acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life‐threatening emergency and plasma exchange (PEX) is the initial treatment shown to reduce acute mortality.

Objectives

To compare current practice in the United Kingdom (UK) against the standards set out in the 2012 British Society of Haematology guideline, and to better understand the issues affecting prompt initiation of PEX.

Patients/Methods

The trainee research network HaemSTAR conducted a retrospective nationwide review of adults presenting to UK hospitals with a first episode of acute TTP.

Results

Data on 148 patients treated at 80 UK hospitals between 2014 and 2019 demonstrated that 64.8% of patients received PEX within 24 h. Diagnostic uncertainty was the most commonly cited reason for delayed treatment. Conversely, a shorter time to PEX occurred in patients who had red cell fragments or severe thrombocytopenia identified on their first complete blood count. Availability of on‐site PEX was associated with a greater proportion of patients receiving PEX within 8 h compared to patients transferred, but by 24 h there was no difference between the two groups and two‐thirds of all patients had received their first PEX. The mortality rate for patients that received PEX was 9.2%, with 27.8% of deaths linked to delayed treatment initiation.

Conclusions

This is the first multi‐center evaluation of treatment delays in acute TTP and it will inform targeted pathways to improve prompt access to life‐saving intervention.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: early diagnosis and effective treatment in 2025 [^1123wBQV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2024, the centenary of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) marks a significant milestone in the understanding and management of this rare and life-threatening condition. To commemorate this occasion, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine launched an educational initiative aimed at consolidating and disseminating key knowledge on TTP, spanning its history, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. This paper summarizes the advances that have transformed TTP from a nearly universally fatal disease to one with a survival rate exceeding 95%. The journey from Eli Moschcowitz's first description of TTP in 1924 to today's sophisticated therapeutic options highlights the crucial contributions of clinicians, basic scientists, and industry collaborators. Central to TTP's pathophysiology is the deficiency of the plasma protease ADAMTS13, caused either by autoantibodies as in immune TTP (iTTP) or by genetic mutations of ADAMTS13 in congenital TTP (cTTP). The discovery of ADAMTS13 and its deficiency has led to breakthroughs in diagnosis and differential diagnoses, and the development of targeted treatments, including therapeutic plasma exchange, caplacizumab (an anti-VWF nanobody), and recombinant ADAMTS13. This review provides a comprehensive summary of TTP, with a focus on diagnostic challenges, therapeutic advancements, and future perspectives. It also serves as a tribute to the collaborative efforts that have shaped our understanding of this disease over the past century. By raising awareness and sharing best practices, this educational initiative aims to further improve outcomes for patients with TTP and foster continued progress in the field.

### Molecular basis of thrombotic microangiopathy [^116hsVyf]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are two index conditions of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). While conditions classified as TMA share common clinical characteristics, their underlying causes differ significantly. TMA is challenging to diagnose but life threating without proper and timely diagnosis and treatments. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding of the molecular basis, clinical epidemiology, and treatments of TTP and HUS.

### Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura of unidentified pathophysiology in patients with severe disease: completing the landscape of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^1157CuU7]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) results from a severe (activity < 10 IU/dL) ADAMTS13 deficiency, typically categorized as congenital (cTTP), immune-mediated (iTTP), or acquired with an unknown mechanism (uTTP). Recently, our group proposed the term uTTP to describe acquired TTP cases with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency but without detectable anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, that typically occur in association with other comorbidities such as cancer, severe infection, liver failure or systemic autoimmune disease. This proposal raises new questions about the pathophysiological landscape of TTP and highlights potential diagnostic gaps. We understand and appreciate the comprehensive editorial of TTP classification by Knöbland we respectfully address several key points for further clarification and nuance.

Among patients classified as uTTP, who systematically exhibited features of TMA justifying an ADAMTS13 investigation, a substantial subset (20–25%) likely represents iTTP cases. These cases are typically associated with specific clinical contexts that include a history of systemic autoimmune disease, pregnancy, or mild infections; ADAMTS13 is in an open conformation, indicating an underlying autoimmune, antibody-mediated mechanism for ADAMTS13 deficiency, and clinical features are those typically observed in iTTP. In that way, anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies can be finally identified in up to 20% of those patients later during follow-up. This group of patients differs significantly from uTTP cases defined by a TMA syndrome associated with specific conditions such as cancer, severe sepsis or liver failure, which tend to exhibit a closed ADAMTS13 conformation. In that regard, outside of any context of TMA, rare cases of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency have been previously reported in severe sepsis, with no underlying autoimmune mechanism. Our group has documented this point, reinforcing the view that severe ADAMTS13 deficiency can arise in critical diseases and results from non-immune mechanisms, particularly in the context of severe inflammation or hemodynamic stress, occurring in the absence of TMA features. In those contexts, ADAMTS13 deficiency may result from a cleavage of the protein by other proteases, such as plasmin, as well as degradation or consumption. In uTTP, such mechanisms may account for a severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency but also for TMA features.uTTP is therefore an important and specific condition occurring in non-immunologic contexts that needs to be considered in patients with features of TMA, as it expands our clinical understanding of ADAMTS13 deficiency in various pathophysiological settings. Recognizing uTTP patients provides crucial insights into ADAMTS13 activity and conformation as well as clinical background, allowing for a more comprehensive and accurate categorization and management of TTP patients. It is noteworthy that the underlying contexts in uTTP patients usually lead to their exclusion from clinical studies to ensure homogeneous patient populations, as their condition can contribute to cytopenias and directly affect prognosis, accounting for a bias where over 95% of iTTP patients with well-documented anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies are included in published studies.

### Pathology consultation on the diagnosis and treatment of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) [^115LjJm6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pathologists specializing in transfusion medicine, apheresis medicine, and/or coagulation are often consulted by clinicians to reach a diagnosis for patients with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), so that disease-specific, often life-saving therapy can be initiated as promptly as possible.

Methods

This article describes how to proceed when treating a patient with TMA. The differential diagnosis is broad and potentially very challenging. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and typical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are three such TMAs that require timely diagnosis and treatment.

Results

TTP is treated with daily therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and commonly with adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy, while aHUS may initially be managed with TPE but is best controlled with eculizumab once a presumptive diagnosis is made. TPE has no proven role in typical HUS, which is most commonly treated with supportive measures only.

Conclusions

Prompt and accurate diagnosis of TMA subtypes optimizes treatment and improves patient outcomes.

### Current concepts in the diagnosis and management of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^116iWU5T]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a multisystem disease characterized by thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, renal failure, fever, and neurologic abnormalities. Plasma exchange has revolutionized the outcome of this entity from a once fatal disease to a disease that potentially is cured or has prolonged remission. The understanding of the pathophysiology of TTP continues to evolve. Recently, investigators showed that a deficiency in a specific plasma protease responsible for cleaving vWf plays a crucial role in the familial form of TTP. This explains in part why patients usually respond to plasma exchange therapy. The identification of a mutation in a specific gene that belongs to the metalloproteinase family located at chromosome 9q34 could have important therapeutic implications. TTP can be induced by certain drugs, especially immunosuppressants, in the setting of bone marrow and solid organ transplantation. This disease also has been described in association with HIV, pregnancy, cancer, and chemotherapy. TTP remains an ideal example of how knowledge about the etiology of a disease can improve therapeutic interventions.

### Advances in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^112gNMRE]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are both characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolysis, and organ dysfunction. Other disorders occasionally present with similar manifestations. Recent studies have demonstrated that deficiency in the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease ADAMTS13, due to genetic mutations or autoimmune inhibitors, causes TTP. Molecular cloning of ADAMTS13 elucidates the structure of the protease, raising the prospect for advances in diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Assay of ADAMTS13 activity distinguishes TTP from HUS and other types of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA); therefore, the term TTP/HUS should be avoided because it obscures the known or potential differences among the various types of TMA.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a hematological emergency [^116T1RzJ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a hematological emergency and diagnostic challenge. The critical determinant of outcome is timely diagnosis and treatment.

Objectives

Describe the pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Discussion

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has a varied presentation and a tendency to mimic several disorders. However, it may be at least provisionally diagnosed in the patient with thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia without alternate cause. The mainstay of treatment is immediate plasma exchange to be repeated until platelet count is stabilized. Adjuvant therapies include corticosteroids, rituximab, and cyclosporine.

Conclusion

It is essential for the emergency physician to be aware of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura's range of presentations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment.

### None of the above: thrombotic microangiopathy beyond TTP and HUS [^114qhRB8]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are appropriately at the top of a clinician's differential when a patient presents with a clinical picture consistent with an acute thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). However, there are several additional diagnoses that should be considered in patients presenting with an acute TMA, especially in patients with nondeficient ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity (> 10%). An increased awareness of drug-induced TMA is also essential because the key to their diagnosis more often is an appropriately detailed medical history to inquire about potential exposures. Widespread inflammation and endothelial damage are central in the pathogenesis of the TMA, with the treatment directed at the underlying disease if possible. TMA presentations in the critically ill, drug-induced TMA, cancer-associated TMA, and hematopoietic transplant-associated TMA (TA-TMA) and their specific treatment, where applicable, will be discussed in this manuscript. A complete assessment of all the potential etiologies for the TMA findings including acquired TTP will allow for a more accurate diagnosis and prevent prolonged or inappropriate treatment with plasma exchange therapy when it is less likely to be successful.

### Stroke due to typical thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura treated successfully with intravenous thrombolysis and therapeutic plasma exchange [^1148Hgnp]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We report a case of a 39-year-old man with expressive aphasia due to occlusion of the temporal stem of the left middle cerebral artery. Laboratory tests showed microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. A thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was diagnosed, and thrombolytic therapy (TT) with alteplase followed by therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) were performed with complete resolution of symptoms. The gold standard TTP treatment is TPE, and its delay can be lethal. The use of TT in TTP is controversial and has potential risks. This case shows a successful TT in a patient with typical TTP presenting as a stroke due to a large cerebral artery occlusion.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disease whose incidence is now increasing. We present a case of a 37-year-old man who presented with bilateral flank pain and hematuria, subsequently diagnosed with TTP. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has classically been characterized by the pentad of fever, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurologic symptoms, renal dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. The pathogenesis of the disease has been a mystery until recently. We review the current literature regarding the pathophysiology and management of this disorder. Our discussion focuses on the importance of understanding this disease while considering the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with anemia and thrombocytopenia because the common pitfall of rapidly administering platelets to a patient with TTP may lead to a disastrous outcome.

### Thrombotic microangiopathies (TTP, HUS, HELLP) [^111vhhHQ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia, strictly defined as a platelet count less than 150,000, is common in the emergency department. Recognition, diagnostic investigation, and proper disposition of a thrombocytopenic patient are imperative. One group of disorders leading to thrombocytopenia is the thrombotic microangiopathies, hallmarked by platelet destruction. These thrombotic microangiopathies include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, low platelet count (HELLP), which should be distinguished from similar disease processes such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). In this article, clinical presentations, pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, management plans, complications, and dispositions are addressed for this complex group of platelet disorders.

### Overweight individuals are at increased risk for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^1118tp43]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, TTP, has increased dramatically in the past few years with the identification of the role of ADAMTS13. Nonetheless, risk factors for the development of acute TTP are few. Informally, obesity was felt to be common in patients with TTP and so a formal study was undertaken to further define this association. We report our data in 105 patients with classical TTP as defined by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. We found that marked obesity is a previously unrecognized risk factor with an associated odds ratio of 7.6. Interestingly, despite this increased risk, obesity might well be associated with lower mortality, although this did not reach statistical significance.

### Diagnostic uncertainty presented barriers to the timely management of acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in the United Kingdom between 2014 and 2019 [^114bNnXq]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Once TTP is recognized, arrangements for PEX must be made. Approximately 40 hospitals offer this service in the UK, typically the larger tertiary centers, with a maximum travel time of around 2 h for patients requiring transfer to one of these sites (excluding rare circumstances such as island residents who may need air ambulance). Where a 24‐h PEX service is not available either local ad hoc arrangements are made, or transfer to a tertiary center must be co‐ordinated, which can be a complex and time‐consuming task.

The recognized problems in acute TTP management have provoked recent proposals for a national service with appointed TTP specialist centers and provision for rapid hospital transfer.

There is currently no comprehensive record of treatment delays experienced by patients presenting with acute TTP in UK hospitals and these data would be valuable in the design of new or improved services. To understand issues affecting practice the trainee research network HaemSTAR conducted a retrospective nationwide audit of patients presenting to UK hospitals with TTP against British Society of Haematology (BSH) clinical guidelines. HaemSTAR is a UK‐wide network of clinical hematology registrars supported by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) non‐malignant Clinical Research Network (CRN).

### Pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^115VBC4F]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

The discovery of a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) revolutionized our approach to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Inherited or acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency allows the unrestrained growth of microthrombi that are composed of von Willebrand factor and platelets, which account for the thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, schistocytes, and tissue injury that characterize TTP. Most patients with acquired TTP respond to a combination of plasma exchange and rituximab, but some die or acquire irreversible neurological deficits before they can respond, and relapses can occur unpredictably. However, knowledge of the pathophysiology of TTP has inspired new ways to prevent early deaths by targeting autoantibody production, replenishing ADAMTS13, and blocking microvascular thrombosis despite persistent ADAMTS13 deficiency. In addition, monitoring ADAMTS13 has the potential to identify patients who are at risk of relapse in time for preventive therapy.

### Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of TTP: an integrated approach [^11473bnD]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) is a rare, life-threatening disease with an incidence of approximately 2 persons per million per year. It is characterized by severe deficiency of the von Willebrand cleaving protease, ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), leading to formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the microvasculature. Prompt initiation of appropriate therapy, particularly plasma exchange, may be life-saving. Diagnosis of TTP is challenging because of its diverse clinical manifestations, overlap in clinical presentation with other thrombotic microangiopathies, and limited availability of ADAMTS13 testing. Clinical prediction scores have been developed to estimate the pretest probability of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and may be used as an adjunct to clinical judgment to guide initial management decisions. An ADAMTS13 activity level of less than 10% supports the diagnosis of TTP in appropriate clinical contexts, but many centers do not offer testing in-house and must send out the test to a reference laboratory with a turnaround time of several days. In such instances, initial management decisions must be made without the benefit of laboratory testing. In patients with TTP, inhibitor tests may be useful for distinguishing immune-mediated from congenital TTP. In this article, we review the epidemiology, natural history, and clinical presentation of TTP and laboratory assays for TTP including ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor assays. We also describe an evidence-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with suspected TTP that integrates clinical and laboratory assessment.

1 INTRODUCTION

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a very rare, life‐threatening condition precipitated by an acquired (immune‐mediated) or hereditary deficiency of A Disintigren And Metalloprotease with ThromboSponin‐type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS‐13). TTP presents with a variable combination of fever, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, neurological impairment, or other organ dysfunction. It is a recognized medical emergency and prompt diagnosis and initiation of therapy is imperative for survival. In cases of immune TTP, the introduction of plasma exchange (PEX) using fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the 1990s transformed TTP from a near‐universally fatal disease into one with survival rates approaching 80%. In the UK plasma exchange for TTP is performed using FFP that has been solvent detergent treated (SD‐FFP) to achieve viral inactivation, and this is sourced as the commercial product Octaplas. Both acquired and hereditary cases of TTP will receive urgent PEX at first presentation until the underlying cause is differentiated.

The addition of immunosuppression with steroids and rituximab further improved outcomes, but PEX remains the cornerstone of treatment shown to significantly impact acute mortality, and early treatment initiation is critical as up to 50% of TTP deaths occur within 24 h of presentation. Caplacizumab, the monoclonal anti‐Von Willebrand factor (VWF) nanobody, was approved for use combined with PEX for the treatment of acute TTP in the UK in December 2020. While it is acknowledged that some international centers are moving to the use of caplacizumab to the exclusion of PEX, this is not the current standard of care in the UK.

Prompt initiation of PEX faces many logistical challenges. The average UK National Health Service (NHS) Trust may diagnose only one case of TTP per year, presenting symptoms are often non‐specific, and first point of contact is normally with non‐hematologists in the primary or secondary care setting. Laboratory biomedical scientists and/or laboratory technicians are often the first to propose the diagnosis of TTP after identifying thrombocytopenia and red cell fragmentation on blood film examination. Confirmation of the diagnosis is made by uniting the patient's clinical presentation with the complete blood count and an ADAMTS‐13 activity of < 10 iu/dl. ADAMTS‐13 activity is a specialist hemostasis assay that is only available at tertiary centers, with a turnaround time of 4–6 h, and is usually only offered during regular working hours.

### Treating TTP / HUS with plasma exchange: a single centre's 25-year experience [^115fFW8U]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/Haemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) is a thrombotic microangiopathy with a 6-month mortality rate of 16–29%. The present study described the clinical features, treatment regime and 6-month all-cause mortality rate of TTP/HUS patients at the London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC), Canada. Data for this retrospective cohort study were obtained from inpatient and outpatient records for all patients referred for plasma exchange therapy at LHSC, Canada between 1981 and 2006. Patients (n = 110) were categorized as: idiopathic primary (38%) or relapsed (16%), and secondary responsive (30%) or non-responsive (16%). Mortality data were available for all but three patients. The all-cause 6-month mortality rate was 19% overall and was 12% and 26% among idiopathic and secondary TTP/HUS patients, respectively. No mortality events occurred among the 17 idiopathic patients who relapsed. Relapsed patients had the least severe presenting characteristics, the fastest response time, and experienced significant improvement in the severity of clinical features between the first and final presentation. These findings suggest an excellent outcome for relapsed TTP/HUS patients. Patient education, surveillance, and aggressive plasma exchange therapy are hypothesized to improve the likelihood of survival: these hypotheses should be tested in a randomized controlled trial.

### TTP: from empiricism for an enigmatic disease to targeted molecular therapies [^116w7Ewf]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA

The 100th anniversary of the first description of a TTP case is approximately three years away. Despite this disease being known for almost one full century, the state‐of‐the‐art knowledge in TTP had a slow initial evolution whereas during the last 30 years it has seen an explosive expansion.

In Manhattan 1924, Dr. Eli Moschcowitz attended a 16‐year‐old girl, who died after hospitalization for an acute illness displaying high fever, pallor, arm pain, petechiae, paralysis of the left arm and leg, and a preterminal coma. The autopsy revealed multiple 'hyaline' thrombi in the heart muscle vessels, the congested spleen, and kidneys. The disease cause and right treatment remained elusive, but Moschcowitz made an important note about an observation of one of his colleagues, Dr. Max Lederer, who had seen four other similar cases where, in contrast to Moschcowitz's case, all patients had clinical improvement following blood transfusions. These observations were published later, and although they most closely resembled autoimmune or infectious haemolytic anaemia, they supported the view that some haemolytic pathologies could be treated by transfusion. This scenario was replicated later by Rubinstein et al, on another patient, with an associated rise in platelet counts and a drop in reticulocytes percentage. The name 'Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura' was first used only in 1947 after another fatal case, where three autopsy findings stood out: hyaline thrombi, a severe thrombocytopenia and petechiae/purpura. Accumulating cases made it possible to detect the main patterns of disease, with fast clinical deterioration and a pentad of unspecific symptoms first described by Amorosi and Ultman in 1966: fever, haemolytic anaemia with abundant schistocytes, thrombocytopenia (by consumption), purpura or other bleeding symptoms, neurologic signs (transient or permanent) and renal disease. The aetiology and pathophysiology remained elusive, with suggested causes including drugs, toxins, viral infections, and autoimmunity, all requiring more conclusive evidence. As a consequence, the disease was almost always fatal despite administration of various combinations of vitamins, adrenocorticotropin, corticosteroids, azathioprine, nitrogen mustard, anti‐platelet agents such as dipyridamole or aspirin, heparin, streptokinase or splenectomy. By the early 1960's, deficiency of an important factor in TTP patients and plasma therapy potential value was already recognized, eventually leading TTP to be considered a congenital disease. In the late 1970's Bukowski et al reported a small series of patients treated by exchange transfusion where remission rates rose to 60%and Byrnes et al found through a series of exchange transfusions with different hemoderivatives that the missing factor was present in plasma. Soon after, Gottschall et al described a series of 11 patients with a clinical diagnosis of TTP and their evolution in accordance with the type of blood products they received during exchange therapies. Three patients who received platelet‐poor whole blood all survived, whereas one out of three patients who received platelet‐rich whole blood and two out of four patients treated by platelet concentrates with or without whole blood eventually died. Notably, the condition of one patient deteriorated within minutes after receiving platelet‐rich whole blood. This last observation led to the general contraindication of platelet transfusion during TTP. These works slowly began to shape the pathogenesis of TTP, believed to be caused by a deficient inhibitor of platelet activation usually present in normal plasma. Simultaneously these reports and others, added to the possibility of the disease being related to autoimmunity, because patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were observed to often develop TTP, and because glucocorticoids used alone provided occasionally successful remissions. Plasma therapy became the established gold standard treatment, as well as the usefulness of clinical follow‐up by means of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and platelet counts, but no standardized regimen was yet established at the time, despite an observed correlation between recovery and dose of plasma administered. During the early 1980s, Moake et al. helped understanding of the basic pathophysiology mechanism of TTP leap forward: 'unusually large' (or ultralarge) von Willebrand factor multimers (UL‐VWF) released from endothelial cells were found to accumulate in the plasma of patients with chronic relapsing TTP and a failure to process these UL VWF multimers was proposed to explain the disorder.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a thrombotic disorder caused by ADAMTS13 deficiency [^111VqTo8]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

A serious disorder with characteristic microvascular thrombosis involving the brain and other organs, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) typically presents with thrombocytopenia, hemolysis with schistocytes on blood smears, and mental changes or seizures. It may progress rapidly to a fatal end if the patient is not treated immediately with plasma. Recent advances have shown that TTP is caused by deficiency of a circulating, von Willebrand factor cleaving metalloprotease, ADAMTS13. This new knowledge will provide clues to improve the diagnosis and management of this intriguing disease.

Abstract

The 100th anniversary of the first description of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) as a disease by Dr. Eli Moschcowitz approaches. For many decades, TTP remained mostly a mysterious fatal condition, where diagnosis was often post‐mortem. Initially a pentad of symptoms was identified, a pattern that later revealed to be fallible. Sporadic observations led to empiric interventions that allowed for the first impactful breakthrough in TTP treatment, almost 70 years after its first description: the introduction of plasma exchange and infusions as treatments. The main body of knowledge within the field was gathered in the latest three decades: patient registries were set and proved crucial for advancements; the general mechanisms of disease have been described; the diagnosis was refined; new treatments and biomarkers with improvements on prognosis and management were introduced. Further changes and improvements are expected in the upcoming decades. In this review, we provide a brief historic overview of TTP, as an illustrative example of the success of translational medicine enabling to rapidly shift from a management largely based on empiricism to targeted therapies and personalized medicine, for the benefit of patients. Current management options and present and future perspectives in this still evolving field are summarized.

### ISTH guidelines for the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^116adeDq]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite an increase in our understandings of pathogenesis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), the approaches for initial diagnosis and management of TTP vary significantly.

Objective

The evidence-based guidelines of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about the initial diagnosis and management of acute TTP.

Methods

In June 2018, ISTH formed a multidisciplinary panel that included hematologists, an intensive care physician, nephrologist, clinical pathologist, biostatistician, and patient representatives, as well as a methodology team from McMaster University. The panel composition was designed to minimize the potential conflicts of interests. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome framework to develop and grade their recommendations. Public comments were sought and incorporated in the final document.

Results

The panel agreed on three recommendations covering the initial diagnosis with emphasis on the importance of ADAMTS13 testing (eg, activity, anti-ADAMTS13 IgG or inhibitor) and assessment of the pretest probability of TTP by clinical assessment and/or the risk assessment models like the PLASMIC or French score. The panel noted how availability and turnaround time of ADAMTS13 test results might affect early diagnosis and management, in particular the use of caplacizumab.

Conclusions

There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support strong recommendations for the initial diagnosis and management of a suspected TTP. The panel emphasized the importance of obtaining ADAMTS13 testing in a proper clinical context. Future research should focus on how to monitor and act on ADAMTS13 levels during remission.

FIGURE 1
A representation of current Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) epidemiology and its main mechanisms. (A) An overview of a population of 100 TTP patients and the likely distribution of the different types of TTP is shown (adapted from reference). (B) The multimeric size distribution of von Willebrand factor (VWF; adapted from reference). (C) Comparison between normal physiologic conditions of blood flow and TTP. The basic mechanisms of disease are shown, as well as the characteristic signs and symptoms. The relative sizes of ADAMTS13, autoantibodies, VWF multimers and blood cell components is not to scale. In physiologic conditions, functional ADAMTS13 (green ADAMTS13 molecules) cleaves [unusually large (UL)]‐VWF multimers that are secreted from endothelial cells and unravel under high shear stress conditions. In TTP, ADAMTS13 is not functional (activity < 10%) either due to mutations (yellow ADAMTS13 molecules)/lack of its secretion (cTTP), or because of autoantibodies that target functional ADAMTS13 and directly inhibit its activity and/or clear it from circulation (iTTP). In TTP, UL‐VWF multimers are not processed and this facilitates platelet recruitment and thrombosis within the circulation, as well as red‐blood‐cell damage (red blood cells get fragmented and will appear as schistocytes in a blood film)

A delay in the management of TTP worsens its prognosis. Several ADAMTS13 assays exist, and having the ADAMTS13 activity results early at presentation would allow a fast and effective distinction of TTP from another TMA. Since ADAMTS13 tests are not always directly available in all healthcare facilities, time lags usually existand therefore the initial diagnosis of TTP is frequently a clinical diagnosis. To assist the clinician in predicting the ADAMTS13 activity level, clinical score systems have been developed. Among the most popular are the French Score, set out by the French TMA Reference Center (CNR‐MAT), and more recently the PLASMIC Score. The difference between both scores is that the French Score presupposes that patients have a TMA with no associated condition. Clinical experience and awareness of TTP as a possible diagnosis is essential to prevent misdiagnosis, delayed treatment, and adverse outcomes owing to delayed treatment. This aspect is of particular importance at a time when new standards of care started early in the course of disease allow survival of virtually all patients.

Conclusion

With the advent of immunotherapy as a dominant modality in cancer treatment, it is essential for clinicians to be able to quickly identify and treat the common associated and rare immune related toxicities. This requires a high degree of clinical suspicion when addressing patient reported signs and symptoms.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^113s53AA]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare and life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and organ ischemia linked to disseminated microvascular platelet rich-thrombi. TTP is specifically related to a severe deficiency in ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13), the specific von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease. ADAMTS13 deficiency is most frequently acquired via ADAMTS13 autoantibodies, but rarely, it is inherited via mutations of the ADAMTS13 gene. The first acute episode of TTP usually occurs during adulthood, with a predominant anti-ADAMTS13 autoimmune etiology. In rare cases, however, TTP begins as soon as childhood, with frequent inherited forms. TTP is ∼2-fold more frequent in women, and its outcome is characterized by a relapsing tendency. Rapid recognition of TTP is crucial to initiate appropriate treatment. The first-line therapy for acute TTP is based on daily therapeutic plasma exchange supplying deficient ADAMTS13, with or without steroids. Additional immune modulators targeting ADAMTS13 autoantibodies are mainly based on steroids and the humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab. In refractory or unresponsive TTP, more intensive therapies including twice-daily plasma exchange; pulses of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, or cyclosporine A; or salvage splenectomy are considered. New drugs including N -acetylcysteine, bortezomib, recombinant ADAMTS13, and caplacizumab show promise in the management of TTP. Also, long-term follow-up of patients with TTP is crucial to identify the occurrence of other autoimmune diseases, to control relapses, and to evaluate psychophysical sequelae. Further development of both patients' registries worldwide and innovative drugs is still needed to improve TTP management.

### TTP: from empiricism for an enigmatic disease to targeted molecular therapies [^115W3VYh]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
The course of a patient with suspected/proven immune‐mediated Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (iTTP) in a hospital with optimal resources. Acute stage: if the patient suffers from a thrombotic microangiopathy without any apparent cause, a clinical score should be used to estimate ADAMTS13 levels and a citrated blood sample taken for actual ADAMTS13 activity assessment at the day of presentation (Day 0). The French Score takes into account thrombocytopenia and creatinine values, scoring +1 for each if present. A score of 2 indicates high probability of ADAMTS13 < 10%. In this case, a triplet regimen with daily PEX + steroids and daily caplacizumab is instated. If the clinical score is 1, TTP should still be suspected and PEX + steroids and daily caplacizumab should be initiated and kept until the ADAMTS13 activity test results from Day 0 arrive. If ADAMTS13 ≥ 10%, this is suggestive of an alternative diagnosis. If ADAMTS13 < 10%, the diagnosis of iTTP is confirmed, and rituximab is added (usually by day 4 following PEX initiation). This regimen is kept until a clinical response ensues for two days, at which point PEX is stopped, but the remaining therapies continue, with weekly assessments of ADAMTS13 activity. Caplacizumab may be stopped once adequate ADAMTS13 responses are achieved (> 20% or > 10%). Long‐term follow‐up: the focus shifts to preventing relapses and long‐term morbidity, with periodic assessments of ADAMTS13 activity (typically every three months, with pre‐emptive treatment if needed), and yearly assessments to control cardiovascular risk factors, assessment of neuropsychiatric disorders and improvement of quality of life as well as other specific assessments (e.g. pregnancy planning in the case of female patients of childbearing age)

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, more specifically with respect to ADAMTS13 activity and anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, ISTH 2020 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining plasma ADAMTS13 testing (such as ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitors or anti-ADAMTS13 IgG) before initiating therapeutic plasma exchange or any blood product in patients with a high (≥ 90% pretest probability), intermediate or low clinical suspicion of immune-mediated TTP (based on a clinical assessment or a formal clinical risk assessment method) in settings with timely access to plasma ADAMTS13 activity testing.

### Diagnostic uncertainty presented barriers to the timely management of acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in the United Kingdom between 2014 and 2019 [^1179TNHy]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening emergency and plasma exchange (PEX) is the initial treatment shown to reduce acute mortality.

Objectives

To compare current practice in the United Kingdom (UK) against the standards set out in the 2012 British Society of Haematology guideline, and to better understand the issues affecting prompt initiation of PEX.

Patients/Methods

The trainee research network HaemSTAR conducted a retrospective nationwide review of adults presenting to UK hospitals with a first episode of acute TTP.

Results

Data on 148 patients treated at 80 UK hospitals between 2014 and 2019 demonstrated that 64.8% of patients received PEX within 24 h. Diagnostic uncertainty was the most commonly cited reason for delayed treatment. Conversely, a shorter time to PEX occurred in patients who had red cell fragments or severe thrombocytopenia identified on their first complete blood count. Availability of on-site PEX was associated with a greater proportion of patients receiving PEX within 8 h compared to patients transferred, but by 24 h there was no difference between the two groups and two-thirds of all patients had received their first PEX. The mortality rate for patients that received PEX was 9.2%, with 27.8% of deaths linked to delayed treatment initiation.

Conclusions

This is the first multi-center evaluation of treatment delays in acute TTP and it will inform targeted pathways to improve prompt access to life-saving intervention.

### How I treat thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome [^112N32Vb]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

The last 10 years has been associated with a paradigm shift in our understanding, diagnosis, treatment and continuing clinical and basic research into Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) and other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). Here we will concentrate specifically on TTP and aHUS, which, for many years were considered to be the same disease, but it is now clear that their pathophysiology and therapies are quite distinct. TTP results from a deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), a serine metalloprotease required for the cleavage of von Willebrand factor (VWF). In the majority of cases, the low ADAMTS13 levels are due to Anti‐ADAMTS13 autoantibodies and an underlying disturbance in immune function. aHUS is the consequence of dysregulation of the complement system associated with gain‐ or loss‐of‐function mutations causing excessive complement activation.

However, in both disorders, further environmental and possible genetic triggers will be needed for disease presentation.

### A proposal: the need for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura specialist centres – providing better outcomes [^1111CsZn]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is heralded by its demanding presentation and impending mortality. The complex and life-threatening characteristics of TTP justify the need for early referral and responsive management in centres with comprehensive multi-disciplinary resources. In an era where compromise of patient safety or experience is unsatisfactory, the provision of specialist-led, organized care for this patient group remains overdue. Patients and clinical teams continue to lack the knowledge, support and resources required to achieve consistently high levels of clinical care. This forms the rationale for development of TTP Specialist Centres. In this article we focus on what we believe to be the recognized and potential merits of a specialist service provision, highlighting individual components of a high level of integrated expertise. The challenges in managing the condition from acute diagnosis to long-term care are described alongside defining key standards that represent excellence in patient care. The emphasis will be on understanding how the evolution of TTP Specialist Centres diverges from an ad hoc approach to managing this vulnerable patient group and offers promise in the translation to improved patient outcomes.

### The international hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura registry: key findings at enrollment until 2017 [^115KaCV8]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary or congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP; also known as Upshaw-Schulman syndrome; OMIM: 274150) is an autosomal recessive inherited thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which can manifest with acute life-threatening disease episodes and frequent relapses. - The underlying pathophysiology is an absent or severely reduced activity of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13) caused by bi-allelic mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene. - In the absence of functional ADAMTS13, large von Willebrand factor multimeric strings are not cleaved into normal-sized ones. As a result, platelets adhere to these unusually large, extremely adhesive multimers leading to occlusive microvascular thrombosis. The clinical manifestations of acute TTP include the concomitant occurrence of often severe thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and a variable degree of ischemic organ damage, particularly affecting the brain, heart and kidneys. If left untreated, mortality exceeds 90%.

### Consensus on the standardization of terminology in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and related thrombotic microangiopathies [^116XFCCU]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials An international collaboration provides a consensus for clinical definitions. This concerns thrombotic microangiopathies and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The consensus defines diagnosis, disease monitoring and response to treatment. Requirements for ADAMTS-13 are given.

Summary

Background Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) are two important acute conditions to diagnose. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a broad pathophysiologic process that leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, and involves capillary and small-vessel platelet aggregates. The most common cause is disseminated intravascular coagulation, which may be differentiated by abnormal coagulation. Clinically, a number of conditions present with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, including cancer, infection, transplantation, drug use, autoimmune disease, and pre-eclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome in pregnancy. Despite overlapping clinical presentations, TTP and HUS have distinct pathophysiologies and treatment pathways. Objectives To present a consensus document from an International Working Group on TTP and associated thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). Methods The International Working Group has proposed definitions and terminology based on published information and consensus-based recommendations. Conclusion The consensus aims to aid clinical decisions, but also future studies and trials, utilizing standardized definitions. It presents a classification of the causes of TMA, and criteria for clinical response, remission and relapse of congenital and immune-mediated TTP.

### Role of ADAMTS13 in the management of thrombotic microangiopathies including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) [^1154mCCY]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) and other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) can often be similar. The role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) in diagnosing TTP is accepted by most researchers but continues to be debated in a few studies. We report the experience of our single-centre academic institution, where ADAMTS13 is used to diagnose TTP and guide plasma exchange (PLEX). Patients presenting to our institution with thrombotic microangiopathy (60 patients) between January 2006 and December 2012 were divided into two groups based on ADAMTS13 activity and clinical history. Patients with ADAMTS13 activity < 10% were included in the TTP (n = 30) cohort while patients with activity > 11% were classified as 'other microangiopathies' (TMA, n = 30). PLEX was only initiated in patients with a high likelihood of TTP and discontinued when the baseline ADAMTS13 activity was > 11%. Patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (TTP group) showed significant presenting differences: lower platelet counts, less renal dysfunction, higher presence of neurological abnormalities, and greater haemolysis markers as compared to non-deficient patients (TMA group). Most importantly, patients without severe ADAMTS13 deficiency were safely managed without increased mortality despite receiving no PLEX or discontinuing PLEX after a short course (upon availability of ADAMTS13 results). In conclusion, ADAMTS13 can be used to diagnose TTP and guide appropriate PLEX therapy.

### The third form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura shows up again: what is it, does it even exist, how to find out? Comment on "Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura without detectable Anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies: a possible underlying autoimmune mechanism" and on "The different faces of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura" [^116y9ZhQ]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Is there a third form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura?

In 2016, Mariotte and colleagues published a large cross-sectional study on behalf of the French CNR-MAT on more than 900 adult patients hospitalized in the years 1999 to 2013 for a first bout of acute TMA associated with severely decreased functional activity of ADAMTS13. From 772 patients clinical and laboratory data at admission, before starting plasma therapy, were available: 378 patients had idiopathic TTP without an accompanying clinical condition and 394 had non-idiopathic TTP, i.e. TTP with a concomitant disorder, such as an infection, autoimmune disease, pregnancy, cancer, organ transplantation, and certain drugs. Pathophysiologically, 585/772 (75%) were diagnosed as iTTP, 21/772 (3%) had cTTP, and 166/772 (22%) received a diagnosis of acquired TTP of unknown cause (uTTP). The pathophysiological diagnosis of iTTP in 75% of the patients was based on the detection of free anti-ADAMTS13 IgG antibodies in the plasma, cTTP in 3% was established based on lacking anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies and biallelic ADAMTS13 genetic variants, whereas uTTP in 22% of the cohort was diagnosed in those with acquired severe ADAMTS13 deficiency without detectable anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies. Of note, most cases with an idiopathic TTP presentation had iTTP (345/378, 91%) whereas among the cases of non-idiopathic acquired TTP only 240/373 (64%) had iTTP and 133/373 had uTTP. Thus, the diagnosis of uTTP was made predominantly in cases of non-idiopathic TTP and was associated with sepsis, cancer, infection with human immunodeficiency virus, transplantation and other conditions.

### ISTH guidelines for treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^114TCXSb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite advances in treatment options for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), there are still limited high quality data to inform clinicians regarding its appropriate treatment.

Methods

In June 2018, the ISTH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel to issue recommendations about treatment of TTP. The panel discussed 12 treatment questions related to immune-mediated TTP (iTTP) and hereditary or congenital TTP (cTTP). The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, including evidence-to-decision frameworks, to appraise evidence and formulate recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 11 recommendations based on evidence ranging from very low to moderate certainty. For first acute episode and relapses of iTTP, the panel made a strong recommendation for adding corticosteroids to therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and a conditional recommendation for adding rituximab and caplacizumab. For asymptomatic iTTP with low plasma ADAMTS13 activity, the panel made a conditional recommendation for the use of rituximab outside of pregnancy, but prophylactic TPE during pregnancy. For asymptomatic cTTP, the panel made a strong recommendation for prophylactic plasma infusion during pregnancy, and a conditional recommendation for plasma infusion or a wait and watch approach outside of pregnancy.

Conclusions

The panel's recommendations are based on all the available evidence for the effects of an individual component of various treatment approaches, including suppressing inflammation, blocking platelet clumping, replacing the missing and/or inhibited ADAMTS13, and suppressing the formation of ADAMTS13 autoantibody. There was insufficient evidence for further comparing different treatment approaches (eg, TPE, corticosteroids, rituximab, and caplacizumab, etc.), for which high quality studies are needed.
