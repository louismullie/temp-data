## Question

Can Zoloft be taken with Prilosec?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Zoloft (sertraline) can be taken with Prilosec (omeprazole). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and metabolic pathways of sertraline. Then, I should verify omeprazole's enzyme effects, especially CYP2C19 inhibition. Next, I will check whether there is a documented interaction and its clinical significance. After that, I should review safety considerations and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and note any exceptions or dose adjustments needed.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology of sertraline. Sertraline is extensively metabolized, with N-demethylation as a principal route and CYP2C19 contributing meaningfully to its clearance; poor CYP2C19 metabolizers have higher exposure and longer half-life, which establishes a plausible mechanism for CYP2C19-mediated interactions [^e37cce47] [^52acbf4a].

> Now, I need to check omeprazole's enzyme effects. Omeprazole is a known inhibitor of CYP2C19, and this property is well documented across multiple labels and studies, including effects on other CYP2C19 substrates like cilostazol, which consistently show increased exposure when coadministered with omeprazole or esomeprazole [^ac5f629e] [^47141271].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether there is a direct sertraline–omeprazole interaction signal. DrugBank explicitly notes that omeprazole can decrease the metabolism of sertraline, which supports a pharmacokinetic interaction via CYP2C19 inhibition increasing sertraline levels, although the magnitude varies with CYP2C19 phenotype and dose [^b1c9d008].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical significance. Unlike citalopram, where omeprazole produces large, clinically important increases in exposure and has been linked to QT prolongation and arrhythmia risk, sertraline's interaction with omeprazole is generally modest and less likely to cause torsades or major cardiotoxicity; nonetheless, higher sertraline levels can theoretically increase SSRI-related adverse effects such as nausea, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and serotonin syndrome risk in susceptible patients [^14487cd0] [^7c275e21] [^73abb3d3].

> I should double-check whether any authoritative labeling or guidelines mandate a dose change. The FDA sertraline labeling does not list omeprazole as a contraindication or require a specific dose adjustment, and it emphasizes monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions rather than automatic dose reduction; this aligns with a cautious but permissive stance in routine practice [^notfound].

> Next, I should review practical monitoring and risk mitigation. Let me consider patient-specific factors: CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status, higher sertraline doses, older age, hepatic impairment, or concomitant serotonergic drugs increase the chance of clinically meaningful effects; if coadministration is necessary, I would monitor for SSRI adverse effects, consider starting at the low end of the sertraline dose range, and titrate slowly, watching for tolerability and efficacy changes after adding omeprazole [^52acbf4a] [^d2abe4d2] [^7c275e21].

> But wait, what if the patient is on other CYP2C19 substrates or has complex polypharmacy? I need to ensure we also screen for additional CYP2C19 interactions and cumulative serotonergic burden, and I should remember that while pantoprazole or rabeprazole have less CYP2C19 inhibition and may be reasonable alternatives when interactions are a concern, switching should be individualized to the acid-suppression indication and response [^c3f21980] [^8522ee2b].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, Zoloft (sertraline) can generally be taken with Prilosec (omeprazole), but omeprazole may modestly increase sertraline exposure via CYP2C19 inhibition; no automatic dose change is mandated, but I would start low, go slow, and monitor for increased SSRI adverse effects, especially in poor metabolizers or those at higher risk, adjusting the sertraline dose if tolerability or safety concerns arise [^b1c9d008] [^e37cce47] [^d2abe4d2].

---

Zoloft (sertraline) and Prilosec (omeprazole) can be taken together, but **omeprazole may increase sertraline levels** by inhibiting CYP2C19, which can raise the risk of sertraline-related side effects such as nausea, insomnia, and serotonin syndrome [^b1c9d008] [^7c275e21]. No **routine dose adjustment** is required, but monitor for increased sertraline effects — especially at higher sertraline doses or in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers [^52acbf4a]. If side effects emerge, consider lowering the sertraline dose or switching to a PPI with less CYP2C19 inhibition (e.g. pantoprazole) [^8522ee2b]. No clinically significant interaction has been observed in ramelteon studies with sertraline and omeprazole, but vigilance remains prudent [^20fb767b].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms of interaction

Sertraline is metabolized primarily by **CYP2C19 and CYP2D6**, with CYP2C19 contributing substantially to its N-demethylation to desmethylsertraline [^e37cce47] [^52acbf4a]. Omeprazole is a **potent CYP2C19 inhibitor** [^ac5f629e]; thus, coadministration can reduce sertraline clearance and increase its plasma concentration, potentially enhancing therapeutic and adverse effects [^b1c9d008].

---

## Clinical evidence of interaction

Clinical data directly evaluating sertraline–omeprazole coadministration are limited; however, pharmacokinetic studies and case reports indicate that **omeprazole can increase sertraline exposure**. A study in healthy volunteers showed that CYP2C19 poor metabolizers had significantly higher sertraline exposure and longer half-life than extensive metabolizers, underscoring CYP2C19's role in sertraline metabolism [^52acbf4a]. Case reports describe **serotonin syndrome** and increased sertraline toxicity when sertraline is combined with CYP2C19 inhibitors, including omeprazole [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and risk assessment

The interaction is **generally moderate** in clinical significance. The risk of clinically meaningful effects depends on sertraline dose, treatment duration, and individual CYP2C19 phenotype [^52acbf4a]. Poor metabolizers are at higher risk of elevated sertraline levels and adverse effects. Common adverse effects of elevated sertraline levels include:

- Nausea
- Insomnia
- Dizziness
- Serotonin syndrome (rare but serious) [^7c275e21]

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Currently, there are **no definitive clinical guidelines** specifically addressing sertraline–omeprazole coadministration. General principles include:

- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Watch for increased sertraline-related side effects, especially after starting or adjusting omeprazole [^notfound].
- **Dose adjustment**: Consider reducing sertraline dose if significant adverse effects occur.
- **Alternative PPIs**: If interaction is problematic, consider switching to a PPI with less CYP2C19 inhibition (e.g. pantoprazole) [^8522ee2b].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing interaction risk

Several factors influence the **risk and severity** of this interaction:

| **Factor** | **Influence on interaction risk** |
|-|-|
| CYP2C19 phenotype | Poor metabolizers have significantly higher sertraline exposure [^52acbf4a] |
| Sertraline dose | Higher doses increase risk of adverse effects |
| Age | Elderly patients may have increased susceptibility to adverse effects |
| Comorbidities | Hepatic impairment, cardiovascular disease, and psychiatric comorbidities may increase risk |

---

## Clinical management strategies

When coadministering sertraline and omeprazole, clinicians should consider the following strategies:

- **Baseline assessment**: Document baseline symptoms and sertraline tolerance.
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess for adverse effects, particularly after starting or adjusting omeprazole.
- **Patient education**: Inform patients about potential side effects and when to seek medical attention.
- **Alternative therapies**: Consider alternative PPIs or antidepressants if significant interactions occur [^8522ee2b].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Study type** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Pharmacokinetic studies | CYP2C19 inhibition increases sertraline exposure [^52acbf4a] |
| Case reports | Serotonin syndrome and increased sertraline toxicity reported |
| Clinical guidelines | No definitive guidelines; general monitoring and dose adjustment recommended |

---

Sertraline and omeprazole can be coadministered with caution, as omeprazole may increase sertraline levels and adverse effects. No **routine dose adjustment** is required, but monitor for increased sertraline effects — especially in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers or at higher sertraline doses — and adjust therapy as needed [^b1c9d008].

10 OVERDOSAGE

Reports have been received of overdosage with omeprazole in humans. Doses ranged up to 2400 mg (120 times the usual recommended clinical dose). Manifestations were variable, but included confusion, drowsiness, blurred vision, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, flushing, headache, dry mouth, and other adverse reactions similar to those seen in normal clinical experience [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Symptoms were transient, and no serious clinical outcome has been reported when PRILOSEC was taken alone. No specific antidote for omeprazole overdosage is known. Omeprazole is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not readily dialyzable. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.

If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage.

Absorption

Following oral once-daily ZOLOFT dosing over the range of 50 to 200 mg for 14 days, mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of sertraline occurred between 4.5 to 8.4 hours post-dosing. The average terminal elimination half-life of plasma sertraline is about 26 hours. Consistent with the terminal elimination half-life, there is an approximately two-fold accumulation up to steady-state concentrations, which are achieved after one week of once-daily dosing. Linear dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were demonstrated in a single dose study in which the Cmaxand area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of sertraline were proportional to dose over a range of 50 to 200 mg. The single dose bioavailability of ZOLOFT tablets is approximately equal to an equivalent dose of ZOLOFT oral solution. Administration with food causes a small increase in Cmaxand AUC.

Metabolism

Sertraline undergoes extensive first pass metabolism. The principal initial pathway of metabolism for sertraline is N‑demethylation. N‑desmethylsertraline has a plasma terminal elimination half‑life of 62 to 104 hours. Both in vitro biochemical and in vivo pharmacological testing have shown N‑desmethylsertraline to be substantially less active than sertraline. Both sertraline and N‑desmethylsertraline undergo oxidative deamination and subsequent reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation. In a study of radiolabeled sertraline involving two healthy male subjects, sertraline accounted for less than 5% of the plasma radioactivity. About 40‑45% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine in 9 days. Unchanged sertraline was not detectable in the urine. For the same period, about 40‑45% of the administered radioactivity was accounted for in feces, including 12‑14% unchanged sertraline.

Desmethylsertraline exhibits time‑related, dose dependent increases in AUC (0‑24-hour), Cmaxand Cmin, with about a 5‑ to 9-fold increase in these pharmacokinetic parameters between day 1 and day 14.

Protein Binding

In vitro protein binding studies performed with radiolabeled 3H-sertraline showed that sertraline is highly bound to serum proteins (98%) in the range of 20 to 500 ng/mL. However, at up to 300 and 200 ng/mL concentrations, respectively, sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline did not alter the plasma protein binding of two other highly protein bound drugs, warfarin and propranolol.

2.1	Dosage in Patients with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, and SAD

The recommended initial dosage and maximum ZOLOFT dosage in patients with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, and SAD are displayed in Table 1 below. A dosage of 25 mg or 50 mg per day is the initial therapeutic dosage.

For adults and pediatric patients, subsequent dosages may be increased in case of an inadequate response in 25 to 50 mg per day increments once a week, depending on tolerability, up to a maximum of 200 mg per day. Given the 24-hour elimination half-life of ZOLOFT, the recommended interval between dose changes is one week.

2.2	Dosage in Patients with PMDD

The recommended starting ZOLOFT dosage in adult women with PMDD is 50 mg per day. ZOLOFT may be administered either continuously (every day throughout the menstrual cycle) or intermittently (only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, i.e., starting the daily dosage 14 days prior to the anticipated onset of menstruation and continuing through the onset of menses). Intermittent dosing would be repeated with each new cycle.

When dosing continuously, patients not responding to a 50 mg dosage may benefit from dosage increases at 50 mg increments per menstrual cycle up to 150 mg per day.
When dosing intermittently, patients not responding to a 50 mg dosage may benefit from increasing the dosage up to a maximum of 100 mg per day during the next menstrual cycle (and subsequent cycles) as follows: 50 mg per day during the first 3 days of dosing followed by 100 mg per day during the remaining days in the dosing cycle.

2.3	Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting ZOLOFT

Prior to initiating treatment with ZOLOFT or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] .

2.4	Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Both the recommended starting dosage and therapeutic range in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh scores 5 or 6) are half the recommended daily dosage [See Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)] . The use of ZOLOFT in patients with moderate (Child Pugh scores 7 to 9) or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh scores 10-15) is not recommended [See Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Renal Impairment

Sertraline is extensively metabolized and excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. In volunteers with mild to moderate (CLcr=30-60 mL/min), moderate to severe (CLcr=10-29 mL/min) or severe (receiving hemodialysis) renal impairment (N=10 each group), the pharmacokinetics and protein binding of 200 mg sertraline per day maintained for 21 days were not altered compared to age-matched volunteers (N=12) with no renal impairment. Thus sertraline multiple dose pharmacokinetics appear to be unaffected by renal impairment [See Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] .

Pimozide

In a controlled study of a single dose (2 mg) of pimozide, 200 mg ZOLOFT (once daily) co-administration to steady state was associated with a mean increase in pimozide AUC and Cmaxof about 40%, but was not associated with any changes in ECG. The highest recommended pimozide dose (10 mg) has not been evaluated in combination with ZOLOFT. The effect on QTc interval and PK parameters at doses higher than 2 mg of pimozide are not known [See Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6

Many antidepressant drugs (e.g., SSRIs, including ZOLOFT, and most tricyclic antidepressant drugs) inhibit the biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme CYP2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase), and, thus, may increase the plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. The drugs for which this potential interaction is of greatest concern are those metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., tricyclic antidepressant drugs and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). The extent to which this interaction is an important clinical problem depends on the extent of the inhibition of CYP2D6 by the antidepressant and the therapeutic index of the co-administered drug. There is variability among the drugs effective in the treatment of MDD in the extent of clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and in fact ZOLOFT at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class. Nevertheless, even ZOLOFT has the potential for clinically important 2D6 inhibition [See Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

Phenytoin

Clinical trial data suggested that ZOLOFT may increase phenytoin concentrations [See Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

### Ramelteon (rozerem) [^20fb767b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Donepezil

Administration of donepezil 10 mg once daily for 26 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 100% in overall exposure to ramelteon, (AUC0-inf) and a mean increase of approximately 87% in maximum exposure to ramelteon (Cmax) after a single 8 mg dose of ROZEREM. No change was seen in M-II exposure. Patients should be closely monitored when ROZEREM is coadministered with donepezil [see Drug Interactions (7)] .

Doxepin

Administration of doxepin 10 mg once daily for 23 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 66% in overall exposure to ramelteon, (AUC0-inf) and a mean increase of approximately 69% in maximum exposure to ramelteon (Cmax) after a single 8 mg dose of ROZEREM. No change was seen in M-II exposure. Patients should be closely monitored when ROZEREM is coadministered with doxepin [see Drug Interactions (7)] .

Interaction studies of concomitant administration of ROZEREM with fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), omeprazole (CYP1A2 inducer/CYP2C19 inhibitor), theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), sertraline, venlafaxine, escitalopram, gabapentin, and zolpidem did not produce clinically meaningful changes in either peak or total exposures to ramelteon or the M-II metabolite.

Effects of ROZEREM on Metabolism of Other Drugs

Zolpidem

Administration of ramelteon 8 mg once daily for 11 days resulted in an increase in median Tmaxof zolpidem by approximately 20 minutes and exposure to zolpidem (both AUC0-infand Cmax) was unchanged after a single 10 mg dose of zolpidem. Ordinarily zolpidem should not be given in a patient taking ROZEREM.

### Cardiovascular outcomes associated with clinical use of citalopram and omeprazole: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^127532f5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Depression is a widespread disease, especially among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), and has been identified as an independent risk factor for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and CHD‐related mortality. 1, 2 Antidepressants are among the most commonly prescribed classes of medication. 3 However, tricyclic antidepressants have previously been associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction owing to possible cardiotoxic properties. 4, 5 By contrast, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are considered relatively safe, which is why tricyclic antidepressants have been largely replaced by SSRI antidepressants for treatment of depression. 6 Among SSRIs, citalopram is one of the most frequently used SSRIs, its affinity with the 5‐HT receptor has the strongest drug receptor interactions in the same pharmacological class. 7, 8 However, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about citalopram (>40 mg/daily) and risk of prolonged QT interval and torsade de pointes as a consequence of the findings made in a thorough QT study and in postmarketing surveillance. 9 Notably, the warning issued by the agency about the citalopram has raised concerns about the safety of SSRI antidepressants.

From pharmacokinetic viewpoints, it is known that citalopram is metabolized in the liver mostly by the hepatic cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) isoenzyme, but also by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. 10 Polymorphisms of the CYP2C19 has been classified into 3 genotype groups: the rapid extensive metabolizer group, the intermediate metabolizer group, and the poor metabolizer group. The average percentage of poor metabolizer subjects was 2% to 4.8% worldwide, except for a markedly greater prevalence of up to 22.5% among East Asians. 10 Several studies showed that the plasma concentration of citalopram is affected by CYP2C19 variants. Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 had a reduced clearance of citalopram. 11 Patients with ultrarapid CYP2C19 alleles had a lower serum concentration of S‐citalopram. 12 There is evidence that the CYP2D6 poor metabolizer genotype in combination with CYP2C19 poor metabolizer genotype can increase citalopram half‐life. 13 As a result, the pharmacokinetics of citalopram is affected by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genotypes.

### What you need to know when you prescribe a proton pump inhibitor [^48d4c38a]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Ever since they were launched, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been regarded as profligate prescription interventions and have become a favourite target for pharmacy advisers. Now that they are cheap, with generic omeprazole 20 mg daily costing £1.88 per month (£24.51 per annum) in the UK, it is time to ask whether this status should be reviewed, whether there are areas where the message should be reversed and whether there are any circumstances in which the extra cost of branded PPIs or combined preparations is justified. Equally, with the recognition of an extended toxicity profile, is prescribing profligacy not an economic but a safety issue?

Regarding the use of sertraline hydrochloride PO (also known as Zoloft, Zoloft) in pregnant patients for third trimester: consider safer alternatives. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for direct toxic effects of the drug, serotonin syndrome and discontinuation syndrome. The use of SSRIs in late pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, and symptoms of poor adaptation in the neonate. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends SSRIs as first-line pharmacotherapy for perinatal depression and anxiety, with sertraline being a reasonable first-line option. The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments recommends sertraline as a second-line option for major depressive disorder during pregnancy. The drug sertraline hydrochloride PO (also known as Zoloft, Zoloft) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations.

### Specific SSRIs and birth defects: Bayesian analysis to interpret new data in the context of previous reports [^f26a6343]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

SSRI use

During the interview for the NBDPS, no specific question addressed depression. Mothers were asked if they had any illnesses other than the ones already discussed (for example, hypertension or diabetes) and whether they took any medication for the illness. Women could report depression here, which would then be followed by a question about any medications taken for the illness. There were also specific medication related questions: “between three months before conception and [the baby’s] date of birth, did you take any of the following medications? Prozac? Paxil? Zoloft? Celexa?” There was no specific question for Lexapro. For this analysis, we considered women exposed if they reported taking citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), or sertraline (Zoloft) at least once in the period from one month before conception through the third month of pregnancy. Women who reported taking more than one type of SSRI were only included in the multiple SSRI category. We considered women as unexposed if they did not take any antidepressants in the period from three months before to the end of the pregnancy and did not report any depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or obsessive compulsive disorder. Women who did not answer all medication related questions, used SSRIs in a period other than the period of interest, or took antidepressants other than SSRIs (for example, bupropion and venlafaxine) were excluded.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate? [^0a05be8d]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Use of PPIs

Coincident with PPI usage, the literature surrounding PPI safety and efficacy is growing exponentially, making it difficult to delineate an evidence-based guideline on their use. In the study by Scarpignato et al. committees on behalf of three Italian scientific societies collaborated with impressive panels of expert international reviewers to address 13 clinical scenarios in which uncertainty exists about how to prescribe PPIs and where drug misuse is common. They performed a systematic literature review inclusive of almost 500 papers and present a narrative review of the safety and appropriateness of PPI therapy in each scenario. Table 1 summarizes the key messages regarding appropriate PPI use in the 13 scenarios, organized into those appropriate for long-term or short-term PPI use, or not at all. Examining this compendium, one is immediately struck by the fact that the table includes many usages for which there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications. Apparently, the world literature provides ample evidence for the efficacy of PPIs outside of FDA indications.

### Proton pump inhibitors and their drug interactions: an evidence-based approach [^b4377ba3]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective antisecretory agents used to treat acid-related disorders. As such, they are frequently prescribed for patients who are concurrently using other medications. PPIs may interact with other drugs through numerous mechanisms. The most important include competitive inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and alteration of the absorption of other drugs via changes in gastric pH levels. Poor metabolizers, who lack CYP2C19, may be particularly predisposed to drug interactions. Although the potential for drug interactions is high, few clinically significant interactions have been reported for the PPIs. Nevertheless, caution is indicated when certain drugs are co-prescribed with these agents. The incidence of clinically significant drug interactions increases proportionately with the number of drugs taken and with the age of the patient. The drug interaction with the greatest clinical importance is the reduction in benzodiazepine clearance by omeprazole.

### Esomeprazole strontium [^47141271]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Omeprazole acts as an inhibitor of CYP2C19. Omeprazole, given in doses of 40 mg daily for one week to 20 healthy subjects in cross-over study, increased Cmaxand AUC of cilostazol by 18% and 26% respectively. Cmaxand AUC of one of its active metabolites, 3,4-dihydrocilostazol, which has 4- 7 times the activity of cilostazol, were increased by 29% and 69% respectively. Coadministration of cilostazol with esomeprazole is expected to increase concentrations of cilostazol and its above mentioned active metabolite. Therefore a dose reduction of cilostazol from 100 mg twice daily to 50 mg twice daily should be considered.

Concomitant administration of esomeprazole and a combined inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, such as voriconazole, may result in more than doubling of the esomeprazole exposure. Dose adjustment of esomeprazole is not normally required. However, in patients with Zollinger-Ellison’s Syndrome, who may require higher doses up to 240 mg/day, dose adjustment may be considered.

Drugs known to induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 or both (such as rifampin) may lead to decreased esomeprazole serum levels. Omeprazole, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer, has been reported to interact with St. John’s Wort, an inducer of CYP3A4. In a cross-over study in 12 healthy male subjects, St. John’s Wort (300 mg three times daily for 14 days) significantly decreased the systemic exposure of omeprazole in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers (Cmaxand AUC decreased by 37.5% and 37.9%, respectively) and extensive metabolisers (Cmaxand AUC decreased by 49.6 % and 43.9%, respectively). Avoid concomitant use of St. John’s Wort or rifampin with esomeprazole strontium.

7.4 Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors

Drug-induced decrease in gastric acidity results in enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased Chromogranin A levels, which may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.5 Tacrolimus

Concomitant administration of esomeprazole and tacrolimus may increase the serum levels of tacrolimus.

(Omeprazole, Clonazepam) is the most frequent DDI pair observed, by a large margin to the second (fifth,,). Omeprazole is used to treat acid reflux and other gastroesophageal problems, while Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine anti-epileptic. This prevalent dispensation requires particular attention to dosage since “Omeprazole may increase the pharmacological effect and serum levels of certain benzodiazepines via hepatic enzyme inhibition”. Similarly, (Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA), Glyburide) is the top ranked pair in Table 2 and very frequently dispensed (1st,,). This pair is especially problematic for diabetic patients since “the salicylate increases the effect of sulfonylurea;” It causes hypoglycemia by enhancing insulin sensitivity, particularly in patients with advanced age and/or renal impairment.

Major DDI pairs represent 22.5% of all observed DDI administrations per Table 1. The top 20 major DDI pairs are listed in Supplementary Table 11 and include:
(Diltiazem, Simvastatin), sixth,,, where “Diltiazem increases the effect and toxicity of simvastatin” possibly causing liver damage as a side effect.
(Fluoxetine, Amitriptyline), seventh,,, where “Fluoxetine increases the effect and toxicity of tricyclics”.The same ADR affects (Fluoxetine, Imipramine), 23rd,, and (Fluoxetine, Nortriptyline), thirty-third,.
(ASA, Ibuprofen), eighth,,, where “Ibuprofen reduces ASA cardioprotective effects”. In 2015 the European Medicines Agency issued an updated advice that occasional use of Ibuprofen should not affect the benefits of low-dose ASA.Our analysis shows that patients were dispensed this pair concomitantly on average for 53 days (±74 s.d.), conflicting with occasional use. However, since these are common medications we cannot rule out the possibility they were dispensed to be taken as needed.
(Fluoxetine, Lithium), seventeenth,,), where “the SSRI increases serum levels of lithium” potentiating the risk of serotonin syndrome, which is rare but serious and potentially fatal.
(Fluconazole, Simvastatin), nineteenth,,), which leads to “increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis”. Also from the azole class, Ketoconazole and Itraconazole are considered potent inhibitors generally causing less clinically significant interactions with Simvastatin than Fluconazole.Both substitutes are available free of charge in the public health care system.

### Brexpiprazole in combination with sertraline and as monotherapy in posttraumatic stress disorder: a full-factorial randomized clinical trial [^507d615a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective: To investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brexpiprazole in combination with sertraline and as monotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Methods: The trial comprised a 1-week placebo run-in period followed by an 11-week, randomized, double-blind, active-referenced, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm treatment period (with 14-day follow-up). The trial ran from January 2017-November 2018 at 48 clinical trial sites in the United States. Adult outpatients with PTSD ( DSM-5 ) were randomized (1:1:1:1) to oral brexpiprazole + sertraline, brexpiprazole + placebo, sertraline + placebo, or placebo + placebo. Doses were flexible (brexpiprazole 1-3 mg/d; sertraline 100-200 mg/d). The primary endpoint was change in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) total score from randomization (Week 1) to Week 10. Safety assessments included adverse events.

Results: Among 321 randomized participants, completion rates were 58/82 (70.7%) for brexpiprazole + sertraline, 50/75 (66.7%) for brexpiprazole +placebo, 59/81 (72.8%) for sertraline + placebo, and 64/83 (77.1%) for placebo+placebo. At Week 10, brexpiprazole + sertraline demonstrated greater improvement in CAPS-5 total score (randomization, 35.7; least-squares [LS] mean change, -16.4; n = 77) vs sertraline + placebo (randomization, 36.5; LS mean change, -11.4; n = 75) with LS mean difference, -5.08 (95% CI, -8.96 to -1.20; P= .011), and also vs brexpiprazole + placebo and vs placebo+ placebo.

Brexpiprazole + placebo and sertraline + placebo did not differ from placebo + placebo. Treatment emergent adverse events with incidence ≥10% were weight increased (12.5%) and somnolence (10.0%) for brexpiprazole + sertraline, akathisia (13.3%) for brexpiprazole + placebo, and nausea (20.3%) and dry mouth (12.7%) for sertraline + placebo.

Conclusions: Brexpiprazole in combination with sertraline (but not as monotherapy) has potential to be a new efficacious treatment for PTSD, with a safety profile consistent with brexpiprazole in approved indications.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Advise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

Serotonin Syndrome

Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of Sertraline HCl Capsules with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John’s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

Increased Risk of Bleeding

Inform patients about the concomitant use of Sertraline HCl Capsules with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the-counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the all of Us research program [^517bb810]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Role of comorbidity and polypharmacy

To control for potential confounding due to comorbidity and commonly used hemodynamic‐altering medications within the older adult population, we performed multivariable regression analyses with additional covariates including the presence of diabetes and chronic heart failure, as well as interacting medications including hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, CCBs, β‐blockers, ACEi/ARBs, and atypical antipsychotics. After adjusting for these factors, the differential risks among investigated antidepressants and the reference drug omeprazole were almost unchanged (Figure S4B).

We then introduced interaction terms between investigated antidepressants and covariates (one in each model). None of the P ‐values reported in the interaction studies passed multiple‐comparison‐adjusted thresholds for significance. Here, we report positive interactions with agents with increased risks at nominal significance levels (P < 0.05). We observed that escitalopram had nominally significant interaction signals in participants who also took hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. interaction HR [HRi] = 1.46 [1.08–1.97], P = 0.015, compared with sertraline) or ACEi/ARBs (HRi = 1.37 [1.02–1.84], P = 0.037, compared with citalopram; Figure S5A,B). Fluoxetine appeared also to interact with older age (per decade), especially when compared with sertraline and citalopram (HRi = 1.15 [1.04–1.27], P = 0.006; Figure S5C,E). The interaction terms between all study drugs and diabetes were not statistically significant, while the only significant interaction with congestive heart failure was between venlafaxine and paroxetine (Figure S5D). Table S3 provides further details of potential interactions.

Comparisons between different SSRIs, SNRIs, and NRIs

The differential risks of hyponatremia for all study drugs are summarized in Figure 2 and the onset of hyponatremia is plotted as a function with time in Figure 3 and detailed in Table S1. Among the investigated drugs over the follow‐up, the order of risks for hyponatremia from high to low was: duloxetine (HR = 1.56, 95% confident interval [CI]: [1.38–1.76], compared with omeprazole, or 1.37 [1.19–1.58], compared with sertraline), escitalopram, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, bupropion (0.94 [0.84–1.06] compared with omeprazole or 0.83 [0.73–0.94] compared with sertraline), and paroxetine (0.86 [0.73–1.02] compared with omeprazole and 0.78 [0.65–0.93] compared with sertraline). Escitalopram had a higher risk of hyponatremia than citalopram (HR = 1.24 [1.07–1.44]). Results of the proportional hazard assumption tests are described in Supplementary Result S2, Figure S3, and Table S2. At the end of the first 3 years, the cumulative incidence for hyponatremia was 10.5% in the overall combined antidepressant arms, with highest in the duloxetine arm (14.3%) and lowest in the paroxetine (8.0%) or bupropion (8.7%) arms (Table 1).

### Esomeprazole magnesium (esomeprazole magnesium) [^ac5f629e]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Omeprazole acts as an inhibitor of CYP2C19. Omeprazole, given in doses of 40 mg daily for one week to 20 healthy subjects in cross-over study, increased Cmaxand AUC of cilostazol by 18% and 26% respectively. Cmaxand AUC of one of its active metabolites, 3,4-dihydrocilostazol, which has 4 to 7 times the activity of cilostazol, were increased by 29% and 69%, respectively. Co-administration of cilostazol with esomeprazole is expected to increase concentrations of cilostazol and its above mentioned active metabolite. Therefore, a dose reduction of cilostazol from 100 mg twice daily to 50 mg twice daily should be considered.

Concomitant administration of esomeprazole and a combined inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, such as voriconazole, may result in more than doubling of the esomeprazole exposure. Dose adjustment of esomeprazole is not normally required. However, in patients with Zollinger-Ellison's Syndrome, who may require higher doses up to 240 mg/day, dose adjustment may be considered.

Drugs known to induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 or both (such as rifampin) may lead to decreased esomeprazole serum levels. Omeprazole, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer, has been reported to interact with St. John's Wort, an inducer of CYP3A4. In a cross-over study in 12 healthy male subjects, St. John's Wort (300 mg three times daily for 14 days) significantly decreased the systemic exposure of omeprazole in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers (Cmaxand AUC decreased by 37.5% and 37.9%, respectively) and extensive metabolisers (Cmaxand AUC decreased by 49.6 % and 43.9%, respectively). Avoid concomitant use of St. John's Wort or rifampin with esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules.

7.4 Interactions With Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors

Drug-induced decrease in gastric acidity results in enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased Chromogranin A levels which may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.5 Tacrolimus

Concomitant administration of esomeprazole and tacrolimus may increase the serum levels of tacrolimus.

### Transient neonatal jitteriness due to maternal use of sertraline (zoloft) [^9925a42b]. Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

We describe the occurrence of marked jitteriness and an enhanced startle response in a term infant after being exposed to sertraline in utero. An umbilical cord blood sample taken at the time of birth showed a sertraline concentration (<10 ng/mL) below the reference range. On the third day during the peak of the symptoms, sertraline plasma concentration was <10 ng/mL, while his serotonin level (6 ng/mL) was below the reference range. The neurologic symptoms resolved by the fifth day. To date, there are no reports of transient neonatal jitteriness with maternal use of sertraline documented with low cord and neonatal plasma samples consistent with withdrawal syndrome.

### Proton pump inhibitors: the good, bad, and ugly [^419a151c]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) continue to be the medication of choice for treatment of acid-related disease, with few if any overt side effects seen with daily use. They are often prescribed empirically, often in high doses and with many patients being treated with multiple PPIs without an objective diagnosis. Therefore, they are believed to be overprescribed and used without indication. In this article we discuss the appropriate clinical indications for PPIs, review in detail the major associated adverse events, and put in perspective key issues in balancing benefits and risk of this exceptional (and safe) class of drug.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^73c266cc]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite PPIs carrying – like any other classes of drugs – some risks, they should not be denied to patients who are likely to benefit from them merely because of concerns about putative adverse effects. There is generally some equivalence between the acceptable burden of adverse effects and the severity of the illness being treated. However, patients with acid-related diseases are often otherwise “healthy” subjects, who take drugs for a given condition. What level of undesirable effects would be acceptable for them and who will bear the cost of treating any ensuing iatrogenic disease? A number of simple and potentially effective preventive measures should be recommended for some (if not all) safety concerns in order to minimize them.

First of all, PPI therapy should be evidence based. Decisions on whether or not to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be sound and PPIs should only be prescribed when there is an appropriate clinical indication. Clinical guidelines can certainly help. In this Position Paper, we have reviewed the current available guidelines, together with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to generate them, and synthesized the knowledge in a number of statements (i.e. Summaries of the current evidence) and in Table 3.

Table 3 
Current indications of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy

Guidelines rely on both evidence and expert opinion; they are neither infallible nor a substitute for clinical judgment. They do, however, go beyond systematic reviews to recommend what should and should not be done in specific clinical circumstances. Despite guidelines being developed to improve quality of care received by patients, they have been criticized for recommending too little or too much, and even for providing reasons for national health systems or insurance payers to deny coverage. Guidelines are often inflexible and can actually harm by leaving insufficient room for clinicians to tailor care to individual patient circumstances and medical history. What is best for patients overall, as recommended by guidelines, may be inappropriate for individuals. Only evidence-based recommendations, which consider the balance between benefits and harms, and weigh these considerations using patient (rather than expert and societal) value, should be followed in everyday clinical practice. Taking these considerations into account, we have tried to distill the current evidence and provide physicians with clear patient-oriented recommendations, beyond cost and reimbursement issues. Medicine is a rapidly evolving field, however, and the validity of guidelines will not necessarily stand the test of time: indeed, today’s assumptions may no longer be valid tomorrow. Healthcare providers should therefore stay tuned and constantly update their knowledge.

### Detecting and tracking depression through temporal topic modeling of tweets: insights from a 180-day study [^50ebb101]. Npj Mental Health Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Fourth, we detected swearing to be a key theme in the discourse associated with depression. In broader terms, swearing refers to the activity of using taboo words to convey strong emotions. Swearing has been seen as an approach to reduce pain or tension release in individuals. Depressed users tend to swear in the presence of othersand prior studies have found swearing to be a distinctive marker of language used by depressed users,. Our topic modeling results showed depressed users commonly use swear words in their Twitter posts. This was prevalent in both time periods preceding and succeeding the clinical diagnosis.

The fifth theme concerns depression treatments. We found disclosing users to share content about their anti-depression medications, side effects, clinic visits, counseling, therapy sessions, and treatment plans. Twitter uses in our dataset shared tweets such as “ I started taking zoloft today ”, “ I got myself a doctors appointment I was diagnosed with severe depression and panic disorder/anxiety and have been put on sertraline (Zoloft) antidepressant ”, “ I’m still depressed and now on Seroquel. And my mouth may permanently taste terrible.” We also found users to share their experiences with drugs and treatment plans. When we examined the temporal trends about treatments, we found z -scores to be higher in the post-diagnosis and disclosure phase as compared to the earlier period.

### Brexpiprazole and sertraline combination treatment in posttraumatic stress disorder: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^807aa83c]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Importance

New pharmacotherapy options are needed for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Objective

To investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brexpiprazole and sertraline combination treatment (brexpiprazole + sertraline) compared with sertraline+placebo for PTSD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a parallel-design, double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted from October 2019 to August 2023. The study had a 1-week, placebo run-in period followed by an 11-week, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-arm period (with 21-day follow-up) and took place at 86 clinical trial sites in the US. Adult outpatients with PTSD were enrolled (volunteer sample).

Interventions

Oral brexpiprazole 2 to 3 mg per day (flexible dose) + sertraline 150 mg per day or sertraline 150 mg per day+placebo (1:1 ratio) for 11 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was change in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) total score (which measures the severity of 20 PTSD symptoms) from randomization (week 1) to week 10 for brexpiprazole+sertraline vs sertraline+placebo. Safety assessments included adverse events.

Results

A total of 1327 individuals were assessed for eligibility. After 878 screen failures, 416 participants (mean [SD] age, 37.4 [11.9] years; 310 female [74.5%]) were randomized. Completion rates were 137 of 214 participants (64.0%) for brexpiprazole+sertraline and 113 of 202 participants (55.9%) for sertraline+placebo. At week 10, brexpiprazole+sertraline demonstrated statistically significant greater improvement in CAPS-5 total score (mean [SD] at randomization, 38.4 [7.2]; LS mean [SE] change, -19.2 [1.2]; n=148) than sertraline+placebo (randomization, 38.7 [7.8]; change, -13.6 [1.2]; n=134), with LS mean difference, -5.59 (95% CI, -8.79 to -2.38; P<.001). All key secondary and other efficacy end points were also met. Treatment-emergent adverse events with incidence of 5% or greater for brexpiprazole+sertraline (and corresponding incidences for sertraline + placebo) were nausea (25 of 205 [12.2%] and 23 of 196 [11.7%]), fatigue (14 of 205 [6.8%] and 8 of 196 [4.1%]), weight increase (12 of 205 [5.9%] and 3 of 196 [1.5%]), and somnolence (11 of 205 [5.4%] and 5 of 196 [2.6%]). Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 8 of 205 participants (3.9%) for brexpiprazole+sertraline and 20 of 196 participants (10.2%) for sertraline+placebo.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this randomized clinical trial show that brexpiprazole + sertraline combination treatment statistically significantly improved PTSD symptoms vs sertraline+placebo, indicating its potential as a new efficacious treatment for PTSD. Brexpiprazole+sertraline was tolerated by most participants, with a safety profile consistent with that of brexpiprazole in approved indications.

### Citalopram (Citalopram hydrobromide) [^dba33e22]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CYP3A4 and CYP 2C19 inhibitors:

Since CYP3A4 and CYP 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Citalopram 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Coadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.

Clinical Efficacy Trials

The efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for depression was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks in duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depression. Study 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg or 60 mg/day, showed that citalopram at doses of 40 and 60 mg/day was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the HAMD depressed mood item (Item 1), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity scale. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 and 20 mg/day doses, and the 60 mg/day dose was not more effective than the 40 mg/day dose. In study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in depressed patients, of whom 85% met criteria for melancholia, the initial dose was 20 mg/day, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg/day. Patients treated with citalopram showed significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, HAMD item 1, and the CGI Severity score. In three additional placebo-controlled depression trials, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant, possibly due to high spontaneous response rate, smaller sample size, or, in the case of one study, too low a dose.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^c3f21980]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPI-related adverse events involve the GI tract as well as other organs and systems. The majority of these events have been summarized in comprehensive reviews, to which the reader is referred. The potential risks of long-term PPI therapy, along with the respective evidence summary, are outlined in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 1 
Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Digestive System

Table 2 
Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Extra-digestive effects

Gastric pH is relevant for the absorption of several drugs and its modification by antisecretory therapy may significantly modify their pharmacokinetics. PPIs also influence drug absorption and metabolism by interacting with adenosine triphosphate-dependent P-glycoprotein (e.g. inhibiting digoxin efflux) or with the CYP P450 enzyme system (e.g. decreasing simvastatin metabolism), thereby affecting both intestinal first-pass metabolism and hepatic clearance. A number of studies have shown that omeprazole (and, to a lesser extent, lansoprazole) carries a considerable potential for DDIs, since it has a high affinity for CYP2C19 and a somewhat lower affinity for CYP3A4. In contrast, pantoprazole and rabeprazole display a lower potential for DDIs. DDIs therefore represent a molecule-related effect rather than a class-effect.

These interactions are clinically relevant mostly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. diazepam, warfarin, antipsychotics, etc.). In addition, PPI metabolism is very rapid in most Caucasian subjects (extensive metabolizers), so that their half-life ranges from only 0.5 to 2.1 hours. Indeed, the prevalence of poor metabolizers, potentially at increased risk of drug interactions, is as low as 1.2–3.8 % in Europe as compared to 23 % in Asia. This could explain why only few of the reported DDIs involving PPIs have been shown to be of clinical significance.

Recent studies have raised concerns about a possible adverse interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs (currently prescribed to patients who are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent upper GI bleeding) that could reduce the antithrombotic effect of the former and, therefore, lessen protection against CV events in high-risk patients. However, current evidence shows that, while concomitant use of some PPIs with clopidogrel does attenuate the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel, this effect is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Conversely, denying PPIs to patients at GI risk would result in increased life-threatening GI bleeding.

### Cardiovascular outcomes associated with clinical use of citalopram and omeprazole: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^14487cd0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

It has been noted that the PPIs are all substrates of CYP2C19, and a theoretical rationale exists for a decreased metabolism of citalopram by concomitant treatment with PPIs. 34, 35 The impact of omeprazole on the metabolism of citalopram has been studied in humans in previous studies. In the first of these, a mean 51% increase in the plasma levels of citalopram was seen after the administration of omeprazole to 16 healthy volunteers. 36 In the second, about a 2‐fold increase in the concentration of S‐citalopram and 25% increase of the concentration of R‐citalopram were found in 9 subjects. 34 In the present population‐based study, patients with concomitant use of omeprazole and citalopram had a significantly higher risk of SCA as compared with the comparison cohort (adjusted HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.79–2.78). Moreover, the cumulative incidence of SCA was more pronounced in patients with co‐administration of omeprazole and citalopram than those with omeprazole use alone and citalopram use alone (Figure). Indeed, observational pharmacosurveillance study involved examining geriatric inpatients health records revealed that treatment with citalopram plus omeprazole led to a statistically significant prolongation in QT interval. 37 It is noted that citalopram and omeprazole are commonly co‐prescribed in the elderly and this observational pharmacosurveillance study suggested that citalopram and omeprazole interact significantly in the elderly population to prolong the QT interval. Overall, these study findings suggest a drug‐drug interaction between citalopram and omeprazole and there is a potential adverse effect on cardiovascular events.

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the all of Us research program [^69b98792]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

For SSRIs, we included fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram. For SNRIs, we included duloxetine and venlafaxine. The NRI bupropion was also included in this study. Our primary reference drug was sertraline, the most used antidepressant. In addition, we included omeprazole (a non‐psychiatric medication) as a secondary reference drug. Omeprazole is a commonly prescribed acid suppression medication used with a similar frequency, a similar age distribution, and a similar pattern of comorbidities in All of Us (Table 1, Figure S6A,B). Hyponatremia with omeprazole (or with any of the proton pump inhibitors) occurs infrequently.Participants were assigned to study arms defined by the index drug that they had used: fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, duloxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, or omeprazole. Participants who were prescribed more than one SSRI, SNRI, or NRI were excluded from our analysis (Supplementary Result S1) to avoid misclassification as well as potential analytical complications related to the timing of drug epochs, outcome ascertainment assignment, and related dosage adjustments. Participants prescribed both an antidepressant and omeprazole were assigned to the antidepressant arms if they otherwise met the criteria. All the included participants were indexed with the first recorded date of the study drugs in their EHR (time zero for the survival analysis).

Participant demographics

Participants who ever had diagnostic codes for end‐stage renal disease, acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma, sepsis, hypovolemia, renal dialysis, and other conditions that suggest alternative causes for hyponatremia were excluded from all cohorts (Supplementary Method S1). Also, participants who ever had hyponatremic events prior to the start of antidepressants or omeprazole were excluded. Covariates adjusted included age at time zero (reported as in decades), sex, and self‐reported race and ethnicity, as defined in Supplementary Method S2.

### Deprescribing versus continuation of chronic proton pump inhibitor use in adults [^2f7c80c3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of medications that reduce acid secretion and are used for treating many conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), dyspepsia, reflux esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, and hypersecretory conditions (e.g. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), and as part of the eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori bacteria. However, approximately 25% to 70% of people are prescribed a PPI inappropriately. Chronic PPI use without reassessment contributes to polypharmacy and puts people at risk of experiencing drug interactions and adverse events (e.g. Clostridium difficile infection, pneumonia, hypomagnesaemia, and fractures).

Objectives

To determine the effects (benefits and harms) associated with deprescribing long-term PPI therapy in adults, compared to chronic daily use (28 days or greater).

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). The last date of search was November 2016. We handsearched the reference lists of relevant studies. We screened 2357 articles (2317 identified through search strategy, 40 through other resources). Of these articles, we assessed 89 for eligibility.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized trials comparing at least one deprescribing modality (e.g. stopping PPI or reducing PPI) with a control consisting of no change in continuous daily PPI use in adult chronic users. Outcomes of interest were: change in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, drug burden/PPI use, cost/resource use, negative and positive drug withdrawal events, and participant satisfaction.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed and extracted data and completed the risk of bias assessment. A third review author independently confirmed risk of bias assessment. We used Review Manager 5 software for data analysis. We contacted study authors if there was missing information.

Main Results

The review included six trials (n = 1758). Trial participants were aged 48 to 57 years, except for one trial that had a mean age of 73 years. All participants were from the outpatient setting and had either nonerosive reflux disease or milder grades of esophagitis (LA grade A or B). Five trials investigated on-demand deprescribing and one trial examined abrupt discontinuation. There was low quality evidence that on-demand use of PPI may increase risk of 'lack of symptom control' compared with continuous PPI use (risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31 to 2.21), thereby favoring continuous PPI use (five trials, n = 1653). There was a clinically significant reduction in 'drug burden', measured as PPI pill use per week with on-demand therapy (mean difference (MD) -3.79, 95% CI -4.73 to -2.84), favoring deprescribing based on moderate quality evidence (four trials, n = 1152). There was also low quality evidence that on-demand PPI use may be associated with reduced participant satisfaction compared with continuous PPI use. None of the included studies reported cost/resource use or positive drug withdrawal effects.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with mild GERD, on-demand deprescribing may lead to an increase in GI symptoms (e.g. dyspepsia, regurgitation) and probably a reduction in pill burden. There was a decline in participant satisfaction, although heterogeneity was high. There were insufficient data to make a conclusion regarding long-term benefits and harms of PPI discontinuation, although two trials (one on-demand trial and one abrupt discontinuation trial) reported endoscopic findings in their intervention groups at study end.

### Safety of eluxadoline in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea [^b376c5a7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

There were six major adverse cardiac events that were evenly distributed between patients randomized to placebo (0.3% 3/975) and eluxadoline (0.2% 3/1,839; Table 3). All of these eluxadoline-treated patients were ≥70 years of age and all had medical histories or risk factors for cardiopulmonary disease.

In the eluxadoline 100 mg group, there was a single case of suspected colon ischemia in a 72-year-old female with a recent history of polymicrobial sepsis (treated with antibiotics) and chronic medical conditions including type II diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis with cirrhosis, pulmonary hypertension with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diverticulosis. Nineteen days after the first dose of study drug, the patient developed abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting followed by rectal bleeding and hypotension, with a blood pressure reading of 80/40 mm Hg documented at home. Concomitant medications at the time of event onset included acetylsalicylic acid, gabapentin, lovastatin, omeprazole, psyllium mucilloid, sertraline, temazepam, and ursodeoxycholic acid. Upon presentation, blood pressure was 147/90 mm Hg with a heart rate of 93 beats per minute; abdominal examination was unremarkable. Colonoscopy and histologic examinations were consistent with colon ischemia, with biopsy specimens revealing microscopic focus of reparative epithelial changes suggestive of colon ischemia in the ascending colon, and focal epithelial erosion and reparative epithelial changes compatible with colon ischemia in the transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon: the patient recovered uneventfully and there were no known complications at the time of last follow-up. The patient's electronic diary showed no recordings of constipation prior to the event.

### Cardiovascular outcomes associated with clinical use of citalopram and omeprazole: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^fdb82b4e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Subjects

We identified patients who have ever received citalopram and/or omeprazole between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2005 as the exposed cohort. In addition, we included patients who have been treated with antidepressants without the risk of SCA (eg, imipramine, amitriptyline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, trazodone, bupropion, or duloxetine) 22 and/or PPIs other than omeprazole (eg, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, or dexlansoprazole) between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2005 as the non‐exposed cohort to reduce the possible problem of confounding by indication. We applied propensity score matching at a ratio of 1:4 for exposed cohort to the matched comparator cohort. The date of initial use of citalopram or other antidepressants under study and/or omeprazole or other PPIs under study for each patient was assigned as their enrollment date. Initiation was defined as being free from any prescribed medication under study for 12 months before the first prescription. Patients aged <18 years (n=2231) with a diagnosis of SCA before the enrollment date (n=12 016) were excluded. We finally included 35 377 patients as the exposed cohort and 141 508 patients as the comparison cohort.

### Brexpiprazole and sertraline combination treatment in posttraumatic stress disorder: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^851427de]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

The study Brexpiprazole plus Sertraline for PTSD was published by Lori L Davis and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. This study is related to the following diseases: Posttraumatic stress disorder. In the Brexpiprazole plus Sertraline for PTSD study, the trial question was: what is the role of brexpiprazole and sertraline combination therapy in patients with PTSD? In the Brexpiprazole plus Sertraline for PTSD study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Brexpiprazole plus Sertraline for PTSD study, the population was: 416 patients (310 female, 106 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with PTSD. The key exclusion criteria were traumatic events within 3 months of screening; considered psychotropic treatment-resistant/refractory by history in the investigator's opinion; receipt of sertraline with adequate dose and duration; previous exposure to brexpiprazole; change in PTSD treatment within 28 days of screening; current DSM-5 major depressive episode. In the Brexpiprazole plus Sertraline for PTSD study, the interventions were: n=214 brexpiprazole plus sertraline (oral brexpiprazole 2-3 mg/day plus sertraline 150 mg/day) n=202 placebo plus sertraline (matching placebo plus oral sertraline 150 mg/day). In the Brexpiprazole plus Sertraline for PTSD study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in least-square mean reduction in Clinician-Administered Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Scale for DSM-5 total score at week 10 (19.2 points vs. 13.6 points; MD 5.59, 95% CI 2.38 to 8.79). In the Brexpiprazole plus Sertraline for PTSD study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in least-square mean reduction in Clinical Global Impression-Severity of illness at week 10 (1.5 points vs. 1.1 points; MD 0.47, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.76) Significant increase in least-square mean reduction in Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Function at week 10 (33.8 points vs. 21.8 points; MD 12, 95% CI 4.62 to 19.4) Significant increase in least-square mean reduction in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety at week 10 (4.7 points vs. 3.1 points; MD 1.56, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.72). In the Brexpiprazole plus Sertraline for PTSD study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-emergent adverse events. In the Brexpiprazole plus Sertraline for PTSD study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with PTSD, brexpiprazole plus sertraline was superior to placebo plus sertraline with respect to a least-square mean reduction in Clinician-Administered Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Scale for DSM-5 total score at week 10.

### Recent safety concerns with proton pump inhibitors [^37044e3c]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

There have been recent concerns about the safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). We focus here on 3 specific concerns-the possible interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel, the postulated link between PPI use and fractures, and the possibility that long-term PPI use might lead to hypomagnesemia. There is evidence for an in vitro interaction between clopidogrel and at least some PPIs. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned against the use of certain PPIs by patients on clopidogrel. However, a randomized controlled trial that compared clopidogrel alone with the combination of clopidogrel and omeprazole found no increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes and a reduction in the rate of adverse gastrointestinal outcomes attributable to omeprazole. PPI use may be a weak risk factor for certain fractures, but the quality of evidence is relatively poor and there is a strong possibility of confounding. The mechanism whereby PPI use might increase fracture risk is unknown. Currently, no additional measures concerning calcium supplementation or bone mineral density monitoring are recommended for patients on a PPI. The FDA has suggested monitoring serum magnesium levels in patients on PPI therapy. The mechanism and frequency of PPI-induced hypomagnesemia are unclear. PPI treatment should not be withheld from patients who genuinely require it, but the PPI should be taken in the lowest effective dose and only for as long as clinically indicated. The same is, of course, true for all medicines. The benefits of PPI therapy greatly outweigh the risks.

### Safety of proton pump inhibitor exposure [^cded0131]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Proton pump (H(+)/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase) inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used to treat patients with acid-related disorders because they are generally perceived to be safe and effective. However, as with any pharmacologic agent, they have the potential for side effects. Many studies have examined the side effects of long-term or short-term PPI exposure. We review the mechanism of action of PPIs, focusing on recently released products that might have greater risks of adverse effects than older products because of increased potency and/or duration of action. We summarize the data available on the putative adverse effects of PPI therapy and propose guidelines for clinicians who prescribe these agents to limit the potential for adverse outcomes in users of these effective therapeutic agents.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^65c6e9f0]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

GERD—antisecretory drug selection and on-demand therapy highlights that circumstances in which one antisecretory drug might be preferable to another primarily relate to side effects or when the onset of effect is a prime consideration. The most common side effects of PPIs are headache, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain, and switching among alternative PPI drugs or to a lower dose can usually circumvent these side effects. For on-demand use, if a patient intends to take a drug only in response to symptoms, then it should be a rapidly acting drug, and the most rapidly acting agents are antacids, the efficacy of which can be sustained by combining them with an H2RA or a PPI.

### Improving adherence to therapy and clinical outcomes while containing costs: opportunities from the greater use of generic medications: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^259ced47]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Brand-name and generic medications—clinical effects and bioequivalence—To be approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, generics must demonstrate bioequivalence, defined as the absence of a significant difference in availability of the active ingredient at the site of drug action, which can be established by maximum serum concentration, time to maximum concentration, or area under the concentration–time curve. Although concerns exist (for example, several generic versions of bupropion were found not to be bioequivalent to the brand-name version), most peer-reviewed evidence indicates comparable clinical outcomes: a meta-analysis of 47 studies across 9 classes of cardiovascular medications found no evidence of superiority of brand-name medication, including among anticoagulants and antiarrhythmics with narrow therapeutic windows. For proton-pump inhibitors, comparative studies indicate no meaningful differences; head-to-head trials showed absolute differences in erosive esophagitis healing at 4 weeks ranged from −6% to 2%, with none statistically significant. At 8 weeks, esomeprazole versus omeprazole showed a trend with risk difference, 3% [95% CI, 0% to 6%], but clinical significance is unclear, and there were no differences between agents for healing of duodenal or gastric ulcers. For antidepressants, clinical practice guidelines do not recommend their use unless lower-cost generic therapies have been unsuccessful.

### Clinical pharmacology and safety profile of esomeprazole, the first enantiomerically pure proton pump inhibitor [^ad155d1a]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Awareness of important differences in the pharmacological profile of individual optical isomers of chiral drugs led to the development of esomeprazole, the S-isomer of omeprazole, a new pharmacological entity designed to improve the clinical outcome of available proton pump inhibitors in the management of acid-related disorders. The superior acid control achieved by esomeprazole is mainly due to an advantageous metabolism compared with racemate omeprazole, leading to improved bioavailability and to enhanced delivery of the drug to the gastric proton pump.

### Pharmacokinetics of sertraline in relation to genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 [^52acbf4a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between the disposition of sertraline and the presence of the CYP2C19 gene and to define the contribution of cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to sertraline N-demethylation.

Methods

A single oral 100-mg dose of sertraline was administered to 6 subjects who were extensive metabolizers and 6 subjects who were poor metabolizers recruited from 77 healthy Chinese volunteers whose genotypes were predetermined by polymerase chain reaction-based amplification, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Phenotypes were determined by use of the omeprazole metabolic rate. The plasma concentrations of sertraline and desmethylsertraline were determined by gas chromatography with electron-capture detection.

Results

Six poor metabolizers with m1 mutation had area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) values (983.6 +/- 199.3 microg x h/L versus 697.6 +/- 133.0 microg x h/L; P <.05) and terminal elimination half-life values of sertraline (35.5 +/- 5.6 hours versus 23.5 +/- 4.4 hours; P <.01) that were significantly higher than the values in 6 extensive metabolizers who were either homozygous or heterozygous for CYP2C19*1. The oral clearance of sertraline in poor metabolizers (105.3 +/- 19.4 L/h) was significantly lower than that of extensive metabolizers (148.4 +/- 28.6 L/h). The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 144 hours and the maximum plasma concentration of desmethylsertraline in poor metabolizers were significantly lower than the values of extensive metabolizers (627.6 +/- 203.8 microg x h/L versus 972.1 +/- 270.3 microg x h/L; P <.05; and 23.6 +/- 6.5 nmol/L versus 32.4 +/- 8.2 nmol/L; P <.01; respectively).

Conclusions

The polymorphic CYP2C19 appears to be a major enzyme involved in the N-demethylation of sertraline, and both extensive and poor metabolizers had marked differences in the disposition of sertraline.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (sertraline HCl) [^fcb9617c]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Protein-bound drugs: Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of Sertraline HCl Capsules or other protein-bound drugs (e.g., warfarin) as warranted (7.1, 12.3)
CYP2D6 substrates: Reduce dosage of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (7.1, 12.3)

7.1 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions

Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Sertraline HCl Capsules [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with Sertraline HCl

Based on pharmacokinetic studies with another sertraline HCl formulation, no dosage adjustment of Sertraline HCl Capsules is necessary when used in combination with cimetidine. Additionally, no dosage adjustment is required for diazepam, lithium, atenolol, tolbutamide, digoxin, and drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, when Sertraline HCl Capsules is administered concomitantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

7.3 False-Positive Screening Tests for Benzodiazepines

False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking another sertraline HCl product. This finding is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of Sertraline HCl Capsules. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish sertraline from benzodiazepines.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^9a83cfff]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A matter for concern is the interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel. Based on pharmacokinetic studies, PPI therapy reduces the efficacy of clopidogrel by interfering with the hepatic CYP2C19-based activation. However, the clinical relevance of such a phenomenon is largely controversial. Indeed, a panel of experts of the European Society of Cardiology recently suggested that there is no conclusive evidence to discourage PPI use with clopidogrel due to a potential increased risk of ischemic events. Further, the only prospective study (the COGENT trial) demonstrated that omeprazole significantly reduces the rate of composite GI events but did not show any increase in the composite CV events in patients at high CV risk. Additionally, a recent meta-analysis, while confirming that the pharmacodynamic interaction between PPI and clopidogrel has no clinical significance, actually suggests that PPIs are a marker of increased CV risk in patients taking clopidogrel rather than a direct cause of worse outcomes. Nevertheless, PPIs that lack inhibition of CYP2C19 (i.e. pantoprazole or rabeprazole) might be preferred in clopidogrel users. No significant interaction between PPIs and the new antiplatelet agents (prasugrel or ticagrelor) has been documented.

Co-administration of aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with synergistic effects in causing serious GI bleeding. Indeed, epidemiological studies have invariably shown that combination of two antiplatelet drugs produces significant excess risk of UGIB. PPI co-treatment is also effective in reducing the risk of UGIB in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. It is worthwhile mentioning that – among patients with dual antiplatelet therapy and PPI co-therapy – GI bleeding episodes are more frequent in the lower GI tract ; this changing pattern of bleeding likely reflects the success of gastroprotection.

Anticoagulants, either vitamin K antagonists or novel oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, do not cause gastroduodenal mucosa injury per se. These medications may, however, facilitate bleeding of pre-existing PUs. While gastroprotection is generally not advised, unless a concomitant anti-platelet or NSAID therapy is prescribed, a very recent retrospective cohort study found that PPI co-therapy is associated with reduced risk of warfarin-related upper GI bleeding. As expected, the risk reduction was greatest in patients also taking antiplatelet drugs and/or NSAIDs, but was still significant in those without concurrent use of these medications.

### Cardiovascular outcomes associated with clinical use of citalopram and omeprazole: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^07b4004d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Chi‐square and t‐tests were used to evaluate the distributions of categorical and continuous variables between the study cohorts. Because the exposure in the observational cohort is time‐dependent and non‐proportional hazards of SCA exist between study cohorts, as indicated by the Schoenfeld global test (P =0.0255), the Cox regression model with time‐dependent covariates were used to determine the association between use of citalopram and/or omeprazole and risk of SCA and the results were presented as a hazard ratio (HR) and a 95% CI. In this model, patients treated with citalopram and/or omeprazole were defined as the exposure group during a specified period of time, and patients would be switched to the non‐exposure group when they stopped citalopram and/or omeprazole treatments during another specified period of time. We included the propensity score as a covariate in the time‐dependent Cox regression model to adjust for the effects of potential confounders. We also included a composite variable representing the use of drugs potential for induction of QT‐prolongation, 23 QT prolonging drugs, in the time‐dependent Cox regression model for the adjustment. Furthermore, PPIs have been shown to interact with clopidogrel, the platelet aggregation inhibitor, reducing its platelet inhibiting effect, probably by competitive effects on CYP2C19. 24 Thus, the use of clopidogrel (ATC [Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical] code: B01AC04) was also included in the time‐dependent Cox regression model for the adjustment. In order to evaluate the drug‐drug interaction, the exposed cohort was divided into three subgroups: use of citalopram alone, use of omeprazole alone, and concomitant use of citalopram and omeprazole. Patients in each subgroup were compared with patients who received treatment with antidepressants without the risk of SCA and/or PPIs other than omeprazole. Differences in the cumulative risk of SCA between the cohorts were estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method. Given the presence of non‐proportional hazards of SCA in the study cohorts, a variant of the log‐rank test, the Tarone‐Ware test, was used to examine the difference in the cumulative incidence curves of SCA between study cohorts. All statistical tests were two‐sided, and an α level of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Brexpiprazole and sertraline combination treatment in posttraumatic stress disorder: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^bfe4316a]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in this trial was low (3.9% for brexpiprazole + sertraline vs 10.2% for sertraline + placebo), indicating that most participants tolerated brexpiprazole and sertraline combination treatment. Of note, almost three-quarters of participants were PTSD-pharmacotherapy naive at baseline, which is not uncommon in PTSD due to various treatment barriers. The safety profile of brexpiprazole + sertraline was generally similar to that of sertraline + placebo. In both treatment arms the only TEAE with incidence greater than 10% was nausea, a known adverse effect of sertraline treatment.Weight gain (objectively, and as a TEAE) was greater among participants receiving brexpiprazole + sertraline than sertraline + placebo; previous analyses in schizophrenia and major depressive disorder show that brexpiprazole is associated with moderate weight gain (+3-4 kg over 1 year). The incidence of activating and sedating TEAEs (a concern with some antipsychotics) was generally low, although fatigue (6.8% vs 4.1%) and somnolence (5.4% vs 2.6%) had a higher incidence with brexpiprazole + sertraline than sertraline + placebo. Overall, brexpiprazole + sertraline had a safety profile consistent with that of brexpiprazole in approved indications.,,,,

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of this trial include the enrollment of participants with different traumas representative of the patient population, the predominantly PTSD pharmacotherapy–naive sample, the placebo run-in period to reduce placebo response,the blinding of trial design elements, and the concurrent use of clinician- and patient-reported outcomes.

Limitations include the patient eligibility criteria, restrictions on concomitant therapy, and the lack of non-US sites, which mean that the results may not be generalizable to a broader population with PTSD. Specifically, the exclusion of patients with a current major depressive episode is both a strength (to show a specific effect on PTSD) and a limitation (given the high prevalence of comorbid depression in PTSD). Results of this trial support starting patients on combination therapy; however, the effect of adding brexpiprazole to existing sertraline therapy was not evaluated. This trial cannot be used to advise on duration of treatment, and longer-term efficacy and safety data are needed.

### AGA clinical practice update on the personalized approach to the evaluation and management of GERD: expert review [^8522ee2b]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial—best practice advice, clinicians should provide patients presenting with troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain without alarm symptoms a 4- to 8-week trial of single-dose PPI therapy (BPA 4). Patients should be counseled to take the PPI 30 to 60 minutes prior to a meal. Education on literature emphasizing safety of PPIs for the treatment of GERD should be provided (BPA 3). Patient symptoms should be reassessed after a 4- to 8-week trial. With inadequate response, dosing can be increased to twice a day or switched to a more effective acid suppressive agent once a day (BPA 4). These can include PPIs that are more potent, less metabolized through the CYP2C19 pathway (eg, rabeprazole, esomeprazole), or available in an extended release formulation (eg, dexlansoprazole), as well as potassium competitive acid blockers when available. Routine re-evaluation of the treatment should be performed, and the PPI should be tapered to the lowest effective dose when there is adequate response (BPA 4) (Figure 1).

### Brexpiprazole and sertraline combination treatment in posttraumatic stress disorder: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^05b940f3]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Methods

This was a phase 3, multicenter, 12-week, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial of brexpiprazole + sertraline in patients with PTSD. The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are available in Supplement 1. The trial was conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guideline and local regulatory requirements. The trial was reviewed and approved by the governing institutional review board for each investigational site. All participants provided written or electronic informed consent before initiation of trial procedures and were reimbursed for time and travel. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guidelines.

Participants and Study Design

Participants (a volunteer sample) were screened by investigators at 78 of 86 selected trial sites in the US (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Key inclusion criteria were as follows: outpatient status, age 18 to 65 years, diagnosis of PTSD as defined by DSM-5 criteriaand confirmed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview version 7with symptoms for 6 or more months before screening, and a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)total score of 33 or greater at screening and baseline (day 0). Enrollment of patients with an index trauma related to combat was limited to 20%. Key exclusion criteria were as follows: receiving disability payments or being engaged in compensation litigation related to PTSD or another psychiatric disorder; an index traumatic event before age 16 years or more than 9 years before screening; a traumatic event within 3 months of screening; currently experiencing trauma, ongoing contact with their assailant/abuser, or ongoing legal matters related to their assault/abuse; considered psychotropic treatment–resistant/refractory by history in the investigator’s opinion; currently receiving sertraline with adequate dose and duration; any previous exposure to brexpiprazole; a change in PTSD treatment within 28 days of screening; a current DSM-5 major depressive episode; a current or recent (within 6 months of screening) anxiety disorder that has been the primary focus of psychiatric treatment; at significant risk of committing suicide; or any other psychiatric or medical condition as listed in the protocol.

### Clopidogrel and interaction with proton pump inhibitors: comparison between cohort and within person study designs [^913821f9]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Cohort analysis

Patients enter the cohort at the latest of 1 January 2003 or first recorded prescription for clopidogrel in combination with aspirin. Follow-up was censored at the earliest of stopping treatment with clopidogrel, stopping treatment with aspirin, occurrence of an outcome of interest, death, transfer out of the practice, last data collection date for the practice, or 31 July 2009. Follow-up time was then classified according to whether the patient was receiving a proton pump inhibitor as recorded in the database, with time updated treatment status, allowing patients to fluctuate between exposed and unexposed depending on prescription patterns.

Treatment with aspirin was assumed to be continuous unless a gastrointestinal bleed was recorded, from which time treatment was assumed to be discontinued. For clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitor exposure, where possible we calculated the anticipated length of each prescription based on pack size and dosing instructions. From all prescription records where this information was available, we calculated the median length of exposure from a single prescription. This median duration was imputed for all individual prescriptions where duration was not recorded. Courses of treatment were assumed to be continuous when any apparent treatment break was less than 180 days, to allow for partial non-compliance and situations where patients might have built up treatment stocks or obtained drugs through alternative sources. The primary exposure of interest was any proton pump inhibitor. Given the varied capacity for 2C19 inhibition among individual proton pump inhibitors, however, we also restricted exposure to strong inhibitors only (omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole). We examined other drugs likely to be used over long periods by patients taking clopidogrel as secondary exposures; other strong 2C19 inhibitors included fluoxetine/paroxetine. Citalopram and ranitidine were selected as a weak/non-2C19 inhibitors, with ranitidine used for similar indications to proton pump inhibitors.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was a composite end point of all cause mortality or incident myocardial infarction. Mortality was determined from Office for National Statistics mortality records, with incident myocardial infarction determined by Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project records. Secondary end points included incident myocardial infarction, all cause mortality, and mortality attributed to vascular and non-vascular causes, determined with cause of death information recorded by the Office for National Statistics. Vascular causes of death were all those assigned an ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) code for “diseases of the circulatory system” as the underlying cause.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^66124ee7]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor interactions and risks in obsessive-compulsive disorder are characterized by limited important drug–drug interactions for “citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline,” yet vigilance for “the risk of serotonin syndrome from adding an SSRI to an MAOI, tramadol, meperidine, or dextromethorphan.” For up-to-date interaction information, clinicians can consult “the federal National Library of Medicine database … which is also accessible by entering the term ‘pubmed’ in a search engine.”

### Antiplatelet drug interactions [^f2f59231]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Both laboratory studies in healthy volunteers and clinical studies have suggested adverse interactions between antiplatelet drugs and other commonly used medications. Interactions described include those between aspirin and ibuprofen, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the thienopyridine, clopidogrel, and drugs inhibiting CYP2C19, notably the proton pump inhibitors (PPI) omeprazole and esomeprazole. Other interactions between thienopyridines and CYP3A4/5 have also been reported for statins and calcium channel blockers. The ibuprofen/aspirin interaction is thought to be caused by ibuprofen blocking the access of aspirin to platelet cyclo-oxygenase. The thienopyridine interactions are caused by inhibition of microsomal enzymes that metabolize these pro-drugs to their active metabolites. We review the evidence for these interactions, assess their clinical importance and suggest strategies of how to deal with them in clinical practice. We conclude that ibuprofen is likely to interact with aspirin and reduce its anti-platelet action particularly in those patients who take ibuprofen chronically. This interaction is of greater relevance to those patients at high cardiovascular risk. A sensible strategy is to advise users of aspirin to avoid chronic ibuprofen or to ingest aspirin at least 2 h prior to ibuprofen. Clearly the use of NSAIDs that do not interact in this way is preferred. For the clopidogrel CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 interactions, there is good evidence that these interactions occur. However, there is less good evidence to support the clinical importance of these interactions. Again, a reasonable strategy is to avoid the chronic use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, notably PPIs, in subjects taking clopidogrel and use high dose H2 antagonists instead. Finally, anti-platelet agents probably interact with other drugs that affect platelet function such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and clinicians should probably judge patients taking such combination therapies as at high risk for bleeding.
