## Question

Differential for knee pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me for a differential diagnosis for knee pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organizing framework for causes of knee pain. Then, I should verify demographic modifiers and red flags that change urgency. Next, I will populate the differential by category, double-check imaging and lab algorithms, and synthesize key distinguishing features. Finally, I will consider pain mechanisms and rare-but-critical etiologies, and close with a pragmatic diagnostic pathway supported by guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the overarching framework. The 2023 JAMA review offers a comprehensive, clinically useful categorization: tendinitis/bursitis; degenerative/structural; trauma-related; arthritic/inflammatory; infectious/systemic; neuropathic/other joint disorders; neoplastic; and metabolic/crystal deposition. Adopting this structure ensures full coverage from common to rare and aligns downstream testing and management, so I will use it as the scaffold for the differential [^117KwPXg].

> Next, I should review how age and activity shift pretest probabilities. Wait, let me verify the dominant patterns: in adolescents, patellofemoral pain, traction apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter, Sinding-Larsen–Johansson), and osteochondritis dissecans stand out, with prognosis data showing chronicity risks in nontraumatic adolescent knee pain [^115oGhhW]. In young active adults, patellofemoral pain and overuse syndromes predominate, with sports-related meniscal and ACL injuries common in this cohort [^112y4AhH]. In adults over 50, osteoarthritis is the leading cause with substantial population burden and classic mechanical pain features, though pain-structure discordance can occur [^113RDy5J] [^116S6Fu7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before excluding emergencies. I should confirm red flags and immediate actions: a hot, swollen monoarthritis with fever or marked ROM pain raises concern for septic arthritis and mandates urgent arthrocentesis for cell count, Gram stain, culture, and crystal analysis; inability to bear weight after trauma or focal bony tenderness triggers radiographs per the Ottawa Knee Rules and related decision tools; rapid hemarthrosis after twisting suggests internal derangement or fracture requiring timely imaging and support [^1173sAtq] [^114hznr3].

> I will now examine the differential by category, pausing to verify typical pain patterns. For tendinitis/bursitis: prepatellar and pes anserine bursitis, patellar tendinopathy, infrapatellar fat pad (Hoffa) impingement, and iliotibial band syndrome present with focal anterior or lateral pain linked to activity and palpation findings, often without joint effusion [^117KwPXg]. Degenerative/structural: knee osteoarthritis, patellofemoral pain, osteonecrosis, osteochondritis dissecans, and adolescent traction apophysitis account for much of chronic and anterior knee pain across ages [^117KwPXg].

> Hmm, wait a minute — chondromalacia patellae. I initially listed it as a diagnostic label, but I should correct myself. Chondromalacia is a surgical or imaging finding rather than a stand-alone clinical diagnosis; clinically we should frame this as patellofemoral pain unless corroborated intraoperatively or by advanced imaging for specific indications [^116W4zw6].

> For trauma-related conditions, I need to ensure I capture internal derangements. Meniscal pathology typically causes joint line tenderness, mechanical symptoms, and effusion; ACL or PCL injury presents with instability and positive Lachman or drawer tests; ruptured Baker cyst can mimic DVT with acute calf swelling; fractures require decision-rule–guided radiography first. Let me double-check: physical exam maneuvers have moderate accuracy, and MRI is reserved for persistent symptoms or surgical planning after initial radiographs unless occult fracture/internal derangement is suspected with negative x-rays following acute trauma [^114hznr3] [^114iToWE].

> For arthritic and inflammatory causes, I should confirm monoarticular crystal disease versus polyarticular autoimmune patterns. Gout and CPPD present as acute flares requiring synovial fluid analysis for definitive diagnosis; rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis or reactive arthritis manifest with inflammatory features such as morning stiffness > 30 minutes and multi-joint involvement, guiding targeted serologies and imaging when indicated [^117KwPXg]. Infectious and systemic etiologies include septic arthritis and Lyme disease; broader systemic causes like SLE or fibromyalgia can contribute to knee pain but require careful history and exam correlation to avoid overtesting [^117KwPXg].

> Let me consider neuropathic and other joint-related disorders. Central pain augmentation and saphenous neuritis can mimic joint pathology. I should double-check that CAP-Knee and related constructs help identify central mechanisms; saphenous neuritis can produce medial allodynia and responds diagnostically to targeted local anesthetic injection, which is worth remembering when structural workups are unrevealing [^116H7p6q] [^1135EDze].

> But wait, what if a mass or unexplained night pain is present? Neoplastic conditions such as synovial sarcoma or osteosarcoma are rare but critical; chronic swelling from tenosynovial giant cell tumor also enters the differential. Persistent, progressive, or systemic features should prompt imaging escalation and referral to avoid delays in diagnosis [^117KwPXg].

> I should not forget metabolic and crystal deposition disease beyond gout, particularly CPPD. Chondrocalcinosis on radiographs in older adults with acute monoarthritis is a clue, but I need to remind myself that joint aspiration with crystal identification remains the diagnostic standard when feasible to separate CPPD from septic arthritis [^117KwPXg].

> Next, I should review imaging pathways to avoid overuse and missed pathology. Wait, I almost said MRI first for chronic pain — that would be premature. For chronic knee pain (> 6 weeks), obtain knee radiographs first; advanced imaging is reserved for unclear diagnoses, surgical planning, or refractory symptoms. For acute trauma, start with radiographs guided by decision rules; if films are negative but suspicion for occult fracture or internal derangement remains, proceed to MRI. Ultrasound is useful for effusions, cysts, and superficial structures. I should confirm these steps align with ACR 2018 chronic and 2020 acute criteria, which they do [^112U1Un6] [^1173JbUm].

> I need to ensure the lab and procedural algorithm is explicit. In any hot, swollen knee with suspicion for infection or crystal disease, arthrocentesis with cell count, Gram stain, culture, and crystal analysis is mandatory; inflammatory arthritis workups can include ESR/CRP, RF/anti-CCP, and targeted testing based on history. Routine labs are otherwise unnecessary in straightforward mechanical presentations, which aligns with primary care guidance emphasizing history and examination first [^1173sAtq].

> Let me synthesize distinguishing clinical patterns to make this actionable. Patellofemoral pain usually presents as anterior pain worse with stairs, squatting, and prolonged sitting and is diagnosed clinically without routine imaging in younger active patients. Osteoarthritis presents with activity-related pain, brief morning stiffness, and crepitus, often corroborated by weight-bearing radiographs. Meniscal tears cause mechanical symptoms and joint line tenderness, with MRI considered when symptoms persist or surgery is planned. These anchor diagnoses help prioritize tests while avoiding unnecessary imaging in low-risk scenarios [^112y4AhH] [^113RDy5J] [^114hznr3].

> Hold on, I should verify the "rare but important" alerts I flagged. In adolescents with unexplained severe bone pain and concerning imaging, Gaucher disease can masquerade as osteomyelitis or tumor; recognizing the possibility and checking β-glucocerebrosidase activity and GBA mutation testing can prevent delays in appropriate therapy. I will keep this as a low-frequency, high-impact addition to the differential in selected cases [^117LZFtg].

> Finally, I need to integrate pain mechanisms because structure does not always explain symptoms. There is consistent evidence for central sensitization in subsets of knee OA and patellofemoral pain; tools like CAP-Knee can help phenotype patients where pain is disproportionate to structural findings, influencing counseling and treatment selection. This explains why some patients hurt despite modest imaging abnormalities and reinforces the need for mechanism-informed care paths alongside structural diagnoses [^116jY3Nk] [^116H7p6q].

Knee pain has a broad differential, including **traumatic injuries** (ligamentous, meniscal, fractures), **degenerative conditions** (osteoarthritis, meniscal degeneration), **inflammatory arthritides** (rheumatoid, psoriatic, gout, pseudogout), **infectious causes** (septic arthritis, osteomyelitis), and **overuse syndromes** (patellofemoral pain, iliotibial band, bursitis, tendinopathies) [^117KwPXg]. Evaluation should be guided by **history, physical examination, and imaging**: obtain radiographs for trauma or chronic pain [^1173JbUm] [^112U1Un6], MRI for suspected internal derangement [^114iToWE], and ultrasound for effusions or superficial structures [^1152ewor]. **Red flags** (fever, inability to bear weight, acute swelling, deformity) require urgent assessment to exclude infection, fracture, or acute inflammatory arthritis [^1173sAtq] [^114hznr3] [^1173sAtq].

---

## Traumatic injuries

Traumatic injuries commonly cause **acute knee pain** and are usually associated with a clear injury [^114hznr3].

- **Ligamentous injuries**: anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injuries present with instability, swelling, and pain [^117KwPXg] [^114hznr3].

- **Meniscal injuries**: medial or lateral meniscal tears cause joint line tenderness, locking, or clicking sensations [^117KwPXg] [^1141fbYX].

- **Fractures**: patellar, tibial plateau, femoral condyle, or proximal tibial fractures present with severe pain, swelling, and inability to bear weight [^117KwPXg] [^1173JbUm].

---

## Degenerative conditions

Degenerative conditions are common in older adults and typically present with **chronic, progressive pain**. **Osteoarthritis (OA)** is characterized by pain worsened with activity and relieved by rest, morning stiffness, crepitus, and reduced range of motion [^113Zy4XH] [^113RDy5J]. **Degenerative meniscal tears** are common in older adults, often associated with OA, and present with joint line tenderness and mechanical symptoms [^117KwPXg] [^116HnEUn].

---

## Inflammatory arthritides

Inflammatory arthritides present with **joint inflammation, swelling, and systemic symptoms**. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) causes symmetrical joint involvement and morning stiffness, while psoriatic arthritis is associated with psoriasis and presents with dactylitis and enthesitis. Gout is an acute inflammatory arthritis caused by urate crystal deposition, presenting with sudden severe pain, swelling, and erythema, whereas pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease) presents similarly due to calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition [^117KwPXg] [^1173sAtq].

---

## Infectious causes

Infectious causes of knee pain require **urgent evaluation and treatment**. **Septic arthritis** is an acute joint infection presenting with severe pain, swelling, erythema, fever, and inability to bear weight. **Osteomyelitis** is a bone infection causing localized pain, swelling, and systemic symptoms [^1173sAtq] [^114hznr3].

---

## Overuse syndromes

Overuse syndromes are common in **active individuals and athletes**. Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) causes anterior knee pain aggravated by activities involving knee flexion, such as running or squatting [^112y4AhH]. Iliotibial band syndrome presents with lateral knee pain associated with repetitive knee flexion and extension; bursitis of the prepatellar, infrapatellar, or pes anserine bursae causes localized pain and swelling. Tendinopathies include patellar tendinopathy ("jumper's knee"), quadriceps tendinopathy, and hamstring tendinopathy, causing localized pain and tenderness.

---

## Pediatric and adolescent considerations

Knee pain in **children and adolescents** often differs from that in adults and includes unique conditions [^111QPzZu]. Osgood-Schlatter disease is tibial apophysitis causing anterior knee pain in adolescents; osteochondritis dissecans is a subchondral bone lesion causing knee pain and mechanical symptoms. Patellar instability involves recurrent patellar dislocation or subluxation causing anterior knee pain [^116W4zw6].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation

Certain symptoms indicate serious underlying conditions and **require immediate evaluation** [^1173sAtq]:

- **Inability to bear weight**: suggests fracture, severe ligamentous injury, or septic arthritis [^114hznr3].

- **Acute swelling and deformity**: indicates fracture, dislocation, or severe ligamentous injury.

- **Fever and systemic symptoms**: suggest septic arthritis or osteomyelitis [^1173sAtq].

- **Severe pain with limited range of motion**: indicates acute inflammatory arthritis or septic arthritis [^117KwPXg].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A systematic diagnostic approach includes:

- **History and physical examination**: assess pain characteristics, trauma history, systemic symptoms, and perform targeted physical examination [^1173sAtq].

- **Imaging**: radiographs for acute trauma or chronic pain [^1173JbUm] [^112U1Un6], MRI for suspected internal derangement [^114iToWE], ultrasound for effusions or superficial structures [^1152ewor].

- **Laboratory tests**: inflammatory markers, joint aspiration for suspected infection or crystal arthropathy [^1173sAtq].

---

Knee pain has a broad differential spanning traumatic, degenerative, inflammatory, infectious, and overuse etiologies. A systematic approach — history, physical examination, imaging, and laboratory testing — is essential for **accurate diagnosis and management** [^113RDy5J].

### Knee pain in adults and adolescents: The initial evaluation [^1173sAtq]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Knee pain affects approximately 25% of adults, and its prevalence has increased almost 65% over the past 20 years, accounting for nearly 4 million primary care visits annually. Initial evaluation should emphasize excluding urgent causes while considering the need for referral. Key aspects of the patient history include age; location, onset, duration, and quality of pain; associated mechanical or systemic symptoms; history of swelling; description of precipitating trauma; and pertinent medical or surgical history. Patients requiring urgent referral generally have severe pain, swelling, and instability or inability to bear weight in association with acute trauma, or have signs of joint infection such as fever, swelling, erythema, and limited range of motion.

A systematic approach to examination of the knee includes inspection, palpation, evaluation of range of motion and strength, neurovascular testing, and special (provocative) tests. Radiographic imaging should be reserved for chronic knee pain (more than six weeks) or acute traumatic pain in patients who meet specific evidence-based criteria. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography allows for detailed evaluation of effusions, cysts (e.g. Baker cyst), and superficial structures. Magnetic resonance imaging is rarely used for patients with emergent cases and should generally be an option only when surgery is considered or when a patient experiences persistent pain despite adequate conservative treatment. When the initial history and physical examination suggest, but do not confirm, a specific diagnosis, laboratory tests can be used as appropriate.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute trauma to the knee [^114iToWE]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for patellofemoral pain syndrome, especially concerning diagnostic imaging for acute knee pain, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining a knee MRI for evaluating suspected occult knee fractures or internal derangement. This applies following a fall or acute twisting trauma to the knee in adult or pediatric patients (either skeletally mature or immature) with a negative radiograph.

### Determinants of pain and functioning in knee osteoarthritis: A one-year prospective study [^116wXMbS]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

The strengths of the present study include the repeated examination of various pain, function, and psychological outcomes. The use of X-ray with at least the Kellgren-Lawrence scale 2 for knee osteoarthritis confirms the diagnosis. Furthermore, the study sample can be considered representative of ordinary community-dwelling knee osteoarthritis patients. Most of the participants (77%, n = 86) were enrolled as a result of a previous referral for a knee X-ray by their general practitioners.

On the other hand, a central limitation of this analysis could be the overly strict selection of study patients due to the inclusion criteria of the original randomized controlled trial. Firstly, the candidates had to exhibit a high WOMAC pain subscale level (VAS ≥ 40/100 mm) to be included, leading to the exclusion of almost half of the candidates (47%, n = 209) because their WOMAC pain level was too low. Secondly, the recruitment process may have resulted in selecting patients who were more active and had better psychological well-being than the average knee osteoarthritis patient.

This analysis adds to the limited number of prospective studies concerning the impact of psychological factors on pain and function in knee osteoarthritis patients. To our knowledge, the results provide new information on the predictive role of pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, and life satisfaction in self-reported pain and function for this patient group.

### Relationship between knee pain and infrapatellar fat pad morphology: A within- and between-person analysis from the Osteoarthritis Initiative [^113LT236]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Inflammation is known to be strongly associated with knee pain in osteoarthritis, with the infrapatellar fat pad representing a potential source of proinflammatory cytokines. However, the relationship between infrapatellar fat pad morphology and osteoarthritis symptoms remains unclear.

- **Methods**: We investigated quantitative imaging parameters of infrapatellar fat pad morphology between painful and contralateral pain-free legs of subjects with unilateral knee pain, as well as between patients with chronic knee pain and matched pain-free control subjects. A total of 46 subjects with strictly unilateral frequent knee pain and bilateral radiographic osteoarthritis (Kellgren/Lawrence grade 2/3) were drawn from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. Additionally, 43 subjects with chronic knee pain over 4 years and 43 matched pain-free controls without pain over this period were studied. Infrapatellar fat pad morphology (volume, surface area, and depth) was determined by manual segmentation of sagittal magnetic resonance images.

- **Results**: No significant differences in infrapatellar fat pad morphology were observed between painful versus painless knees of persons with strictly unilateral knee pain (mean difference -0.7% [95% CI -0.6, 0.9; P = 0.64]) or between chronically painful knees versus matched painless controls (-2.1% [95% CI -2.2, 1.1]; P = 0.51).

- **Conclusion**: Independent of the ambiguous role of the infrapatellar fat pad in knee osteoarthritis — as a potential source of proinflammatory cytokines or a mechanical shock absorber — the size of the infrapatellar fat pad does not show significant differences in morphology between painful and painless knees.

### Early-stage symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee - time for action [^116ny4zh]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) remains the most challenging arthritic disorder, characterized by a high burden of disease and the absence of disease-modifying treatments. Symptomatic early-stage OA of the knee, the focus of this review, urgently needs to be identified and defined. Efficient early-stage case finding and diagnosis in primary care would enable health-care providers to proactively and substantially reduce the burden of the disease through proper management. This includes structured education, exercise, weight management (when needed), and addressing lifestyle-related risk factors for disease progression.

Efforts to define patient populations with symptomatic early-stage knee OA based on validated classification criteria are ongoing. Such criteria, along with the identification of molecular and imaging biomarkers of disease risk and/or progression, would enable well-designed clinical studies. These studies facilitate interventional trials and aid in discovering and validating cellular and molecular targets for novel therapies.

Treatment strategies, relevant outcomes, and ethical issues need to be considered in the context of the cost-effective management of symptomatic early-stage knee OA. To advance, a multidisciplinary and sustained international effort involving all major stakeholders is required.

### Gaucher disease: an unusual cause of knee pain [^117LZFtg]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Gaucher disease (GD) is a genetic lysosomal disorder leading to the storage of the glycolipid molecule glucocerebroside in macrophages, causing multiorgan dysfunction. Bone marrow involvement may result in painful bone crisis and hematologic disturbance.

- **Case report**: We present a case of a 13-year-old adolescent boy with right knee pain. Radiograph and magnetic resonance imaging of the distal femur indicated possible osteomyelitis or bone tumor. However, histologic examination of bone biopsy material suggested the diagnosis of GD, which was confirmed by detection of decreased β-glucocerebrosidase activity and identification of the exact gene mutation.

Many visceral and bone abnormalities of GD have been described. The diagnosis of GD is based on clinical and laboratory findings and is established by the measurement of β-glucocerebrosidase dysfunction and the study of GBA gene mutations. Treatment is currently based on enzyme replacement and substrate reduction.

This is a rare case of GD presenting initially with knee pain. Because early diagnosis is important for the treatment of this condition, orthopaedic surgeons should consider this uncommon cause in the differential diagnosis of joint pain.

### Reduced strength, poor balance and concern about falls mediate the relationship between knee pain and fall risk in older people [^112c8SGY]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Pain is an independent risk factor for falling with one in two older community-dwelling people with musculoskeletal pain experiencing a fall each year. This study examined physical, psychological, and medical factors as potential mediators to explain the relationship between knee pain and falls.

- **Methods**: Three hundred and thirty-three community-dwelling people aged 70+ years (52% women) participated in this cohort study with a one-year follow-up for falls. Participants completed questionnaires about medical history, general health, and concern about falls, and underwent physical performance tests. They were classified into 'pain' and 'no pain' groups based on self-reported knee pain. Poisson Regression models were computed to determine the relative risk (RR) of having multiple falls and potential mediators for increased fall risk.

- **Results**: One hundred and eighteen (36%) participants were categorized as having knee pain. This group took more medications and had more medical conditions (P < 0.01) compared to the no-pain group. Participants with knee pain had poorer balance, physical function, and strength and reported increased concern about falls. Sixty-one participants (20%) reported two or more falls, with the pain group being twice as likely to experience multiple falls over the 12-month follow-up (RR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.27–3.13). Concern about falls, knee extension torque, and postural sway with eyes closed were identified as significant and independent mediators of fall risk, and when combined explained 23% of the relationship between knee pain and falls.

- **Conclusion**: This study has identified that…

### Prognostic factors for adolescent knee pain: an individual participant data meta-analysis of 1281 patients [^115oGhhW]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

Adolescent knee pain has a propensity for chronicity, impacting physical activity and health into adulthood. The aim of this study is to investigate prognostic factors in adolescents with knee pain using individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. Studies were identified through a systematic search and a collaborative group. We included IPD from prospective studies of adolescents (age 10–19 years) with nontraumatic knee pain (13 studies and 1516 adolescents with 1281 unique participants). Primary outcomes were pain intensity and function (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score "Sport/Rec" subscale). The primary endpoint was 12 months. The risk of bias was appraised with the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Harmonised IPD was analysed by multilevel modelling.

Fifty-one percent reported knee pain after 12 months. Lower baseline pain frequency was associated with lower pain intensity at 12 months ("less than weekly" resulted in 12 points lower on a 100-point pain scale, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7–17, and "monthly" resulted in 15 points lower, 95% CI 9–22, compared with "almost daily pain"). Other factors most strongly associated with 1-year pain prognosis were lower quality of life (30 points lower, 95% CI 19–42, per unit change in the EQ5D index score), female sex (8 points higher, 95% CI 4–12, compared with males), and bilateral pain (7 points higher, 95% CI 1–13). Similar factors were associated with function. Body mass index, pain sensitivity, and knee strength were not associated with the prognosis of pain or function. Adolescent knee pain is associated with clinically relevant long-term pain.

### Association between radiographic features of knee osteoarthritis and pain: Results from two cohort studies [^116S6Fu7]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

We conducted separate analyses for MOST and Framingham concerning frequent knee pain. The other two pain measures were assessed only in MOST. We identified individuals with knees discordant for each pain measure separately. Two discordant knees within a person then formed a matched set for a specific pain measurement.

Specifically, in analyzing the association of radiographic osteoarthritis with the presence of frequent knee pain, eligible participants were those who experienced frequent knee pain in one knee but not in the contralateral knee. For evaluating the relationship of radiographic knee osteoarthritis to the consistency of frequent knee pain, eligible participants were those whose knees were discordant in the consistency of frequent knee pain as follows: one knee had consistent frequent knee pain, and the contralateral knee had no frequent knee pain; one knee had inconsistent frequent knee pain, and the contralateral knee had no frequent knee pain; or one knee had consistent frequent knee pain, and the contralateral knee had inconsistent frequent knee pain.

For the severity of knee pain, we initially classified knees into three categories based on the maximal WOMAC score on any of the five pain questions: severe to extreme pain (maximal WOMAC score of 3 or 4 on any of the five pain questions), mild to moderate pain (maximal WOMAC score of 1 or 2 on any of the five pain questions), and no pain (maximal WOMAC score of 0 on all five pain questions). We then selected participants whose knees were discordant in categories of pain severity.

### Risk factors for patellofemoral pain syndrome: A systematic review [^112YAGb2]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

This systematic review aims to systematically outline the risk factors for patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). PFPS is the most commonly diagnosed condition in young individuals with knee complaints. Its high incidence among athletes suggests a possibility of prevention, with the first step being the identification of possible risk factors.

- **Methods**: Prospective studies that included 20 or more patients with PFPS and examined at least one possible risk factor for PFPS were included. An assessment list was applied to evaluate the quality of the studies. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. Significant differences were based on calculated mean differences, with matching 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For dichotomous data, odds ratios or relative risks were calculated.

- **Results**: Of the 3845 potentially relevant articles, 7 were included in this review. These studies examined a total of 135 variables, and pooling was possible for 13 potential risk factors. The pooled data showed that knee extension peak torques were significantly lower in the PFPS group than in controls. Mean differences in torque, with negative differences reflecting lower means in the PFPS group, were as follows: (a) standardized relative to body weight at 60°/s, -0.24 Nm (95% CI: -0.39, -0.09); (b) standardized relative to body weight at 240°/s, -0.11 Nm (95% CI: -0.17, -0.05); (c) standardized relative to body mass index at 60°/s, -0.84 Nm (95% CI: -1.23, -0.44); (d) standardized relative to body mass index at 240°/s, -0.32 Nm (95% CI: -0.52, -0.12).

### Manifestations of pain sensitization across different painful knee disorders: A systematic review including meta-analysis and metaregression [^116jY3Nk]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Previous reviews have reported that manifestations of pain sensitization may play an important role in the pain experienced by people with knee osteoarthritis. However, it is unknown if manifestations of pain sensitization are common features across other painful knee disorders or if sensitization requires targeted intervention. This review aims to synthesize the published research investigating manifestations of pain sensitization in painful knee disorders and to evaluate if the manifestations of pain sensitization change in response to treatment.

The systematic review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015024211). We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Sportsdiscus, and Cochrane Central for studies that investigated between-group differences (knee pain vs. pain-free subjects) or the effect of treatment on manifestations of pain sensitization. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and quality. Available data were synthesized via predetermined levels of evidence, meta-analysis, and metaregression where possible.

Fifty-two studies investigating evidence related to pain sensitization distributed across four different painful knee disorders were identified.

Our meta-analysis provides evidence of pain sensitization in people with knee osteoarthritis (strong evidence), people with patellofemoral pain (moderate evidence), and postmeniscectomy patients (very limited evidence). However, conflicting evidence exists in patellar tendinopathy. Metaregression indicates that pain is associated with…

### Association between radiographic features of knee osteoarthritis and pain: Results from two cohort studies [^117SgAsm]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

In contrast to such studies, by taking advantage of nature, we compared two knees within a person in whom the two knees had different levels of pain. When all person-level factors influencing pain contribute equally to both knees, we are asking why, in an individual person, one knee has pain (or more pain) whereas the other does not (or has less pain). This novel approach eliminates between-person confounding, allowing us to obtain valid effect estimates of radiographic osteoarthritis or specific radiographic features on knee pain, even in mild osteoarthritis.

Secondly, as a substantial proportion of people with knee osteoarthritis have intermittent pain, this temporal variability further complicates observational studies of knee pain. For example, a person or knee can be misclassified as being pain-free when pain status has been ascertained at only a single time point when the person was not experiencing pain but had experienced pain recently, or vice versa. Thus, as with previous studies, our study design is also susceptible to unadjusted potential time-varying factors. Nevertheless, such misclassification is likely to be non-differential in our study design and would dilute the true estimates towards the null. In MOST, we assessed participants' pain status at two proximate time points by using these two times to define consistency of knee pain. As the pathological features of osteoarthritis are generally believed not to regress, one may expect that people with more consistent knee pain would have greater underlying pathology. Indeed, in our study, we found stronger ass

### Nonopioid pharmacologic management of chronic noncancer pain [^117UvspK]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for knee osteoarthritis, specifically concerning non-opioid analgesics, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend considering topical NSAIDs as a first-line pain treatment for patients with knee osteoarthritis due to their effectiveness and minimal adverse effects. This is followed by oral NSAIDs, which have similar effectiveness but more adverse effects, and then duloxetine.

### Consensus methods in patellofemoral pain: How rigorous are they? A scoping review [^111P4pP9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Clinicians treating patients with patellofemoral pain (PFP) rely on consensus statements to make the best practice recommendations in the absence of definitive evidence on how to manage PFP. However, the methods used to generate and assess agreement for these recommendations have not been examined. Our objective was to map the methods used to generate consensus-based recommendations for PFP and apply four novel questions to assess the rigour of consensus development.

- **Design**: Scoping review.

- **Data sources**: We searched Medline, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Embase from inception to May 2022 to identify consensus-derived statements or practice guidelines on PFP. The Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis was followed to map the existing evidence. We measured the consensus methods based on four sets of questions addressing the panel composition, application of the consensus method chosen, agreement process, and the use of evidence mapping.

- **Eligibility criteria**: All consensus statements or clinical guidelines on PFP were considered.

- **Results**: Twenty-two PFP consensus statements were identified.
	- **Panel composition**: 3 of the 22 (14%) consensus groups reported the panellists' experience, 2 (9%) defined a desired level of expertise, 10 (45%) reported panellist sex, and only 2 (9%) included a patient.
	- **Consensus method**: 7 of 22 (32%) reported using an established method of consensus measurement/development.
	- **Agreement process**: 10 of 22 (45%) reported their consensus threshold, and 2 (9%) acknowledged dissenting opinions among the panel.
	- **Evidence mapping**: 6 of 22 (27%) reported evidence mapping.

### Magnetic resonance imaging-defined osteoarthritis features and anterior knee pain in individuals with, or at risk for, knee osteoarthritis: A multicenter study on osteoarthritis [^113VxXzB]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Low credibility.

Pain is a key feature of knee osteoarthritis (OA) that limits function and quality of life. Despite the assumption that structural features of OA are directly associated with knee pain, imaging studies have revealed a discordance (i.e. lack of a strong association or conflicting findings) between knee OA structural features and pain. While early studies focused exclusively on the tibiofemoral joint, later studies demonstrated that including patellofemoral joint images reduced this apparent discordance. Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) is prevalent in approximately 40–50% of individuals with knee symptoms. In addition to pain, it is associated with decreased function and lower quality of life. Importantly, PFOA is often the first manifestation of early knee OA, with subsequent progression to involve the tibiofemoral joint. A deeper investigation into the relationship between PFOA and pain could refine our understanding of this discordance phenomenon and provide insights into earlier manifestations of knee OA that could inform future trial design. Understanding this relationship better is particularly important because knee OA treatments are often prescribed with the belief that they address underlying structural damage or inflammation that is believed to cause the pain.

- **Significance & innovations**: Patellofemoral joint–related structural damage is believed to cause localized anterior knee pain (AKP); however, this association has not been evaluated in patellofemoral osteoarthritis (OA). We used two different study designs within the same study to robustly examine this.

### Patellofemoral pain [^112y4AhH]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral pain refers to pain behind or around the patella (also known as patellofemoral pain syndrome, anterior knee pain, runner's knee, and, formerly, chondromalacia patellae). Patellofemoral pain is common, accounting for 11–17% of all knee pain presentations to general practice. While it typically occurs in physically active people under 40 years of age, it also affects individuals of all activity levels and ages. Patellofemoral pain can be diagnosed in the clinic, and evidence-based treatments can reduce pain and improve function, allowing patients to maintain a physically active lifestyle.

### The long-term consequence of anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus injuries: Osteoarthritis [^115a3y1k]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study are to review the long-term consequences of injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci, the pathogenic mechanisms, and the causes of the considerable variability in outcomes. Injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci are common in both athletes and the general population. On average, 10 to 20 years after the diagnosis, 50% of those with a diagnosed anterior cruciate ligament or meniscus tear have osteoarthritis with associated pain and functional impairment, often described as the young patient with an old knee. These individuals make up a substantial proportion of the overall osteoarthritis population.

There is a lack of evidence to support a protective role of repair or reconstructive surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament or meniscus against osteoarthritis development. A consistent finding in a review of the literature is the often poor reporting of critical study variables, which precludes data pooling or a meta-analysis. Osteoarthritis development in injured joints is caused by intra-articular pathogenic processes initiated at the time of injury, combined with long-term changes in dynamic joint loading.

Variation in outcomes is influenced by additional variables associated with the individual, such as age, sex, genetics, obesity, muscle strength, activity, and reinjury. A better understanding of these variables may improve future prevention and treatment strategies. In evaluating medical treatment, we now expect large randomized clinical trials complemented by postmarketing monitoring, and we should strive toward a comparable level of quality.

### The central aspects of pain in the knee (CAP-Knee) questionnaire; a mixed-methods study of a self-report instrument for assessing central mechanisms in people with knee pain [^116H7p6q]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2021). Low credibility.

Clinical decision support tools have the potential to greatly enhance a clinician's ability to carefully subgroup patients and inform mechanism-based treatment allocation in primary care settings. Employing such tools could inform the choice of tailored stratified treatment pathways for individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain. However, such tools are not widely available for widespread use in clinical practice.

We have therefore developed a simple questionnaire, the Central Aspects of Pain in the Knee (CAP-Knee), comprising self-report items measuring each of the eight characteristics that contribute to the Central Mechanisms trait in people with knee pain. We hypothesized that this Central Mechanism trait is associated with both sensory and emotional components of knee pain. We show that CAP-Knee is interpreted appropriately, psychometrically valid and reliable, and is associated with sensory and affective components of pain severity in people with knee pain.

### Potential surrogate outcomes in individuals at high risk for incident knee osteoarthritis [^114qifww]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2023). High credibility.

To study potential surrogate outcomes for osteoarthritis (OA) incidence, this research evaluated the association of short-term changes in clinical and imaging biomarkers with long-term clinical knee OA incidence.

Middle-aged women with overweight or obesity, but free of knee symptoms, were recruited through their general practitioners. At baseline, after 2.5 years, and after 6.5 years, questionnaires, physical examinations, radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained. The percentage of knees with a minimal clinically important difference for knee pain severity, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain, stiffness, function, and joint space narrowing were determined. Additionally, progression or regression of medial knee alignment, chronic knee pain, radiographic osteophytes, and cartilage defects, bone marrow lesions, osteophytes, and effusion/synovitis on MRI were assessed. For each of these potential surrogate outcomes with ≥ 10% improvement or progression in the population over 2.5 years, their association with incident clinical knee OA, defined using the combined ACR criteria, after 6.5 years was determined.

Most pre-defined potential surrogate outcomes showed ≥ 10% change in the population over 2.5 years. However, only worsening of TF cartilage defects, worsening of TF osteophytes on MRI, and an increase in pain severity were significantly associated with greater clinical knee OA incidence after 6.5 years. These potential surrogate outcomes had high specificity and negative predictive value (89–91%) but exhibited low sensitivity.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of anterior knee pain [^116W4zw6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Pain receptors are present within several knee structures, including the patella, synovium, fat pad, tendon, subchondral bone, and quadriceps retinaculum. Any of these structures, individually or in combination, can cause anterior knee pain. Most causes of anterior knee pain involve the patellofemoral joint and the extensor mechanism of the knee. The term anterior knee pain is often used interchangeably with patellofemoral pain. Previous literature has also interchanged the term "chondromalacia patella" with anterior knee pain; however, this is now out of favor, as chondromalacia patella is a surgical finding, not a diagnosis. Patients with anterior knee pain do not necessarily have chondromalacia patella, and patients with chondromalacia do not uniformly have pain. Anterior knee pain may be caused by conditions unique to the growing pediatric skeleton, including hip disease (slipped capital femoral epiphyses and Perthe's disease) or osteochondroses (Osgood-Schlatter disease or Sinding-Larsen-Johansen disease). Anterior knee pain is occasionally caused by serious underlying systemic diseases, including inflammatory conditions and malignancies.

### Evaluation of acute knee pain in primary care [^114hznr3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The evaluation of acute knee pain often includes radiography of the knee. The objective of this study was to synthesize the literature to determine the role of radiologic procedures in evaluating common causes of acute knee pain: fractures, meniscal or ligamentous injuries, osteoarthritis, and pseudogout.

- **Data sources**: A MEDLINE search was conducted from 1966 to October 2002.

- **Study selection**: All published, peer-reviewed studies of decision rules for fractures were included. Studies that used arthroscopy as the gold standard for measuring the accuracy of the physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for meniscal and ligamentous knee damage were considered. Additionally, all studies on the use of radiographs in pseudogout were included.

- **Data extraction**: Data were extracted in duplicate, and physical examination and MRI results were abstracted into 2 x 2 tables.

- **Data synthesis**: Among the five decision rules for deciding when to use plain films in knee fractures, the Ottawa knee rules (injury due to trauma and age > 55 years, tenderness at the head of the fibula or the patella, inability to bear weight for four steps, or inability to flex the knee to 90 degrees) have the strongest supporting evidence. When the history suggests a potential meniscal or ligamentous injury, the physical examination is moderately sensitive (meniscus, 87%; anterior cruciate ligament, 74%; and posterior cruciate ligament, 81%) and specific (meniscus, 92%; anterior cruciate ligament, 95%; and posterior cruciate ligament, 95%). The Lachman test is more sensitive and specific for ligamentous tears than the drawer sign.

Knee pain in children and adolescents is one of the most prevalent complaints in a pediatric practice, accounting for at least a third of musculoskeletal complaints. Accurate diagnosis requires an understanding of knee anatomy, patterns of knee injuries, and skill in physical examination.

### Consistency of knee pain: correlates and association with function [^113ueKv1]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2010). Low credibility.

The extent and factors associated with knee pain fluctuation are not well-known. We evaluated the prevalence, correlates, and association with function of consistency of knee pain.

- **Design**: Participants of the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study, a cohort of individuals with or at high risk of knee osteoarthritis (OA), had baseline knee X-rays, questionnaires, and a question about frequent knee pain (FKnP) (pain on most of the past 30 days) at two time points: a telephone screen and a later clinic visit. We computed the prevalence of inconsistent knee pain (positive answer to FKnP question at only one time point) and consistent knee pain (positive answer to FKnP question at both time points). We evaluated the association of consistency of FKnP with a number of sociodemographic factors, pain severity, and function.

- **Results**: There were 2940 participants with complete data (5867 knees) (mean age 62, mean body mass index (BMI) 30.7, 60% female). Of those, 2977 knees had pain, with 43% having inconsistent and 57% having consistent knee pain. Those with radiographic OA [odds ratio (OR) 0.46], depressive symptoms (OR 0.73), and widespread pain (OR 0.68) (all P < 0.05) were less likely to have inconsistent compared with consistent knee pain. Pain, function, and strength were significantly better in persons with two knees that had inconsistent compared with consistent pain.

- **Conclusions**: A substantial proportion of persons with knee pain have inconsistent knee pain, associated with better physical function and strength (adjusting for pain severity).

### Qualitative study exploring the meaning of knee symptoms to adults ages 35–65 years [^116iRwtj]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Participants explained knee symptoms by recounting their personal biographies and relating their symptoms to prior actions, incidents, personal characteristics, or family history. While participants' explanations of the cause varied, a common feature across their accounts was at least partial attribution of symptoms to actions or incidents that were modifiable.

Some participants, particularly adults with a diagnosis of OA, understood their symptoms as overuse of the joint. Participants described the activities they thought may have contributed to their knee problems, including leisure activities (e.g. martial arts) and occupations that required extensive walking, kneeling, or lifting. Participants used language such as "abuse", "overuse", and "wear and tear" to describe the cause. Some participants talked about how they had "pushed" their bodies too far. They perceived the knee as having a finite capacity to withstand activity. For example, one participant, who attributed his knee pain to years of jogging and playing squash, stated, "What has happened is in some ways when you abuse or overuse it, there is a wear… in my case, I overused it more than a normal function which the body was supposed to do" (Chata, age 65, interview).

### Reduced strength, poor balance and concern about falls mediate the relationship between knee pain and fall risk in older people [^114XSWa6]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Pain is an independent risk factor for falling. One in two older community-dwelling people with musculoskeletal pain fall each year. This study examined physical, psychological, and medical factors as potential mediators to explain the relationship between knee pain and falls.

Three hundred and thirty-three community-dwelling people aged 70+ years (52% women) participated in this cohort study with a 1-year follow-up for falls. Participants completed questionnaires on medical history, general health, and concern about falls, and underwent physical performance tests. They were classified into 'pain' and 'no pain' groups based on self-reported knee pain. Poisson regression models were computed to determine the relative risk (RR) of having multiple falls and potential mediators for increased fall risk.

One hundred and eighteen (36%) participants were categorized as having knee pain. This group took more medications and had more medical conditions (P < 0.01) compared to the no pain group. The pain group had poorer balance, physical function, and strength and reported increased concern about falls. Sixty-one participants (20%) reported ≥ 2 falls, with the pain group twice as likely to experience multiple falls over the 12-month follow-up (RR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.27–3.13). Concern about falls, knee extension torque, and postural sway with eyes closed were identified as significant and independent mediators of fall risk, and when combined, explained 23% of the relationship between knee pain and falls.

### Clinical evaluation of the knee arthritis patient [^115KnExa]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The evaluation of a patient with knee osteoarthritis (OA) has three main components: clinical history, physical examination, and radiographic imaging. The clinician should assess for inciting and aggravating factors for the knee pain, as well as the presence of any mechanical symptoms. A history of prior knee injury or surgery can suggest the development of early osteoarthritis.

A thorough physical examination of the knee should be performed. Some features of OA include limited range of motion, crepitus in the patellofemoral compartment, and joint line tenderness. Depending on the severity of OA, varus or valgus alignment can develop. Special tests, such as the McMurray test for meniscal tears, may cause increased pain as patients with OA often have degenerative meniscal tears.

Weight-bearing radiographs can confirm the diagnosis of OA. Several scales exist to grade the severity of OA, with the Kellgren-Lawrence scale being one that is often used. Radiographic features of OA include joint space narrowing, osteophytes, sclerosis of bone, and bone end deformities. If after the above evaluation the diagnosis is still unclear, advanced imaging or laboratory testing can be performed to evaluate for alternative diagnoses.

### Statistical approaches to evaluating the effect of risk factors on the pain of knee osteoarthritis in longitudinal studies [^114LtN4c]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

We describe commonly used measures of knee pain in longitudinal studies and review various analytic approaches to evaluating the effect of a risk factor on each type of pain measure.

- **Recent findings**: In longitudinal epidemiologic studies of knee pain, frequent knee pain and activity-related pain severity are the most commonly used measures. Various analytic approaches have been employed to evaluate the effect of a risk factor on each type of pain measure, including the generalized estimating equations model and the mixed-effects linear regression model for pain severity assessed as a continuous outcome variable. The mixed-effects logistic regression model and conditional logistic regression model are used for pain exacerbation measured as a dichotomous outcome variable. Moreover, a mixed-effects regression model, stratified proportional odds model, and a multistate transition model are utilized for pain severity assessed as an ordinal outcome variable.

- **Summary**: Compared with cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies enable investigators to assess the effect of change in a risk factor of interest on change in the risk of knee pain or change in pain severity. With appropriate analysis methods, investigators can minimize potential confounders that differ among individuals or knees but do not vary over time within a person or knee.

### Management of patellofemoral pain syndrome [^1159UVkA]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is the most common cause of knee pain in the outpatient setting. It is caused by imbalances in the forces controlling patellar tracking during knee flexion and extension, particularly with overloading of the joint. Risk factors include overuse, trauma, muscle dysfunction, tight lateral restraints, patellar hypermobility, and poor quadriceps flexibility.

Typical symptoms include pain behind or around the patella that increases with running and activities involving knee flexion. Findings in patients with PFPS range from limited patellar mobility to a hypermobile patella. To confirm the diagnosis, an examination of the knee focusing on the patella and surrounding structures is essential.

For many patients with the clinical diagnosis of PFPS, imaging studies are not necessary before beginning treatment. Radiography is recommended for patients with a history of trauma or surgery, those with an effusion, those older than 50 years (to rule out osteoarthritis), and those whose pain does not improve with treatment.

Recent research has shown that physical therapy is effective in treating PFPS. There is little evidence to support the routine use of knee braces or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Surgery should be considered only after the failure of a comprehensive rehabilitation program. Educating patients about the modification of risk factors is important in preventing recurrence.

### Gaucher disease: An unusual cause of knee pain [^1174sTn1]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Bone pain may be an early manifestation in patients with Gaucher disease (GD), especially in childhood and adolescence. Because it generally occurs along with elevated inflammatory markers and signs of local inflammation, a possible misdiagnosis of osteomyelitis may delay adequate therapy and allow progression of bone involvement. The differential diagnosis between these two conditions is challenging. During bone crises in GD, MRI illustrates high signal intensity of the bone marrow in T2-weighted images because of edema; however, osteomyelitis presents with similar imaging. Most frequently, the only clue in favor of GD is negative cultures following a biopsy. Nevertheless, a diagnostic suspicion of GD may prompt measurement of β-glucocerebrosidase, which, in combination with DNA analysis, can confirm the diagnosis without any orthopedic intervention.

### Saphenous neuritis: A poorly understood cause of medial knee pain [^1135EDze]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2002). Low credibility.

Saphenous neuritis is a painful condition caused by either irritation or compression at the adductor canal or elsewhere along the course of the saphenous nerve. The condition may also be associated with surgical or nonsurgical trauma to the nerve, especially at the medial or anterior aspect of the knee. Saphenous neuritis can imitate other pathologies around the knee, particularly a medial meniscal tear or osteoarthritis. Unrecognized saphenous neuritis can confuse the patient's clinical picture, complicate treatment, and compromise results. As an isolated entity, saphenous neuritis may appear in conjunction with other common problems, such as osteoarthritis and patellofemoral pain syndrome, and it can have an indolent and protracted course. Its clinical appearance is characterized by allodynia along the course of the saphenous nerve.

The diagnosis is confirmed by relief of symptoms after an injection of the affected area with a local anesthetic. Initial treatment can include non-surgical symptomatic care, treatment of associated pathology, and diagnostic or therapeutic injections of local anesthetic. In recalcitrant cases, surgical decompression and neurectomy are potential options. The key to treatment is prompt recognition; palpation of the saphenous nerve should be part of every routine examination of the knee.

### Traits associated with central pain augmentation in the knee pain in the community (KPIC) cohort [^1177YHHC]. Pain (2018). High credibility.

We hypothesize that each of these traits might reflect aspects of central pain mechanisms. By combining evidence from expert opinion and statistical analysis of questionnaire data from a community-based study in people with knee pain, we aimed to identify a concise, yet psychometrically reliable and valid set of self-report questions that measure a phenotypic trait associated with central pain augmentation, as indicated by reduced PPT at the proximal tibia, a site distal to the painful knee.

### What is the role of imaging in the clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis and disease management [^1152ewor]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is predominantly diagnosed based on clinical criteria, although imaging can assist in differential diagnosis for clinically suspected cases. Traditionally, plain radiographs are the first choice of imaging modality. However, MRI and ultrasonography (US) also play a valuable role in assessing multiple pathological features of OA, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Modern imaging modalities offer the capability to detect a broad range of osseous and soft tissue (such as cartilage, menisci, ligaments, synovitis, effusion) OA-related structural damage. Despite this, the additional information has yet to favorably influence the clinical decision-making and management process.

Imaging is recommended when there are unexpected rapid changes in clinical outcomes, to determine whether these changes are related to disease severity or an additional diagnosis. In developing specific treatments, imaging serves as a sensitive tool to measure treatment response. This narrative review aims to describe the role of imaging modalities in aiding OA diagnosis, disease progression, and management. It also provides insight into the use of these modalities in identifying targeted treatment strategies in clinical research.

### Relationship between magnetic resonance imaging features and knee pain over six years in knees without radiographic osteoarthritis at baseline [^112HpC1J]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Low credibility.

The directed acyclic graph (DAG) depicted in Figure 1 illustrates the assumptions of causal pathways between magnetic resonance imaging features and knee pain. The DAG implies the following adjustments to obtain total causal effects: meniscal tear (no adjustment required); meniscal extrusion (adjustment for meniscal tear); cartilage damage (adjustment for meniscal tear and meniscal extrusion); bone marrow lesion (BML) and bone marrow cyst (BMC) (adjustment for meniscal tear, meniscal extrusion, and cartilage damage); osteophytes (adjustment for meniscal tear and meniscal extrusion); synovitis (adjustment for meniscal tear and meniscal extrusion); and popliteal cysts (adjustment for meniscal tear, meniscal extrusion, and synovitis).

In all analyses, we assumed that the effect of structural features on pain was immediate because previous pain is unlikely to cause incident MRI features. Additionally, we assumed that previous MRI features do not confound the effect on knee pain, as it is fully mediated by MRI features. These assumptions were consistent for all time points and incorporated into the same model, allowing us to utilize the longitudinal data while examining the immediate effect of an MRI feature on knee pain. Any confounding due to central sensitization or mixing up of within and between knee effects is adjusted for using the between–within approach. In a sensitivity analysis, instead of using the sum of scores, we dichotomized each MRI exposure as present (grade 1 or higher) or absent (grade 0). Meniscal extrusion was treated as present if it was ≥ 3 mm.

### Gaucher disease: An unusual cause of knee pain [^1136o7nT]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of Gaucher disease (GD) includes a wide variety of symptoms and signs. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are common manifestations of GD. The latter is associated with hypersplenism and consequential thrombocytopenia, which may result in bleeding disorders. The spleen size in our case was near the upper limits; still, no thrombocytopenia was found.

Bone involvement in GD includes alterations of both the mineralized components and the bone marrow. As Gaucher cells gradually replace the normal mesenchymal cells of the bone marrow, osteoblastic and endothelial cell function and hematopoiesis are compromised. This may result in abnormalities in bone formation and remodeling, manifested as the long bone Erlenmeyer flask deformity, osteoporosis, bone infarction, osteonecrosis, and anemia. Bone crisis, as a result of ischemia, presents with acute, severe pain, usually around the joints. In our case, the complete blood count revealed anemia and the knee radiograph demonstrated the Erlenmeyer flask deformity of the distal femur. These findings suggested the need for additional investigation. In addition, after making the diagnosis, we concluded that the persistent periarticular knee pain, which was the main symptom of our patient, was the result of a bone crisis.

Neurologic symptoms in GD include a variety of manifestations. Central nervous system symptoms are usually present in patients with type 3 GD, manifested as seizures or epilepsy. Peripheral neuropathy and parkinsonism are associated with tremor, decreased finger dexterity, instability, and deafness.

### Traits associated with central pain augmentation in the knee pain in the community (KPIC) cohort [^117UEm5V]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Knee pain is a major source of disability, particularly in individuals over 50 years old, and it is most commonly attributed to osteoarthritis (OA). Osteoarthritis pain is perceived as originating from the joint and is often associated with structural changes or inflammation, which are exacerbated by joint loading and movement. However, OA pain can be troublesome even without severe radiographic changes and might persist after removing the peripheral nociceptive drive. Persistent pain is reported by 10% to 20% of individuals following total knee replacement for knee OA. Evidence from mechanistic studies (e.g. experimental pain testing and functional neuroimaging studies) and therapeutic trials indicates that the central nervous system (CNS) might amplify neural signaling and influence OA knee pain sensitivity, leading to central pain augmentation. Thus, optimal management of OA knee pain necessitates the identification of underlying pain mechanisms in each individual.

Quantitative sensory testing can indicate changes in pain sensitivity. Pressure pain detection thresholds (PPTs) may be reduced at a site of clinical pain, suggesting neuronal sensitization of the affected area. More widespread increased sensitivity at pain-free control sites suggests altered pain processing in the CNS. In animal models of OA, pain sensitivity (notably reduced withdrawal thresholds to punctate stimulation) at a site distal to the affected knee, such as the hindpaw, is characterized by spinal hyperexcitability of neurons innervating sites distal to the affected joint.

### Experimental pain sensitivity differs as a function of clinical pain severity in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis [^114P9nxg]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2013). Low credibility.

Pain in knee osteoarthritis (OA) has historically been attributed to peripheral pathophysiology; however, the poor correspondence between objective measures of disease severity and clinical symptoms suggests that non-local factors, such as altered central processing of painful stimuli, also contribute to clinical pain in knee OA. Consistent with this notion, recent evidence demonstrates that patients with knee OA exhibit increased sensitivity to painful stimuli at body sites unaffected by clinical pain.

To further investigate the contribution of altered pain processing to knee OA pain, the study tested the hypothesis that symptomatic knee OA is associated with enhanced sensitivity to experimental pain stimuli at the knee and at remote body sites unaffected by clinical pain. It was further anticipated that pain sensitivity would differ as a function of the OA symptom severity. Older adults with and without symptomatic knee OA completed a series of experimental pain assessments. A median split of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index of Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) was used to stratify participants into low vs. high OA symptom severity.

Compared to controls and the low symptom group, individuals in the high symptom group were more sensitive to suprathreshold heat stimuli, blunt pressure, punctuate mechanical, and cold stimuli. Individuals in the low symptomatic OA group exhibited experimental pain responses similar to the pain-free group on most measures. No group differences in endogenous pain inhibition emerged.

### Osteoarthritis pain: nociceptive or neuropathic [^111gKK65]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

In this article, we present the case for the existence of a subgroup of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) who experience pain with neuropathic features. Recognizing these patients as a distinct subgroup will allow clinicians to improve the management of their symptoms. We discuss the diagnostic criteria for pain to be classed as neuropathic, then systematically examine the applicability of these criteria to the symptoms, signs, and pathology of OA. What are the implications for the preclinical development and clinical use of analgesics for OA? How should existing treatment options be reassessed?

Differences in the etiology of OA and the pharmacological sensitivity of patients with OA pain with neuropathic features, compared with other patients with OA, might explain the frequent negative findings of clinical trials of treatments for symptomatic OA. If the global prevalence of OA pain with neuropathic features is accurately represented by reports from small experimental groups of patients, then a substantial unmet need to tailor diagnosis and therapy for these individuals exists.

### Multiple nonspecific sites of joint pain outside the knees develop in persons with knee pain [^111iRobL]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Many persons with knee pain have joint pain outside the knee, but despite the impact and high frequency of this pain, its distribution and causes have not been studied. We undertook this study to test the hypothesis of those studying gait abnormalities who have suggested that knee pain causes pain in adjacent joints but that pain adaptation strategies are highly individualized.

- **Methods**: We studied persons ages 50–79 years with or at high risk of knee osteoarthritis who were recruited from two community-based cohorts, the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study and the Osteoarthritis Initiative, and we followed them up for 5–7 years. We excluded those with knee pain at baseline and compared those who had developed knee pain at the first follow-up examination (the index visit) with those who had not. We examined pain on most days at joint regions outside the knee in examinations after the index visit. Logistic regression analyses examined the risk of joint-specific pain adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and symptoms of depression, and we performed sensitivity analyses excluding those with widespread pain.

- **Results**: In the combined cohorts, 693 persons had knee pain at the index visit and 2,793 did not. A total of 79.6% of those with bilateral knee pain and 63.8% of those with unilateral knee pain had pain during follow-up in a joint region outside the knee, compared with 49.9% of those without knee pain. There was an increased risk of pain at most extremity joint sites, without a predilection for specific sites. Results were unchanged when those with widespread pain were excluded.

### Effects of dietary intervention and quadriceps strengthening exercises on pain and function in overweight people with knee pain: Randomised controlled trial [^115oWAaQ]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

We did not ask participants to stop taking painkillers during this relatively long trial, a factor that has the potential to confound the pain outcomes, but we thought that this would have been unacceptable and would have hindered recruitment. There were no differences between the four randomisation groups concerning the self-reported use of analgesics at the start of the trial. However, those exposed to exercise reported less use and lower doses during the trial than those in the dietary group, facts that support the result of a beneficial effect from exercise but not from dietary intervention on pain.

We were interested in seeing whether we could predict at baseline those who were willing to change their behaviour, information that might aid recruitment in future studies. With the two questions we used, however, we were not able to do this. Reasons might have been respondents' varying interpretations of the word "lifestyle" and not connecting this to exercise or dietary behaviour, as these questions were asked before potential participants knew anything about the trial.

It is clear that regular exercise that strengthens the thigh (quadriceps) muscles can reduce pain and disability from knee pain and osteoarthritis. Such exercise might act by reducing the muscle weakness and impaired balance that occur with knee pain and osteoarthritis, thus directly improving the stability and health of the affected knee. This allows people to do more with their knee and to experience less pain.

### Magnetic resonance imaging-defined osteoarthritis features and anterior knee pain in individuals with, or at risk for, knee osteoarthritis: a multicenter study on osteoarthritis [^114SQyBE]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). High credibility.

Patients and methods

- **Study design**: The Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) is a cohort of individuals with, or at risk for, knee osteoarthritis (OA) (n = 3,026). Participants were aged 50–79 years at enrollment and were eligible if they were either overweight or obese, had knee pain, aching, or stiffness for most of the previous 30 days, or had a previous knee injury or surgery. Details of the study sample have been published previously. For the present study, we excluded knees with total knee arthroplasty.

- **Anterior knee pain**: In the present study, we operationalized anterior knee pain (AKP) as frequent isolated AKP, using a two-step process. First, at the in-person clinic visit, we identified knees with frequent knee pain. We defined "frequent knee pain" as a response of "yes" to the question, "During the past 30 days, have you had pain, aching, or stiffness in your knee on most days?" This question was answered for each knee separately. Next, in knees with frequent knee pain, we evaluated the participants' knee pain maps to identify knees where pain was reported to be isolated to the anterior knee region. This two-step process thus led to identifying knees with frequent isolated AKP. Knee pain maps were completed at the 60-month and 84-month visits.

### The sources of pain in knee osteoarthritis [^116doMEs]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

To review the mechanisms for the production of pain in knee osteoarthritis, recent findings have shown that nociception is produced by the stimulation of unmyelinated and small myelinated fibers in the joint and surrounding tissue. To produce pain, the stimuli must be either repeated or spatially clustered. When they reach the spinal cord, stimuli are subject to two inhibitory effectors: interneurons and descending central neurons. Inflammation lowers the threshold for nociception.

In the joint, tissues containing nociceptors include primarily the joint capsule, ligaments, synovium, bone, and, in the knee, the outer edge of the menisci. Nociceptive stimuli are likely to emanate from one or more of these locations in people with knee pain. This review does not cover psychological aspects of pain.

Nociception in the knee is complex, and the nociceptive stimuli are related to but fundamentally different from those producing cartilage loss. Better appreciation for these processes will facilitate the development of new treatments.

### Elucidating the initial symptoms and experiences of knee osteoarthritis: An international patient survey [^113UWLW5]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2025). Low credibility.

Within the first phase of developing classification criteria for early-stage symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, among individuals with knee OA, we explored the following:

- **Symptoms within the first year**: Participants reported frequently experiencing knee pain (70%), swelling (58%), crepitus (42%), stiffness (29%), and instability (24%).

- **Features indicating OA was the cause**: Few participants could provide specific clinical features, but approximately half (53%) perceived medical imaging as crucial in identifying OA.

- **Timing and reasons for seeking healthcare**: Only 35% sought healthcare within the first year of experiencing symptoms. We assessed the timing of seeking care using an ordinal scale.

We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of individuals with knee OA recruited from Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United States. Eligible individuals were those who recalled their first symptoms. Using free-text responses, participants described changes in their knee's appearance, feel, movement, and overall state within the first year. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and summative content analysis.

We included 92 participants with a median age of 67 years (interquartile range [IQR] 59, 75), of which 69% were women. The median body mass index (BMI) was 26 kg/m² (IQR 24, 30). Individuals with knee OA recalled varied knee symptoms within the first year of noticing their knees, as detailed above.

### Effects of blood flow restriction training on muscle strength and pain in patients with knee injuries: A meta-analysis [^112EVSLj]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). High credibility.

Due to the pain caused by knee injuries, low-load resistance training with blood flow restriction (L-BFR) may be a potential adjuvant therapeutic tool in the rehabilitation of knee injuries. This review aimed to analyze the effectiveness of the L-BFR training modality in knee rehabilitation.

- **Design**: A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the potential impact of blood flow restriction on patients with knee injuries. PubMed, EBSCO, and Web of Science databases were searched for eligible studies from January 2000 until January 2020. The mean differences of the data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3 software with a 95% confidence interval.

- **Results**: Nine studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These studies involved 179 patients who received L-BFR, 96 patients who underwent high-load resistance training, and another 94 patients who underwent low-load resistance training. The analysis of pooled data showed that patients in both the L-BFR (standardized mean difference, 0.83 [0.53, 1.14], P < 0.01) and high-load resistance training (standardized mean difference, -0.09 [-0.43, 0.24], P = 0.58) groups experienced an increase in muscle strength after the training. In addition, the pain score was significantly reduced in the L-BFR group compared with the other two groups (standardized mean difference, -0.61 [-1.19, -0.03], P = 0.04).

- **Conclusions**: Muscle strength increased after L-BFR and high-load resistance training compared with low-load resistance training. Furthermore, pain score was significantly reduced after L-BFR. Hence, L-BFR is a potential intervention to be applied.

### Contralateral knee effect on self-reported knee-specific function and global functional assessment: data from the osteoarthritis initiative [^115F1oQn]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

To analyze the effect of contralateral knee pain on the sensitivity of patient-reported outcomes and objectively measured functional performance tests in subjects with knee osteoarthritis (OA), subjects with discordant knee pain status (i.e. one knee being painful [≥ 4 on a numeric pain rating scale (NPRS)], with the contralateral knee being pain-free [NPRS 0]) were selected from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. These subjects were matched to those with bilaterally pain-free and painful knees by age, sex, body mass index, and radiographic knee OA. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) physical function score, the global Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), and objective functional performance tests were cross-sectionally compared in a matched case-control design.

A total of 378 subjects with discordant knee pain status were matched to 359 controls with bilaterally pain-free knees and to 323 controls with bilaterally painful knees. WOMAC scores in pain-free knees of discordant knee pain cases significantly differed compared to scores of bilaterally pain-free knees (P = 0.003). Likewise, scores in painful knees of discordant knee pain cases significantly differed compared to scores of bilaterally painful knees (P = 0.68). Functional performance tests differed in subjects with discordant knee pain compared to subjects with bilaterally pain-free knees and when compared to subjects with bilaterally painful knees, with the chair stand test showing significant variation.

### The Chitranjan S. Ranawat award: Factors that predict outcome five years following total knee arthroplasty [^111rdq6z]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Low credibility.

Previous reports have identified several potential predictors of pain and function after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, the results of these studies are conflicting, and most have a short follow-up after TKA. The purpose of this study was to identify factors predictive of pain and function five years after TKA.

- **Methods**: A multicenter cohort of 3,688 primary unilateral TKA patients from a comparative effectiveness consortium was enrolled. Demographic data, medical and musculoskeletal comorbidities, and patient-reported outcome measures were collected preoperatively and postoperatively at five years. This included the Short-Form Health Survey 36-item (SF-36) and the Knee Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) for pain and activities of daily living (ADL) function scores. Multivariate regression models with a 95% confidence interval were used to identify independent predictors of KOOS pain and function scores at five years.

- **Results**: The analysis identified the factors that were independently predictive for KOOS pain score at five years as follows: age, insurance, race, Charlson comorbidity index, back pain, number of other painful hip and knee joints, contralateral knee pain, preoperative SF-36 mental component summary, and baseline KOOS pain scores. For KOOS ADL, the predictive factors identified included age, body mass index, insurance, race, Charlson comorbidity index, back pain, number of other painful joints, contralateral knee pain, ipsilateral hip pain, preoperative SF-36 mental component summary, and physical component summary scores.

### Knee power is an important parameter in understanding medial knee joint load in knee osteoarthritis [^113FjEjX]. Arthritis Care & Research (2014).

We examined whether the following variables were potential covariates in the analyses because these have been previously identified as being related to the knee adduction moment (KAM): age, sex, knee pain, gait speed, and obesity. Knee pain was measured using the pain subscale of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS-pain). The KOOS was developed to assess self-reported knee pain, physical function, quality of life, and sport and recreation. For the purpose of this study, only the pain subscale was used. Participants were asked to consider pain over the last week, and scores from this 5-point Likert subscale were then normalized, with 100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms. Gait speed was measured during gait trials between the first heel strike and the second heel strike (meters/second). Obesity was characterized by body mass index (BMI), which was calculated from measured height and body mass (kg/m²) while participants were barefoot, wearing a t-shirt and shorts.

- **Statistical analysis**: Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software. Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) were calculated for the demographic, dependent, independent, and covariate variables. Pearson's correlation coefficients examined bivariate relationships between the KAM impulse and KAM peak with the independent variables and each of the potential covariates. For the correlations, Bonferroni adjustments were made for multiple comparisons, resulting in an alpha set at 0.002. Two stepwise, forward linear regression analyses were performed for each of the two dependent variables.

### Knee osteoarthritis [^113RDy5J]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) typically presents with joint pain that is exacerbated by use and alleviated with rest. There is relatively brief, self-limited morning stiffness and the absence of constitutional symptoms. Overweight and obesity are the most important modifiable risk factors. Although pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions are generally effective at alleviating pain and improving physical function, they do not fundamentally reverse the pathologic and radiographic process of knee OA. As the severity of the disease increases, the magnitude of pain and functional impairment intensifies. Surgical intervention should be pursued to relieve pain and restore functionality only when nonpharmacologic approaches and pharmacologic agents fail to control pain.

### Towards developing diagnostic criteria for early knee osteoarthritis: Data from the CHECK study [^117Y76Tp]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

With a lack of treatment options that can cure osteoarthritis (OA), there is a general consensus that a shift in focus towards early diagnosis and treatment is warranted. By identifying OA patients early in the disease, treatment can potentially start prior to the occurrence of irreversible joint damage, before pain becomes chronic and triggers sensitization of the central nervous system, and before a severe decline in physical functioning has occurred. In theory, in the early phase of OA, treatment options are applied when the disease is more amenable to modification.

As of today, there are no validated and widely accepted criteria for early knee OA available. Like for established OA in primary care, validation of diagnostic criteria for early OA is challenging due to the lack of a gold standard.

One way to overcome the lack of a gold standard in a research setting is to obtain a clinical expert-based diagnosis to identify clinically relevant cases of knee OA. The first aim of the study was to obtain a clinical expert-based diagnosis of clinically relevant knee OA development 5–10 years after the first presentation, in patients aged 45–65 years who consulted their general practitioner (GP) for knee complaints. Next, using the clinical expert-based diagnosis as the gold standard, we aimed to develop diagnostic criteria for early knee OA based on a set of predefined clinical and radiographic factors obtained at the first consultation. As the set of predicting factors was collected at the first consultation, these should be seen as early diagnostic criteria.

### Contribution of central and peripheral risk factors to prevalence, incidence and progression of knee pain: a community-based cohort study [^115z4axk]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

- **Key messages**:
	- Knee pain (KP) is associated with both central and peripheral risk factors.
	- Peripheral risk factors, such as joint injury, contribute more to the development of KP.
	- Central factors, such as pain catastrophizing and depression, appear to be the main drivers for the progression of KP.

### Surgical management of degenerative meniscus lesions: The 2016 ESSKA meniscus consensus [^116HnEUn]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

- **Imaging**: What is the role of knee radiographs in the assessment of middle-aged or older patients with a painful knee? Knee radiography should be used as a first-line imaging tool to support a diagnosis of osteoarthritis or to detect certain rarer pathologies of the knee. Therefore, at least a posterior-anterior weight-bearing semi-flexed knee radiograph and a lateral view should be included in the work-up of the middle-aged or older patient with knee pain (Grade B).

- **Diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis**: How should we make the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis on a daily practical basis? The clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis can typically be made on the basis of the duration and character of the knee joint symptoms, patient history (including the presence of strong risk factors for osteoarthritis such as age, limb malalignment, obesity, heredity, prior knee injuries, and surgeries), and findings from clinical examination. In the orthopedic setting, weight-bearing semi-flexed knee radiographs (such as the Lyon Schuss or Rosenberg view) should be included in the work-up of the middle-aged or older patient with knee pain. A skyline patella view is also important for the detection of radiographic evidence of patella-femoral osteoarthritis. Please note that plain knee radiography does not necessarily capture early stages of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (Grade B).

- **Knee MRI**: What is the role of knee MRI in the assessment of a middle-aged or older patient with a painful knee? Knee MRI is typically not indicated in the first-line work-up of the middle-aged or older patients with knee joint symptoms. However, knee MRI may…
