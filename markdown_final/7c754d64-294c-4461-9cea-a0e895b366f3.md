## Question

An 82-year-old man had a syncopal episode in the clinic during ear irrigation, attributed to a vasovagal event. A couple of weeks later, while sitting at the dinner table, he suddenly couldn't speak or respond to questions; the symptoms resolved after he was laid flat on the floor. Vitals were normal apart from mild hypotension. What are the next steps in his workup?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate next steps in evaluating an 82-year-old man with a brief speech arrest, likely a high-risk TIA scenario, including assessment, imaging, risk stratification, and initial management decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and exclusion of mimics such as hypoglycemia. Then, I should categorize the event and weigh TIA against seizure, syncope, and migraine. Next, I will risk-stratify with ABCD2 while acknowledging its limitations, decide on disposition, and determine the optimal sequence of brain and vascular imaging. After that, I need to outline cardiac evaluation for occult AF, initiate evidence-based antithrombotic therapy tailored to presumed mechanism, consider carotid revascularization if indicated, and address risk-factor modification and follow-up because early recurrence risk is front-loaded.

> Let me first confirm the bedside priorities and avoid assumptions. Airway, breathing, circulation, oxygenation, and vital signs should be reassessed, but wait, I need to verify glucose immediately to exclude hypoglycemia as a reversible mimic of transient aphasia, and I should perform a focused neurologic exam to document any residual language deficit, visual field cut, motor weakness, ataxia, or cranial nerve abnormality, as these findings will shape both imaging urgency and etiologic thinking [^115sLeqf] [^114nYsAo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to categorize the event based on clinical phenomenology. Sudden inability to speak with preserved awareness localizes to dominant hemisphere language cortex and points toward a focal cortical ischemic event, making an anterior-circulation TIA the leading consideration; resolution after lying flat could reflect transient improvement in cerebral perfusion but does not rule out ischemia, while the absence of loss of consciousness or convulsions argues against syncope or seizure in this seated patient, and although migraine aura can mimic TIA, the abrupt onset and age profile favor TIA over aura here [^1149DucM] [^114ogxyB] [^112fspNW].

> I should confirm risk and disposition next, but hmm, wait a minute, ABCD2 alone can undercall danger. Age ≥ 60 years gives 1 point, speech disturbance without weakness adds 1 point, duration is unknown but "brief", blood pressure at presentation is "mildly hypotensive" so likely 0, and diabetes is unknown; even if ABCD2 were < 4, up to 20% of such patients harbor high-risk disease needing urgent treatment decisions, so I will treat this as moderate-to-high risk by phenotype and age and arrange same-day or in-hospital evaluation under a high-risk TIA pathway, ideally in a stroke unit or rapid-access TIA clinic within 24 hours, accounting for local logistics and patient preference [^1116o1DW] [^115sLeqf] [^1145UrE4].

> Next, I should review brain imaging strategy carefully. Let me verify best first-line imaging: MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging is preferred when feasible because of superior sensitivity for acute ischemia and prognostic value of DWI positivity; if MRI access is delayed or contraindicated, CT perfusion is reasonable, and if neither is available rapidly, a non-contrast head CT can exclude hemorrhage or mass while arranging MRI as soon as possible; practically, I would obtain MRI DWI with FLAIR and T2✱GRE sequences stat, recognizing that DWI positivity correlates with higher early recurrence risk [^112ycXH3] [^113NMX33] [^115GPqyR] [^11653w6x].

> I will now examine cervicocephalic vasculature because mechanism matters for secondary prevention. CTA or MRA of the head and neck should be obtained urgently to evaluate for extracranial carotid stenosis, intracranial atherosclerosis, or dissection; carotid duplex ultrasound is an acceptable alternative if CTA/MRA are unavailable, but it misses intracranial disease, so I prefer CTA/MRA when feasible to inform revascularization decisions and medical therapy [^115bPb2x] [^115XRLEv] [^111yHCPG].

> Let me consider the cardiac workup next and not overlook paroxysmal AF. I should confirm a 12-lead ECG to screen for atrial fibrillation or flutter and other cardiac conditions, and I need to ensure at least 24 hours of continuous ECG monitoring initially to detect paroxysmal AF in TIA patients potentially eligible for anticoagulation, escalating to extended ambulatory monitoring if suspicion remains high and initial monitoring is unrevealing [^112fvjaf] [^114qfArE].

> Before treatment decisions, I should double-check disposition. Given advanced age, focal cortical symptoms, and the need for expedited neurovascular and cardiac evaluation, admission to a stroke unit or a same-day rapid-access TIA clinic is warranted; carefully selected lower-risk patients can be managed via structured rapid outpatient models if reliable 24-hour completion of imaging and consultation is ensured, but I need to verify that all logistical criteria are met before discharge [^1145UrE4] [^115sLeqf] [^114VLsUL].

> Now, antithrombotic therapy; hold on, I should verify mechanism first. If imaging and evaluation support a non-cardioembolic high-risk TIA, I would initiate short-term dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel over monotherapy, then de-escalate to single antiplatelet per guideline; if a cardioembolic source such as AF is identified, antiplatelet therapy is insufficient and oral anticoagulation should be used for secondary prevention rather than antiplatelets alone [^117GAp5Z] [^117Jkgcx] [^115cM5fy].

> But wait, what if we find severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis. I should confirm stenosis severity and surgical candidacy; for TIA within 6 months and ipsilateral 70–99% carotid stenosis, carotid endarterectomy by operators with perioperative stroke/death rates < 6% reduces recurrent stroke risk, and timing matters, so I need to coordinate rapid imaging-to-revascularization workflow without unnecessary delay [^115U1cxe] [^115D1uD3].

> Next, I should review vascular risk factor optimization. For hypertension, I need to ensure initiation or intensification of evidence-based agents such as thiazides, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs to reduce recurrent stroke risk, with systolic BP targets individualized and often < 140 mmHg in older adults after shared decision-making; for dyslipidemia, I should address severe hypertriglyceridemia when present and implement diet and pharmacotherapy as indicated alongside standard statin-based ASCVD risk reduction per contemporary practice [^111LyqrD] [^115et9yM] [^115oKtKG].

> I should also consider and exclude common mimics thoughtfully. While convulsive syncope and epileptic seizures can produce transient unresponsiveness or postictal aphasia, the preserved consciousness, seated onset, and isolated speech arrest here make these less likely; migraine with aura can rarely present without headache in older adults, but the abrupt onset and vascular risk profile keep my threshold low for tissue imaging and TIA-directed management rather than attributing to aura prematurely [^112fspNW] [^1149DucM].

> Finally, I need to ensure the patient understands early risk and the follow-up plan. The 90-day stroke risk after TIA can approach 17–18% with nearly half of events in the first 48 hours, and DWI-positive lesions carry a higher recurrence hazard, so I will communicate urgency, arrange close follow-up with stroke neurology, and verify adherence to antithrombotic therapy, BP control, and cardiac monitoring completion [^115sLeqf] [^11653w6x].

The patient's transient aphasia that resolved promptly on lying flat is most consistent with a **transient ischemic attack (TIA)** [^115sLeqf] rather than a vasovagal event. Immediate next steps are to obtain an urgent **brain MRI with DWI** [^113NMX33] to detect acute ischemia [^112ycXH3] and perform **CTA or MRA of the head and neck** [^115bPb2x] to assess for carotid or intracranial stenosis [^111yHCPG]. In parallel, obtain an **ECG** [^112fvjaf] with at least 24-hour cardiac monitoring [^114qfArE] to detect atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias, and **admit the patient to a stroke unit** [^1145UrE4] for rapid evaluation and secondary prevention. Additional steps include echocardiography [^115bPb2x], routine labs [^115sLeqf], and risk factor management (antiplatelet therapy, statin, blood pressure control) [^115bPb2x], while **tilt-table testing is not indicated** unless recurrent syncope persists after TIA workup [^112QTi3J].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Transient ischemic attack is characterized by **sudden, focal neurological deficits** that resolve within 24 hours [^115B5gm8] and is often associated with hypoperfusion or embolic events. Alternatives include seizure with transient postictal deficits (such as Todd's paralysis), syncope due to cerebral hypoperfusion — in which isolated aphasia without loss of consciousness is uncommon — and migraine aura, which typically has a gradual onset with an associated headache [^112fspNW]. Given the patient's age, vascular risk factors, and clinical presentation, **TIA is the most likely diagnosis** [^115sLeqf].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

### Neuroimaging

For neuroimaging, a **brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)** [^113NMX33] is recommended to identify acute ischemic lesions and confirm the diagnosis of TIA [^112ycXH3]. CT angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck [^115bPb2x] is essential to evaluate for **carotid stenosis**, **intracranial atherosclerosis**, or other vascular abnormalities [^111yHCPG].

---

### Cardiac evaluation

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To screen for atrial fibrillation (AF) or other arrhythmias [^112fvjaf].
- **Continuous cardiac monitoring (at least 24 hours)**: To detect paroxysmal AF or other intermittent arrhythmias [^114qfArE].
- **Echocardiography**: To evaluate for structural heart disease, valvular abnormalities, or cardiac sources of emboli [^115bPb2x].

---

### Laboratory tests

Obtain a **complete blood count** to assess for anemia or infection, and check electrolytes, renal function, and glucose to identify metabolic disturbances. Also evaluate cardiovascular risk with a lipid profile and HbA1c [^115sLeqf].

---

### Additional evaluations

If CTA/MRA is unavailable or contraindicated, obtain a **carotid ultrasound** to screen for carotid stenosis [^115XRLEv]. Tilt-table testing is **not routinely indicated** unless recurrent syncope persists after TIA workup [^112QTi3J].

---

## Risk stratification and management

- **ABCD2 score**: Age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration, and diabetes status to assess short-term stroke risk and guide management [^114ogxyB].
- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Initiate aspirin or clopidogrel promptly to reduce stroke risk [^115bPb2x].
- **Statin therapy**: Initiate high-intensity statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk [^115bPb2x].
- **Blood pressure control**: Target systolic blood pressure < 140 mmHg [^115et9yM].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Smoking cessation, dietary changes, and physical activity [^115bPb2x].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalization is recommended for patients with:

- **High ABCD2 score (≥ 4)**: Indicates high short-term stroke risk [^115sLeqf].
- **Significant carotid stenosis (> 50%)**: Requires urgent evaluation and possible intervention [^115bPb2x].
- **Cardiac arrhythmias or structural heart disease**: Requires inpatient monitoring and management.
- **Recurrent or persistent neurological symptoms**: Indicates unstable clinical condition [^1145UrE4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The patient's presentation is most consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Immediate evaluation and management are critical to **prevent subsequent stroke** [^115sLeqf]. Recommended next steps are to obtain a brain MRI with DWI [^113NMX33] to confirm acute ischemia; perform CTA or MRA of the head and neck [^115bPb2x] to evaluate for vascular stenosis or occlusion; obtain an ECG [^112fvjaf] with continuous cardiac monitoring [^114qfArE] to detect arrhythmias; and perform echocardiography [^115bPb2x] to assess cardiac structure and function. Also obtain laboratory tests to identify metabolic or hematologic abnormalities, initiate antiplatelet and statin therapy [^115bPb2x] to reduce stroke risk, and hospitalize high-risk patients based on ABCD2 score, vascular findings, or cardiac abnormalities [^115sLeqf]. Prompt and comprehensive evaluation is essential to identify the underlying cause and implement appropriate **secondary prevention strategies**.

### National stroke association guidelines for the management of transient ischemic attacks [^1152cNyM]. Annals of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attacks are common and significant indicators of potential subsequent strokes. The management of these attacks varies significantly, and many existing guidelines have not been updated in recent years. The objective of this study was to create comprehensive, unbiased, and evidence-based guidelines for managing patients with transient ischemic attacks.

Fifteen expert panelists were selected based on objective criteria using publication metrics that indicated a higher likelihood of being nominated by practitioners in the field. Prior published guidelines were identified through a systematic review, and recommendations derived from these guidelines were independently evaluated for quality by the experts. The highest quality recommendations were selected and subsequently edited by the panelists using a modified Delphi approach, which involved multiple iterations of questionnaires to reach a consensus on new changes. Experts were provided with systematic reviews of recent clinical studies and were asked to justify wording changes based on new evidence. They also rated the final recommendations based on the level of evidence and quality. No expert was allowed to contribute to recommendations on a topic where there could be any perceived conflict of interest.

Of the 257 guideline documents identified by systematic review, 13 documents containing 137 recommendations met all entry criteria. Six iterations of questionnaires were needed to reach a consensus on the wording of 53 final recommendations. These final recommendations covered various areas, including initial management, evaluation, medical treatment, surgical treatment, and risk factor management.

### Transient ischemic attack: Definitions and clinical presentations [^1149DucM]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The definition of transient ischemic attack (TIA) has changed from a focal neurologic event that lasts less than 24 hours to one that typically lasts less than 1 hour and is not associated with changes on neuroimaging. Transient ischemic attacks, using the older definition, carry a 10% risk of stroke within 90 days and are therefore considered a serious condition meriting urgent attention.

The manifestations of transient ischemic attacks are varied and include events that involve the anterior and posterior cerebral circulations. Correct diagnosis depends on an accurate medical history and physical examination, combined with the appropriate neuroimaging. It is uncommon that syndromes such as syncope, isolated dizziness, drop attacks, or global amnesia are caused by cerebral ischemia or transient ischemic attack. With the careful evaluation of symptoms according to this definition of transient ischemic attack, a clinician can determine whether a transient ischemic attack has occurred and thus propose treatment that may decrease the likelihood of a subsequent stroke.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines recommend defining orthostatic headache as a headache meeting the following criteria:

- **Absent or mild severity**: Headache is absent or only mild (1–3 on verbal rating scale) on waking or after prolonged lying flat.
- **Onset timing**: Onset occurs within 2 hours of becoming upright.
- **Symptom improvement**: There is good improvement in severity (> 50% on verbal rating scale) within 2 hours after lying flat.
- **Consistent timing**: The timing of onset and offset is consistent.

### National Stroke Association recommendations for systems of care for transient ischemic attack [^111RgWMu]. Annals of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are common and indicate a high short-term risk of stroke. Evidence-based recommendations for the urgent evaluation and treatment of patients with TIA have been published. However, consistent and reliable implementation of these recommendations will necessitate changes in the systems of care established for TIA. The National Stroke Association convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop recommendations for the essential components of systems of care at hospitals to improve the quality of care provided to patients with TIA. The panel recommends that hospitals establish standardized protocols to ensure rapid and complete evaluation and treatment for patients with TIA, with particular attention to urgency and close observation in patients at high risk of stroke.

### Long-term risk of myocardial infarction compared to recurrent stroke after transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1144uQiA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

Although there is evidence that patients suffering a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke (IS) are at high risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), guidelines for the prevention of coronary events in high-risk individuals do not include stroke patients. A writing group committee suggested the inclusion of large atherosclerosis IS, while other subtypes of IS are thought to carry a lower risk of CAD. In a previous systematic review, the annual risk of myocardial infarction (MI) after TIA or IS was shown to be 2.2%. However, the risk of MI remains difficult to predict as the improvement of secondary prevention therapies may be counterbalanced by the aging of the population. Additionally, long-term estimates were scarce, and several cohort studies have been published since this meta-analysis.

Moreover, whether coronary events or stroke is the main cause of death in IS/TIA patients remains uncertain. There are also no reliable data on predictors of MI among IS/TIA patients.

Therefore, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the long-term risk of MI, with temporal trends, along with the risks of recurrent stroke, cardiac, and vascular deaths, in IS/TIA patients. Additionally, we compared the risks of MI and recurrent stroke for fatal and nonfatal events and the risks of cardiac death versus fatal recurrent stroke. We assessed the risk factors for MI among IS/TIA patients.

### Do orthostatic vital signs have utility in the evaluation of syncope [^112wpHns]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED). The differential diagnosis is long and includes benign conditions as well as acute life threats, such as dysrhythmias or pulmonary embolism.

- **Objective**: The specific goals of this review are twofold: 1) to define the diagnostic utility of orthostatic vital signs (OVS) as a test for orthostatic syncope, and 2) to determine whether OVS help diagnose or exclude life-threatening causes of syncope in ED patients.

- **Methods**: Three prospective cohort studies plus 2017 national guidelines for syncope management were identified, reviewed, and critically appraised.

- **Results**: This literature review found that orthostatic hypotension is common among ED patients with syncope and is often diagnosed as the cause of syncope.

- **Conclusions**: OVS measurements do not, in isolation, reliably diagnose or exclude orthostatic syncope, nor do they appear to have value in ruling out life-threatening causes of syncope.

### Severe anemia associated with transient ischemic attacks involving vertebrobasilar circulation [^111xvYyK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attack is one of the most common causes of transient neurologic deficit. Anemic hypoxia results from reduced hemoglobin content with normal arterial oxygen tension and saturation. Anemic hypoxia caused by blood loss or hemolysis has not been considered an independent factor leading to significant neurologic problems, because cerebral homeostasis, regulated by physiologic processes in cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation, usually meets the brain's oxygen requirement in most circumstances even with profound anemia. We report a case of severe anemia associated with a transient ischemic attack involving vertebrobasilar circulation.

### Long-term risk of myocardial infarction compared to recurrent stroke after transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115sx12]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

We report our study according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses. Eligible studies were observational cohort studies or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including ≥ 100 ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients with at least 1 year of follow‐up, reporting data on subsequent (fatal or nonfatal) myocardial infarction (MI). We also extracted data on recurrent stroke and cardiac and vascular deaths, comparing the risks of MI and recurrent stroke as well as the risks of cardiac death and recurrent stroke in the same cohorts.

To minimize bias in cardiac and vascular death definitions and to increase quality, we only selected studies reporting these events if information on MI was given separately. When reported, we collected data on risk factors for subsequent MI after IS/TIA. We excluded studies with highly selected populations (e.g. young age, specific race, patients with a rare cause of stroke). Studies of stroke patients with a small (< 15%) proportion of hemorrhagic stroke were not excluded. In cases of multiple publications pertaining to the same population, we included only the publication with the largest amount of relevant data to this review. IS and TIA had to be defined according to the World Health Organization as a minimum. We relied on authors' definitions of MI and of cardiac and vascular deaths.

We extracted data on study design (community‐, hospital‐based study, RCT), year of enrollment, duration of follow‐up, and completeness of follow‐up.

### Association between duration of transient neurological events and diffusion-weighted brain lesions [^11653w6x]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

- **Clinical perspective**: Recognition and treatment of transient cerebrovascular events are critical to lower the high early risk of re-ischemia and infarction. Minor cerebrovascular events, including transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor ischemic stroke, exhibit a wide spectrum of symptomatology, making diagnosis challenging. The risk of re-ischemic stroke is high for those with classic as well as atypical symptoms. Therefore, identifying markers of increased risk of re-ischemic stroke is important.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is the optimal imaging technique for diagnosing acute ischemic stroke, with a sensitivity of 88% to 100% and specificity of 95% to 100%. In a cohort of 1028 patients with lower-risk clinical events, there was a 6-fold higher risk of re-ischemic stroke in those who were DWI-positive, although this estimate is based on only 7 re-strokes in follow-up at 1 year. In a cohort of 1033 patients with TIA or minor ischemic stroke, DWI positivity was associated with a 2.2-fold increase in the hazard of 90-day re-ischemic stroke (14.5% versus 8.9%) and therefore may be a useful test for prognostication.

Nevertheless, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may not be readily available or done in a timely fashion in many settings, raising the importance of characterizing the association between key clinical factors and the presence of DWI lesions to assist in early decision-making. Specifically, longer duration of events has been identified as a marker of ischemic stroke recurrence, although information on DWI lesions is limited.

### Examining multimorbidity contributors to dementia over time [^112h6u7o]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

To capture the joint contribution of chronic conditions to dementia as a clinical syndrome, frequently co‐occurring conditions characterized previously as risk factors — diabetes, ischemic heart disease, stroke or transient ischemic attack (STIA), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), atrial fibrillation, rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, heart failure, and hypertension — require concomitant inclusion in models. The contributions of chronic conditions (multimorbidity) to ADRD have been estimated frequently by computing population attributable fractions (PAFs), which increase with the prevalence of chronic conditions and the relative association strength of chronic conditions with ADRD.

Previous research suggests high PAFs of up to 20% for individual chronic conditions such as hypertension, and up to approximately 40% for weighted combined contributions of chronic conditions and other risk factors. Although reported PAFs sometimes adjust for confounding factors, they do not account for the sequential accumulation of multimorbidity of chronic conditions and are not additive, with sums potentially exceeding 100%.

Furthermore, commonly applied dimensionality reduction strategies to derive weights and adjust for the communality of individual PAFs when computing joint contributions of chronic condition combinations to ADRD risk imperfectly account for the longitudinal coevolution of multimorbidity. Similarly, nominal chronic condition groupings are agnostic to the temporal ordering of chronic conditions and may be biased depending on a priori defined cutoffs or chronic condition combinations.

### Does ABCD2 score below 4 allow more time to evaluate patients with a transient ischemic attack [^1116o1DW]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends that patients with a transient ischemic attack and an ABCD(2) score ≥ 4, as well as those with more than two transient ischemic attacks within one week, be admitted for urgent, complete etiologic evaluation within 24 hours. Patients with an ABCD(2) score < 4 may be managed differently based on the presence of other vascular risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, carotid artery stenosis ≥ 50%, symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis ≥ 50%, or a major cardiac source of embolism.

- **Results**: Among 697 patients with an ABCD(2) score < 4, the presence of high-risk disease factors was noted (e.g. stenosis ≥ 50%, symptomatic intracranial stenosis in 5.0%, atrial fibrillation in 5.9%, and other major cardiac sources of embolism in 2.1%) compared to 31.6% of 497 patients with an ABCD(2) score ≥ 4. The sensitivity and specificity of an ABCD(2) score ≥ 4 or NICE criteria for discriminating between patients requiring admission or not were significant, with values ≥ 80%.

- **Conclusions**: One in five patients with an ABCD(2) score < 4 had high-risk disease requiring urgent treatment decision-making. There is a necessity to evaluate these patients comprehensively to ensure timely and effective management.

### Demographics in children presenting with acute neurologic deficits concerning for stroke: An evaluation of the stroke alert process [^115E1Mdw]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to assess the demographics and clinical characteristics of children presenting with acute neurologic symptoms concerning for stroke. Stroke leads to significant morbidity in the pediatric population. Stroke protocols were created as a means to help identify and triage these children. Despite the implementation of these protocols, there have been few population-based studies evaluating the demographics and clinical features of children presenting with acute stroke-like symptoms.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review of patients for whom the stroke alert process was activated from September 2016 through August 2018 at Children's Mercy Hospital.

- **Results**: There were a total of 61 activations. Acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack comprised 18% and was the second leading diagnosis after seizure with postictal (Todd) paralysis (20%). Two activations were candidates for mechanical thrombectomy, and none received tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Children with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack were likely to be younger in age (median 4 years, interquartile range [IQR] 3–9) compared to those with nonischemic stroke diagnoses (median 12.5 years, IQR 7–15.3) (P = 0.010). The anatomical location of acute ischemic stroke was widespread, including both anterior and posterior circulations. Past medical history, family history, racial demographics, sex, and initial presenting symptoms were not predictive of the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Furthermore, 38% of activations had diagnoses other than transient ischemic attack.

### Migraine and risk of stroke [^112fspNW]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Differentiating between migraine aura and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can be challenging, even for experienced neurologists. This is especially true for patients older than 60 years, where TIA occurrence increases. In contrast, attacks of migraine with aura (MA) tend to become atypical, as they are not always followed by a migraine headache. The sudden onset of TIA symptoms, along with vascular risk factors, differentiates it from MA, which has a more gradual onset of symptoms. The presence of a headache after transient neurological symptoms does not necessarily indicate MA, as a migraine-like attack (with or without aura) can also be triggered by ischaemic vascular events. Although not extensively studied, the risk of TIA appears to be increased in people with MA, but not in those with migraine without aura (MO). Misdiagnosis of migraine aura as TIA may impede proper study of this association.

- **Clinical implication**: A detailed clinical workup is recommended for patients with known MA whose aura symptoms differ, are atypical, or are accompanied by clinical signs of basilar artery involvement. In these cases, the threshold for definitive tissue imaging with MRI should be low.

### Clinical diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging in patients with transient and minor neurological symptoms: A prospective cohort study [^11339nUH]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Neurologists and stroke physicians find it challenging to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients presenting with transient or minor neurological symptoms. The optimal initial investigation strategy for these patients remains uncertain.

One approach is to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head for every patient with these symptoms. MRI of the brain can detect diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions characteristic of acute brain ischemia or, rarely, can make a positive diagnosis of an alternative cause for the symptoms, such as multiple sclerosis or a brain tumor. If the diagnosis of TIA or stroke is confirmed, the ischemia pattern observed on MRI may help identify the underlying cause, like multivascular-territory ischemia in cardioembolism. However, an MRI showing no signs of acute ischemia is the most common finding in patients with a clinical diagnosis of TIA or minor stroke and may provide false reassurance. This is particularly prevalent in patients with brain stem TIA or minor stroke, or those with delayed presentation, where normal MRI brain imaging is more frequently observed.

To assess the benefits of an MRI strategy that scans all patients compared to a clinically targeted strategy, it is necessary to estimate the proportion of patients with positive DWI across different levels of clinical probability of a TIA or minor stroke diagnosis. For instance, if the majority of patients with a high clinical probability of TIA or stroke exhibit DWI changes, or the majority of patients with a low clinical probability…

### Magnetic resonance imaging assists with determining etiology after transient ischemic attack or minor stroke [^1139FNje]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

The initial assessment of a potential transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke relies on patient history and examination, and subsequent neuroimaging can be used to confirm the diagnosis of cerebral ischemia. It has been well established that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is more sensitive for detecting ischemia than computed tomography, though the rates of DWI-positive lesions after clinical TIA vary widely in the literature. The detection of DWI-positive lesions appears to be dependent on various factors such as the duration of symptoms, type and severity of symptoms, and timing of MRI after the event.

Secondary prevention of ischemic stroke has increasingly become tailored to stroke etiology. The rate of cryptogenic stroke in the era is 30% to 35%; therefore, it remains imperative to find additional methods of identifying stroke etiology to tailor therapies appropriately. Several studies have demonstrated that infarct topography on MRI can assist with determining stroke etiology, but how and to what extent DWI positivity influences etiology determination in a clinical context has not yet been well characterized. This is especially true in patients with suspected TIA or minor stroke. The aim of this study is to examine whether there are differences in ischemic stroke etiologies between patients who have a DWI-positive MRI compared with patients who are DWI-negative after suspected TIA or minor stroke, in a large prospective study of patients referred for urgent neurological assessment.

### Transient ischemic attacks of spinal cord due to abdominal aortic aneurysm thrombus [^116WmGBi]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Thrombosis due to abdominal aortic aneurysm is a rare condition that causes high mortality. Transient ischemic attack of the spinal cord can occur as a result of trash emboli from thrombus in abdominal aortic aneurysm. This condition generally occurs during operation of abdominal aortic aneurysm; very rarely, it can also be seen in laminated abdominal aortic aneurysm. Here, we present a case of a patient presenting with bilateral lower extremity paralysis resulting from transient ischemic attack of the spinal cord due to infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.

In the context of transient ischemic attack, particularly for patients with carotid artery stenosis and the timing of revascularization, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend that carotid artery stenting or carotid endarterectomy should be performed by operators with established periprocedural stroke and mortality rates of less than 6%. This approach aims to reduce the risk of surgical adverse events in patients with a TIA and symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis.

### Diagnosis, workup, risk reduction of transient ischemic attack in the emergency department setting: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115sLeqf]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

At least 240,000 individuals experience a transient ischemic attack each year in the United States. Transient ischemic attack is a strong predictor of subsequent stroke; the 90-day stroke risk following a transient ischemic attack can be as high as 17.8%, with almost half occurring within 2 days of the index event. Diagnosing transient ischemic attack can be challenging given the transitory nature of symptoms, often reassuring neurological examination at the time of evaluation, and lack of confirmatory testing. Limited resources, such as imaging availability and access to specialists, can further exacerbate this challenge.

This scientific statement focuses on the correct clinical diagnosis, risk assessment, and management decisions of patients with suspected transient ischemic attack. Identification of high-risk patients can be achieved through the use of comprehensive protocols incorporating acute phase imaging of both the brain and cerebral vasculature, thoughtful use of risk stratification scales, and ancillary testing. The ultimate goal is to determine who can be safely discharged home from the emergency department versus admitted to the hospital.

We discuss various methods for rapid yet comprehensive evaluations, keeping resource-limited sites in mind. In addition, we discuss strategies for secondary prevention of future cerebrovascular events using maximal medical therapy and patient education.

### Etiologic workup in cases of cryptogenic stroke: A systematic review of international clinical practice guidelines [^112FtqSN]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on the etiologic workup of acute ischemic stroke are of variable quality but largely reach consensus about appropriate standard investigations. However, there is little agreement and a lack of underpinning evidence for more advanced or specialized investigations for rarer causes of stroke. This lack of evidence and consensus, along with poor applicability of many existing guidelines, is likely to contribute to variability of access to investigations, inappropriate use of costly and specialized resources and skills, and delays or lack of diagnosis of etiologies. Unless addressed, this gap in knowledge will continue to result in missed opportunities to identify and implement necessary secondary prevention measures, and provide high-quality clinical and psychological advice and support to stroke survivors and their families regarding ongoing stroke risk.

### Transient ischemic attacks: Part I. Diagnosis and evaluation [^112VRDW3]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attack is no longer considered a benign event but, rather, a critical harbinger of impending stroke. Failure to quickly recognize and evaluate this warning sign could mean missing an opportunity to prevent permanent disability or death. The 90-day risk of stroke following a transient ischemic attack has been estimated to be approximately 10 percent, with one half of strokes occurring within the first two days of the attack. The 90-day stroke risk is even higher when a transient ischemic attack results from internal carotid artery stenosis.

Most patients reporting symptoms of transient ischemic attack should be sent to an emergency department. Patients who arrive at the emergency department within 180 minutes of symptom onset should undergo an expedited history and physical examination, as well as selected laboratory tests, to determine if they are candidates for thrombolytic therapy. Initial testing should include complete blood count with platelet count, prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio, partial thromboplastin time, and electrolyte and glucose levels. Computed tomographic scanning of the head should be performed immediately to ensure that there is no evidence of brain hemorrhage or mass. A transient ischemic attack can be misdiagnosed as migraine, seizure, peripheral neuropathy, or anxiety.

### Diagnosis of non-consensus transient ischaemic attacks with focal, negative, and non-progressive symptoms: population-based validation by investigation and prognosis [^11487ruB]. Lancet (2021). Low credibility.

Up to 25% of strokes are preceded by a transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The early risk of stroke following a TIA is high, and urgent investigation and treatment are required. In particular, treatment with antiplatelets is needed because these drugs substantially reduce the risk of early recurrent stroke. Diagnosis of TIA usually relies on the patient's description of symptoms and on the ability of clinicians to interpret them correctly. However, the high-level definition of TIA as a sudden, focal neurological deficit of presumed vascular origin lasting less than 24 hours provides no guidance on which symptoms are likely to be vascular in origin.

Agreement between clinicians regarding the diagnosis of TIA is only moderate. Diagnostic criteria of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) were developed by expert consensus to aid clinical practice and recruitment into research. Specifically, these criteria disqualify several sudden onset and focal monosymptomatic events deemed not to be TIAs, including isolated diplopia, dysarthria, vertigo, ataxia, sensory loss, and bilateral visual impairment. The argument is that these isolated symptoms often have a non-vascular cause, but interobserver agreement in diagnosis between clinicians is poor.

### Diagnosis of non-consensus transient ischaemic attacks with focal, negative, and non-progressive symptoms: Population-based validation by investigation and prognosis [^11111Gez]. Lancet (2021). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) can be difficult. There is consensus on classic symptoms (e.g. motor weakness, dysphasia, hemianopia, monocular visual loss), but there is no consensus on several monosymptomatic events with sudden-onset, non-progressive, focal negative symptoms (e.g. isolated diplopia, dysarthria, vertigo, ataxia, sensory loss, and bilateral visual disturbance). Significant variation exists in investigation and treatment practices.

We prospectively ascertained and investigated all strokes and sudden onset transient neurological symptoms in a population of 92,728 people (no age restrictions) from Oxfordshire, UK, who sought medical attention at nine primary care practices or at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK (Oxford Vascular Study). Patients classified at baseline with minor ischaemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Score < 5), classic TIA, or non-consensus TIA were treated according to secondary prevention guidelines. Risks of stroke (7-day, 90-day, and 10-year risks) and risks of all major vascular events (from the time of first event and from the time of seeking medical attention) were established by face-to-face follow-up visits and were compared with the risk expected from age and sex-specific stroke incidence in the underlying study population.

Between April 1, 2002, and March 31, 2018, 2,878 patients were identified with minor ischaemic stroke (n = 1,287), classic TIA (n = 1,021), or non-consensus TIA (n = 570). Follow-up lasted until October 1, 2018, with a median duration of 5.2 years (IQR 2.6–9.2 years).

### Long-term risk of myocardial infarction compared to recurrent stroke after transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1172TdKM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Twenty-three (40%) studies provided an explicit definition of myocardial infarction (MI), which was based on clinical parameters, biological markers, ECG changes, or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). An explicit definition of recurrent stroke was given in 15 (38%) studies: a neurologic deficit lasting ≥ 24 hours was the definition used in most of the studies, and only one required a period of neurological stability between the index stroke and recurrent stroke. The study reports the pooled risks of MI, recurrent stroke, and cardiac and vascular deaths, both overall and in the prespecified subgroups, with differences among subgroups assessed by meta-regressions.

### Transient ischemic attack: Part I. Diagnosis and evaluation [^114ogxyB]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

A transient ischemic attack is defined as transient neurologic symptoms without evidence of acute infarction. It is a common and important risk factor for future stroke but is greatly underreported. Common symptoms are sudden and transient and include unilateral paresis, speech disturbance, and monocular blindness. Correct and early diagnosis of transient ischemic attack versus mimicking conditions is important because early interventions can significantly reduce the risk of future stroke.

- **Symptoms and mimicking conditions**: Nonspecific symptoms and gradual onset are more likely with mimics than with true transient ischemic attacks. Transient ischemic attacks are more likely with sudden onset, focal neurologic deficit, or speech disturbance.

- **Evaluation and imaging**: Urgent evaluation is necessary in patients with symptoms of transient ischemic attack and includes neuroimaging, cervicocephalic vasculature imaging, cardiac evaluation, blood pressure assessment, and routine laboratory testing.

- **ABCD(2) score**: The ABCD(2) (age, blood pressure, clinical presentation, diabetes mellitus, duration of symptoms) score should be determined during the initial evaluation and can help assess the immediate risk of repeat ischemia and stroke. Patients with higher ABCD(2) scores should be treated as inpatients, whereas those with lower scores are at lower risk of future stroke and can be treated as outpatients.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^115heUuE]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, specifically focusing on carotid sinus massage, the 2018 ESC guidelines recommend confirming carotid sinus syndrome when carotid sinus massage induces bradycardia (asystole) and/or hypotension that reproduces spontaneous symptoms. Additionally, patients should exhibit clinical features compatible with a reflex mechanism of syncope.

### Diagnosis of non-consensus transient ischaemic attacks with focal, negative, and non-progressive symptoms: Population-based validation by investigation and prognosis [^115NvfQt]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Our study has some limitations. First, it was conducted in Oxfordshire, UK, with a primarily white European population, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other settings. Second, although the diagnostic classification was prospective — and therefore blind to subsequent events — and based on prespecified syndrome descriptions, the element of subjective clinical judgment is inevitable. The designation of an isolated symptom depends on the patient's memory and the quality of medical history recording. However, most patients were seen acutely, and a detailed clinical history was obtained by a dedicated clinical researcher rather than a busy non-study clinician. Prespecified syndromic diagnosis forms the basis of much medical practice, thus the prognosis of non-consensus TIA is likely to be broadly generalizable.

Additionally, routine brain MRI investigations were initially limited to patients enrolled later in the cohort, but this method was then applied consecutively without differences in imaging rates between classic TIAs and non-consensus TIAs. Although the cohort of 570 patients with non-consensus TIAs with isolated negative focal symptoms is, to our knowledge, the largest assembled and followed up at the time of writing, further studies and pooled analyses would provide more reliable risk estimates for individual clinical syndromes. Our analysis of stroke risk from the time of the index TIA included some patients who only sought medical attention following a stroke, but it was unable to include them before the incident occurred.

### Risk of cardiovascular diseases after nonfocal transient neurologic attacks in the elderly: The Rotterdam study [^111Nth2h]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

A transient neurologic attack (TNA) is a temporary episode of neurologic symptoms lasting less than 24 hours. TNAs can be subtyped into focal, nonfocal, and mixed, depending on the symptoms. Focal and mixed TNAs, sometimes referred to as typical and atypical transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), are known indicators of ischemic stroke. Furthermore, mixed TNA has also been associated with an elevated risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).

In contrast to the well-established prognosis following focal and mixed TNA, there is a notable scarcity of knowledge regarding the clinical relevance of nonfocal TNA. Evidence on the clinical consequences following nonfocal TNAs is limited, but suggests an elevated risk of ischemic stroke afterward. The risk of nonfocal TNA for individuals older than 55 years is estimated at 3.8%, potentially leaving a considerable portion of the elderly population at an elevated risk of future stroke.

However, this evidence is limited by biases, as these studies are hospital-based, retrospective in nature, or have short follow-up periods. Owing to these limitations, uncertainty persists among clinicians regarding the optimal management of nonfocal TNA. In particular, the question remains whether these attacks require secondary prevention measures in line with the management of a TIA.

Therefore, we investigated the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) following a nonfocal TNA and assessed whether this risk differed when compared with TIA.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on management of transient ischaemic attack [^117GAp5Z]. European Stroke Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for transient ischemic attack, particularly concerning antithrombotic therapy for non-cardioembolic TIA, the ESO 2021 guidelines recommend initiating short-term dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel over monotherapy. This is subsequently followed by monotherapy in patients with an acute non-cardioembolic high-risk TIA, defined by an ABCD² score of ≥ 4.

### Diagnosis of non-consensus transient ischaemic attacks with focal, negative, and non-progressive symptoms: Population-based validation by investigation and prognosis [^111UujdU]. Lancet (2021). Low credibility.

The evidence base for the diagnosis of TIAs is limited. Since acute ischaemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging are present in relatively few patients with a definite TIA, symptomatic diagnosis remains the mainstay of clinical practice. However, the widely accepted high-level definition of TIA as a sudden onset, focal neurological deficit of presumed vascular origin lasting less than 24 hours provides no guidance on which symptoms are likely to be vascular in origin. Interobserver agreement between clinicians for the diagnosis of classic TIA is good, but there is only moderate agreement when all TIA referrals are included, even when written scenarios are used. This clinical disagreement, driven mainly by non-consensus TIAs, undermines effective management in the absence of a gold standard diagnostic test.

The low prevalence of acute ischaemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging, particularly in posterior circulation TIAs, means that there are currently only two indicators of the likely nature of non-consensus TIAs — the risk of subsequent stroke and the frequency of vascular pathological findings on investigation. In our prospective population-based study of patients seeking medical attention with suspected TIAs or stroke, we noted that the risk of stroke after non-consensus TIA was much higher than age-matched or sex-matched stroke incidence rates in the underlying population. This overlapped with the risk after non-motor classic TIAs, and the frequencies of vascular pathological findings were also similar to those in patients with classic TIA.

### ACC/AHA/HRS versus ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope: JACC guideline comparison [^112ZrLeC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope is a commonly encountered and challenging problem in medical practice. Presentations vary, and the causal mechanism often remains elusive even after extensive (and often expensive) evaluation. Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to guide the multidisciplinary approach necessary to diagnose and manage the broad spectrum of patients presenting with syncope. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Heart Rhythm Society, published its first syncope guidelines in 2017. The European Society of Cardiology released the fourth iteration of its syncope guidelines in 2018.

### Transient ischemic attack (TIA): The initial diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma [^113UECXk]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Many patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are at high risk of stroke within the first few days of onset of symptoms. Emergency physicians and primary care physicians need to assess these patients quickly and initiate appropriate secondary stroke prevention strategies. Recent refinements in diagnostic imaging have produced valuable insights into risk stratification for patients with TIA. Clinical data regarding the urgent initiation of antiplatelet therapy specifically in this patient population with non-cardioembolic TIA are limited but promising. This review outlines the diagnostic tools available for the rapid assessment of patients presenting with symptoms of TIA and discusses clinical trials applicable to these vulnerable patients.

### Management of transient ischemia attacks in the twenty-first century [^114Q1jLD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Patients who have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) represent a group that may appear well but are at high risk for stroke within 90 days. Management of patients who have a TIA requires an understanding of the short-term risk for stroke to guide acute management and the long-term benefits of medical and surgical therapies. The initial emergency department (ED) evaluation may be supplemented with simple TIA stroke risk scores to estimate short-term stroke risk. The addition of MRI provides yet more information regarding stroke risks, while identifying some specific causes of TIA.

Extended testing may not be feasible in the ED, and to address this limitation, new outpatient strategies for patients who have a TIA have been developed, such as the use of an ED observation unit or an outpatient TIA clinic. Although controversy remains in some areas of acute TIA management because of the lack of evidence from controlled trials, evidence from large randomized trials has led to a better understanding of effective measures for the long-term prevention of stroke.

### Five-year mortality after transient ischemic attack: Focus on cardiometabolic comorbidity and hospital readmission [^112guAeg]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

We aimed to provide estimates of mortality associated with cardiometabolic comorbidity and incident readmission from cardiometabolic as compared with noncardiometabolic conditions following a first transient ischemic attack.

- **Methods**: Between 2000 and 2015, patients hospitalized for a first transient ischemic attack were examined for cardiometabolic comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation), 5-year incident hospitalization, and time to death.

- **Results**: Of 251 patients with transient ischemic attack, 134 (53%) had at least one and 55 (22%) had at least two cardiometabolic conditions. By 5 years, 491 readmissions (134 [27%] cardiometabolic and 357 [73%] noncardiometabolic) and 75 deaths (27 [36%] cardiometabolic and 47 [64%] noncardiometabolic) were observed. Mortality was increased with any cardiometabolic comorbidity (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–3.03; P = 0.0089) with multiplicative mortality risk from a combination of coronary artery disease and heart failure. Each hospitalization was associated with a 1.5-fold risk of death (95% confidence interval, 1.37–1.64; P < 0.0001). The risk of cardiometabolic and noncardiometabolic mortality was correlated with the corresponding category-specific readmission.

- **Conclusions**: Among patients hospitalized for a first transient ischemic attack, 5-year mortality is associated with cardiometabolic comorbidity and rates of subsequent hospitalization.

As neurological symptoms resolve after TIA, there has been a widely held perception that urgent evaluation and treatment following TIA are unnecessary. In actual fact, it is becoming increasingly clear that the short-term stroke risk after TIA is very high. Recent studies have identified independent predictors that indicate which patients are at highest risk of ischemic events. These risk scores could enable physicians to target appropriate patients for urgent care. In this review, we summarize the recent literature on stroke risk after TIA and risk stratification, along with recently published guidelines on evaluation and treatment.

### Transient ischemic attack overview: Defining the challenges for improving outcomes [^111P9Yi8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attacks are reversible neurologic events that herald potentially catastrophic strokes. Well-designed studies have documented that approximately 10% of patients who experience a transient ischemic attack will have a stroke within the succeeding 90 days; half of these strokes occur within 48 hours of the transient ischemic attack. Improved outcomes from transient ischemic attacks require a heightened awareness of their clinical features on the part of both patients and physicians. The significant potential for stroke in the immediate days following the transient ischemic attack imposes an urgency in the diagnostic evaluation of these patients.

A review of the literature suggests a need for pathways to promote facilitated evaluations of transient ischemic attack patients in order to identify underlying correctable pathologies, and to direct medical and surgical management strategies.

### Clinical diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging in patients with transient and minor neurological symptoms: A prospective cohort study [^115A2PWQ]. Stroke (2022). Low credibility.

The utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with transient or minor neurological symptoms is uncertain. This study aimed to determine the proportion of participants with transient or minor neurological symptoms who had MRI evidence of acute ischemia at different clinical probabilities of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke.

- **Methods**: The cohort consisted of participants with transient or minor neurological symptoms from emergency and outpatient settings. Clinicians at different levels of training provided each participant with a diagnostic probability: probable when TIA/stroke was the most likely differential diagnosis; possible when TIA/stroke was not the most likely differential diagnosis; or uncertain when a diagnostic probability could not be given. This was done before a 1.5 or 3T brain MRI was performed within five days of symptom onset. Post hoc, each clinical syndrome was defined, blind to MRI findings, as National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke criteria TIA/stroke; International Headache Society criteria migraine aura; non-TIA focal symptoms; or nonfocal symptoms. MRI evidence of acute ischemia was defined by two reads of MRI. Stroke occurrence was ascertained for at least 90 days and up to 18 months after recruitment.

- **Results**: A total of 272 individuals participated (47% female, mean age 60, SD 14), with 58% undergoing MRI within two days of onset. Most (92%) reported focal symptoms. MRI evidence of acute ischemia was found in cases with stroke/TIA clinical probabilities as follows: probable, 23 out of 75 (31% [95% CI, 21%–42%]); possible, 26 out of 151 (17% [12%–24%]); and uncertain, 9 out of 43 (20% [10%–36%]).

### Clinical laboratory testing: What is the role of tilt-table testing, active standing test, carotid massage, electrophysiological testing and ATP test in the syncope evaluation [^115M81P7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The first step in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected syncope begins with an "initial evaluation", which consists of a careful history taking and a physical examination, including orthostatic blood pressure measurement and an electrocardiogram. However, even in expert centers, the diagnostic yield of this "initial evaluation" is only approximately 50%. In the remaining cases where a satisfactory diagnosis is either unknown or uncertain after the initial assessment, additional clinical testing is required.

- **Role of additional diagnostic tests**: This article reviews the role of some of the more commonly used additional diagnostic tests, including tilt-table testing, the active standing test, carotid sinus massage, electrophysiological testing, and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) test. The role of angiography, exercise testing, and imaging is noted briefly.

Other clinical laboratory investigations, such as ambulatory ECG monitoring, are examined in other papers in this issue. In brief, clinical laboratory tests, when carefully interpreted, may be useful in evaluating the basis of suspected syncope. However, these tests should be selected carefully and performed based on the pre-test probability inferred from the initial examination, with a preference for using less invasive tests first.

### Transient ischemic attacks: Advances in diagnosis and management in the emergency department [^113fn7xV]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The definition of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) has evolved over the past decade from a clinical diagnosis to a tissue-based definition based on neuroimaging results. TIA shares the same pathophysiology as stroke, which occurs in up to 5% of patients within 48 hours of the TIA and 10% within 90 days. This rate is decreasing, likely due to improved diagnostic and management strategies. Decision support scores have been developed to risk-stratify patients, which include clinical and radiological elements. Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, as well as carotid endarterectomy/stenting, have been shown to reduce the occurrence of stroke after TIA.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^111LyqrD]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for transient ischemic attack, more specifically with respect to the management of hypertension, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with hypertension experiencing a TIA.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^115oKtKG]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for transient ischemic attack, specifically in relation to the management of dyslipidemia, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend identifying and addressing causes of hypertriglyceridemia in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL). Patients should consider adopting a very low-fat diet, avoiding refined carbohydrates and alcohol, and consuming omega-3 fatty acids to further reduce triglycerides. This approach aims to lower the risk of ASCVD events in patients with persistently elevated or increasing levels of triglycerides. Additionally, initiating fibrate therapy may be necessary to prevent acute pancreatitis.

### Improving referrals for tilt table testing in patients with transient loss of consciousness [^115sGfAD]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Low credibility.

A simple educational intervention and the use of a referral proforma in this quality improvement project have made a sustained difference in improving the appropriateness of referrals for tilt table testing. The total number of appropriate referrals increased from 76% at baseline to 92–100%.

Use of a referral proforma also helps us triage referrals so that patients with Class I indications might be prioritized if there is a growing number of referrals exceeding the capacity of the service.

Not all doctors were using the referral proforma since its introduction despite the publicity (PDSA cycle 2). The department still receives typed letters from clinics asking for tilt table tests, creating inherent delays in getting letters typed by secretaries, signed by consultants or registrars, and then posted to the department.

Other limitations include the small number of patients in PDSA cycles 1 and 2 and the final measurement, although a large number of patients were studied at baseline. However, to avoid bias, we studied a consecutive cohort of NHS patients.

### Transient ischemic attack: risk stratification and treatment [^111P87AA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A major challenge facing the physician evaluating patients with transient ischemic attack is determining which patients are at the highest short-term risk of stroke. A number of stratification schemes have been recently developed incorporating easily obtainable clinical information about the individual patient. Further, emerging data suggest a role for brain and vascular imaging in risk stratification.

Many aspects of acute management of transient ischemic attack, such as which patients should be hospitalized and choice of acute antithrombotic therapy, remain controversial because of a lack of evidence from controlled trials. For longer-term prevention, there is much firmer evidence from multiple large randomized trials, and these data are reviewed in this article.

### Patient readiness for risk-reduction education and lifestyle change following transient ischemic attack [^115sVxDu]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to address the limited understanding of patient readiness for secondary prevention and lifestyle changes following a transient ischemic attack. Understanding patient perspectives about the timing and delivery of secondary prevention education is essential to promote meaningful risk factor reduction in this population.

A single, semi-structured, telephone interview was conducted with ten individuals (7 male, 3 female) within three months following a transient ischemic attack. These interviews explored experiences related to transient ischemic attacks and post-event education, and the data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.

Results showed that individuals had varied experiences with secondary prevention education. Four themes emerged from these experiences: "what the hell happened?", "I mustn't have been quite ready", "what should I be doing?" and "we all see it in different ways". Patient readiness to receive secondary prevention education and adopt lifestyle changes was influenced by individual knowledge, personal experience of the transient ischemic attack, socio-environmental factors, and the format and content of education.

Readiness for risk-reduction education and lifestyle change following transient ischemic attack is individual and complex. Logistical factors including the location, time, and cost of education, timing of education delivery, and patient perspectives should be considered in the development and delivery of secondary prevention interventions.

### Clinical diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging in patients with transient and minor neurological symptoms: A prospective cohort study [^114BYWmc]. Stroke (2022). Low credibility.

In this study, MRI evidence of acute ischemia was seen in 17% (95% CI, 12%–24%) of participants with possible stroke or TIA (where another diagnosis was thought more likely) and 16% (95% CI, 10%–25%) of participants with focal symptoms that were not within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke definition of TIA. Using the prescription of antiplatelets as a proxy for secondary prevention, we estimated that MRI would have led to a modest increase (5% [95% CI, 3%–8%]) in the number of people who would have been prescribed an antiplatelet compared with treatment plans without MRI.

The findings from this study are consistent with other literature. In a study of 1028 participants from multiple countries with minor or transient symptoms, 12% of participants with a diagnosis of transient focal neurological events had an MRI DWI finding. In other smaller studies, DWI-positive lesions were present in 23% (13/56) of patients with transient neurological attacks and 35% (21/59) of patients with neurological symptoms and normal brain computed tomography (CT) presenting to an emergency department.

Clinical diagnosis of transient and minor neurological symptoms relies on a history that may be poorly interpreted by a clinician or remembered with difficulty by patients because of acute or chronic cognitive problems. Therefore, doctors often disagree about whether a patient's symptoms are due to a TIA when comparing general practitioners with neurologists, emergency department doctors with neurologists, neurologists with neurologists, or even stroke-trained neurologists.

### Recognizing posterior circulation transient ischemic attacks presenting as episodic isolated dizziness [^113jX8S4]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Diagnosing patients presenting to the emergency department with self-limited episodes of isolated dizziness, known as the episodic vestibular syndrome, requires a broad differential diagnosis that includes posterior circulation transient ischemic attack. Because these patients are, by definition, asymptomatic without new neurologic findings on examination, the diagnosis largely based on history and epidemiologic context can be challenging.

We review literature that addresses the frequency of posterior circulation transient ischemic attack in this group of patients compared with other potential causes of episodic vestibular syndrome. We present ways of distinguishing posterior circulation transient ischemic attack from vestibular migraine, the most common cause of episodic vestibular syndrome. We also present a diagnostic algorithm that may help clinicians work their way through the differential diagnosis.

### Carotid artery imaging for secondary stroke prevention: Both imaging modality and rapid access to imaging are important [^116CmEvm]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with transient ischemic attack require carotid imaging to diagnose carotid stenosis. The differing sensitivity, specificity, and availability of carotid imaging methods have created uncertainty over which noninvasive method is best and whether intra-arterial angiography is still required. We evaluated the influence of carotid imaging methods on secondary stroke prevention.

- **Methods**: We modeled the effect of different carotid imaging strategies and timing on endarterectomy workload, stroke, and death at 1 and 5 years. We used all available data on stroke prevention after transient ischemic attack from systematic reviews (carotid imaging, medical and surgical interventions), population-based transient ischemic attack/stroke studies, government statistics, and stroke prevention clinics.

- **Results**: Choice of imaging strategy affected speed of assessment, strokes prevented, and endarterectomy workload. The number of strokes prevented at 5 years varied by up to 22 per 1000 patients between imaging strategies for a given time to assessment. Delaying endarterectomy from 14 to approximately 30 days would fail to prevent up to 11 strokes per 1000 patients depending on the imaging strategy. Sensitive fast imaging (e.g. ultrasound) was best for patients seen early; specific imaging (e.g. CT angiography or contrast-enhanced MR angiography) was best for patients seen late after transient ischemic attack. Intra-arterial angiography conferred no advantage over noninvasive imaging.

- **Conclusions**: Rapid access to sensitive noninvasive carotid imaging prevents most strokes in patients following a transient ischemic attack.

### Safety and feasibility of a rapid outpatient management strategy for transient ischemic attack and minor stroke: The Rapid Access Vascular Evaluation-Neurology (RAVEN) approach [^114VLsUL]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

This study evaluates the feasibility and safety of a rapid outpatient stroke clinic for transient ischemic attack and minor stroke, known as the Rapid Access Vascular Evaluation-Neurology (RAVEN) approach. Although most patients with transient ischemic attack and minor stroke in US emergency departments (EDs) are admitted, experiences from other countries suggest that efficient outpatient evaluation may be safe.

- **Methods**: Patients with transient ischemic attack and minor stroke presenting to the ED with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 5 or less and a nondisabling deficit were assessed for potential discharge to RAVEN, following a protocol that incorporated both social and medical criteria. A vascular neurologist conducted an outpatient evaluation, including vessel imaging, within 24 hours at the RAVEN clinic. Participants were monitored for compliance with clinic attendance as well as 90-day return ischemic attack and minor stroke and hospitalization rates.

- **Results**: Between December 2016 and June 2018, 162 patients with transient ischemic attack and minor stroke were discharged to RAVEN. Among them, 154 patients (95.1%) attended as scheduled, and 101 (66%) received a final diagnosis of transient ischemic attack and minor stroke. At the RAVEN evaluation, two patients (1.3%) required hospitalization; one for worsening symptoms and another for intracranial arterial stenosis caused by zoster. In the group with confirmed transient ischemic attack and minor stroke, 18 out of 101 patients (19.1%) had either returned to an ED or been admitted within 90 days.

### Transient ischemic attack: reviewing the evolution of the definition, diagnosis, risk stratification, and management for the emergency physician [^114xbrE5]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is an episode of reversible neurologic deficit caused by temporary focal central nervous system hypoperfusion. TIA is a medical emergency because patients with TIA in the emergency department (ED) have a high risk for stroke within the next 48 hours. It is imperative for the clinician to recognize this golden opportunity to prevent a disabling stroke. This article reviews our conceptual understanding of TIA, its definition, diagnosis, ways to stratify stroke risk, the acute management and disposition in the ED, and the potential future role of diagnostic biomarkers.

### Transient ischemic attack: Definition and natural history [^115B5gm8]. Current Atherosclerosis Reports (2006). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on transient ischemic attack:

- **Definition**: A TIA is a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than 1 hour but can persist for up to 24 hours, and without evidence of acute infarction.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of TIA involves a temporary disruption in blood flow to a specific area of the brain, often due to emboli or thrombi. This leads to ischemia in the affected area, causing transient neurological symptoms. Common conditions causing a TIA include cerebrovascular disorders such as large artery atherosclerosis, carotid or vertebral artery stenosis, and cervical artery dissection; cardiovascular disorders such as AF, valvular heart disease, and infective endocarditis; hypercoagulable conditions such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, cancer, hyperhomocysteinemia, and sickle cell disease; and inflammatory vascular conditions such as FMD, giant cell arteritis, and primary angiitis of the CNS.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of TIA in the US is estimated at 0.7–1.19 per 1,000 person-years.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for TIA include advanced age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia, tobacco smoking, high sodium intake, high stress, CVDs, and a family history of cerebrovascular accidents.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of a TIA is characterized by sudden onset of symptoms that resolve within 24 hours. Symptoms can include motor weakness, dysphasia, and altered consciousness.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^115et9yM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for transient ischemic attack (TIA), particularly concerning hypertension management and blood pressure (BP) targets, the 2017 guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the American College of Physicians (ACP) recommend considering the initiation or intensification of pharmacologic treatment. The aim is to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 140 mmHg, with the goal of reducing the risk of stroke or cardiac events in patients aged 60 years or older with a history of TIA. Treatment goals should be determined based on a periodic discussion with the patient about the benefits and potential harms of specific BP targets.
