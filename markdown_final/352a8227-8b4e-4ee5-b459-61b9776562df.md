## Question

Updated treatment strategies for intestinal Behçet's disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about updated treatment strategies for intestinal Behçet's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching treatment principles and treat-to-target framework. Then, I should verify how disease severity and prognostic factors stratify therapy. Next, I will review first-line options for mild-to-moderate disease, followed by escalation to anti-TNF agents and immunomodulators for moderate-to-severe or refractory disease. After that, I need to examine advanced biologics and combination strategies, surgical indications and perioperative management, and finally monitoring, targets, and special populations, while continuously checking for internal consistency and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the core principles so I don't jump to conclusions. The updated consensus emphasizes prompt suppression of inflammatory flares, prevention of recurrences, and avoidance of irreversible organ damage, using a multidisciplinary, individualized approach and a treat-to-target strategy adapted from IBD, with early clinical remission and CRP normalization as initial goals and mucosal healing as a further target, recognizing that intestinal BD is a systemic vasculitis with gastrointestinal manifestations rather than a purely intestinal disease [^112yBqMW] [^112W3H9y] [^114zRv6w] [^111GmKwM].

> Hold on, I should verify how severity and prognosis shape choices. Severe disease features such as large or deep volcano-shaped ulcers, high DAIBD scores, elevated CRP, steroid dependency, and prior surgery predict worse outcomes and guide earlier use of biologics; DAIBD thresholds like ≥ 70 predict surgery and ≥ 40 correlate with a more severe course, so I need to keep these in mind when deciding on escalation timing [^112CDrTk] [^115bjtpx] [^116iAsit].

> Next, I will examine first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate disease. I initially thought 5-ASA could be used broadly, but wait, let me verify the nuance: 5-ASA is reasonable for mild flares or maintenance in select cases, yet evidence is limited and it should not be relied upon for moderate-to-severe disease or deep ulcers; corticosteroids remain the cornerstone for acute flares, typically prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg with a planned taper, ideally as bridging therapy while starting a steroid-sparing agent to mitigate dependency, which occurs in roughly a third of patients if not tapered appropriately [^114VcBH1] [^1143ep9G] [^111zLKXX] [^116dkoGJ].

> I need to check immunomodulator positioning next. Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine are recommended as first- or second-line options in moderate-to-severe activity or when large or deep ulcers are present to prevent complications, and they are also used to maintain remission and reduce steroid exposure; thalidomide can be effective in refractory cases but requires strict teratogenicity precautions and neurologic monitoring, so I should confirm contraception and counsel before prescribing [^114aCuAn] [^116wjUPA] [^112BYh9S].

> Now, I will escalate to anti-TNF agents for severe disease or steroid-refractory cases. Infliximab and adalimumab have robust real-world and meta-analytic evidence showing approximately 60–74% clinical improvement by 10–14 weeks and 74–78% by 48–54 weeks, with sustained efficacy up to 100 weeks in many cohorts; importantly, mucosal healing occurs in about 61% with long-term therapy, and guidelines endorse anti-TNF as first-line biologic therapy in severe GI involvement or deep/large ulcers to prevent perforation, bleeding, or obstruction [^1135UHBz] [^115P2E1G] [^113Gre3w] [^114SN6Qt].

> Wait, I should double-check predictors of response and durability. Higher baseline CRP, particularly ≥ 1 mg/dL, predicts earlier discontinuation and poorer continuation on anti-TNF, whereas achieving remission by week 4 and concomitant immunomodulator use improve sustained response; dose optimization through interval shortening or dose escalation is recommended in resistant disease, aligning with treat-to-target principles [^112m4WQa] [^1173AnHx] [^1162G4JA] [^111ZqynR].

> Let me consider advanced biologics for refractory cases, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about head-to-head superiority. Ustekinumab and vedolizumab are reasonable off-label options per living guidelines when anti-TNF fails or is contraindicated, though high-quality intestinal BD–specific data are sparse; case-level evidence exists for IL-6 blockade with tocilizumab in refractory disease, and IL-1 inhibition has anecdotal support, so I should frame these as alternatives with careful risk–benefit review and shared decision-making [^111Ng8uY] [^112JV2Un] [^111zLKXX].

> I should confirm combination strategies in highly refractory presentations. Combining infliximab with thalidomide has case-level evidence of synergistic TNF pathway blockade and clinical improvement, but I need to ensure robust neuropathy monitoring and contraception given thalidomide's risks; this remains a last-resort strategy after standard options fail [^112BYh9S] [^115KBdeX].

> Next, I should review surgical indications and perioperative management. Immediate surgery is mandatory for uncontrolled bleeding, perforation, or obstruction, and early surgery in selected patients may reduce recurrence and reoperation compared with delayed surgery in acute presentations; to mitigate postoperative relapse, guidelines recommend perioperative systemic corticosteroids and anti-TNF, with thiopurines for maintenance, and I should coordinate closely with surgery to time biologic exposure around the operation [^116mzx4X] [^117TpB2a] [^115dQ4pa] [^116wjUPA].

> I will now examine monitoring and treat-to-target endpoints. Clinical remission with DAIBD ≤ 19 and CRP normalization are initial targets, with mucosal healing as a further goal given its association with reduced relapse and surgery; fecal calprotectin correlates with intestinal disease and may serve as a noninvasive surrogate, while transmural healing is promising but not yet validated as a target in intestinal BD; I should confirm that endoscopic reassessment guides escalation, ideally every 6–12 months in active disease [^112CDrTk] [^114zRv6w] [^115s5AxZ] [^116oNn26].

> But wait, what about special populations and safety prerequisites. In pediatrics, anti-TNF is often first-line biologic for severe organ involvement including GI disease, with close growth and infection surveillance; before immunosuppression, I need to screen for latent infections including TB and HBV, vaccinate appropriately, and counsel on pregnancy planning given teratogenicity of thalidomide and limited but growing biologic safety data; multidisciplinary care remains essential given multisystem risk [^112zBVsg] [^115YZKeX] [^111sKFfH].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure coherence. Start with 5-ASA for mild disease and corticosteroids for acute flares with a planned taper, introduce azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine early for moderate-to-severe disease or deep ulcers, escalate promptly to anti-TNF for severe activity, steroid dependence, or refractory disease with proactive dose optimization, consider ustekinumab or vedolizumab after anti-TNF failure, reserve thalidomide combinations for exceptional refractory cases, and integrate surgery for emergencies and selected early cases, all anchored by treat-to-target monitoring with DAIBD, CRP, fecal calprotectin, and endoscopic healing [^114VcBH1] [^114aCuAn] [^114SN6Qt] [^111Ng8uY] [^112BYh9S] [^116mzx4X] [^112CDrTk] [^114zRv6w].

---

The updated treatment strategy for intestinal Behçet's disease emphasizes a **treat-to-target approach** [^116oNn26] with early induction and maintenance of remission, prioritizing mucosal healing [^115s5AxZ] and prevention of complications [^112yBqMW]. First-line therapy includes **5-ASA for mild disease** [^114VcBH1] and corticosteroids with immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) for moderate-to-severe or steroid-dependent cases [^1111AoDg] [^114aCuAn] [^111zLKXX]. Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab) are recommended for refractory disease or severe activity [^114LaVTm], with dose escalation or interval shortening for nonresponders [^111ZqynR]. Thalidomide is a last-resort option for refractory cases [^112BYh9S], and surgery is reserved for complications such as perforation, obstruction, or uncontrolled bleeding [^116mzx4X]. Emerging therapies like ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors are under investigation [^111Ng8uY] [^115iiL4r]. Management should be individualized and multidisciplinary [^112yBqMW], with regular monitoring of clinical, endoscopic, and biomarker responses [^112CDrTk].

---

## Treatment principles and goals

The core principles include **prompt suppression of inflammatory exacerbations** and prevention of recurrences to avoid irreversible organ damage [^112yBqMW], with individualized therapy based on disease severity, organ involvement, and patient preferences [^112yBqMW]. The treat-to-target strategy aims for **clinical remission, normalization of CRP, and mucosal healing** as primary targets [^114zRv6w], with deeper remission (transmural healing) as a secondary goal where feasible [^notfound].

---

## First-line therapies

### Mild disease

For mild disease, **5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)** is recommended for mild-to-moderate flares [^114VcBH1] and for maintenance therapy [^116dkoGJ].

---

### Moderate-to-severe disease

- **Corticosteroids**: Oral or intravenous corticosteroids are first-line for acute flares [^1143ep9G]; taper on starting 5-ASA or immunomodulators [^1143ep9G].

- **Immunomodulators**: Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine are first-line for moderate-to-severe activity or large/deep ulcers to prevent complications [^114aCuAn].

---

## Second-line and biologic therapies

### Anti-TNF agents

- **Indications**: Infliximab or adalimumab are first-line biologics for severe activity or refractory disease [^114SN6Qt] [^114LaVTm].

- **Efficacy**: Clinical improvement in ~70% and mucosal healing in ~60% with long-term therapy [^1135UHBz] [^112Qr7N6].

- **Dose optimization**: Escalate dose or shorten intervals for nonresponders [^111ZqynR].

---

### Thalidomide

Thalidomide is a **last-resort option** for refractory disease [^112BYh9S]; consider combination with anti-TNF for enhanced efficacy, with mandatory neurophysiology monitoring and contraception [^112BYh9S].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **complications** — perforation, obstruction, or uncontrolled bleeding [^116mzx4X] — and for **post-resection relapse prevention**, for which corticosteroids and anti-TNF are first-line to reduce relapse risk [^115dQ4pa].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging options include **ustekinumab and vedolizumab**, considered for refractory disease [^111Ng8uY], and **IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors**, which are under investigation for refractory cases [^1174iHf2] [^111Ng8uY].

---

## Monitoring and treatment targets

Regular **clinical, endoscopic, and biomarker monitoring** is essential to guide therapy adjustments [^114zRv6w]. Treatment targets include **clinical remission, CRP normalization, and mucosal healing** as primary goals [^114zRv6w], with transmural healing as a secondary target where feasible [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic factors influencing treatment response

Poor prognostic factors include **young age, high disease activity, volcano-type ulcers, absence of mucosal healing, elevated CRP, prior surgery, and lack of initial response to medical therapy** [^116iAsit]. Baseline CRP ≥ 1 mg/dL predicts higher discontinuation rates with anti-TNF therapy [^112m4WQa].

---

## Current limitations and future directions

Evidence remains **limited**, with a need for more randomized controlled trials and head-to-head comparisons [^111v6eXu]. Biomarker development is needed to enable noninvasive monitoring and better disease stratification [^116HG5H9]. Personalized medicine approaches tailored to disease phenotype, severity, and patient factors are also required [^112TFPGf].

---

The updated strategy for intestinal Behçet's disease centers on **early, targeted therapy** with escalation to biologics for refractory disease, surgical management of complications, and ongoing monitoring to achieve mucosal healing and prevent relapse [^112yBqMW].

Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic and recurrent systemic vasculitis involving large, medium and small blood vessels as well as arteries and veins. BD with predominant gastrointestinal manifestations is diagnosed as intestinal BD, which is associated with severe complications such as massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, perforation, and obstruction. Recently, treat-to-target (T2T) strategies have been successfully used in many chronic diseases and been suggested in the management of BD, while there are no related reviews about the global treatment strategy including treatment principles and targets for intestinal BD in detail.

According to these studies, the EULAR and RSCMA updated the guidelines in 2018 and 2021, respectively. The updated treatment principles can be summarized as follows: (1) The key point is to promptly suppress inflammatory exacerbations and prevent recurrences. (2) The prevention of irreversible organ damage and disease progression is the final goal. (3) A multidisciplinary approach and individualized treatment based on patient status, severity of organ involvement, and patient preferences are necessary. To some extent, it is similar to the principles of treatment for IBD, which aims for early induction of remission and long-term maintenance to prevent relapse.

Conclusion

In summary, BD is a systemic vasculitis with multiple organ involvement. For intestinal BD namely BD with predominant gastrointestinal manifestations, we review the global treatment strategy with treatment principles and targets. The key points of the treatment principles of intestinal BD focus on prompt suppression of inflammatory exacerbations and prevention of recurrences to prevent irreversible organ damage and disease progression. As for treatment targets in intestinal BD, further seeking MH is expected to have a better prognosis after achieving remission of clinical symptoms and normalization of CRP. Subsequent multicenter, prospective and large-sample-size studies are needed for further exploration of treatment targets, such as noninvasive markers and whether TH and HH can improve the long-term prognosis of intestinal BD.

### The treatment principles and targets for intestinal behcet's disease [^111GmKwM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The management of intestinal BD is mainly carried out in the Departments of Rheumatology and Gastroenterology, which are complementary to each other. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) updated the recommendations for the management of BD published in 2018, which first proposed that gastrointestinal involvement of BD should be confirmed by endoscopy and/or imaging. Evidence-based Diagnosis and Clinical Practice Guidelines (EDGs) for intestinal BD published by the Japanese Society for Behcet's Disease (JSBD) in 2020 clearly presented the diagnostic criteria and algorithm. Recently, the Inflammatory Enteropathy Group, Chinese Medical Association (IEGCMA) published a Chinese consensus on diagnosis and treatment of intestinal BD in 2022.

Recently, treat-to-target (T2T) strategies have been embraced in many chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and CD. T2T strategies have improved long-term outcomes of related diseases. With a deeper understanding of BD and the development of diagnosis, evaluation and treatment methods, Hatemi proposed for the first time in 2022 to implement a T2T strategy in the management of BD. To date, there is no related reviews about the treatment principles and targets of intestinal BD in detail. Therefore, we review intestinal BD with treatment principles and targets to improve the clinicians' understanding.

### An update on the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of intestinal Behçet's disease [^116iAsit]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses recent scientific developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of intestinal Behçet's disease.

Recent Findings

Gastrointestinal involvement is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Behçet's disease. Patient clinical data are scarce because of the rarity of the disease; however, novel diagnostic criteria and disease activity indices have been developed recently to aid treatment of Behçet's disease patients. Current therapies include 5-aminosalicylic acids, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or antitumor necrosis factor alpha agents. Antitumor necrosis factor alpha agents can achieve clinical responses and remission in patients that were previously nonresponsive to corticosteroids or immunomodulators. Clinical variables, including young age and higher disease activity at the time of diagnosis, volcano-type ulcers, absence of mucosal healing, higher C-reactive protein levels, prior history of surgery, and lack of initial response to medical therapy, can be regarded as poor prognostic factors.

Summary

Previously, the diagnosis and management of intestinal Behçet's disease depended upon the expertise of individual clinicians; however, more standardized medical assessments and improved treatment regimens for Behçet's disease patients are evolving.

Key points to be made clear

What's more, there were several key points which should be made clear in our review. It was listed in a table form as follows (Table 1): ① Application: as we all knew, intestinal BD was gastrointestinal involvement of BD while BD was an autoimmune disease with multiple organ involvement. For patients with BD, skin, mucosa, and joint involvement could cause impairment of quality of life but do not cause permanent damage whereas untreated eye, vascular, nervous system, and gastrointestinal system involvement could cause serious damage and even death. And it was worth noting for clinicians in disease assessment that the treatment targets mentioned in our review applied to gastrointestinal assessment of BD after treatment especially presenting mainly with gastrointestinal involvement. The treatment targets for BD needed to be multidimensional as it was a systemic vasculitis which can affect multiple organs with different course and prognostic importance; ② Reference: in consideration of lack of high-quality research in the field of intestinal BD and clinical similarity between intestinal BD and IBD to some extent, we reviewed the treatment targets of intestinal BD by mentioning several definitions and conceptions in IBD for partial reference. However, it was also worth noting that intestinal BD and IBD were clearly different kinds of diseases. The former was the gastrointestinal manifestations of chronic recurrent systemic vasculitis while the latter was a disease of nonspecific chronic inflammation confined to the intestine with different which could have extraintestinal manifestations during the clinical course. Therefore, as we mentioned above, further studies should be conducted to explore whether the definitions and conceptions from IBD needed to be adjusted or modified in intestinal BD; ③ Significance: we reviewed the treatment principles and targets of intestinal BD, aiming to improve clinicians' global understanding of the disease treatment. Certainly, the concrete medical treatment plans in intestinal BD such as reduction strategies of corticosteroid, advantages and disadvantages of different drugs, and application of biologic agents and conventional immunosuppressive agents were of the same importance which needs further discussion in the future.

Treatment targets

The treatment principles and targets complement each other and act as global treatment strategy. Up to now, the medical treatment target for intestinal BD is to prompt timely suppression of inflammation and maintenance of disease remission. Here, we elaborate the treatment target from three aspects as follows: evaluable markers, effective markers, and potency-ratio markers. Considering that there is a lack of high-quality research in the field of intestinal BD, some definitions and conceptions are cited from IBD.

Evaluable markers: Where should we pick up treatment targets from?

Clinical manifestations

In 2011, Cheon et al. first proposed the Disease Activity Index for Intestinal BD (DAIBD) to evaluate the disease activity of intestinal BD. The DAIBD provides a score between 0 and 325 based on an 8-point index that includes symptoms and signs of patients. It classifies disease activity as quiescent (≤ 19), mild (20–39), moderate (40–74) and severe (⩾75). The study enrolled a total of 110 patients with intestinal BD, and the results revealed that the DAIBD showed much higher responsiveness than the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) (r = 0.81 versus 0.65, respectively). Park et al. in 2013 reported that DAIBD had predictive value for prognosis and outcome of intestinal BD: ① DAIBD ⩾ 70 was a predictive factor for surgical intervention [Hazard ratio (HR) 5.43; 95% CI 2.65–11.10]; ② DAIBD ⩾ 60 was an independent factor associated with relapse for patients during 5-ASA therapy (HR 2.30; 95% CI 1.10–4.83); ③ DAIBD ⩾ 40 at the time of diagnosis was independently associated with a more severe clinical course (OR 6.20; 95% CI 1.10–33.50). However, some studies have shown that a portion of patients with intestinal BD in clinical remission (DAIBD ≤ 19) still have endoscopic disease activity.

### Anti-TNF-α agents for refractory intestinal Behçet's disease: case series and meta-analysis [^1135UHBz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Behçet's disease (BD) is a relapsing systemic immune disorder, and intestinal BD is a significant cause of mortality in patients with BD. Conventional therapeutic strategies for intestinal BD showed unsatisfactory outcomes, especially in those patients with refractory subtypes. In recent years, biologic agents have exhibited promising results in this field. While the sample sizes of existing studies were limited, the results were heterogeneous.

Objectives

This study aimed to observe the efficacy of different biologics in clinical symptomatic improvement and intestinal mucosal healing.

Design

This is a study including the report of case series and meta-analysis.

Data Sources and Methods

This meta-analysis was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Free-text words and subject terms, including 'Behcet's Syndrome', 'Biologics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Antagonist', were used to systematically research the relevant studies in the electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library). All retrieved articles were from inception to July 2021, and the data from our institution were also included in this meta-analysis. A double arcsine transformation was performed to stabilize the variance of the original ratio. Heterogeneity was evaluated via Q -test and I 2 statistics. Random-effects or fixed-effects model was used to calculate the pooled parameters, and the results were presented as forest plots with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Twelve studies were included, but only antitumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) agents were prescribed as biologicals for refractory intestinal BD. The symptom improvement rates at our institution ranged from 57.1 to 81.8%, and the mucosal healing rates were from 20 to 60% in different therapeutic periods. A total of 514 patients were enrolled in the meta-analysis, and the synthesized ratios showed that 59.8% (n = 377) and 73.7% (n = 317) of patients who received maintenance therapy with anti-TNF-α agents could achieve clinical symptomatic improvement during short-term (10–14weeks) and long-term (48–54weeks) periods, respectively. Furthermore, 77.8% (n = 229) of patients with intestinal BD maintained therapeutic efficacy for a longer time (100weeks). In addition, 60.9% (n = 120) of the patients achieved sustained intestinal mucosal healing during a long-term follow-up (24–52weeks).

Conclusion

Anti-TNF-α treatment is effective in treating refractory intestinal BD but more studies are required to evaluate the effects of new biologics for intestinal BD in the near future.

Registration

This study has been registered on PROSPERO, the ID is CRD42022329211.

Plain Language Summary

Anti-TNF-α agents are effective and safe in patients with intestinal Behçet's disease Behçet's disease (BD) is a disease affecting several organs including the gastrointestinal tract. Nowadays, the efficacy of existing therapy strategies is still unsatisfactory and some patients are suffering from repeated attacks of the disease. We noticed that a new kind of medicine, called antitumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) agents, was applied to these patients recently. The therapeutic efficacy is not convincing enough to evaluate since the number of patients receiving this new medicine was small in every individual study. Regarding this, we conducted a research to learn about the efficacy of this medicine at our own institution. Besides, we composed the results of other studies in an appropriate way. Then, we drew a conclusion on the exact efficacy of anti-TNF-α agents after the data analysis. We unveiled that the anti-TNF-α agents appeared both effective and safe in the management of intestinal BD patients when the classical therapy failed. More than half of the patients could achieve discomfort remission when they got the therapy of the new medicine at our institution. We also found that intestinal ulcers in most patients improved after they received the treatment. All in all, it offered another foothold for getting relief in these patients who were caught in this mire.

### Anti-TNF-α agents for refractory intestinal Behçet's disease: case series and meta-analysis [^1174iHf2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Behçet's disease (BD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease with a poorly understood etiology, and it is characterized by vasculitis with multisystem involvement including oral-genital-aphthous ulcers, ocular and neurological lesions. – A diagnosis of intestinal BD is established when intestinal symptoms and typical gastrointestinal tract ulcers arise in the defined BD patients. Besides, other typical oval-shaped large ulcers in the terminal ileum were contributory to the diagnosis after the exclusion of other diseases with similar manifestations. Overall, intestinal BD accounts for only 5–10% of all BD patients. The disease is prevalent in Asia and Mediterranean areas, but rare in western countries. Inflammatory bowel disease is another relapsing autoimmune disease, and its pathogenesis and manifestations could mimic those of intestinal BD. Thus, therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease are generally prescribed for intestinal BD, including 5-aminosalicylic acids, steroids, and immunomodulators. Nevertheless, not all patients obtain an alleviation from these conventional therapies, and some patients even deteriorate progressively or require surgery. It is reported that the cumulative 5- and 10-year surgery rates for intestinal BD have reached approximately 30 and 40%, respectively.

In recent years, biologics have received attention for their high effectiveness in treating various inflammatory diseases. – Multiple biologics have been applied as an alternative treatment for patients with BD, while the efficacy of biologics for intestinal BD is still indeterminate. – Most of the published researches paid close attention to antitumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) agents, but other biologics like interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, or IL-17 inhibitors were rarely used. Although anti-TNF-α agents showed moderate effectiveness in intestinal BD, the relevant studies were single-arm retrospective observational studies with small sample sizes and the time periods of efficacy evaluation were highly heterogeneous. As a result, variations among the recent evidence were remarkable and the exact efficacy of biologics for intestinal BD was inconsistent.

Currently, the therapeutic strategies for intestinal BD treatment have been just barely satisfactory and the evidence was mostly based on the findings of retrospective observational studies. To unveil the efficacy and safety of biologics for intestinal BD, we performed a retrospective study at our institution. Furthermore, a single-arm meta-analysis was performed and results from our institution were included. A better understanding of biologics in intestinal BD would be favorable to improve the therapeutic strategies and the prognosis, especially for those patients who failed to achieve alleviation in the conventional treatments.

### A Treat-to-target approach is needed for Behçet's syndrome [^116oNn26]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Treat-to-target (T2T) approach has improved outcomes in chronic diseases. The aim of this review is to discuss the long-term goals and review the evidence for possible targets that would predict the achievement of these goals for developing a T2T strategy for Behçet's syndrome.

Recent Findings

There are no trials comparing a tight control strategy to standard care in Behçet's syndrome but recent studies suggest better outcomes with earlier use of biologic agents compared with sustained conventional treatment. Fluorescein angiography may be a reliable tool for assessing remission in uveitis as fluorescein angiography findings were shown to predict relapses and long-term visual outcome. Good recanalization on Doppler ultrasonography can be a target for venous involvement as this was the only predictor of relapse. Fecal calprotectin levels were associated with small intestinal and colonic ulcers and may be used as a surrogate for remission of gastrointestinal involvement.

Summary

There are several new treatment modalities that are tried for Behçet's syndrome and ongoing work on outcome measures for reliable disease assessment. In order to ensure the wise and efficient use of treatment modalities, development and implementation of T2T strategies are needed through multidisciplinary and multinational efforts that include patient research partners.

Potency-ratio markers: Why should we weigh the pros and cons of different treatment targets?

The concept 'the deeper the remission, the better the outcomes' has been recognized by an increasing number of clinicians engaged in chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases. However, immunosuppressive drugs such as glucocorticoids, traditional immunosuppressants, and biological agents have their related adverse drug reactions, which may be life-threatening in serious conditions. In addition, some drugs are relatively expensive. – Therefore, seeking deeper remission may be associated with more adverse reactions and costs, especially for patients with advanced age, immunosuppressed conditions, underlying diseases, high risk of treatment and poor economic status. Consequently, the EDG for intestinal BD in 2020 by the JSBD emphasized that adverse events due to enhanced treatment must be comprehensively considered before upgrading the treatment target. In addition, a simple algorithm for the treatment goals in UC and CD suggested by the STRIDE-II consensus is worthy of reference for clinicians engaged in the field of intestinal BD. The key points are summarized as follows: ① It is emphasized that it is necessary to balance the benefits and risks before adjusting the treatment targets; ② the treatment targets are stratified according to time, which means that remission of clinical symptoms and biomarkers presents as early and initial goals, while deep remission acts as a late and final goal; ③ the treatment targets are individualized based on the disease characteristics such as MH and HH for UC and MH and TH for CD.

This is a study including the report of case series and meta-analysis.

Data sources and methods:

This meta-analysis was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Free-text words and subject terms, including 'Behcet's Syndrome', 'Biologics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Antagonist', were used to systematically research the relevant studies in the electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library). All retrieved articles were from inception to July 2021, and the data from our institution were also included in this meta-analysis. A double arcsine transformation was performed to stabilize the variance of the original ratio. Heterogeneity was evaluated via Q -test and I 2 statistics. Random-effects or fixed-effects model was used to calculate the pooled parameters, and the results were presented as forest plots with 95% confidence intervals.

Results:

Twelve studies were included, but only antitumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) agents were prescribed as biologicals for refractory intestinal BD. The symptom improvement rates at our institution ranged from 57.1 to 81.8%, and the mucosal healing rates were from 20 to 60% in different therapeutic periods. A total of 514 patients were enrolled in the meta-analysis, and the synthesized ratios showed that 59.8% (n = 377) and 73.7% (n = 317) of patients who received maintenance therapy with anti-TNF-α agents could achieve clinical symptomatic improvement during short-term (10–14 weeks) and long-term (48–54 weeks) periods, respectively. Furthermore, 77.8% (n = 229) of patients with intestinal BD maintained therapeutic efficacy for a longer time (100 weeks). In addition, 60.9% (n = 120) of the patients achieved sustained intestinal mucosal healing during a long-term follow-up (24–52 weeks).

Conclusion:

Anti-TNF-α treatment is effective in treating refractory intestinal BD but more studies are required to evaluate the effects of new biologics for intestinal BD in the near future.

Registration:

This study has been registered on PROSPERO, the ID is CRD42022329211.

Plain language summary

Anti-TNF-α agents are effective and safe in patients with intestinal Behçet's disease

Behçet's disease (BD) is a disease affecting several organs including the gastrointestinal tract. Nowadays, the efficacy of existing therapy strategies is still unsatisfactory and some patients are suffering from repeated attacks of the disease. We noticed that a new kind of medicine, called antitumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) agents, was applied to these patients recently. The therapeutic efficacy is not convincing enough to evaluate since the number of patients receiving this new medicine was small in every individual study. Regarding this, we conducted a research to learn about the efficacy of this medicine at our own institution. Besides, we composed the results of other studies in an appropriate way. Then, we drew a conclusion on the exact efficacy of anti-TNF-α agents after the data analysis. We unveiled that the anti-TNF-α agents appeared both effective and safe in the management of intestinal BD patients when the classical therapy failed. More than half of the patients could achieve discomfort remission when they got the therapy of the new medicine at our institution. We also found that intestinal ulcers in most patients improved after they received the treatment. All in all, it offered another foothold for getting relief in these patients who were caught in this mire.

Treatment principles

Severity of disease and previous treatment principles

In the past decade, significant research results on BD have been published enabling a deeper understanding of disease behavior and management. Studies showed that any part of the alimentary tract can be affected in intestinal BD while the ileocecal area was the most frequently involved location. Deep ulcers in intestinal BD were responsible for severe complications such as perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding and obstruction, which indicated that gastrointestinal involvement in BD was a predictive factor for a poor prognosis. For example, Yook et al. in 2013 conducted a retrospective analysis of 124 patients with intestinal BD and found that the incidence of intestinal perforation, fistula, stenosis and abscess was 12.7, 7.6, 7.2, and 3.3%, respectively. Hatemi et al. reviewed the charts of all BD patients in their BD clinic in 2016 and found that 32% patients (N = 60) suffered from acute abdominal pain. 8 of these patients had massive bleeding while the other 11 patients had perforations. Another study in 2017 also showed that 11.2% patients (N = 588) with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding were identified in patients with intestinal BD. Therefore, it was necessary to prompt timely treatment of intestinal BD to prevent severe complications and to achieve favorable prognosis.

In the field of rheumatology, the EULAR recommendations for the management of BD in 2008 and the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of BD published by the Rheumatology Society of Chinese Medical Association (RSCMA) in 2011 put forward the treatment principles in detail. The aim of BD treatment is to control symptoms and prevent irreversible organ damage. In addition, multisystem involvement mandates collaboration between different specialties. In the field of gastroenterology, Japanese gastroenterologists used to have extensively studied intestinal BD. The Japanese consensus statement for the diagnosis and management of intestinal BD was established and updated in 2007 and 2014, which paid more attention to the treatment goals than to the treatment principles. The EDGs for intestinal BD published by the JSBD in 2020 and Chinese consensus on intestinal BD published by the IEGCMA in 2022 also focused on the treatment goals.

### Efficacy and predictor of anti-TNF α agents in patients with intestinal Behçet's disease [^114fda4b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Notably, anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNFα) agents are now expected to be promising treatment options, with accumulating evidence revealing the therapeutic efficacy of anti-TNFα agents such as infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA). IFX therapy has shown a complete response rate of 61% at 54 weeks post-induction, while that of ADA was 60% at 52 weeks post-induction. In Japan, IFX and ADA have recently been approved for treating patients with intestinal BD exhibiting severe disease or resistance to existing treatment. Accordingly, anti-TNFα agents are expected to gain momentum in the management of intestinal BD. However, data regarding the long-term outcomes of anti-TNFα therapy remain scarce.

In the present study, we retrospectively evaluated continuation rate of anti-TNFα in intestinal BD and factors predictive of sustained response.

Effective markers: How should we pick up effective treatment targets?

According to the characteristics of the above evaluable marker and relevant research, the EDGs for intestinal BD by the JSBD in 2020 and the RSCMA guidelines for BD in 2021 updated the treatment targets that clinical remission and the normalization of CRP are the initial targets, and MH was recommended as a further target, which was supported by the Chinese consensus on intestinal BD published by the IEGCMA in 2022. TH and HH, which indicated deeper remission, were not included in the guidelines as treatment targets due to a lack of relevant research in intestinal BD. We speculate that TH may be more promising in the further study of intestinal BD than HH, considering that intestinal BD is more similar to CD in its clinical symptoms, imaging findings and endoscopic characteristics than UC. It is worth noting that some studies in IBD revealed that the combination of evaluable markers (e.g. CRP and FC, CDAI and FC) may be promising treatment targets according to the effectiveness of disease-activity evaluation. This new idea is worthy of reference for intestinal BD. In clinical practice, some patients with vasculitis, such as BD, may suffer from irreversible damage to the involved organs and blood vessels, such as coronary artery stenosis and ischemia, pulmonary hypertension, renal insufficiency and so on, while inflammation is well controlled. Moreover, it is well known that ischemia of blood-supply mesenteric vessels is the cause of ischemic bowel disease and one of the causes of refractory duodenal ulcer. Therefore, we suggest that future studies should focus on whether the definition of MH in intestinal BD needs to be adjusted or modified.

### Management of Behçet's syndrome [^115BHFCN]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is agreement that the management of Behçet's syndrome has recently improved, especially with the wider use of biologics. The aim of this review is to summarize the current management strategies in Behçet's syndrome.

Recent Findings

There is growing experience with tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists in the management of eye gastrointestinal and nervous disease in Behçet's syndrome. Interferon-alpha at lower doses may increase its tolerability. Other biologics such as interleukin 1-blocking agents and tocilizumab were used in a small number of patients and also seem to be effective.

Summary

Although experiences with biologics have expanded and looks promising, this is mostly observational or retrospective. There still is a lack of controlled trials with these agents, especially in patients with major organ involvement.

Introduction

Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic recurrent systemic vasculitis involving large, medium and small vessels as well as arteries and veins. It was first reported in 1937 by Hulusi Behcet, a Turkish dermatologist. This disease has a high prevalence along the Silk Road, including Japan, Korea, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean region. The most widely accepted criteria include the criteria published by the International Study Group for BD in 1990 and The International Criteria for Behcet's Disease developed from the collaboration of experts from 27 nations. The sensitivity and specificity of the former are 85 and 96%, respectively, while the latter are 94.8 and 90.5%, respectively. BD can involve multiple organs, including skin, mucosa, eyes, cardiovascular system, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, joints, lungs, kidneys, etc. Patients with involvement of important organs usually have poor outcomes.

Gastrointestinal involvement of BD is termed as intestinal Behcet's disease (intestinal BD). It may cause serious complications including perforation, obstruction, fistula formation and gastrointestinal bleeding in some cases, showing high rates of disability and mortality. The prevalence of gastrointestinal involvement in BD is about 3–60% and it shows regional differences, with approximately 2.8–4.0% in Turkey, India and Saudi Arabia, 10% in China, 38–53% in Japan and 50–60% in the UK. It is noteworthy that intestinal BD can present with or without other organ involvement, with volcano-shaped ulcers in ileocecal area as the typical finding. Up to now, the diagnosis of intestinal BD mainly depends on clinical manifestations without specific laboratory index. And in a few cases, it is hard to differentiate intestinal BD from other inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease (CD), intestinal tuberculosis. Japanese and Korean guidelines for intestinal BD have proposed algorithms for definite diagnosis. Recently, our team also summarized the key points of differential diagnosis among intestinal BD, CD and intestinal tuberculosis in a review about clinical characteristics, diagnosis and evaluation of intestinal BD.

Updated treatment methods and treatment principles

The appropriate adoption of medical therapy was of great importance in intestinal BD as well as proper intervention with surgical management. Conventional medications included 5-aminosalicylic acids, corticosteroids, immunomodulators such as azathioprine, thalidomide, which were capable of inducing and maintaining remission without the need for surgery in some patients. These drugs acted as key components of the standard therapy for intestinal BD according to the Japanese consensus of intestinal BD published in 2007. However, some patients with intestinal BD were refractory to conventional treatment. Park et al. performed a study regarding clinical outcomes after corticosteroid use in patients with moderate-to-severe intestinal BD. A total of 54 patients were enrolled and 46.3% of whom achieved complete remission after 1 month of treatment and 48.1% remained responsive to therapy after 1 year of treatment. Yet it was worth noting that 35.2% of these patients developed corticosteroid dependency and 7.4% received surgery after 1 year. The adoption of biological agents such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents in intestinal BD allowed for effective treatment of these corticosteroid-dependent and other complicated cases. Kinoshita et al. reported that 15 Japanese patients with refractory intestinal BD who showed poor response to corticosteroid and conventional immunosuppressive agents received therapy of an anti-TNF agent (infliximab) at a single center and exhibited significant clinical response with 80% patients at 10 weeks, 64.0% at 12 months, and 50.0% at 24 months. Furthermore, in 2013 Lee et al. conducted a Korean multicenter retrospective study of 28 patients with intestinal BD who received infliximab therapy. They showed that patients at 2, 4, 30, and 54 weeks after treatment presented a clinical response rate of 75.0, 64.3, 50, and 39.1%, and a clinical remission rate of 32.1, 28.6, 46.2, and 39.1%, respectively. It was suggested that infliximab was a well-tolerated and effective therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe intestinal BD.

Methods

Case series

Cases selection

A retrospective single-center case series was performed to indicate the efficacy of anti-TNF-α agents in intestinal BD at our institution. The information about patients with intestinal BD were screened from 1st January 2011 to 1st October 2021. Patients who received anti-TNF-α treatments were included and their electronic medical records were collected. These patients were mainly diagnosed according to the Japanese Behçet's Disease Research Committee criteria and the discussions in multidisciplinary teams.

Data collection

We extracted data on the following clinical characteristics: sex, age, disease duration, clinical manifestations, biochemical and endoscopic examination findings, coinstantaneous medical treatments, and treatment history. The activity of BD was evaluated by Disease Activity Index for intestinal Behcet's Disease (DAIBD), and this points-scoring system assesses general well-being, fever status, extraintestinal and intestinal manifestations. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by the degree of improvement in clinical and endoscopic manifestations.

Meta-analysis

Search strategy

This meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the 'Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses' (PRISRM) guidelines. It has been registered on PROSPERO, the ID is CRD42022329211. We systematically searched published literatures in the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. All databases were screened from inception to July 2021. The following free-text words and subject terms were included in our search strategies: 'Behcet's Syndrome', 'Biologics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Antagonist', 'Infliximab', 'Adalimumab', 'Etanercept', 'Tocilizumab', 'Golimumab', 'Canakinumab', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', and 'Vedolizumab'. Furthermore, the reference lists of the selected articles were manually screened to avoid missing any qualified studies. (The search strategy for the PubMed database is provided in the.)

Therapy

Both BD and CD are multisystem, inflammatory conditions, and steroids with immunomodulatory agents are first-line therapies. The management of patients with BD is based on the presence of organ involvement and disease severity. Colchicine is widely used as first-line treatment for BD (muco-cutaneous and musculoskeletal findings). When colchicine is inadequate and ocular, vascular, neurological, or intestinal involvement is present, steroids and azathioprine can be indicated. A small number of unresponsive patients may require mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide especially in cases of vascular and neurological involvement. No randomized prospective studies are present on the treatment of intestinal BD, which is very similar to CD. There is controversy regarding the therapeutic effects of 5-amino-salicylates (5-ASA)/sulfasalazine, which have routinely been employed in patients with IBD. 5-ASA should only be used to treat intestinal BD if clinical and endoscopic activity are mild. Systemic corticosteroids (CSs) are often useful as first-line therapy either in the acute phase of intestinal BD or in patients with moderate to severe disease when treatment with 5-ASA/sulfasalazine fails. An initial dose of 0.5–1 mg/kg prednisolone and rapid tapering strategies are prevalent, similar to IBD treatment. A retrospective cohort study in 54 patients with active intestinal BD treated with CSs therapy, showed complete remission in 46.3%, partial remission in 42.6%, and, in 11.1%, no response after a month from treatment. After one year, 35.2% of patients showed corticosteroid dependency. Although CSs are the main treatment for intestinal BD, many patients become CS-resistant or CS-dependent. Thiopurines or azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine (AZA/6-MP) (2.0–2.5 mg/kg/day) are indicated in patients with steroid dependency or resistance. Jung et al. reported cumulative relapse rates of 5.8, 28.7, 43.7, and 51.7% at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years after remission among patients with intestinal BD who received AZA/6-MP. Thalidomide (2 mg/kg/day) has been demonstrated as capable of achieving symptom control and replacing steroid therapy in patients with intestinal BD. Monoclonal antibodies to tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), including infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA), are biological agents for treating IBD, and are beneficial in patients who are unresponsive to conventional therapies. There are few randomized trials on the use of anti-TNF-α agents in patients with intestinal BD. The first patient with BD treated with infliximab was reported in 2001. A Korean retrospective multicenter study showed 28 cases of patients with intestinal BD refractory to conventional medical treatment and treated with IFX, with a clinical response rate of 64.8% at 4 weeks. Maintenance infliximab treatment has shown to be more beneficial than short-term treatment for maintaining remission in patients with intestinal BD. Intestinal BD has also been successfully treated with adalimumab, a fully humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to TNF-α. The Japanese group in a consensus statement of anti-TNF-α therapy in patients with intestinal BD proposed its indication as a standard therapy for intestinal BD. Recently, adalimumab has successfully been used as a first-line anti-TNF-α agent in patients with steroid-dependent intestinal BD to induce and maintain complete remission. Although there is proven efficacy of anti-TNF-α agents in intestinal BD, further randomized, prospective trials are necessary to confirm these findings. Cantarini et al. has reported efficacy of a novel class of therapies directed against specific cytokines implicated in the disease, as Anakinra. It is an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist with effectiveness in BD with bowel involvement amd resistant to others immunomodulatory agents (anti-TNF-α). Management options for CD include nutritional therapy, drug therapy, and, in severe or chronic active disease, surgery. The aims of CD treatment are to reduce symptoms and maintain or improve quality of life. Steroids are the first-line therapy for CD. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) recommend budesonide 9 mg daily to induce remission in mildly active, localized ileocecal CD with 50–60% remission at 8 weeks of therapy. Although it is less efficacious to conventional steroids, especially in the case of severe disease, it has fewer side effects. Moya et al. in a detailed meta-analysis, showed that mesalazine (4 g/day) has a very marginal benefit confirming that budesonide is the best option in mild disease, and found no clear evidence for mesalazine being better than placebo at any dose. Exclusive enteral nutrition therapy is regarded as appropriate only for adjunctive treatment to support nutrition and not for primary therapy, while it is recommended as first line therapy to induce remission in children with active luminal CD. According to ECCO guidelines, moderately active localized ileocaecal CD should be treated with budesonide, or systemic corticosteroids. In the case of steroid-refractory or intolerance, an anti-TNFα based strategy should be used both in adult and pediatric population. In conclusion, medical and surgical therapies are similar in BD and CD but the biological therapy seems to be more efficacious in CD than BD.

### Anti-TNF-α agents for refractory intestinal Behçet's disease: case series and meta-analysis [^113Gre3w]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

According to this retrospective case series and meta-analysis, anti-TNF-α treatment is effective for clinical symptom remission and intestinal ulcer healing in intestinal BD. Data from our own institution and the results of the meta-analysis indicated that anti-TNF-α agents could alleviate the disease in approximately 70% of the patients who were refractory to conventional treatments. Furthermore, IFX exerted its effect on the clinical symptoms remission within a short period of time, while ADA worked at a slower rate. They took effects comparably in terms of intestinal mucosal ulcer alleviation. In addition, anti-TNF-α treatment was safe with few adverse side effects. In conclusion, anti-TNF-α agents could be another choice for patients with refractory intestinal BD to improve their prognosis. However, future studies should be conducted to investigate the roles of other biologics, especially their efficacy in the first-line treatment of intestinal BD.

### Anti-TNF-α agents for refractory intestinal Behçet's disease: case series and meta-analysis [^112Qr7N6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our findings indicated that anti-TNF-α agents could effectively mitigate clinical symptoms in nearly 70% of the included patients, and the therapeutic efficacy could be sustained over a long period of time. Furthermore, anti-TNF-α agents also contributed to intestinal ulcer improvement, and almost 60% of the patients achieved complete mucosal healing during the long-term period. Further subtype analyses showed IFX exerted its effect within a short period of time, but ADA seemed to work at a slower rate and was likely to be less effective in the clinical symptom improvement during induction and early term periods. In terms of intestinal mucosal ulcer alleviation, ADA and IFX took effects comparably in every therapeutic period. Satisfactorily, only mild adverse events were reported in all included studies. As a whole, the results of our study with larger sample size were more credible than the previous single-arm studies.

### Efficacy and predictor of anti-TNF α agents in patients with intestinal Behçet's disease [^112m4WQa]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Behçet's disease (BD) is a recurrent multisystem inflammatory disease. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α agents have been used to treat patients with intestinal BD with severe disease activity or those who are resistant to conventional treatments; however, the long-term efficacy of anti-TNFα agents in intestinal BD remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the clinical outcomes and predictors of discontinuation of anti-TNFα agents in patients with intestinal BD.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of patients with intestinal BD who received first-line anti-TNFα agents between January 2009 and June 2020. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who continued anti-TNFα therapy for 48 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of patients who achieved marked improvement, complete remission, and mucosal healing, as well as predictors of discontinuation of anti-TNFα agents.

Results

A total of 29 patients were included in the study. Twenty-two (75.9%) patients continued anti-TNFα therapy for 48 weeks. The percentage of patients who achieved marked improvement, complete remission, and mucosal healing at week 48 was 48.3%, 37.9%, and 48.3%, respectively. At week 96, 11 (37.9%) patients achieved marked improvement, complete remission, and mucosal healing. A higher C-reactive protein level (CRP; ≥ 1 mg/dL) at baseline was a predictor of discontinuation of anti-TNFα agents.

Conclusions

The 48-week continuation rate of anti-TNFα agents was 75.9% in bio-naïve patients with intestinal BD. However, a higher baseline CRP level (≥ 1 mg/dL) was associated with discontinuation of anti-TNFα agents.

In the current study, we present guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of the mucocutaneous lesions of Behçet's disease, which is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the involvement of various organs, including mucocutaneous, ocular, vascular, intestinal and central nervous system lesions. It is often identified in the Middle East Mediterranean to East Asia region. Skin manifestations include erythema nodosum, papulopustular lesions and thrombophlebitis, and mucosal manifestations include oral and genital ulcers. These mucocutaneous lesions are characteristically the first signs of Behçet's disease and are important to be recognized for the early diagnosis of the disease. Moreover, these manifestations also recur and persist over the long-term course of the disease. The management of mucocutaneous lesions is important to prevent recurrence. We developed consensus guidelines that provide recommendations for general practitioners and dermatologists and physicians on the management of the mucocutaneous lesions of Behçet's disease.

### Intestinal Behçet and Crohn's disease: two sides of the same coin [^114ufHy5]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Behçet's disease (BD) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic immune-mediated, inflammatory disorders affecting many different systems (joints, skin, eyes, gastrointestinal and biliary tracts). Both disorders have fluctuating courses and when gastrointestinal symptoms are prevalent, differential diagnosis can be difficult. BD involves the gastrointestinal tract in 10–15% of cases with localized lesions in the ileocecal region. The clinical picture is heterogeneous with various clusters of disease expression. CD is a chronic inflammatory disorder, which can affect any part of the intestinal tract, as well as extra-intestinal tissue. Factors that contribute towards the pathogenesis of both disease include the host's genetic profile, and immune system, and environmental factors such as the gut microbiota. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a narrative review of clinical features of BD and CD, highlighting the importance of differential diagnosis and therapeutic approach, especially in the presence of gastrointestinal involvement. A comprehensive search of published literature using the Pubmed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) database was carried out to identify all articles published in English from 1999 to October 2016, using 4 key terms: "Behçet Disease", "Intestinal Behçet's Disease", "Crohn's Disease" and" Inflammatory Bowel Disease".

### Gastrointestinal manifestations of Behçet's disease: advances in evaluation and management [^115kudC3]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Behçet's disease is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory disorder characterized by orogenital ulcers and skin lesions; serious manifestations also include ocular, large vessel, gastrointestinal and neurological involvement. Genetic and unknown environmental factors customise the wide clinical expression of the disease. Gastrointestinal involvement is not unusual, albeit with a highly variable frequency among different ethnic populations. However, given the fact that gastrointestinal symptoms such as reflux, bleeding, diarrhoea are common in the general population, their clinical significance needs to be carefully interpreted. Apart from mouth the ileocecal area is typically involved, but inflammatory and/or vasculitic lesions may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Complications such as perforation carry high morbidity rates and even mortality. Herein, we review all available information pertinent to gastrointestinal involvement of Behçet's disease and discuss the published advances in evaluation and its empirical management, including anti-TNF biologic therapies.

### Gastrointestinal involvement in Behçet disease [^116mmaJx]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Behçet disease (BD) is a variable vessel vasculitis that can involve several organs and systems. Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement has an acute exacerbating course with ulcers, most commonly in the ileocolonic area. These ulcers can be large and deep, causing perforation and massive bleeding. This article highlights the current knowledge on the epidemiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, and management of GI involvement of BD, with emphasis on recent findings.

### Anti-TNF-α agents for refractory intestinal Behçet's disease: case series and meta-analysis [^117NjPZe]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

This study had some limitations. First, almost all included articles were single-arm studies, and most patients received anti-TNF-α treatment after they received conventional treatments. Thus, direct comparisons could not be made between the anti-TNF-α agents and other conventional medicines. Second, the sample sizes for ADA and IFX in the subgroup analyses were highly diverse. The efficacy of ADA was evaluated in a larger population, while that of IFX was evaluated in a smaller population. Therefore, the overall efficacy of IFX is prone to be affected by the extremely abnormal results of the included studies. Third, studies from different countries adopted multiple criteria to evaluate the disease severity, and the timing of therapeutic efficacy evaluation varied widely across the included studies. This could potentially be a source of significant bias.

A series of measures were taken to moderate the influence of these limitations. We set strict inclusion criteria; only patients diagnosed with intestinal BD according to the criteria definitively were included in this study. Moreover, our analyses only incorporated studies that clearly reported the efficacy evaluation times, then we integrated the heterogeneous estimation time into broad treatment periods according to the medicine administration regimen (Table 2).

This study indicated the effectiveness of anti-TNF-α agents for intestinal BD. To better understand the efficacy of biologics for intestinal BD, more studies about the first-line efficacy of other biologics in addition to anti-TNF-α are necessary, especially their comparison with conventional treatments.

### Surgical treatment and outcomes in patients with intestinal Behçet disease: long-term experience of a single large-volume center [^1171rK82]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies have examined the surgical treatment of intestinal Behçet disease. Consequently, there is currently no standard surgical treatment for intestinal Behçet disease. Instead, treatment is empirical and symptom based.

Objective

Our aim was to evaluate the clinical course after surgery and determine the appropriate surgical options for intestinal Behçet disease.

Design

Medical charts of patients who underwent surgery for intestinal Behçet were retrospectively reviewed.

Settings

The study was conducted at a tertiary referral center.

Patients

Ninety-one patients who underwent surgical treatment for intestinal Behçet disease between January 1995 and December 2012 were included in this study.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcomes measured were patient demographics, clinical characteristics, operative and postoperative outcomes, and long-term follow-up data.

Results

Surgical treatment was mainly in response to intractability to medical treatment (56.0%), and 19.8% of patients underwent an emergency operation. Surgery was performed laparoscopically in 33.0% of the patients. Most patients received an ileocecectomy (39.6%) or a right hemicolectomy (34.1%). Twenty-eight patients (30.8%) experienced postoperative morbidities, and 8 patients (8.8%) required reoperations. There were 3 deaths. Reoperation was required for recurrent disease in 32 patients during the long-term follow-up, and the 5-year cumulative reoperation rate was 31.2% (95% CI, 20.4%-42.0%). Among those requiring a second operation, 53.1% were segmental colonic resections that included the previous anastomosis. From multivariable Cox regression analysis, independent predictors of surgical recurrence included postoperative use of steroids (HR = 2.85 (95% CI, 1.21–6.75); p = 0.02), postoperative complications (HR = 2.42 (95% CI, 1.12–5.22); p = 0.03), and BMI (HR per 1-kg/m increase in BMI = 0.90 (95% CI, 0.82–0.99); p = 0.04).

Limitations

This study was designed retrospectively and had a small sample size.

Conclusions

Patients treated surgically for intestinal Behçet disease frequently have postoperative complications and the need for a stoma and have a high risk of recurrence.

### Intestinal Behçet and Crohn's disease: two sides of the same coin [^115rPS8Z]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Intestinal BD and CD are inflammatory diseases with similar multisystem involvement and various extra-intestinal signs and symptoms. Intestinal BD shares clinical courses, endoscopic and histologic features with IBD, particularly CD. It may be extremely difficult to distinguish intestinal BD from IBD due to similarities in intestinal and extra-intestinal manifestations, and pathologic findings. Differential diagnosis between intestinal BD and CD remains a challenge for clinicians, and both conditions have significant clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic overlaps.

### Efficacy and predictor of anti-TNF α agents in patients with intestinal Behçet's disease [^114FdwEL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

It has been shown that trough levels of anti-TNFα agents reflect the efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis and in CD. Our results indicate that it is important to maintain a trough level of anti-TNFα agents for continued long-term anti-TNFα therapy. CRP levels before treatment are positively associated with TNFα levels; therefore, higher doses of anti-TNFα agents are needed to control disease activity in patients with high CRP levels at baseline. Moreover, baseline CRP levels can be correlated with the continuation of anti-TNFα agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and with a colectomy-free rate in patients with ulcerative colitis in the active phase; for continued long-term maintenance therapy with anti-TNFα, we may need to maintain a high trough level of anti-TNFα agents by employing corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents in patients with high CRP levels at baseline, higher dosages of anti-TNFα agents, or shorter dosing intervals in patients with escalated activity during anti-TNFα therapy.

Our study had several limitations. First, this was a single-center study, and the sample size was relatively small. Moreover, our study had a retrospective design. Finally, the disease severity evaluated using endoscopic findings before treatment was not included. However, we believe that our data will provide useful insights when clinicians encounter patients with severe intestinal BD.

### The treatment principles and targets for intestinal behcet's disease [^115s5AxZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Endoscopy

Endoscopic evaluation of intestinal BD mainly includes gastroscopy, colonoscopy, enteroscopy and capsule endoscopy. According to the guidelines established by the IBD Study Group of the Korean Association of the Study of Intestinal Diseases, the typical ulcerations of intestinal BD were described as few in number (≤ 5), large, discrete, and round or oval-shaped ulcerations in the ileocecal area (Figure 1(a)). The other types of ulcers include small aphthous ulcerations to multiple irregularly shaped ulcerations and are defined as atypical ulcerations. A multivariate regression analysis of 167 intestinal BD patients conducted by Lee et al. revealed that the number of intestinal ulcers (⩾2, p = 0.031) and volcano-shaped ulcers (p = 0.001) were predictive factors for severe DAIBD scores and disease activity. Mucosal healing (MH) has been one of the main therapeutic targets stipulated by recent authoritative recommendations and guidelines in IBD and is associated with better long-term outcomes. The definition of MH currently lacks consensus. A Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 or an SES-CD (simple endoscopic score for CD) less than 3 is recognized by most experts as an acceptable measure of MH and has been widely used in UC and CD. With a deep understanding of intestinal BD, recent studies suggest that MH is a potential predictive factor for the long-term prognosis of intestinal BD (Figure 1(b)). A meta-analysis by Wu et al. in 2020 revealed that MH is associated with a decreased risk of disease recurrence (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.30–0.57) and surgery (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.17–0.63) in intestinal BD. However, in clinical practice, there are contraindications for endoscopic examination of some patients, as it is invasive. To date, there are no surrogate noninvasive markers of endoscopy.

### Anti-TNF-α agents for refractory intestinal Behçet's disease: case series and meta-analysis [^111bK6jZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Nine studies including 328 patients evaluated long-term maintenance therapy. The clinical-symptom-remission rate in this period was 73.7%, and 58.7% of these patients received complete resolution. The remission rates in patients who received IFX and ADA were 72.9 and 80.6%, respectively. Moreover, 65.6% of the IFX-treated patients and 58.2% of the ADA-treated patients achieved complete symptomatic remission (Figure 2(d)). Besides, the therapeutic effect over 100 weeks was also evaluated in 212 patients; 77.8 and 65.4% of the patients achieved remission and complete alleviation of the symptoms, respectively. Especially, the complete remission rate was 86.1% among 20 patients with IFX treatment, but the corresponding rate in patients receiving ADA was 43.7% (Figure 2(e)).

### Management of Behçet's syndrome [^111cDQhq]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Current trends in the management of Behçet's syndrome will be reviewed in this article.

Recent Findings

Biologic agents have gained increasing importance over the years in the management of Behçet's syndrome. Long-term results of observational studies have shown that anti-tumor necrosis factor agents may be effective in Behçet's syndrome patients with refractory eye involvement. Case series reporting about use of anti-tumor necrosis factor agents in vascular and gastrointestinal involvement have also shown good results. Caution is required for infectious complications with these agents. Apremilast is an immunomodulatory agent that works through phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition. A randomized controlled trial has shown that it is effective for the management of oral and genital ulcers and is generally well tolerated.

Summary

The outcome of Behçet's syndrome with major organ involvement has improved with more effective management strategies, especially with the use of biologic agents in severe cases. Controlled trials are needed to guide physicians in making treatment decisions.

### Efficacy of infliximab in intestinal Behçet's disease: a Korean multicenter retrospective study [^1162G4JA]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although infliximab is widely accepted as a therapeutic option for inflammatory bowel disease, its therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of intestinal Behçet's disease (BD) is unknown. We investigated the short-term and long-term response rates to infliximab in intestinal BD and predictive factors of sustained treatment response following infliximab treatment.

Methods

This study was conducted using a retrospective noncontrolled review of medical records from 8 tertiary hospitals in Korea. We collected clinical, demographic, and laboratory data for patients with 28 patients with intestinal BD who received at least 1 dose of infliximab. Response rates of infliximab at 2, 4, 30, and 54 weeks for each patient and factors predictive of sustained response were investigated. Adverse events were also identified.

Results

The median duration of follow-up after initial infliximab infusion was of 29.5 months. The clinical response rates at 2, 4, 30, and 54 weeks were 75%, 64.3%, 50%, and 39.1%, respectively, with clinical remission rates of 32.1%, 28.6%, 46.2%, and 39.1%, respectively. After multivariate analysis, older age at diagnosis (≥ 40 yr), female sex, a longer disease duration (≥ 5 yr), concomitant immunomodulator use, and achievement of remission at week 4 were found to be predictive factors of sustained response. There was 1 serious infection but no malignancies or deaths in this study.

Conclusions

Infliximab was a well-tolerated and effective therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe intestinal BD. Moreover, we found 5 predictive factors associated with sustained response, which might assist in optimal patient selection for infliximab treatment.

### Real-world efficacy of adalimumab and infliximab for refractory intestinal Behçet's disease [^114hFg9v]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents are important for managing refractory intestinal Behçet's disease. Few studies have reported the efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibodies for intestinal Behçet's disease due to its rarity.

Aims

The aim was to examine the efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α antibodies for intestinal Behçet's disease in real-world practice.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of medical records at 4 hospitals in Japan. Global gastrointestinal symptom and endoscopic assessment scores were analyzed in intestinal Behçet's disease patients given anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents at 3 and 12 months after the start of therapy.

Results

Of 53 intestinal Behçet's disease patients, 22 received anti-tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibody treatment. At the first line, 14 were given adalimumab, and 8 were given infliximab. After 3 and 12 months of treatment, 7 and 11 patients showed complete response of gastrointestinal symptom scores, respectively, and 5 and 9 showed complete remission of the endoscopic assessment score, respectively. Three patients switched anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents.

Conclusion

Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibodies are effective for refractory intestinal Behçet's disease in real-world situations. Switching anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents may be useful for failure of first-line anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy in some refractory cases.

### Intestinal Behçet and Crohn's disease: two sides of the same coin [^112Jnkic]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Behçet's disease (BD) was first described by the Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Behçet in 1937 as a syndrome with oral and genital ulcerations and ocular inflammation. It is a rare multi-systemic inflammatory disease with unknown etiology and a chronic recurrent pattern, characterized by recurrent oral and genital aphthous/ulcers with muco-cutaneous, ocular, articular, vascular, and/or gastrointestinal lesions. BD is included both in vasculitis, affecting vessels of all kinds and sizes, and auto-inflammatory disease classifications. Crohn's disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. It often includes both intestinal (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting) and extra-intestinal symptoms (fever, weight loss, anaemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye). When the gastrointestinal tract is involved, a differential diagnosis between BD and CD is very difficult. There are no pathognomonic laboratory tests or endoscopic findings of intestinal BD, although few, large and deep ulcerations with discrete borders are described as a characteristic endoscopic pattern. Recently, novel diagnostic criteria and a disease activity index have been proposed in the diagnosis of intestinal BD. Treatment for intestinal BD is similar to CD, such as steroids, immunomodulators and biologic agents (anti-tumour necrosis factor α antibody). The goal of this review is to describe these clinical conditions with similarities and differences from clinical, therapeutic and surgical points of view.

### New approaches in the treatment of adamantiades-behçet's disease [^112Yh7ST]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To update clinicians on the recent advances in the treatment of Adamantiades-Behçet's disease.

Recent Findings

Interferon-alpha-2a and infliximab have proved able to induce prompt remission in the vast majority of Adamantiades-Behçet's patients with DMARD-resistant uveoretinitis. Efficacy of interferon-alpha-2a has also been reported for mucocutaneous lesions, arthritis, and (more anecdotally) for neuro-Behçet, while results from small case series suggest that infliximab is beneficial for mucocutaneous lesions and (more anecdotally) for arthritis and gastro-intestinal manifestations. Two cases of neuro-Behçet treated with infliximab showed a complete resolution. Finally, in a randomized controlled trial of patients with mucocutaneous, arthritic manifestations, or both, etanercept effectively suppressed mucocutaneous lesions. A different approach is tolerization by oral administration of the 336–351 peptide of the human heat shock protein 60 (thought to have a pathogenic role in Adamantiades-Behçet's disease-associated uveitis), linked to recombinant cholera B-toxin B-subunit. Preliminary results have shown that tolerization is safe and effective in preventing relapses of uveitis.

Summary

Biologic agents have proved effective in patients resistant to conventional treatment. However, disease subsets characterized by severe morbidity and mortality such as vasculo-Behçet and neuro-Behçet still pose major therapeutic challenges. Further studies are needed to devise better treatment strategies for severe Adamantiades-Behçet's disease.

### Management of severe complications in Behçet's disease with TNF inhibitors [^114tn3qL]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy of anti-TNFα agents has been recently evaluated in many studies in Behçet's disease (BD), particularly in ocular and life-threatening manifestations such as neurological and vascular disease. Areas covered: The following article aims to summarize the currently available efficacy and safety data of anti-TNFα agents in BD. Expert opinion: Most studies have shown dramatic and rapid efficacy with anti-TNFα agents on the main BD-associated issues including posterior uveitis, gastro-intestinal and neurological complications as well as major vessel disease. Experts in the field do recommend the use of anti-TNF agents (either infliximab or adalimumab) as a first-line therapy in severe posterior uveitis in BD and now use anti-TNFα treatment in BD-associated life threatening manifestations. However, data is mainly based on retrospective cohorts or open-label prospective studies. Controlled studies (versus conventional immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide) are warranted to properly evaluate their efficacy as first line therapeutic in life-threatening manifestations of BD.

### Combination therapy of infliximab and thalidomide for refractory entero-behcet's disease: a case report [^115KBdeX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

After the treatment, his symptoms and intestinal lesions improved without adverse effects. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a treatment regime using the combination therapy of infliximab and thalidomide. The good response of the patient to this combination therapy is likely a result of a complete TNF-α blockade by the two agents. Although our report describes only one case, the improvement in symptoms of the patient supports evidence that increased levels of TNF-α play a critical role in the inflammatory process associated with BD. In view of limitations of the present treatment for intestinal BD, combination therapy with infliximab and thalidomide appears to be an effective approach for the treatment of entero-BD and perhaps other manifestations of BD.

### A contemporary review of behcet's syndrome [^113NBhfc]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Behcet's syndrome (BS) is a chronic systemic inflammatory vasculitis with a wide range of clinical manifestations including recurrent oral and genital ulcers; cutaneous lesions; and ophthalmic, neurologic, and gastrointestinal involvement. BS has a global distribution but is particularly prevalent in so-called Silk Road populations. Disease onset is usually around the third or fourth decade of life, and the sex ratio is roughly 1:1. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the etiology of BS, although the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. At present, there is no laboratory examination with diagnostic value for BS; therefore, a diagnosis is made based on clinical manifestations. The International Study Group diagnostic criteria published in 1990 is the most widely used and recognized, but in order to improve sensitivity, the International Criteria for Behcet's Disease is developed in 2014. Evaluating disease activity in BS is an important basis for treatment selection and monitoring, the simplified Behcet's Disease Current Activity Form (2006 version) is a well-established scoring method. Given that multiple organs are affected in BS, it must be differentiated from other diseases with similar manifestations or that may be induced by drug treatment. The goal of BS treatment is to eradicate triggers and/or aggravating factors, alleviate and control clinical symptoms, prevent and treat any damage to organs, slow disease progression, and improve the patient's quality of life. The clinical management of BS depends on the affected organs and disease severity. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge of BS pathogenesis and therapeutic options.

### Efficacy and predictor of anti-TNF α agents in patients with intestinal Behçet's disease [^116CHXdT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

Among 51 patients with intestinal BD, we reviewed the medical records of all patients who received first-line anti-TNFα agents at Kobe University Hospital from January 2009 to June 2020. The diagnosis of intestinal BD was based on the Japanese diagnostic criteria for intestinal BD. We excluded patients with any evidence of other gastrointestinal diseases, such as Crohn's disease (CD), intestinal tuberculosis, or ischemic colitis, during the follow-up period.

Drug administration

IFX or ADA was administered according to the standard Japanese administration protocol. IFX (5 mg/kg) was intravenously administered at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and then every 8 weeks. ADA was subcutaneously administered at 160 mg at week 0, followed by 80 mg at week 2, followed by 40 mg every other week. Concomitant therapies, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, are permitted at stable dosages during anti-TNFα therapy. Upon observation of clinical improvement, corticosteroids were gradually reduced and discontinued.

Fig. 1
The composite disease activity index for global GI symptom and endoscopic assessment scores. A combination of scores is used to characterize disease activity after medical treatment

Global drug responses were assessed by dividing the observed responses into four categories: no change/aggravated, improvement, marked improvement (MI), and complete remission (CR), using the composite disease activity index at the indicated time points, consisting of global GI symptom scores and endoscopic assessments. MI was defined as a global GI symptom score and endoscopic assessment score of ≤ 1, while CR was defined as a global GI symptom score and an endoscopic score of 0. In addition to the global drug response, mucosal healing (MH) was defined separately when the endoscopic score was 0.

Primary and secondary endpoints of our study

In the present study, the primary outcome was the continuation rate of anti-TNFα therapy at week 48. The secondary outcomes included the percentage of patients who achieved MI, CR, and MH at weeks 48 and 96, the predictors of discontinuation of anti-TNFα therapy, and all AEs through week 96.

Statistical analysis

All data are summarized and presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables. Categorical data are expressed as the number of patients plus the percentage. Comparisons of groups were performed using the Student's t-test for unpaired data in a two-group comparison. The Chi-square test with Fisher's correction was used to evaluate differences in categorical data, where needed. Statistical significance was set at a p value of ≤ 0.05. The Kaplan–Meier survival method was used to estimate the cumulative probability of continuing anti-TNFα therapy. Differences between curves were tested using the log-rank test. EZR software was used for the statistical analyses.

### Thalidomide for treatment of intestinal involvement of juvenile-onset Behçet disease [^114th5iv]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Thalidomide has been identified and its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties clarified. This report expands our report of 2 entero-Behçet disease children who developed significant steroid toxicity and improved dramatically with thalidomide.

Methods

We studied the effects of thalidomide in 7 juvenile-onset patients with severe, recurrent intestinal involvement of Behçet disease. Thalidomide was given at an initial dose of 2 mg/kg per day, and the dose was increased to 3 mg/kg per day if necessary (3 of 7 patients) or decreased to 1–0.5 mg/kg per day according to the responses to the drug.

Results

All 7 patients showed dramatic improvement in clinical symptoms with thalidomide therapy, and they successfully discontinued steroid therapy. Patients receiving thalidomide were monitored for prolonged neurotoxicity, and the treatment and a few side effects were well tolerated by all patients.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that thalidomide can be an efficacious medication in appropriately selected patients with some inflammatory bowel diseases with many chances of success.

### The treatment principles and targets for intestinal behcet's disease [^111cY25T]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Radiology

The radiologic evaluation of intestinal BD is mainly based on computed tomography enterography (CTE). On CTE, intestinal BD commonly manifests as geographic, relatively large, and deep penetrating ulcers with bowel wall thickening and mural hyperenhancement in the ileocecal region. Occasionally, intestinal BD manifests as a cecal mass or an aneurysmal dilatation of the terminal ileum masquerading as a malignant tumor. Patients with gastrointestinal complications such as intestinal perforation, fistula, stenosis and abscess may have corresponding imaging findings (Figure 2). Recently, magnetic resonance enterography and bowel ultrasonography have also been increasingly used in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic intestinal inflammatory disease. One study by Peker et al. revealed that a polypoid pattern and homogeneous mural enhancement were the findings seen more frequently in BD (p < 0.001) than in CD (p = 0.003). Another study by Ma et al. in 2021 showed that focal lesions (OR 0.16, 95% CI: 0.04–0.56) and large ulcers (OR 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01–0.55) were independent predictors of intestinal BD over CD in bowel ultrasonography. Transmural healing (TH) refers to healing of the full-thickness bowel wall under radiology. At present, there is no internationally recognized definition, and most studies use bowel wall thickness (usually 3 mm or less as the critical value) for evaluation. There were more significant research results for TH in CD than in UC: ① A study of 218 CD patients who completed a 2-year treatment course with anti-TNF-α agents showed that TH was associated with longer intervals until clinical relapse (HR 0.87, p = 0.01), hospitalization (HR 0.88, p = 0.002) and surgery (HR 0.94, p = 0.008) than MH.② There is controversy regarding the correlation between TH and MH in CD. In two studies of CD patients (N = 66 and N = 90), a good correlation was observed between MH and TH (k = 0.63, p < 0.001; k = 0.64, p < 0.001). Another study of CD patients (N = 214) revealed that TH and MH are associated with improved long-term outcomes in CD, but there was poor correlation between TH and MH.③ An update on the Selecting Therapeutic Targets in IBD (STRIDE-II) conducted by the International Organization for the Study of IBD in 2021 recommended that TH should be used as an adjunct to MH to represent a deeper level of healing in CD. We speculate that this may be related to the pathophysiological mechanism of CD as full-thickness inflammation.

### A case of refractory intestinal Behçet's disease treated with tocilizumab, a humanised anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody [^112JV2Un]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

We describe a young female patient who had refractory intestinal Behçet's disease that responded to tocilizumab, a humanised anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody. The patient had suffered from long disease activity courses and was treated with multiple medications, and the disease became refractory when immunosuppressants (e.g., thalidomide, sulfasalazine and azathioprine) were limited for poor remission, methylprednisolone pulse therapy, cyclophosphamide, and biological agents (e.g., adalimumab or infliximab) were restricted due to side effects after administration. Therefore, tocilizumab was considered as a therapeutic option and the symptoms resolved during 9 months of administration. Tocilizumab may be a good choice for intestinal Behçet's disease refractory to conventional treatment.

### Anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody therapy for gastrointestinal Behçet's disease: a case report [^114XJWDA]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Behçet's disease (BD) is a multisystem immune-mediated inflammatory disorder that involves the intestine in 3%-26% of cases. Corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid derivatives, immunomodulators, and more recently thalidomide and pentoxifylline have been used to treat BD with varying degrees of success. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is believed to play a pivotal role in this T helper cell type 1 (Th1)-mediated disease. Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF-alpha, has been demonstrated to be an effective therapy for Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, 2 other Th1-mediated disorders. We describe a patient with chronically active, steroid-dependent BD involving the gastrointestinal tract who received 4 doses of infliximab during a 6-month period. Because most of her symptoms were gastrointestinal, the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was used to assess response. A rapid and dramatic improvement in both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms was observed. The CDAI score decreased from 270 points (preinfusion) to 13 points by week 2, and remission was sustained despite complete withdrawal of steroids. Colonoscopy performed 10 weeks after the first infusion showed marked endoscopic and histologic improvement. This report suggests that infliximab may be an effective new therapy for gastrointestinal BD, and perhaps other manifestations of BD as well.

### Biotherapies in Behçet's disease [^116RGe7o]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic large-vessel vasculitis characterized by a wide clinical spectrum including recurrent oral and genital ulcerations, uveitis, vascular, neurological, articular, renal and gastrointestinal manifestations. Therapeutic management of BD depends on the clinical presentation and organ involved. Although colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and topical treatments with corticosteroids are often sufficient for mucocutaneous and joint involvements, more aggressive approach with immunosuppressive agents is warranted for severe manifestations such as posterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis, vascular, and neurological and gastrointestinal involvements. However, some patients still have refractory disease, relapse, sight threatening eye disease, or irreversible organ damage. Recent improvements in the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms have led to the identification of potential targets and future biological therapies for BD. In contrast to current non-specific immunosuppressive agents, the emergence of biotherapies provides the possibility of interfering with specific pathogenic pathways. Novel targeted biotherapies might be used in the future for BD.

### Management of behcet's syndrome [^111sKFfH]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Behcet's syndrome (BS) is a variable vessel vasculitis with heterogeneous clinical features. Skin, mucosa and joint involvement can cause impairment of quality of life but do not cause permanent damage whereas untreated eye, vascular, nervous system and gastrointestinal system involvement can cause serious damage and even death. Management of BS as a multidisciplinary team enables a faster and more accurate diagnosis and well-integrated treatment strategies. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy. Colchicine, AZA, ciclosporin-A, cyclophosphamide, IFN alpha, and tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors are other agents used as induction and/or maintenance therapy. Although biologic agents have been increasingly used, there are still unmet needs. Head-to-head comparison studies of some therapeutic options (e.g. TNF inhibitors vs IFN alpha in uveitis) are required. Novel therapeutic agents in the pipeline could change the standard of care for BS in the future.

### Early versus late surgery in patients with intestinal Behçet disease [^117TpB2a]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2012). Low credibility.

Background

To date, no studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential benefits of early surgery in patients with intestinal Behçet disease.

Objective

We investigated the long-term clinical outcomes in patients with intestinal Behçet disease first diagnosed at surgery ("early surgery") compared with those requiring surgical resection during the course of the disease ("late surgery").

Design

This is a retrospective cohort study.

Settings

This study was conducted at a single tertiary academic medical center.

Patients

We reviewed the medical records of 272 consecutive patients with intestinal Behçet disease between March 1986 and August 2010.

Main Outcome Measures

The cumulative probabilities of clinical recurrence and reoperation after operation were the main outcomes measures.

Results

Forty of 272 patients were first diagnosed with intestinal Behçet disease at surgery (early surgery); the remaining 232 were diagnosed clinically, with 62 undergoing surgery during their follow-up after clinical diagnosis (late surgery). The cumulative probabilities of postoperative clinical recurrence and reoperation were significantly lower in the early-surgery group than in the late-surgery group (p = 0.045 and p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, early surgery was the only independent factor significantly associated with a reduced probability of reoperation (HR 0.26; 95% CI 0.10–0.71; p = 0.008). However, when we analyzed only the patients who underwent surgery because of chronic symptoms, early surgery was not associated with lower cumulative clinical recurrence and reoperation rates (p = 0.896 and p = 0.492).

Limitations

We analyzed the clinical characteristics retrospectively, and the number of patients was insufficient to reach a decisive conclusion.

Conclusions

According to the current study, the patients with intestinal Behçet disease undergoing early surgery showed better prognoses in comparison with those undergoing late surgery. Early surgery may represent a valid approach in the initial management of the patients with intestinal Behçet disease, at least in the subset of the patients with acute symptoms.

### Combination therapy of infliximab and thalidomide for refractory entero-behcet's disease: a case report [^116ssDgy]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Behcet's disease (BD) is a systemic inflammatory disease with the histopathological features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis that affects nearly all organs and systems. When it involves the intestine, it is called entero-Behcet's disease (entero-BD).

Case presentation

Here we described a 23-year-old man with entero-BD refractory to conventional therapies who responded well to the combination therapy of infliximab, an anti-tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha antibody, and thalidomide. After combination treatment, the patient's symptoms improved greatly and his Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score decreased from 344 to 52 points, accompanied by a body weight increase from 53 kg to 64 kg. A follow-up endoscopy performed 10 weeks after the treatment showed significant improvement and the patient's multiple ulcers had healed well.

Conclusion

The combination therapy of infliximab and thalidomide appears to be clinically effective in a patient with refractory entero-BD. However, further studies need to be performed to evaluate the efficacy of this combination therapy.

### Proceedings of the 32nd European paediatric rheumatology congress [^112zBVsg]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The task force devised 33 statements including 4 overarching principles. Major themes endorse the importance of acknowledging that pediatric Behcet disease can be a challenging diagnosis, as symptoms emerge gradually over time. It's crucial to consider genetic or genomic conditions in the differential diagnosis, especially for patients with early-onset or family history of Behcet-like disease. In these cases, evaluation should include genetic testing using NGS-based autoinflammatory gene panels or WES or WGS as well as screening (immune-phenotyping) for immune dysregulation, and disease-associated comorbidities. Monoclonal Anti TNFs should be used as a first-line biologic treatment for patients with severe major organ such as ocular, neuro, vascular and GI involvement. Close monitoring for disease progression and complications is essential as well as the access to specialized, multidisciplinary care at referral centers.

Conclusion: These recommendations represent state-of-the-art knowledge based on published data and expert opinion to guide diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and monitoring of patients with pediatric BD, and to standardize and improve care, quality of life and disease outcomes.

A wide range of etiologies and pathogenic mechanisms underlie colitis. This Review provides an overview of the pathophysiology, epidemiology, histopathology, and clinical characteristics of noninfectious and non-IBD forms of colitis: microscopic colitis, Behçet's syndrome, diversion colitis, diverticular colitis, eosinophilic colitis, ischemic colitis, and radiation colitis. These more recently characterized and rare forms of colitis occur as either primary conditions or complications of other diseases. Most of these diseases are uncommon; therefore, epidemiologic data and data from controlled trials are not readily available. Practical guidelines for the diagnosis and therapy of these more recently characterized and rarer forms of colitis are given where possible.

### Adherence to guidelines for the treatment of Behçet's syndrome in New York and amsterdam [^115QU7Zp]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess adherence to published guidelines for the treatment of Behçet's syndrome (BS) in two geographic areas.

Methods

We extracted guideline statements from the 2008 EULAR recommendations. Adherence to these statements was evaluated retrospectively in both New York (USA) and Amsterdam (The Netherlands), by reviewing records from patients fulfilling the ISG criteria. We analysed data per statement and event, and divided data according to the year in which an event occurred. We compared events prior to 2009 to those after publication of the EULAR recommendations (2009 and later).

Results

474 patients were evaluated, 24 of whom were from Amsterdam. Treatment adherence varied substantially across various Behçet's manifestations, ranging from 21% vs. 31% in posterior uveitis, 50% vs. 25% in arterial disease, 29% vs. 29% in arthritis and 38% vs. 55% in erythema nodosum to 65% vs. 67% in deep venous thrombosis (DVT), before and after publication of the guidelines respectively. Topical treatment of mucocutaneous disease was only 2% vs. 8%, whereas adherence in neuro-Behçet was ≥ 94% and 100% in gastrointestinal disease.

Conclusions

Adherence to treatment guidelines varies substantially by Behçet's manifestation. Lack of adherence in manifestations such as eye disease and arthritis suggests that current recommendations are not sufficient or other concurrent manifestations require more aggressive treatment. The extensive use of anti-TNF agents might indicate a shift towards more aggressive treatment. Thus, our results suggest the 2008 guidelines were not in line with treatment in clinical practice over the past years and the recent revision of the recommendations was indeed needed.

Cogan and Behcet syndromes are considered large vessel vasculitides. Both are rare diseases, with varied clinical manifestations affecting multiple organ systems. Although both have hallmark symptoms (ocular and vestibuloauditory inflammation in Cogan syndrome and aphthous ulcers in Behcet syndrome), neither has confirmatory diagnostic testing. Delayed diagnosis can result in poor outcomes. In both syndromes, large vessel arterial inflammation may result in severe morbidity and mortality. Treatment strategies in both syndromes vary based on organ system involvement and severity of manifestations.

### Behçet's syndrome: facts and controversies [^1174r2PT]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Behçet's syndrome is a systemic vasculitis of small and large vessels affecting both veins and arteries. Almost all patients with Behçet's syndrome have recurrent oral aphthae, followed by genital ulcers, variable skin lesions, such as erythema nodosum and papulopustuler lesions, arthritis, uveitis, thrombophlebitis, and gastrointestinal and central nervous system involvement. Recent epidemiologic works suggest that genetic factors are more important than environmental factors in its pathogenesis. European League Against Rheumatism guidelines were recently published for the treatment of Behçet's syndrome. Although these are quite useful for the management of mucocutaneous, eye, and joint involvement, treatment of vascular, neurological, and gastrointestinal involvement are still problematic as there are no controlled studies for these manifestations. This contribution addresses the epidemiology, mucocutaneous manifestations, diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based therapies, including biologic agents.

### Management of major organ involvement of Behçet's syndrome: a systematic review for update of the EULAR recommendations [^111v6eXu]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of treatment modalities for major organ involvement of Behçet's syndrome (BS), in order to inform the update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of BS.

Methods

A systematic literature review of all randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, or open label trials assessing eye, vascular, nervous system or gastrointestinal system involvement of BS was performed. If controlled trials were not available for answering a specific research question, uncontrolled studies or case series were also included.

Results

We reviewed the titles and abstracts of 3927 references and 161 studies met our inclusion criteria. There were only nine randomized controlled trials. Observational studies with IFN-α and monoclonal anti-TNF antibodies showed beneficial results for refractory uveitis. Meta-analysis of case-control studies showed that immunosuppressives decreased the recurrence rate of deep vein thrombosis significantly whereas anticoagulants did not. CYC and high dose glucocorticoids decreased mortality in pulmonary arterial aneurysms and postoperative complications in peripheral artery aneurysms. Beneficial results for gastrointestinal involvement were obtained with 5-ASA derivatives and AZA as first line treatment and with thalidomide and/or monoclonal anti-TNF antibodies in refractory cases. Observational studies for nervous system involvement showed improved outcome with immunosuppressives and glucocorticoids. Meta-analysis of case-control studies showed an increased risk of developing nervous system involvement with ciclosporin-A.

Conclusion

The majority of studies related to major organ involvement that informed the updated EULAR recommendations for the management of BS were observational studies.

### Development and validation of novel diagnostic criteria for intestinal Behçet's disease in Korean patients with ileocolonic ulcers [^116V5zRu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

It is difficult to diagnose intestinal Behçet's disease (BD) due to various extraintestinal manifestations emerging at different time points in the disease course and a lack of reliable diagnostic criteria. We conducted this study to develop and validate novel diagnostic criteria for intestinal BD.

Methods

Experts from three universities generated the preliminary diagnostic criteria for intestinal BD, and a consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method with 13 gastroenterologists participating. To validate the criteria, we recruited 12,850 consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopic examinations between January 2000 and December 2006 at Severance Hospital, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.

Results

The novel diagnostic criteria were developed on the basis of two aspects: colonoscopic findings and extraintestinal manifestations. Of the 12,850 patients, 280 with ileocolonic ulcers were enrolled for validation. At the time of initial colonoscopic examinations, patients were categorized for BD status into 4 groups: definite (84 patients), probable (67), suspected (15), and nondiagnostic (114). At the end of the follow-up period (mean, 50.9 ± 25.7 months), intestinal BD was confirmed in 145 patients (51.8%)-84 (100%) from the definite group, 49 (73.1%) from the probable group, 10 (66.7%) from the suspected group, and 2 (1.8%) from the nondiagnostic group. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the diagnosis probability of these criteria were 98.6, 83.0, 86.1, 98.2, and 91.1%, respectively.

Conclusions

These newly proposed, simple criteria might be useful in diagnosing intestinal BD, especially in patients with ileocolonic ulcers who do not fully satisfy the diagnostic criteria of systemic BD.

### Treating ulcers associated with Behçet's disease… [^116Gz1q5]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Behçet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory condition, probably of autoimmune origin, that is triggered by infectious antigens or other antigens in genetically predisposed persons. Recurrent, painful ulcerations of the oral and genital mucosa are the most common symptoms. Therapeutic agents, such as topical or intralesional corticosteroids, generally are used only for palliative therapy. Sucralfate, which is commonly used in the treatment of peptic ulcers, can also heal ulcers of the gastrointestinal tract. However, its effectiveness in healing oral and genital ulcerations is unknown. Alpsoy and associates evaluated the efficacy of topical sucralfate suspension in the treatment of the mucocutaneous lesions associated with Behçet's disease. Forty patients with Behçet's disease were randomized to receive either sucralfate or a placebo four times a day for three months. Sucralfate and the placebo were identical in appearance.

All patients were instructed to use 5 mL of sucralfate or placebo as an oral rinse for one to two minutes after routine mouth care and before sleep. Patients with genital ulcerations were also given sucralfate or placebo, to be applied as topical therapy or a vaginal douche. Patients were examined every two weeks during the study period and again three months after the treatment ended. The mean frequency, healing time and pain of ulcerations were evaluated before treatment and compared with responses after treatment. Data were evaluated for 30 of the 40 patients eligible for the study. Disease parameters at baseline were similar between groups. Patients in the treatment group had significantly decreased mean frequency, healing time and pain associated with oral ulcerations, and decreased healing time and pain associated with genital ulcerations compared with the pretreatment period.

Patients in the placebo group showed no significant differences between the pretreatment and treatment periods, except for decreased pain of oral ulcerations. Only mean frequency and healing time of oral ulcerations were significantly different in patients in the treatment group at the follow-up visit. The authors conclude that topical sucralfate suspension is effective and inexpensive in treating the oral and genital ulcerations characteristic of Behçet's disease and offers an option to palliative therapy. The differences in improvement ratings for oral ulcerations between groups were significant. Despite the fact that the healing time and pain associated with genital ulcerations decreased clinically, this difference did not achieve statistical significance. A striking finding was the marked decrease in pain scores in both groups. Although the percentage of decrease was higher in the treatment group, the results indicate that coating agents are helpful in the palliation of pain.

### Beh ҫ et's syndrome | NEJM resident 360… [^116CdQ7J]. resident360.nejm.org (2024). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published February 14, 2024 Behҫet's syndrome is a chronic, multisystem, inflammatory condition with a relapsing and remitting course. Read the NEJM Review Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: Describe some of the epidemiological features of Behҫet's syndrome. A: The highest prevalence of Behҫet's syndrome is found in Turkey, with 420 cases per 100, 000 persons. The mean age at diagnosis is approximately 30 years, with the majority of patients presenting between the ages of 15 and 45 years. Disease activity tends to wane with advancing age. Although there is no difference in the incidence of Behҫet's syndrome according to sex, male patients are more likely than female patients to have severe forms of the disease. Q: Is the eye frequently affected in Behҫet's syndrome. A: The eye is the most frequently affected major organ in Behҫet's syndrome, with ocular involvement occurring in approximately 50% of patients.

Bilateral involvement is observed in 75 to 80% of new cases with ocular manifestations, on average occurring 2 years after the onset of the initial symptoms. Panuveitis is the most common presentation. A: Recurrent oral ulceration, a hallmark of Behҫet's syndrome, is the most common clinical manifestation, followed by genital ulcers, papulopustular lesions, and nodular skin lesions. Up to a third of patients present with only these manifestations throughout the course of their illness. Oral ulcers are typically both the initial and most persistent symptom in Behҫet's syndrome. Roughly half the patients with Behҫet's syndrome have joint involvement, which typically manifests as nondeforming, self-limited monoarthralgia or oligoarthralgia or arthritis, primarily affecting the knees, ankles, wrists, and elbows. The prevalence of gastrointestinal involvement varies substantially across ethnic groups, with rates below 5% in Europe and the Middle East and up to 20% in East Asia.

Gastrointestinal ulcerations may occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract, leading to a range of clinical manifestations from mild to severe, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding. These symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those found in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. A: Vascular Behҫet's syndrome can affect both veins and arteries of varying calibers and typically follows a relapsing course. Overall, the estimated 5-year cumulative risk of recurrent vascular events among patients with Behҫet's syndrome is close to 40%. Superficial thrombophlebitis and deep-vein thrombosis are the most common manifestation of vascular Behҫet's syndrome, occurring in 15 to 40% of cases. In patients with deep-vein thrombosis, there is a predilection for lower limb involvement, which can lead to a severe post-thrombotic syndrome. Pulmonary embolism is rare.

Thrombotic events have also been noted in several other locations, including portal or suprahepatic veins, the superior or inferior vena cava, and cerebral sinuses. Patients with arterial manifestations of Behҫet's syndrome primarily present with aneurysms but may also have thrombotic occlusion or stenosis. Involvement of the pulmonary artery, although rare, is highly specific for Behҫet's syndrome. Vascular Behҫet's syndrome is the leading cause of death among patients with Behҫet's disease, which is mainly due to arterial aneurysms and Budd–Chiari syndrome.
