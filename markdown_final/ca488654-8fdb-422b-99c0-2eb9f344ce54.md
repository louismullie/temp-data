## Question

How should hydroxyshloroquine be dosed to avoid toxic retinoapthy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how hydroxychloroquine should be dosed to minimize retinopathy risk, with explicit step-by-step thinking and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core dosing principle and the weight basis. Then, I should verify the dose–response data and risk thresholds. Next, I will examine major and minor risk modifiers that justify dose adjustments or enhanced screening. After that, I need to translate this into practical dosing strategies, including tablet-splitting and special populations. Finally, I should integrate screening protocols and a decision framework for dose reduction versus discontinuation, and close with a concise, actionable recommendation summary.

> Let me first confirm the core dosing principle. The current standard is a maximum of 5 mg/kg/day using actual body weight, replacing the older 6.5 mg/kg/day based on ideal body weight, because real weight correlates better with retinopathy risk and avoids underdosing thin patients while preventing overdosing in others [^114NqHa6] [^112sibq6] [^113KY715].

> Wait, let me verify the dose–response risk data before I anchor on a single number. Large cohorts show a clear gradient: at 15 years, cumulative retinopathy is about 2.7% with ≤ 5 mg/kg/day, 11.4% with 5–6 mg/kg/day, and 21.6% with > 6 mg/kg/day, with a roughly linear relationship between daily dose and risk, supporting the ≤ 5 mg/kg/day target as the safest practical threshold [^112aH2oF] [^117W3vJ7]. I should also note that even at ≤ 5 mg/kg/day, risk rises with duration, approaching 20% after 20 years, which underscores the need for ongoing surveillance rather than complacency [^114NqHa6] [^1136EeBs].

> Hold on, I should verify the major risk modifiers that might push me to use a lower target or intensify monitoring. Chronic kidney disease with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² increases risk about twofold and warrants dose reduction and earlier or more frequent screening, as does concomitant tamoxifen, which multiplies risk approximately 3–5 fold, and older age at initiation, which shows a stepwise increase in hazard with each decade above 45 years [^1115Tovt] [^113uT1CC] [^1127q63A]. Let me also consider that Asian ancestry is associated with a pericentral pattern and higher risk, which should prompt broader field testing and vigilance even if the daily dose is "acceptable" by weight [^1115Tovt] [^117JGJyw].

> I need to check whether there are additional modifiers with weaker or conflicting evidence. Female sex has been associated with higher risk in some cohorts even after adjusting for dose, possibly reflecting pharmacokinetics or hormonal factors, though this is not uniformly observed and should be interpreted cautiously; liver disease has not shown a consistent association, and obesity per se is less predictive than the arithmetic of real-weight dosing, which can inadvertently exceed 5 mg/kg/day in smaller patients prescribed 400 mg flatly [^1115Tovt] [^114RFuK1] [^111o4Mbp].

> Next, I should review practical dosing strategies. For most adults, 200–400 mg/day is typical, but I must calculate using actual weight and aim for ≤ 5 mg/kg/day; if 400 mg exceeds this threshold, I should split tablets or use alternate-day strategies to stay under the cap, and I should avoid exceeding 400 mg/day in any patient regardless of weight because the absolute ceiling still applies in obesity [^112sibq6] [^114NqHa6]. Let me double-check that tablet-splitting is acceptable; yes, tablet division is a recognized approach to achieve intermediate doses, though the FDA label advises against crushing or dividing, so I should confirm local policy and patient-specific factors when splitting is necessary [^112Po8dR] [^111o8Ydz].

> But wait, what about patients with very low or very high body weight. In patients under about 60 kg, 400 mg/day often exceeds 5 mg/kg/day, so I should proactively prescribe 200–300 mg/day or use split dosing; conversely, in obesity, real-weight dosing can paradoxically permit 400 mg/day while staying within 5 mg/kg/day, though I should still cap at 400 mg/day and consider that some experts argue for using the lesser of real or ideal weight in select phenotypes to avoid inadvertent overdose in short, obese individuals [^111o4Mbp] [^1129vqf3] [^113nKe8B]. Hold on, I should verify that the 2016 AAO explicitly supports real weight; yes, it does, and the cap of 400 mg/day remains a practical safeguard even when the arithmetic allows higher by weight alone [^114NqHa6].

> I will now examine special populations and scenarios. In CKD, I should reduce the dose and consider earlier screening; in patients who require tamoxifen, I should use the lowest effective HCQ dose and intensify ophthalmic surveillance; in older adults starting therapy, I should consider starting at the low end of the range and reassess early, given the steeper risk trajectory with age; in Asian patients, I should broaden visual field testing to capture pericentral disease and maintain a lower threshold for concern [^1115Tovt] [^113uT1CC] [^117JGJyw].

> Next, I should review the screening protocol and ensure it aligns with guidelines. Baseline retinal examination with SD-OCT and appropriate visual fields should occur within the first year, with annual screening beginning after 5 years for average-risk patients, and earlier or more frequent screening for those with major risk factors such as CKD, tamoxifen, or dose > 5 mg/kg/day; in Asian patients, I should include wider fields to detect pericentral patterns, and I should avoid stopping therapy for equivocal findings without confirmatory testing and coordination with the prescriber [^117BfG1c] [^114fR2bH] [^116YR2rd] [^116c4d8S].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping therapy at the first hint of change. I should confirm that early, mild retinopathy may justify dose reduction with closer monitoring rather than abrupt cessation, especially when disease control is critical, whereas clear structural damage warrants discontinuation; this balanced approach is emphasized in multidisciplinary guidance to avoid unnecessary flares while protecting vision [^114uLoux] [^116c4d8S].

> I should double-check the balance between ocular safety and disease control, because underdosing can increase flares. Observational data suggest that maintaining doses around 5 mg/kg/day may be associated with higher flare risk compared with slightly higher historical targets, so I need to individualize within the ≤ 5 mg/kg/day band, consider short-term dose escalations for control with prompt de-escalation, and recognize that emerging tools like HCQ blood levels may help identify nonadherence or unusually high exposure, though level-guided dosing remains investigational [^1154sACr] [^115LaRMF] [^112Po8dR].

> Let me reconsider the practical implementation details to avoid dosing errors. I need to ensure current weight is documented at every visit, embed EMR alerts for weight-based dosing, and provide patients with clear instructions if using split or alternating-day regimens; quality improvement studies show that simple workflow changes markedly improve adherence to ≤ 5 mg/kg/day dosing and screening documentation [^112vdgmL] [^117BfG1c].

> Final synthesis: I should confirm the actionable recommendation. Prescribe hydroxychloroquine at ≤ 5 mg/kg/day actual body weight, never exceeding 400 mg/day, adjusting for tablet size by splitting or alternate-day dosing as needed; reduce dose and increase surveillance with CKD, tamoxifen, or older age at initiation; perform baseline retinal testing within a year and annual screening after 5 years, sooner and more often for high-risk patients; and manage early toxicity with dose reduction and close monitoring rather than reflex discontinuation, coordinating with ophthalmology and the patient to preserve vision without sacrificing disease control [^114NqHa6] [^114fR2bH] [^1115Tovt] [^117BfG1c].

To minimize hydroxychloroquine retinopathy risk, **keep the daily dose ≤ 5 mg/kg actual body weight** [^114NqHa6] and avoid exceeding 400 mg/day [^115c8ZF6]. Use the **actual body weight** for dosing [^113KY715], not ideal body weight, and adjust for renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^1115Tovt] or tamoxifen use [^1127q63A], which increase toxicity risk. For obese patients, **cap the dose at 400 mg/day** regardless of weight [^112YDkzo]. Perform a baseline ophthalmic exam within the first year [^117BfG1c], then screen annually after 5 years [^114fR2bH]; start earlier if risk factors are present [^116TgtF1]. If toxicity is detected, reduce the dose or stop the drug and monitor closely [^116YR2rd].

---

## Recommended dosing guidelines

- **Maximum daily dose**: ≤ 5 mg/kg actual body weight [^114NqHa6] (≤ 400 mg/day) [^111o8Ydz].

- **Body weight calculation**: Use actual body weight, not ideal body weight [^113KY715].

- **Obesity**: Cap at 400 mg/day regardless of weight [^112YDkzo].

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dose if eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [^112fEfZy] [^114cmS8h].

- **Tamoxifen**: Increases toxicity risk; consider dose reduction and closer monitoring [^1115Tovt] [^114T57VQ].

---

## Risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy

- **Daily dose**: > 5 mg/kg/day significantly increases risk [^112aH2oF] [^1127q63A].

- **Duration**: Risk rises with > 5 years of use; ~20% after 20 years [^114NqHa6] [^1136EeBs].

- **Renal impairment**: Higher risk with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [^1115Tovt] [^111MwdJ6].

- **Tamoxifen**: ~5-fold increased risk [^1127q63A].

- **Age**: Older age at initiation increases risk [^1115Tovt] [^113uT1CC].

- **Genetics**: CYP polymorphisms may increase risk [^111MwdJ6].

---

## Ophthalmic screening recommendations

- **Baseline exam**: Within the first year of therapy [^117BfG1c] [^114fR2bH].

- **Routine screening**: Annually after 5 years of therapy [^114fR2bH] [^114T57VQ].

- **High-risk patients**: Annual screening if dose > 5 mg/kg/day, renal impairment, tamoxifen use, or macular disease [^115qWACo] [^114cmS8h].

- **Screening tests**: SD-OCT, 10–2 visual fields, fundus autofluorescence [^116vAEhb] [^114fR2bH].

---

## Management of detected retinopathy

When retinopathy is detected, **reduce the dose to ≤ 5 mg/kg/day** or discontinue therapy [^116YR2rd]. Continue close ophthalmic monitoring, as progression can occur even after stopping the drug [^111grYcW]. Coordinate with the prescribing physician to balance ocular risk against systemic disease control [^116c4d8S].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

Evidence supporting dosing recommendations includes a large cohort showing a **21.6% retinopathy risk at 15 years with > 6 mg/kg/day** versus 2.7% with ≤ 5 mg/kg/day [^112aH2oF]. The AAO 2016 guidelines endorse **≤ 5 mg/kg/day actual body weight** to minimize toxicity [^114NqHa6]. The 2025 ACR guideline conditionally recommends a long-term average dose goal of ≤ 5 mg/kg/day to reduce retinal toxicity [^111Ax6n6].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Calculate dose**: Use actual body weight and stay ≤ 5 mg/kg/day [^114NqHa6].

- **Adjust for risk**: Reduce dose if renal impairment, tamoxifen use, or other risk factors are present [^1115Tovt] [^1127q63A].

- **Screen**: Baseline exam within 1 year, then annually after 5 years; earlier for high-risk patients [^117BfG1c] [^114fR2bH].

- **Educate**: Ensure patients understand adherence and the need for regular screening [^115TqzT9].

---

Adhering to **≤ 5 mg/kg/day actual body weight** [^114NqHa6], using actual body weight for calculations, and adjusting for renal impairment or tamoxifen use [^1115Tovt] are key to minimizing hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. Regular, risk-based ophthalmic screening [^114T57VQ] and prompt dose adjustment or discontinuation if toxicity is detected further reduce visual risk [^116vAEhb].

### Rethinking the hydroxychloroquine dosing and retinopathy screening guidelines [^114uLoux]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe the rationale for revising the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) dosing and screening guidelines and to identify the barriers to more effective guidelines in the future.

Design

Literature review.

Methods

A PubMed query of studies on HCQ dosing and HCQ retinopathy (HCQR) screening was conducted with a selective review of the English language literature.

Results

Three iterations of the American Academy of Ophthalmology HCQ dosing and HCQR screening guidelines have been published without including prescribing physicians on the writing committees. This may contribute to prescribing physicians' low adherence to the guidelines. As ancillary tests have improved, asymptomatic HCQR is being detected earlier, leading to a higher reported prevalence of HCQR and a drop in the ceiling for safe dosing. These trends put stricter constraints on prescribers and their patients, who may have had well-controlled autoimmune disease on HCQ doses that were previously considered to be below the high-risk threshold for HCQR. Indeed, stopping HCQ at the earliest sign of HCQR should be reconsidered; for cases of early HCQR, dose reduction and more intensive monitoring for retinopathy may strike a more appropriate balance between HCQ risk and benefits. A prospective study using the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Retina Network with standardized collection of data, HCQ blood levels, centralized grading of ancillary tests, and community and academic ophthalmologists would provide a stronger evidence base for future HCQ guidelines.

Conclusions

The HCQ dosing and screening guidelines should be updated and a prospective study of HCQ dosing and HCQR should be initiated with the joint efforts of ophthalmologists and prescribing physicians.

### Risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and its subtypes [^1115Tovt]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The major toxic effect of hydroxychloroquine is retinopathy. Thus, current guidelines recommend limiting the dose and screening annually for retinopathy among all long-term users, but individual patient factors may be associated with retinopathy risk.

Objective

To identify risk factors beyond hydroxychloroquine dose and duration of use for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study of 4677 patients in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated health network who initiated hydroxychloroquine, continued treatment, and underwent retinopathy screening after 5 years of use was conducted from July 1, 1997, to December 31, 2020, with up to 15 years of follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed in August 2023.

Exposure

Candidate risk factors included age at hydroxychloroquine initiation, sex, race and ethnicity, indications, chronic kidney disease (CKD), liver disease, diabetes, tamoxifen use, and medications that interact with hydroxychloroquine metabolism. Hydroxychloroquine dose was assessed from pharmacy dispensing records.

Main Outcome and Measures

Incident hydroxychloroquine retinopathy was adjudicated from masked review of guideline-recommended screening studies and classified as parafoveal or pericentral pattern. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess potential risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy within 15 years of initiation.

Results

Of 4677 long-term hydroxychloroquine users (mean [SD] age at initiation, 52.4 [14.1] years; 3877 women [82.9%]), 125 patients developed hydroxychloroquine retinopathy within 15 years (102 parafoveal, 23 pericentral). Older age at time of hydroxychloroquine initiation was associated with retinopathy risk, with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 2.48 (95% CI, 1.28–4.78) for those aged 45 to 54 years, 3.82 (95% CI, 2.05–7.14) for those aged 55 to 64 years, and 5.68 (95% CI, 2.99–10.79) for those aged 65 years or older compared with those younger than 45 years. The risk of retinopathy was higher among females than males (HR, 3.83 [95% CI, 1.86–7.89]), among patients with CKD stage 3 or greater (HR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.25–3.04]), and among individuals with tamoxifen use (HR, 3.43 [95% CI, 1.08–10.89]). The likelihood of pericentral retinopathy was higher among Asian patients (HR, 15.02 [95% CI, 4.82–46.87]) and Black patients (HR, 5.51 [95% CI, 1.22–24.97]) compared with non-Hispanic White patients.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests that increasing age, female sex, CKD stage 3 or greater, and tamoxifen use were associated with a higher risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, whereas being younger than 45 years at hydroxychloroquine initiation and male sex were associated with a lower risk. Race and ethnicity were also associated with the pattern of retinopathy. These factors should be incorporated into hydroxychloroquine dosing decisions.

### Hydroxychloroquine dose and risk for incident retinopathy: a cohort study [^112aH2oF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydroxychloroquine is recommended for all patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and is often used for other inflammatory conditions, but a critical long-term adverse effect is vision-threatening retinopathy.

Objective

To characterize the long-term risk for incident hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and examine the degree to which average hydroxychloroquine dose within the first 5 years of treatment predicts this risk.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

U.S. integrated health network.

Participants

All patients aged 18 years or older who received hydroxychloroquine for 5 or more years between 2004 and 2020 and had guideline-recommended serial retinopathy screening.

Measurements

Hydroxychloroquine dose was assessed from pharmacy dispensing records. Incident hydroxychloroquine retinopathy was assessed by central adjudication of spectral domain optical coherence tomography with severity assessment (mild, moderate, or severe). Risk for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy was estimated over 15 years of use according to hydroxychloroquine weight-based dose (> 6, 5 to 6, or ≤ 5 mg/kg per day) using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.

Results

Among 3325 patients in the primary study population, 81 developed hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (56 mild, 17 moderate, and 8 severe), with overall cumulative incidences of 2.5% and 8.6% at 10 and 15 years, respectively. The cumulative incidences of retinopathy at 15 years were 21.6% for higher than 6 mg/kg per day, 11.4% for 5 to 6 mg/kg per day, and 2.7% for 5 mg/kg per day or lower. The corresponding risks for moderate to severe retinopathy at 15 years were 5.9%, 2.4%, and 1.1%, respectively.

Limitation

Possible misclassifications of dose due to nonadherence to filled prescriptions.

Conclusion

In this large, contemporary cohort with active surveillance retinopathy screening, the overall risk for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy was 8.6% after 15 years, and most cases were mild. Higher hydroxychloroquine dose was associated with progressively greater risk for incident retinopathy.

### Updated recommendations on the use of hydroxychloroquine in dermatologic practice [^113eR4D7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine has unique immunomodulatory properties and an attractive adverse effect profile. Over the past 10 years, research has led to significant updates in clinical recommendations concerning the optimal use of hydroxychloroquine and monitoring of patients taking it. We discuss updated recommendations concerning hydroxychloroquine daily dosing, retinopathy screening, serologic monitoring, use in smokers, use in pregnant women, and adverse effect risk and monitoring. This review can hopefully serve as an aid to dermatologists and help ensure they continue using hydroxychloroquine safely and effectively.

### Risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and its subtypes [^115Ffvs9]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine is an important treatment for rheumatic diseases because of its relative safety, tolerability, and low cost profile. It remains a mainstay of treatment for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with benefits including improved survival and prevention of SLE flares and damage. However, its major adverse event is hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, an ocular toxic effect that can develop over long-term use. Hydroxychloroquine retinal toxic effects are characterized by thinning of the outer retina and eventual damage of the retina pigment epithelium and can lead to loss of vision in advanced stages. With typical dose ranges used in the treatment of rheumatic and dermatologic conditions, the risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy is rare within the first 5 years of use, but the overall risk of retinopathy increases to 8.6% after 15 years of use.

Hydroxychloroquine daily dose and duration of use are major established risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy; prior studies have found long-term use of hydroxychloroquine with dosing over 5 mg/kg/d to be associated with higher long-term risks of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, and the risk of retinopathy increases markedly after 10 years of use. The potential association of other risk factors with hydroxychloroquine retinopathy is less clear. Prior studies of such risk factors have been limited by small sample size, prevalent case analyses, and potential misclassification of outcomes. Furthermore, while the classic description of hydroxychloroquine toxic effects from studies of primarily White populations in Europe and the US has been a parafoveal retinopathy pattern, a pericentral retinopathy pattern has now been recognized as the dominant pattern among Asian populations. It is unknown whether other risk factors vary according to the pattern of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. To inform the optimal use of this medication, we assessed the risk factors for incident hydroxychloroquine retinopathy within a large-scale, longitudinal cohort of patients who initiated hydroxychloroquine and continued the medication for at least 3 years.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^111PRgBQ]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Several recent studies aimed to investigate temporal shifts in HCQ dosing in the context of revised guidelines, producing rather mixed results. One group reviewed prescription patterns in a large health network from 2007 to 2016 and reported reduced dosing over time with a marked decrease in percentage of patients receiving at least 400 mg HCQ daily in light of the 2011 guideline revisions. On the other hand, a retrospective review of electronic medical records of another health system documented that approximately 50% and 47% of patients seen from 2009 to 2016 were placed on excess initial doses according to the 2011 and 2016 guidelines, respectively. Of the patients, 56% were currently on excess maintenance doses per the 2016 guidelines. The authors concluded that the 2011 revisions had little impact on clinical practice and similarly tempered expectations for that of subsequent revisions.

Studies have found that concern for adverse effects is a significant cause of non-adherence to medication in patients with SLE. Fear over HCQ toxicity has been a limiting factor in prescribing HCQ for both patients and rheumatologists. There is a lack of data regarding non-reversible HCQ retinopathy/retinal blindness from HCQ use. The current AAO recommendations do not alleviate these fears. The lower dosing suggested by the new guidelines does not consider the limited therapeutic options for the treatment of SLE or the risk/benefit profile of HCQ compared with that of immunosuppressive medications. While rheumatologists understand the 2016 AAO recommendations, the results of the survey expressed appropriate concern that the guidelines lack sufficient evidence to support the change in practice that has ensued. The 2016 AAO guidelines and screening recommendations may be a step forward towards improving patient safety, but not necessarily improved outcomes in SLE. Technological advancements should continue to shape opinions on prevalence of retinopathy and suggest solutions for diagnosis and management. In any case, there is certainly a need for continued multidisciplinary collaboration between clinicians using HCQ to treat debilitating illnesses and ophthalmologists seeking to avoid potentially devastating consequences of overuse.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^113QR2mB]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinal toxicity is an ongoing concern for rheumatologists. The revised 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) guidelines created controversy regarding the correct dosing and evaluation of HCQ toxicity. The current study was initiated to further understand rheumatologists' practices regarding HCQ.

Methods

A questionnaire-based survey was distributed electronically to rheumatologists. We collected information on HCQ dosing, clinical decision-making processes, familiarity with the AAO 2016 guidelines, and perceived disparities between the AAO 2016 guidelines and rheumatological clinical practice.

Results

78 rheumatologists completed the survey (49% from USA, 90% academic practices, 82% self-identified as lupus experts). Only lupus expert (n = 64) data were included in subsequent analysis. The mean cohort size was 747 (50–6571), a total cohort 45 612 patients. HCQ was prescribed to > 75% of patients with SLE by 81.3% of SLE experts, with routine counselling about ophthalmic risks. The typical dose of HCQ used was 200–400 mg/day. 17% of rheumatologists use doses up to 600 mg/day, while 6.2% use up to 6.5 mg/kg/day. HCQ adherence is routinely assessed. 479 cases of HCQ retinal toxicity (1.05%) and 9 cases of HCQ-associated blindness (1.8 per 10 000 patients) were reported. 89.1% of respondents reported familiarity with the AAO guidelines. Those aware of the guidelines cited limited dosing options (54.7%), lack of supporting evidence (57.8%) and low patient adherence (43.8%) as obstacles to greater implementation of the guidelines.

Conclusion

These data suggest that HCQ toxicity and blindness are rare in patients with SLE. Rheumatologists treating patients with SLE are aware of the guidelines and appreciate the importance of partnering with ophthalmologists in preventing retinal toxicity.

### Clinical impact of hydroxychloroquine dose adjustment according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines in systemic lupus erythematosus [^111jUZhY]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune disorder characterised by a disruptive innate and adaptive immunity requiring immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapies. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial drug with immunomodulatory properties, remains one of the most important drugs in SLE. Multiple studies have demonstrated its favourable effects in SLE, such as reducing disease exacerbations, damage accrual and mortality. Despite its several therapeutic benefits, HCQ-induced retinal toxicity remains a major concern. This adverse event is reported to be below 1% during the first 5 years of drug treatment, but increases to 2% during the next 5 years and up to 20% after 20 years of therapy. For this reason, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommended guidelines regarding the screening and risks of retinal toxicity. Previously, the AAO recommended HCQ dose ≤ 6.5 mg/kg/day (ideal body weight) to reduce the risk of retinal toxicity, but in the revised guidelines of 2016 the safety dose was changed to ≤ 5 mg/kg/day (actual body weight). However, it is unclear if this change in HCQ dose has a significant impact on the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with SLE and whether or not this dose reduction would be effective in controlling the disease. Therefore, we examined the effect of HCQ dose adjustment to ≤ 5 mg/kg/day on the clinical outcomes of a cohort of Puerto Ricans with SLE.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^1139bC5B]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune systemic disease of multifactorial aetiology and with an unpredictable course. It can be characterised by the occurrence of flares, eventually leading to organ damage and an impaired quality of life.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), inexpensive and well-tolerated antimalarial drug, is now one of the most important medications for SLE, showing multiple benefits over several outcomes associated with the disease itself, as controlling disease activity, preventing flares and damage accrual, but also to its related comorbidities.HCQ binds strongly to melanin and can deposit in melanin-containing tissues such as the skin and the eyes, which might explain some side effects like retinopathy or skin hyperpigmentation.

Currently, HCQ is prescribed according to body weight. The recommended daily dosage of HCQ has varied during the years. The 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology recommendations stated that the safe daily dose of HCQ is no more than 5 mg/kg of actual body weight per day in SLE to decrease retinopathy occurrence. The current 2020 Joint Statement on HCQ and the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) guidelines confirmed the ophthalmological recommendations. An important concern with the current guidelines is that the efficacy of the recently recommended maximum dose (5 mg/kg/day of real body weight) has not been evaluated for patients with SLE. Many past studies evaluating the efficacy of HCQ considered a dosage of at least 6.5 mg/kg ideal body weight per day and it is unclear if this change in HCQ dose would be effective in controlling the disease. Moreover, this dosage is based on data from patients who effectively collected their medication. Unfortunately, less than half of the patients are taking HCQ as prescribed. Adherence to HCQ treatment is an unmet need in SLE, particularly for younger patients who may concern about adverse effects such as of retinopathy. Although non-adherence is an important issue, over two-thirds of rheumatologists are unaware of HCQ non-adherence. Low adherence rates to HCQ, if combined with a lower prescribed dose, may potentially lead to HCQ undertreatment.

### Recommendations on screening for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (2016 revision) [^1127q63A]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy — major toxicity risk factors emphasize dose, duration, renal disease, tamoxifen, and underlying retinal disease. Dosage > 5.0 mg/kg dramatically increases both population risk and annual incremental risk, and extreme doses can be exceedingly dangerous, with reports of HCQ at 800 to 1000 mg/day (up to 20 mg/kg) producing a 25% to 40% incidence of retinopathy and signs of damage within 1 to 2 years. Duration of use is linked to dosage as a critical factor, and even patients using a recommended dose have significant risk after decades of use; cumulative dose does not hold up well, and risk is most accurately assessed on the basis of duration of use relative to daily dose/weight. Hydroxychloroquine and CQ are cleared to a large degree by the kidney, so renal disease increases circulating drug level and the risk of toxicity; patients with renal disease can have unpredictably high blood drug levels, and both dosage and screening frequency may need to be adjusted. Concomitant tamoxifen increased the risk of toxicity approximately 5-fold, and patients with underlying retinal disease may be at higher risk for toxicity, although there are no specific data to confirm this.

### Recommendations on screening for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (2016 revision) [^114NqHa6]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine retinopathy — dose limits and time-dependent risk: We recommend a maximum daily HCQ use of ≤ 5.0 mg/kg real weight, and dose comparisons in older literature suggest using ≤ 2.3 mg/kg real weight for CQ. At recommended doses, the risk of toxicity up to 5 years is under 1% and up to 10 years is under 2%, but it rises to almost 20% after 20 years, and even after 20 years, a patient without toxicity has only a 4% risk of converting in the subsequent year.

### Recommendations on screening for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (2016 revision) [^112sibq6]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine dosing recommendation — We recommend that all patients using HCQ keep daily dosage ≤ 5.0 mg/kg real weight, acknowledging there may be rare instances when higher doses are needed or when a lower limit is advisable because of major risk factors, and that following this guideline will minimize the risk of retinopathy and allow long-term use of HCQ for most patients.

### Safety of hydroxychloroquine: what a dermatologist should know [^111MwdJ6]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary risk factors for HCQ-induced retinal toxicity include daily dosage, duration of use, renal impairment (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2), tamoxifen usage, and existing ocular diseases. The risk is minimized with a daily dose of less than 5 mg/kg actual body weight. The American College of Rheumatology and other professional institutions recommend careful communication between doctors, patients, and eye care providers to ensure HCQ's safe use, particularly adhering to dosing limits. The risk of retinal toxicity is relatively low (< 1%) in the first 5 years and remains under 2% up to 10 years. However, it increases significantly to nearly 20% after 20 years. Notably, if a patient has not developed toxicity after 20 years, the risk for the subsequent year drops to 4%. Other risk factors include female sex, older age at initiation, and genetic polymorphisms, which can either increase susceptibility (e.g. polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene, which may increase blood concentrations) or offer some protection against toxicity (e.g. non-pathogenic ABCA4 polymorphisms). Concomitant retinal conditions may also elevate the risk due to pre-existing cellular damage.

Four major medical societies involved with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy concur on the need for common principles and cooperation to minimize the risk of ocular toxicity. At a daily dosage of ≤ 5 mg/kg/day actual body weight, the risk of retinal toxicity from HCQ is < 2% for usage up to 10 years. Widespread adoption of more sensitive testing techniques, such as optical coherence tomography and automated visual fields, by eye care providers will allow the detection of early toxicity and thus preserve the patient's visual function. Baseline testing is advised to rule out confounding disease when a patient is started on HCQ. Annual screening with sensitive tests should begin no more than 5 years after treatment initiation. Providers should be sensitive to the medical value of HCQ, and not stop the drug for uncertain indications. It is important to note that effective communication among prescribing physicians, patients, and eye care providers will optimize the utility and safety of HCQ.

### Hydroxychloroquine retinopathy-implications of research advances for rheumatology care [^117NWLcN]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in therapy for rheumatic diseases, hydroxychloroquine remains almost universally recommended for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and is often used in the management of other rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the major dose-limiting toxicity of hydroxychloroquine is retinopathy that can lead to loss of vision. New highly sensitive screening methods can identify early stages of retinopathy, and studies that include these modalities have indicated a substantially higher prevalence of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy than was previously recognized, resulting in revisions to ophthalmology guidelines and the recommendation of a low dose of hydroxychloroquine for many patients. However, the efficacy of low-dose hydroxychloroquine for treating SLE and other rheumatic diseases is unknown. Further studies are required to establish the effectiveness and retinal safety of the latest hydroxychloroquine treatment recommendations.

### Revised recommendations on screening for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy [^116vAEhb]. Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommendations for screening of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy were published in 2002, but improved screening tools and new knowledge about the prevalence of toxicity have appeared in the ensuing years. No treatment exists as yet for this disorder, so it is imperative that patients and their physicians be aware of the best practices for minimizing toxic damage.

Risk Of Toxicity

New data have shown that the risk of toxicity increases sharply toward 1% after 5 to 7 years of use, or a cumulative dose of 1000 g, of HCQ. The risk increases further with continued use of the drug.

Dosage

The prior recommendation emphasized dosing by weight. However, most patients are routinely given 400 mg of HCQ daily (or 250 mg CQ). This dose is now considered acceptable, except for individuals of short stature, for whom the dose should be determined on the basis of ideal body weight to avoid overdosage.

Screening Schedule

A baseline examination is advised for patients starting these drugs to serve as a reference point and to rule out maculopathy, which might be a contraindication to their use. Annual screening should begin after 5 years (or sooner if there are unusual risk factors).

Screening Tests

Newer objective tests, such as multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and fundus autofluorescence (FAF), can be more sensitive than visual fields. It is now recommended that along with 10–2 automated fields, at least one of these procedures be used for routine screening where available. When fields are performed independently, even the most subtle 10–2 field changes should be taken seriously and are an indication for evaluation by objective testing. Because mfERG testing is an objective test that evaluates function, it may be used in place of visual fields. Amsler grid testing is no longer recommended. Fundus examinations are advised for documentation, but visible bull's-eye maculopathy is a late change, and the goal of screening is to recognize toxicity at an earlier stage.

Counseling

Patients should be aware of the risk of toxicity and the rationale for screening (to detect early changes and minimize visual loss, not necessarily to prevent it). The drugs should be stopped if possible when toxicity is recognized or strongly suspected, but this is a decision to be made in conjunction with patients and their medical physicians.

### Clinical characteristics of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy [^115m5iiG]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the characteristics and outcomes of patients with hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and to review the current screening guidelines.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed as having hydroxychloroquine retinopathy at our institution between 2004 and 2008.

Results

All seven patients were women. While every patient received 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine per day, every patient exceeded the recommended daily dosage allowance (6.5 mg/kg/day). The mean daily dose of hydroxychloroquine was 8.2 mg/kg/day (range: 6.8–13.6 mg/kg/day). The mean duration of usage was 16.3 years (range: 8.5–30 years), and the mean cumulative dose was 2377 g (range: 1241–4380 g). The mean visual acuity at presentation was 20/30, but all patients exhibited significant visual-field defects. Colour vision was impaired in six patients. Four patients exhibited granular hyperpigmentation in the central macula, and three had a bull's eye appearance. The mean follow-up time was 21 months. The visual outcomes remained stable for every patient except for one patient who experienced an improvement in visual function after drug cessation.

Conclusions

Hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, although rare, still exists despite current screening guidelines. The authors recommend that physicians dose hydroxychloroquine according to lean body weight and that they use risk stratification to guide their screening regimens.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^1134NpDv]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Retinal toxicity and blindness are the most concerning side effects of HCQ. HCQ toxicity is dependent on daily dose, duration of use and total consumption. The exact pathophysiology of retinal toxicity attributed to HCQ is speculated but remains unclear. Binding of the agent to melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) may concentrate the drug in this region, but it has also been suggested that toxicity originates in the photoreceptor layer with secondary RPE damage. In either case, impairment of lysosomal function and autophagy contributes to RPE degeneration and photoreceptor loss.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) has provided formal recommendations on screening for chloroquine (CQ) and HCQ retinopathy, the most recent iteration of which was released in 2016. These guidelines provide a framework for ophthalmologists and rheumatologists by reviewing patient risk factors, predictors of toxicity, dosage recommendations, preferred screening methodology and management following diagnosis. These guidelines recommend a weight-based dosing (≤ 5 mg/kg real weight), but also state that although the risk of HCQ toxicity 'is smaller with low doses, it is not clear that there is any truly 'safe' dosage for long durations of use'. In making these guidelines, the risk assessments were based on outcomes of characteristic visual field pattern defects combined with retinal findings on optical coherence tomography (OCT). It is unclear whether rheumatologists are familiar and compliant with the 2016 AAO guidelines and the risk factors associated with blindness, including duration of use, medical history of renal or macular disease, and tamoxifen use.

Previous studies have estimated the frequency of HCQ retinal toxicity between 1.0% and 7.5%. Additionally, the proportion of patients with retinal toxicity is under 1% for the first 5 years, increases to 2% after 10 years, and increases to about 20% after 20 years of exposure. For patients taking ≥ 5 mg/kg dose, the risk of retinal toxicity is two to three times higher for the same time frame increments. Additionally, higher HCQ blood levels are associated with increased risk of HCQ retinopathy.

While HCQ-related blindness is uncommon, the potential for these harmful side effects raises concern among patients, rheumatologists and ophthalmologists. Whether retinal toxicity measured by OCT has the same ominous prognosis as decreased visual fields resulting in long-term damage and possible blindness remains to be determined. There are limited data on the actual risk and prevalence of HCQ-induced blindness in patients with SLE.

### Recommendations on screening for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (2016 revision) [^1136EeBs]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy risk by duration and dose increases with time and higher daily dosing; the text states risk increases sharply to approximately 20% after 20 years and is much higher with higher daily dose. With HCQ use at ≤ 5.0 mg/kg, the annual incremental risk is less than 1% during the first 10 years and increases to only approximately 4% after 20 years, which is described as a relatively acceptable risk for patients being screened annually.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^111Ax6n6]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus — in people with SLE, the guideline strongly recommends routine treatment with HCQ unless contraindicated and conditionally recommends continuing HCQ therapy indefinitely, even in the setting of sustained remission. For those receiving HCQ, it conditionally recommends a long-term average daily HCQ dose goal of ≤ 5 mg/kg over a dose goal of > 5 mg/kg to minimize retinal toxicity; use of doses of higher dose between 5 and 6.5 mg/kg/day therapy may be necessary for initiation of treatment or to maintain disease control.

### Hydroxychloroquine retinopathy [^111QXgyu]. Eye (2017). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ; Plaquenil) is used increasingly in the management of a variety of autoimmune disorders, with well established roles in dermatology and rheumatology and emerging roles in oncology. Hydroxychloroquine has demonstrated a survival benefit in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus; some clinicians advocate its use in all such patients. However, Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (CQ) have been associated with irreversible visual loss due to retinal toxicity. Hydroxychloroquine retinal toxicity is far more common than previously considered; an overall prevalence of 7.5% was identified in patients taking HCQ for greater than 5 years, rising to almost 20% after 20 years of treatment. This review aims to provide an update on HCQ/CQ retinopathy. We summarise emerging treatment indications and evidence of efficacy in systemic disease, risk factors for retinopathy, prevalence among HCQ users, diagnostic tests, and management of HCQ retinopathy. We highlight emerging risk factors such as tamoxifen use, and new guidance on safe dosing, reversing the previous recommendation to use ideal body weight, rather than actual body weight. We summarise uncertainties and the recommendations made by existing HCQ screening programmes. Asian patients with HCQ retinopathy may demonstrate an extramacular or pericentral pattern of disease; visual field testing and retinal imaging should include a wider field for screening in this group. HCQ is generally safe and effective for the treatment of systemic disease but because of the risk of HCQ retinal toxicity, modern screening methods and ideal dosing should be implemented. Guidelines regarding optimal dosing and screening regarding HCQ need to be more widely disseminated.

### Hydroxychloroquine-induced retinopathy: a dermatologic perspective [^113PiZZM]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Dermatologists use antimalarials to treat conditions such as cutaneous lupus erythematosus. One potentially serious adverse effect of these agents is irreversible maculopathy. Although there is some evidence that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have similarly narrow therapeutic indices with regard to retinal toxicity, the former is thought to be less damaging to the retina and is thus more widely employed by dermatologists. The current recommended maximal dose for hydroxychloroquine is 6.5 mg/kg/day, with the weight in kilograms used for this calculation being the ideal bodyweight rather than actual bodyweight. Ophthalmologic follow-up is an important component of monitoring patients taking antimalarials. Recommendations for follow-up frequency have varied, and we present the recent guidelines from the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Despite dose limitations and ophthalmologic monitoring, irreversible retinal damage can occur. Among the reported cases, there does not seem to be any obvious predictor of the development of maculopathy. The idiosyncratic nature of this adverse effect may be related to interindividual differences in drug metabolism. To understand why only some patients develop retinopathy, better pharmacokinetic models need to be developed, and further elucidation of the precise mechanism of retinal damage is required.

### The 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology hydroxychloroquine dosing guidelines for short, obese patients [^1129vqf3]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The increasing prevalence of obesity over the past 60 years implies the need to reassess the risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (HR) in obese women using the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 2016 guidelines.

Design

Cross-sectional study.

Participants

Medical records of 64 patients with HR from the practices of 2 ophthalmologists, 11 of whom were women with body mass index of 30 kg/m 2 or more, were reviewed.

Methods

Daily dosing based on real and ideal weight was calculated.

Main Outcome Measure

Determine the number (and percentage) of patients given daily dosing according to real-weight and ideal-weight guidelines.

Results

In 4 patients (36%), daily dosing was more than 5 mg/kg based on real weight and more than 6.5 mg/kg based on ideal weight. In 4 patients (36%), daily dosing was 5 mg/kg or less based on real weight and 6.5 mg/kg or less based on ideal weight. In 3 patients (27%), daily dosing was 5 mg/kg or less based on real weight and more than 6.5 mg/kg based on ideal weight. No patient had daily dosing of more than 5 mg/kg based on real weight and 6.5 mg/kg or less based on ideal weight.

Conclusions

Twenty-seven percent of cases of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in obese women had ostensibly safe dosing based on 2016 AAO guidelines. Overdosing of obese women by 2016 AAO guidelines is not rare. Daily dosing based on the older 6.5-mg/kg ideal weight threshold is safer in women with a body mass index of 30 kg/m 2 or more.

### Recommendations on screening for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (2016 revision) [^114T57VQ]. Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommendations on screening for chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy are revised in light of new information about the prevalence of toxicity, risk factors, fundus distribution, and effectiveness of screening tools.

Pattern Of Retinopathy

Although the locus of toxic damage is parafoveal in many eyes, Asian patients often show an extramacular pattern of damage. DOSE: We recommend a maximum daily HCQ use of ≤ 5.0 mg/kg real weight, which correlates better with risk than ideal weight. There are no similar demographic data for CQ, but dose comparisons in older literature suggest using ≤ 2.3 mg/kg real weight.

Risk Of Toxicity

The risk of toxicity is dependent on daily dose and duration of use. At recommended doses, the risk of toxicity up to 5 years is under 1% and up to 10 years is under 2%, but it rises to almost 20% after 20 years. However, even after 20 years, a patient without toxicity has only a 4% risk of converting in the subsequent year.

Major Risk Factors

High dose and long duration of use are the most significant risks. Other major factors are concomitant renal disease, or use of tamoxifen.

Screening Schedule

A baseline fundus examination should be performed to rule out preexisting maculopathy. Begin annual screening after 5 years for patients on acceptable doses and without major risk factors.

Screening Tests

The primary screening tests are automated visual fields plus spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT). These should look beyond the central macula in Asian patients. The multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) can provide objective corroboration for visual fields, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) can show damage topographically. Modern screening should detect retinopathy before it is visible in the fundus.

Toxicity

Retinopathy is not reversible, and there is no present therapy. Recognition at an early stage (before any RPE loss) is important to prevent central visual loss. However, questionable test results should be repeated or validated with additional procedures to avoid unnecessary cessation of valuable medication.

Counseling

Patients (and prescribing physicians) should be informed about risk of toxicity, proper dose levels, and the importance of regular annual screening.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^111pjjD9]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Familiarity with AAO guidelines

Of the rheumatologists, 57 (89.1%) responded that they were aware of the 2016 AAO guidelines regarding HCQ use (table 5). The rheumatologists identified limited dosing options (35 rheumatologists, 54.7%), evidence not supporting the guidelines (37 rheumatologists, 57.8%), low patient adherence to HCQ (28 rheumatologists, 43.8%) and other issues (8 rheumatologists, 12.5%) as the foremost concerns with the AAO 2016 revised guidelines. There were 479 cases of HCQ retinal toxicity (1.05%) and 9 cases of HCQ-associated blindness (1.8 per 10 000 patients) reported.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^111EQ4FB]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study evaluating rheumatologists' familiarity with the updated AAO guidelines. These data show that rheumatologists are familiar with weight-based dosing recommendations and risk factors outlined in the 2016 AAO guidelines. However, ubiquitous adoption of strict weight-adjusted dosing regimens is hindered by multiple factors, including market availability, patient compliance and some degree of scepticism about supporting literature. Additionally, there were inconsistencies in identifying the clinical risk factors associated with retinal toxicity and the suggested screening methodology.

Our data suggest that blindness from retinal toxicity associated with HCQ use is rare. The results of the survey estimate that blindness occurs in less than 0.1% of patients and retinal toxicity occurs in approximately 1% of patients. These data are consistent with previously published literature suggesting that retinal toxicity occurs in 1% of patients. While larger studies on the outcome of HCQ-related blindness in SLE are needed, the low prevalence of this complication should be considered as rheumatologists and ophthalmologists monitor and counsel patients on the risk of retinal toxicity.

The AAO recommendations on screening for HCQ and CQ retinopathy were initially published in 2002 but would be revised multiple times in the following decades to account for new findings in the literature. Shortly afterwards, a prospective cohort study of 526 patients from Greece treated with HCQ for rheumatoid arthritis or SLE described a 0.5% prevalence of related retinopathy among those receiving recommended dosages (≤ 6.5 mg/kg/day) for at least 6 years. Ophthalmological evaluation entailed best-corrected visual acuity, colour vision testing, static and central visual field testing, funduscopy, electroretinography, and fluorescein angiography when indicated. In 2010, another group reported an incidence rate of 0.65% for definite or probable retinopathy among 3995 patients receiving HCQ for rheumatoid arthritis or SLE. Diagnosis was based on the presence of bull's eye maculopathy on funduscopy or suspicious aberration on visual field examination. While < 0.3% exhibited such signs within the first 5 years of treatment, point estimates of risk at later intervals were approximately 2% at 10–15 years of usage and 3.1% at 20 years.

### Risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and its subtypes [^117W3vJ7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study of long-term hydroxychloroquine users with rheumatic and dermatologic conditions, we found that increasing age, female sex, CKD stage 3 or greater, and tamoxifen use were risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, in addition to the established risk factors of higher weight-based daily hydroxychloroquine dose and duration of use. The pericentral retinopathy pattern was observed more frequently among both Asian and Black patients than non-Hispanic White patients.

The association of hydroxychloroquine dose and duration of use with the risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy has been reported by prior observational studies. Many of those studies have focused on the 5 mg/kg/d cutoff for hydroxychloroquine dosing and retinopathy risk, as is currently recommended by 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines. A previous study reported a stepwise higher incidence of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy associated with greater than 6 mg/kg dosing, followed by 5 to 6 mg/kg dosing and the lowest incidence associated with less than or equal to 5 mg/kg dosing. In the current study, we further characterized the dose-response association using a restricted cubic spline curve, and we identified a relatively linear association between hydroxychloroquine dose and the risk of retinopathy. This finding may suggest that rather than considering any particular dose to be a safe threshold (as suggested by prior prevalence studies), prescribers should use the lowest hydroxychloroquine dose that provides disease control and be wary of using higher doses for an extended period of time.

### Risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and its subtypes [^112PdGf7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Because hydroxychloroquine exposure is necessary for the development of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and the weight-based dose is an established risk factor for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, we assessed the hydroxychloroquine weight-based dose in milligrams per kilogram per day from pharmacy dispensing records. We categorized the dose as less than or equal to 5, 5 to 6, or greater than 6 mg/kg/d; dosing category was defined by least 80% of days covered by a given dose range in the fifth year of hydroxychloroquine use (ie, months 48–60 after hydroxychloroquine initiation). We also assessed the cumulative hydroxychloroquine dose in the first 5 years of use.

Demographic variables, comorbidities, and medication records were available for all patients. For 3 patients with missing creatinine levels, we imputed the mean value of 0.90 mL/min/1.73 m, classified as no CKD. For 2 female patients with missing body weight, we imputed the sex-specific mean of 75.6 kg.

Toxicity and counseling — Retinopathy is not reversible, and there is no present therapy, so recognition at an early stage (before any RPE loss) is important to prevent central visual loss.

Chloroquine (CQ) vs hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) dose equivalence and toxicity — Older literature approximately equated 3.0 mg of CQ with 6.5 mg of HCQ, yielding an estimated equivalent of 2.3 mg/kg CQ for 5.0 mg/kg HCQ. Many reports suggest CQ is somewhat more toxic than HCQ but there are no good data on pharmacologic equivalence, and higher observed toxicity may reflect dosing bias from the available CQ tablet size (250 mg), since almost any patient taking 1 tablet of CQ will receive more than 2.3 mg/kg.

### The incidence, monitoring coverage and clinical characteristics of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in the United Kingdom [^114ECoub]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO; 2011, 2016) and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth; 2018 & 2020) recommend annual screening or monitoring (the preferred term in the U.K.) in long-term hydroxychloroquine users. The recommendations aim to detect the earliest pre-symptomatic manifestations of retinal toxicity in order to limit the degree of functional impairment at diagnosis and to reduce the risk of disease progression following dose reduction or drug cessation. However, it has not yet been shown that visual function is better preserved at the point of diagnosis in patients who received retinal monitoring procedures versus those who did not.

The primary aim of this study was to identify the incidence of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in the United Kingdom (U.K.) – both in patients at risk, and at the population level - and to determine the approximate coverage of monitoring services in the U.K. using published data on the number of long-term hydroxychloroquine users. The secondary aim of the study was to compare visual function between asymptomatic patients detected on retinal monitoring procedures and symptomatic patients with hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. The study was initiated shortly after new monitoring recommendations were published in the U.K. (2018), enabling this comparison. The final aim was to describe the demographics, treatment indications, risk characteristics, clinical features, diagnostic modalities, and management of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in the United Kingdom.

### Hydroxychloroquine blood levels predict hydroxychloroquine retinopathy [^115LaRMF]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

In 2016, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) changed the recommended daily dose of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) from 6.5 mg/kg to < 5 mg/kg. However, it is not clear that the lower prescribed dose of HCQ will have the same efficacy for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) activity or the same role in protecting against cardiovascular risk factors and thrombosis. This study was undertaken to address the frequency of HCQ retinopathy and the role of HCQ blood levels in identifying those individuals who are at a greater future risk of retinopathy.

Methods

HCQ blood levels in 537 patients with SLE from a large clinical cohort were repeatedly measured, and patients were tested for HCQ retinopathy. We assessed the risk of retinopathy according to clinical characteristics and blood levels of HCQ.

Results

The overall frequency of retinopathy was 4.3% (23 of 537 patients). There was a 1% risk of retinopathy in the first 5 years of HCQ treatment, 1.8% from 6 to 10 years, 3.3% from 11 to 15 years, 11.5% from 16 to 20 years, and 8.0% after 21 years of use. We found that older age (P < 0.0001), higher body mass index (P for trend = 0.0160), and longer duration of HCQ intake (P = 0.0024 and P for trend = 0.0006) were associated with a higher risk of HCQ toxicity. Higher blood levels of HCQ predicted later HCQ retinopathy (P = 0.0124 and P = 0.0340 for mean and maximum HCQ blood levels, respectively).

Conclusion

Our data prove the utility of assessing blood levels of HCQ in the prediction of retinopathy. This would allow clinicians to either decrease the dose or increase monitoring in those patients with high HCQ blood levels.

### Retinal toxicity in a multinational inception cohort of patients with systemic lupus on hydroxychloroquine [^1177eo7v]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The current AAO (2016)and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (2019)recommendations caution against exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual body weight) of HCQ per day. Both guidelines base their recommendations mainly on a single study conducted in the United States in 2014. This study (which only included patients taking HCQ for > 5 years) observed that patients using 4–5 mg/kg HCQ had < 2% risk of retinopathy within the first 10 years of use, while patients exceeding 5 mg/kg had approximately a 10% risk in the same period. In our study, patients had less than 1% risk in the first decade of use. After 10 years, we observed a non-significant trend for higher risk, particularly among patients with a mean daily dose > 5 mg/kg (but the 95% CIs around our estimates were very wide, table 2).

Recommendations from ophthalmology and rheumatology associations include good practices on screening for retinal toxicity, such as annual ophthalmology examination particularly in patients with > 5 years of use and/or other risk factors (dose > 5 mg/kg/day, renal impairment and other factors). Interestingly, three of our patients with retinal toxicity did not have any of these risk factors.

Our univariate analysis suggests that older age at SLE diagnosis may be associated with higher risk of retinopathy. Age was not included as a major risk factor in the 2016 AAO guidelines, but more recent studies also found older age to be a predictor in unadjusted analyses. The loss of retinal neurons with older age may set the stage for the clinical development of antimalarial retinal toxicity. However, the effect observed could be due to confounders. Older patients may be more adherent to drugs (higher exposure) and to ophthalmology monitoring (higher chances of event detection). Older patients may also have additional ocular (including retinal) pathology, and in some cases, this could potentially alter the likelihood of being diagnosed (correctly or incorrectly) with retinal toxicity. Given that there is no easily available replacement for HCQ in SLE, it is important to highlight the importance of collaborating closely with ophthalmology in the setting of retinal changes, particularly when there is some doubt as to the aetiology.

### Recommendations on screening for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (2016 revision) [^116DX7fZ]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Statistical risk of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) toxicity — A large cohort "of 2361 patients" using HCQ "for more than 5 years" and assessed with "10–2 visual fields or spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT)" reported an "overall prevalence of toxicity… 7.5%". Risk depended strongly on exposure: "Daily dose… was the most critical determinant of risk", correlating with "real weight" rather than ideal, and "very thin patients" dosed by ideal weight were at increased risk. Average use was "approximately 5.0 mg/kg of real weight", and "5.0 mg of HCQ/kg real weight" corresponds with prescription practices and "should be therapeutically effective for most patients". Lower-dose exposure showed advantage: "4.0 to 5.0 mg/kg" was linked to "markedly lower cumulative risk", and remaining " < 5.0 mg/kg" carried "less than 1%" risk in the first "5 years" and "less than 2%" up to "10 years".

Hydroxychloroquine dosing and blood levels — variable dosing and tablet-splitting can achieve intermediate doses, but blood level measurement is unreliable for effectiveness or toxicity. Blood levels of these drugs only stabilize over many weeks, so that variable dosing will average out over time, and intermediate doses can be obtained easily by splitting tablets or by simply eliminating a tablet on certain days of the week. Although blood levels might aid dosing or evaluating poor clearance, literature on the measurement of HCQ blood level has shown it to be an unreliable indicator of medical effectiveness or toxicity. Hydroxychloroquine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can be affected by a variety of drugs, and some of the variability in blood levels may relate to these metabolic pathways.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)/chloroquine (CQ) retinopathy — baseline and follow-up screening: Patients beginning long-term HCQ or CQ therapy should have a baseline ophthalmologic examination within the first year, with macular fundus evaluation emphasized; baseline visual fields and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) are added if maculopathy is present. For ongoing surveillance, annual screening can be deferred until there has been 5 years of exposure, should begin sooner if the risk is high, and per Table 2 should begin after 5 yrs of use or sooner in the presence of major risk factors; more frequent screening may be considered for patients with major risk factors, and it is important to check the dosage relative to weight at every visit.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) — antimalarial therapy and ophthalmic monitoring: Recommendation 10.2.1.1 states, "We recommend that patients with SLE, including those with lupus nephritis (LN), be treated with hydroxychloroquine or an equivalent antimalarial unless contraindicated (1C)". Dosing guidance notes, "A starting dose of up to 6.5 mg/kg ideal body weight (up to 400 mg/d) followed by 4–5 mg/kg/d for maintenance is recommended. We recommend a maximum dose of 5 mg/kg/d based on risk of toxicity at higher doses". Ocular safety guidance specifies, "Retinal toxicity is low at 5 and 10 years (1% and 2%, respectively) but increases over time. KDIGO recommends baseline and annual retinal examinations", and, "Yearly monitoring should begin after 1 year of therapy in high-risk patients (ie, patients with concomitant tamoxifen use, daily doses > 5mg/kg/d, chloroquine use, or eGFR < 60 mL/min/ 1.73 m2) and after 5 years of therapy in low-risk patients".

### Hydroxychloroquine treatment in European patients with lupus erythematosus: dosing, retinopathy screening and adherence [^115bpR5N]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is common in patients with lupus erythematosus. Long-term use (ie, ≥ 5 years) and high-dose HCQ (ie, > 5 mg/kg/day) are both risk factors for developing HCQ retinopathy. Advances in our understanding of HCQ retinopathy have led to changes in the recommendations for HCQ dosing and retinopathy screening. The latest EULAR guidelines for the management of SLE recommend a maximum HCQ dose of 5 mg/kg/day and ophthalmological screening at baseline and annually after 5 years of HCQ treatment.

Objectives

This study aimed to assess whether the EULAR guidelines are affecting HCQ prescription patterns and screening frequencies in Europe. Furthermore, we inventoried adherence to HCQ.

Results

The online questionnaire was completed by 2936 patients with systemic, cutaneous or juvenile lupus from 33 countries. The majority were female (86.5%) and diagnosed with SLE (81.2%). Among those taking HCQ, the median HCQ dose reported was 4.26 mg/kg/day. More than one-third of respondents (36.8%) exceeded the recommended maximal HCQ dose of 5 mg/kg/day. Baseline ophthalmological screening had been done in 857 out of 1017 respondents diagnosed in the past 10 years (84.3%). Of patients using HCQ ≥ 5 years, 69.2% reported yearly retinopathy screening. Lastly, 17.3% of patients reported that they skipped HCQ once a week or more often.

Conclusion

The results of our study demonstrate that higher than recommended dosages of HCQ are prescribed to more than one-third of patients with lupus in Europe. Recent recommendations regarding screening for retinopathy are incompletely implemented.

### Retinal toxicity in a multinational inception cohort of patients with systemic lupus on hydroxychloroquine [^111FWGyX]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a mainstay in SLE treatment. However, long-term HCQ use may induce retinal toxicity, a serious event that potentially leads to blindness. Retinal damage is of major concern for physicians and patients since there is no specific treatment (other than discontinuing the drug) and serious vision loss can ensue.

Recommendations of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) were revised in 2016 so that the current recommended maximum daily dose is 5 mg/kg (based on actual body weight). Potential risk factors for HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) retinopathy, including high daily dosage, cumulative HCQ and reduced renal function have been studied only in patients with prevalent SLE. Some have misgivings that AAO guidelines are based on suboptimal evidence.

We aimed to evaluate the temporal relationship between HCQ use and retinal toxicity in an incident SLE cohort. We also investigated demographic and clinical characteristics associated with HCQ-induced retinal toxicity.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^115c8ZF6]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Revisions of the guidelines made in 2011 accounted for the above findings of cumulative dose-dependent risk and advances in available ophthalmological screening modalities: multifocal electroretinogram, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and fundus autofluorescence. New recommendations encouraged addition of at least one of the above to supplement routine screening with 10–2 automated fields and capping of daily dose at 400 mg or 6.5 mg/kg ideal body weight. They also cautioned against over-reliance on funduscopic examination due to the late-stage nature of visible bull's eye maculopathy. In 2014, a large retrospective case–control study of 2361 patients on long-term HCQ reported higher prevalence of retinopathy than previously recognised: 7.5% overall and approaching 20% in those receiving longer term (> 20 years) therapy based on visual field or OCT. This landmark study played a role in prompting the 2016 guideline revision, which recommended a maximum daily HCQ dose of 5.0 mg/kg actual body weight, with citation of risk factors including high/excess dose, longer duration of use, and concomitant renal disease or tamoxifen use. Furthermore, updated guidelines emphasised baseline fundus examination, annual screening after 5 years of treatment using automated visual fields and SD-OCT, and additional consideration of patient ethnicity and medical history.

Hydroxychloroquine dose calculation basis — The document explains that prior use of ideal body weight was based on the belief these drugs were not retained in fat, but laboratory data show storage primarily in melanotic tissue, liver, and kidney with low concentrations in muscle and fat; therefore, ideal weight formulas result in overdosage in thin individuals, whereas the recommended formula using real weight accounts for risk evenly across body habitus.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Administer hydroxychloroquine sulfate orally with food or milk. Do not crush or divide the tablets.

2.2 Dosage for Malaria in Adult and Pediatric Patients

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended in pediatric patients less than 31 kg because the lowest available strength (200 mg) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients and it cannot be divided.

Prophylaxis

Treatment must start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area. Advise the patient to take the prophylaxis dosage once a week, staring 2 weeks prior to travel to the endemic area, on the same day every week, continuing the same weekly dose while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. The recommended prophylaxis dosage is:

Adult patients: 400 mg once a week
Pediatric patients ≥ 31 kg: 6.5 mg/kg actual body weight (up to 400 mg) once a week

Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria

The dosages for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria are:

Adult patients: Administer 800 mg initially; subsequently administer 400 mg at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 2000 mg).
Pediatric patients ≥ 31 kg: Administer 13 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) initially; subsequently administer 6.5 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 31 mg/kg - up to 2000 mg).

For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8- aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)].

2.3 Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults

The recommended dosage is:

Initial dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg daily as a single daily dose or two divided doses. The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months for maximum therapeutic effect. Daily doses exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual weight) of hydroxychloroquine sulfate increase the incidence of retinopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Chronic dosage: 200 mg once daily to 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses.

Corticosteroids, salicylates, and other antirheumatic agents may be used concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine sulfate.

2.4 Dosage for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Adults

The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses.

### Special report: recommendations on screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (2026 revision) [^112YDkzo]. Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Academy of Ophthalmology Recommendations on Screening for Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) Retinopathy are now a decade old. This revision provides an update, based on current knowledge. Major points and changes are: NATURE OF TOXICITY: The retina typically remains clinically normal for many years on HCQ, but there is an unpredictable point at which signs of toxicity may develop.

Pattern Of Toxicity

Most eyes of patients of European heritage have a parafoveal pattern of toxicity, while eyes of East Asian patients tend to present with pericentral toxicity. But there are many exceptions, and screening examinations should look for both patterns.

Dosage

The recommended daily dosage remains unchanged at ≤ 5.0 mg/day/kg real weight. Keep under 400 mg/day for severely obese patients.

Risk Factors

Beyond dose and duration, concurrent renal disease and tamoxifen usage increase risk, as does initiation of HCQ therapy at an older age.

Clinical Tests

The primary screening tool should be optical coherence tomography (OCT), along with a wide-pattern fundus autofluorescence (FAF). Visual fields (VF) and multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) are secondary confirmatory tests. Newer VF algorithms such as 24–2C can screen parafoveal and pericentral regions simultaneously.

Screening

A baseline screening exam, including fundus, OCT and FAF, is advised soon after HCQ is begun, not only to rule out pre-existing conditions but also for comparison with later results. Annual screening with OCT and FAF is recommended while using HCQ, but may be deferred during the first 5 years if there are no significant risk factors PROGRESSION: Mild retinopathy is unlikely to progress after discontinuation of HCQ, but severe retinopathy may continue to worsen for many years.

Implications Of Early Signs Of Toxicity

With earlier recognition comes greater need to communicate with patients and their medical providers regarding options to stop HCQ or continue with cautious monitoring.

New Technology

There have been experimental advances in imaging and artificial intelligence analysis for HCQ screening, but none have been validated for general usage, or are widely available at this time.

### Comparison of flares in 85 patients with SLE who maintained, discontinued or reduced dose of hydroxychloroquine during a prospective study of ophthalmological screening for retinopathy (PERFOCTAPS study) [^111BLREG]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in SLE has several beneficial effects, including the prevention of flares and the improvement in survival, and its use is supported by every recent SLE international guideline, regardless of disease severity.

It is, however, associated with long-term side effects, mainly ophthalmological, with toxicity related to duration, cumulative dose, chronic kidney disease and pre-existing retinal or macular disease. Ophthalmological screening is thus recommended at baseline and then annually after 5 years of HCQ treatment to search for early retinal changes (so-called premaculopathy). This screening makes it possible to avoid advanced macular disease (clinical maculopathy), which is usually irreversible.

The optimal daily HCQ dose for an appropriate balance between the ophthalmological risk of HCQ and its benefits has been the object of intense controversy in recent years. For a long period, the dose of 6.5 mg/kg/day of HCQ was recommended. In 2014, a study reported an increased risk of ophthalmological toxicity associated with a daily used dose greater than 5.0 mg/kg. Following this, the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) guidelines recommended prescribing no more than 5 mg/kg of HCQ per day. However, this recommendation was considered by some as due to a misinterpretation of the ophthalmological study, and also as risky as it did not take into consideration the potential risks of reduction.

### Changing paradigms in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^1119ZrTq]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
The multiple therapeutic benefits of hydroxychloroquine in lupus.

To further complicate matters, the recent development of advanced, more sensitive screening techniques for the detection of HCQ-induced retinal toxicity (eg, 10–2 visual fields, spectral domain-optical coherence tomography) suggests that the latter may be more prevalent than previously believed, reaching 10% or more among long-term users. A daily dose of > 5 mg/kg real weight and a duration of use of more than 5 and, especially, more than 10 years, are particularly associated with heightened risk of retinal toxicity. Patients with chronic kidney disease and pre-existing retinal or macular abnormalities comprise a particularly high-risk group. Considering that, (1) recent data were based on prescription practices rather than actual blood concentrations, (2) drug adherence rates are consistently suboptimal in all studies, and (3) SLE is a chronic disease affecting predominantly young individuals, one could be concerned that physician efforts to improve patient compliance rates in the future may have to come at the expense of increased ocular toxicity.

Where do the above data leave us? Undoubtedly, HCQ is indispensable for the treatment of SLE, but a certain degree of caution is needed. The recommended daily dose should not exceed 5 mg/kg real body weight and periodic eye examination (baseline, after 5 years and yearly thereafter, in the absence of retinal findings) should no more be performed by funduscopy, rather by one of the newer screening techniques recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Of note, the comparative efficacy of lower HCQ doses in terms of disease control and prevention of relapses will have to be tested in practice, as all published trials have used the previously common 6.5 mg/kg target dose. In our practice, we also attempt to reduce to a maintenance dose of 200 mg/day in patients with persistent low disease activity (LDA) or remission, although no robust data exist to substantiate this practice. Measuring HCQ concentrations can be helpful to detect complete non-adherence, but more data are needed regarding concentration-adjusted dosing, owing also to its limited availability. Finally, especially in patients with skin manifestations, quinacrine may be used as an alternative antimalarial, given its reported efficacy in cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

### A nationwide survey of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy presenting to the hospital eye service in the United Kingdom [^114ZdKTr]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine retinopathy is a toxic retinopathy that can result in severe and progressive visual loss following exposure to hydroxychloroquine. Prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine have more than doubled in the past 10 years in the United Kingdom, which coupled with low drug discontinuation rates, has led to significant numbers of patients on long-term hydroxychloroquine who are at risk of retinopathy.

The advent of modern retinal imaging techniques — in particular, optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence imaging — has enabled the detection of pre-symptomatic retinopathy. Using these techniques, Melles and Marmor (2014) identified retinopathy in 7.5% of patients with more than 5 years of exposure to hydroxychloroquine, increasing to 20–50% after 20 years based on a single abnormal test result consistent with hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. Jaumouille et al identified a prevalence of 6.5% in long-term users using the same definition of toxicity. A large, single-centre prospective audit of 869 long-term hydroxychloroquine users who underwent monitoring in the UK identified a prevalence of 6.3% if one abnormal test result was used to define toxicity, and 1.6% if two abnormal tests were used to define toxicity. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) recommendations specify that two abnormal tests suggestive of toxicity are required to diagnose definite retinopathy (2018 and 2020).

Monitoring for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy has been recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) since 2002 and the RCOphth since 2018. Despite these recommendations, which have been adopted in many countries, it is unclear how many individuals are diagnosed with hydroxychloroquine retinopathy each year. This is the first national survey of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy cases seen by the UK hospital eye service. Data presented in this paper include patients reported for the first year (July 2018–2019) of a 2-year reporting period. The primary aim of the study was to determine the number of cases of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy presenting to the hospital eye service across the UK, enabling an estimate of the frequency of detected retinopathy in long-term users and an overview of hydroxychloroquine monitoring coverage in the UK. The secondary aims were to identify the demographics of confirmed cases, clinical features, retinal imaging characteristics, dosing characteristics, risk factors for retinopathy and the management of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy.

### Risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and its subtypes [^113uT1CC]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

This study provides evidence for other key risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy beyond hydroxychloroquine exposure itself. After accounting for differences in weight-based dose, female sex was still associated with an approximately 4 times higher risk of incident hydroxychloroquine retinopathy compared with males. As most hydroxychloroquine users are female, this finding can also be interpreted as male sex is associated with a lower risk of retinopathy. A biological explanation for this finding is not known, but sexual disparities have been previously recognized in other retinal and ocular conditions. Older age at hydroxychloroquine initiation was strongly associated with a higher risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, with approximately 3, 4, and 6 times higher risk for those aged 45 to 54 years, 55 to 64 years, and 65 years or older, respectively, compared with those younger than 45 years at time of hydroxychloroquine initiation. The retina is known to thin with age, and these age-related changes may render older individuals more vulnerable to the toxic effects of hydroxychloroquine.CKD stage 3 or greater was also found to be a risk factor for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. Given the important role of the kidneys in clearance of hydroxychloroquine, renal insufficiency likely leads to a patient being effectively exposed to a higher systemic dose of the medication. We did not observe an association between the use of CYP inhibitors and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy risk. CYP enzymes convert hydroxychloroquine to active metabolites, which also ultimately undergo renal clearance. It is not well understood whether these metabolites are also associated with retinopathy risk. Future studies could replicate our findings and assess the potential association of genetic polymorphisms of CYP enzymes with retinopathy risk. Although tamoxifen use was rare in our study, we did substantiate a higher retinopathy risk among tamoxifen users. Tamoxifen itself can cause retinopathy, and there may be a synergetic toxic effect with hydroxychloroquine on the retina. Consideration of these additional risk factors should influence individualized hydroxychloroquine dosing and monitoring for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy.

### A critical review of the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the eye [^117BCmRr]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine have been used for more than 50 years to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other rheumatic diseases. In general, these drugs are well tolerated and rarely need to be discontinued because of an adverse systemic reaction. However, both medications can be irreversibly toxic to the retina. A new study indicates that toxicity is not as rare as once believed, but depends critically on daily dosage and duration of use, as well as other risk factors. With attention to dosage and other factors, and with proper screening for early signs of toxicity, HCQ can be prescribed with relative safety even over long periods of time.

### Hydroxychloroquine: balancing the need to maintain therapeutic levels with ocular safety: an update [^115qVXTZ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Antimalarial drugs including chloroquine, its less toxic quinolone-derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and quinacrine have become cornerstones in the treatment of autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and Sjogren syndrome; cutaneous disorders, antiphospholipid syndrome, and have recently been employed at higher dioses in oncology. Benefits include anti-inflammatory effects, protection against thrombosis, and improved control of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. In general, both the therapeutic advantages and the toxic effects of the drugs correlate with the dose and the duration of therapy. Here we summarize the current literature regarding the administration and the safety profile of HCQ in management of rheumatologic disease and focus on the most recent revised American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) guidelines for prevention and detection of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy to help guide therapeutic decision-making for patients.

Recent Findings

The risk of antimalarial-induced retinal toxicity is better predicted by calculating the daily dosage based on 5mg/kg total body weight rather than 6.5mg/kg lean body weight and reducing dosage in patients with risk factors such as renal failure. The risk of retinal toxicity after 5 years is substantially increased even when these guidelines are followed; hence dose reduction is appropriate with long-term use. Newer techniques provide improved detection of early signs of retinal damage. These advances are reflected in the revised AAO guidelines 2016, which are in part based on the retrospective study by Melles and Marmor of HCQ toxicity.

Summary

The most important changes in practice guidelines include dose calculation based on total body weight, dose reduction after long-term use, and intensified screening with techniques including optical coherence tomography (OCT) after 5 years.

### The impact of different algorithms for ideal body weight on screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in women [^112gyGyh]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Which algorithm the ophthalmologist chooses to use will affect thresholds for ascertaining potentially toxic daily dosing. Choosing the Michaelides algorithm will lead to 98% of patients taking the most common daily dose of 400 mg/d to be classified as taking a potentially toxic dose. In contrast, if the Metropolitan Life Insurance table for large frame women, mean values is chosen, 16% of patients will be classified as taking a potentially toxic dose. It seems impractical to expect that ophthalmologists will contact prescribing physicians to alter dosing in greater than 50% of the patients that they screen. A less strict threshold, eg, exemplified by the Bergholz algorithm or the NHLBI table, balances concern to prevent toxicity with the practical reality that a minority of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine require dosage modification based on concerns regarding ophthalmic toxicity. Although the Wolfe algorithm has been advocated in one editorial, there was no basis given for the preference, and there are reasons why it is not preferable.

### The risk of toxic retinopathy in patients on long-term hydroxychloroquine therapy [^115UynHk]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is widely used for the long-term treatment of autoimmune conditions but can cause irreversible toxic retinopathy. Prior estimations of risk were low but were based largely on short-term users or severe retinal toxicity (bull's eye maculopathy). The risk may be much higher because retinopathy can be detected earlier when using more sensitive screening techniques.

Objectives

To reassess the prevalence of and risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinal toxicity and to determine dosage levels that facilitate safe use of the drug.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective case-control study in an integrated health organization of approximately 3.4 million members among 2361 patients who had used hydroxychloroquine continuously for at least 5 years according to pharmacy records and who were evaluated with visual field testing or spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.

Exposure

Hydroxychloroquine use for at least 5 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Retinal toxicity as determined by characteristic visual field loss or retinal thinning and photoreceptor damage, as well as statistical measures of risk factors and prevalence.

Results

Real body weight predicted risk better than ideal body weight and was used for all calculations. The overall prevalence of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy was 7.5% but varied with daily consumption (odds ratio, 5.67; 95% CI, 4.14–7.79 for > 5.0 mg/kg) and with duration of use (odds ratio, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.20–4.70 for > 10 years). For daily consumption of 4.0 to 5.0 mg/kg, the prevalence of retinal toxicity remained less than 2% within the first 10 years of use but rose to almost 20% after 20 years of use. Other major risk factors include kidney disease (odds ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.44–3.01) and concurrent tamoxifen citrate therapy (odds ratio, 4.59; 95% CI, 2.05–10.27).

Conclusions and Relevance

These data suggest that hydroxychloroquine retinopathy is more common than previously recognized, especially at high dosages and long duration of use. While no completely safe dosage is identified from this study, daily consumption of 5.0 mg/kg of real body weight or less is associated with a low risk for up to 10 years. Knowledge of these data and risk factors should help physicians prescribe hydroxychloroquine in a manner that will minimize the likelihood of vision loss.

### Safety of hydroxychloroquine: what a dermatologist should know [^115CFQ4x]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ophthalmological Toxicities

Previously, HCQ retinopathy was thought to be rare because it was typically detected only in advanced stages. Earlier studies reported a 0.38% incidence of retinal toxicity among 526 patients in 2003, and 0.68% in 2010 for those using HCQ for 5–7 years. This led the American Academy of Ophthalmology to update screening guidelines in 2011. In a 2014 study, Melles and Marmor assessed 2361 patients who had used HCQ for over 5 years, identifying a 7.5% prevalence of retinopathy, which increased to 20–50% after 20 years of use. This study's higher toxicity estimates were due to more sensitive detection methods like spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), long-term HCQ use (mean 15 years), and high doses prescribed before safer dosing guidelines were established.

### Retinal toxicity in a multinational inception cohort of patients with systemic lupus on hydroxychloroquine [^112DNRVW]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We observed only 11 events over the study interval, which limited our power to make strong inferences about most demographic and clinical characteristics in terms of their association with HCQ-induced retinal toxicity. The relatively short follow-up is a potential limitation, and it is imperative that further study of retinal toxicity in incident SLE be undertaken. We did not assess adherence to HCQ, which many studies have shown can be suboptimal in SLE. However, almost no observational studies of drug effects in SLE (or any other disease for that matter) completely account for non-adherence. These limitations were included in our poster presentation of this work at the ACR annual scientific meeting in 2020.

HCQ seems likely to remain a first-line drug in the management of patients with SLE for the foreseeable future. Ophthalmology screening is important for early detection of retinal toxicity which needs confirming by a retinal specialist. We need more work to prospectively identify which patients are at highest and lowest risk of retinal toxicity. HCQ tapering or withdrawal should only be offered to the right patients and at the right time for the right reasons as this can be associated with risk of flare, and other drugs may have more risk than continuing HCQ at appropriate dosing if there is no definite evidence of HCQ retinal toxicity.

### Practice patterns of screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in south Korea [^114yUywH]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

The present study revealed a trend in nationwide use of hydroxychloroquine by patients at risk of retinopathy in South Korea. Although adherence to the current AAO guidelines regarding the timing and modalities used for both baseline and monitoring examinations improved over time, most long-term hydroxychloroquine users remained unscreened after 5 years of hydroxychloroquine use.

Our findings on the use of hydroxychloroquine revealed that during the study period, the annual number of new hydroxychloroquine users at risk of retinopathy decreased, although the annual number of overall hydroxychloroquine users in South Korea increased. Accordingly, more patients should be considered for screening by ophthalmologists, although over time, the target population for baseline screening has decreased every year. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of hydroxychloroquine at a national level that also estimates the proportion of hydroxychloroquine users (0.21%-0.24%) and initiators (0.017%-0.031%) among the entire national population. These numbers and percentages of individual drug users, being not negligible, raise public health concerns urging the establishment and implementation of screening programs for retinopathy.

The AAO recommendations published in 2011 and 2016 defined risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, provided dosage recommendations, and suggested when and how to perform baseline and annual screenings. The timing and modalities used for screening are crucial for timely detection of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and minimization of the risk of irreversible vision loss due to retinal toxicity. However, our findings on timing and modalities suggest that most patients remained unscreened by the baseline (79.2% within 1 year and 55.7% within 5 years) or monitoring (68.4% after 5 years) examination. Unscreened long-term users were of particular concern, as this situation could lead to detection of retinopathy at the symptomatic late stage. Underscreened patients for whom an insufficient number of tests had been performed were not as remarkable as unscreened patients, and the screening modalities mostly included SD-OCT and VF, in agreement with the AAO guideline on suggested primary tests. Therefore, our results suggest that performance of screening itself, rather than how it is performed, may be more important for minimization of delayed diagnosis and associated vision loss in real-world practices of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy screening. Of highest importance, patients taking hydroxychloroquine for diverse indications should be referred by prescribing physicians to ophthalmologists to undergo screening examinations.

### A multidisciplinary collaborative approach to retinal toxic effects screening for dermatology patients taking antimalarials [^116c4d8S]. JAMA Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the roles of antimalarial therapy prescribers and eye care specialists in regard to antimalarial dosing, screening for retinal toxic effects, and antimalarial treatment cessation?

Bottom Line

Antimalarial prescribers should prescribe antimalarial dosages at 5 mg/kg/d or less of actual body weight. A baseline retinal examination with optical coherence tomography should be performed within 6 months of starting antimalarial therapy to rule out confounding disease. Patients at low risk for retinopathy do not require annual screening until 5 years of antimalarial use. Eye care clinicians should not stop treatment with antimalarials because of equivocal findings, as retinopathy occurs slowly, and therefore there is time for repeated testing. Antimalarial treatment cessation should be a collaborative decision that involves the patient, the prescriber, and the eye care clinician and that focuses on patient values, the severity of the underlying disease, and the estimated risk of visual loss if treatment with the drug is continued.

### Guidelines on prescribing and monitoring antimalarials in rheumatic diseases: a systematic review [^115AYR8f]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this systematic review was to identify existing guidelines for antimalarial prescribing and monitoring, specifically for hydroxychloroquine, and how these guidelines compare and have evolved over time.

Methods

A literature search was conducted using Embase and Medline to identify guidelines published from 1946–2018. MeSH terms were used and alternative spelling and related words were entered as keywords to broaden results.

Results

243 results were reviewed to obtain 11 recommendations. Ophthalmology sources included the American Academy of Ophthalmology, Royal College of Ophthalmologists and Canadian editorials. The American College of Rheumatology and Canadian Rheumatology Association consensus statements summarised rheumatology recommendations. Recently, American and British guidelines changed from suggesting hydroxychloroquine doses ≤ 6.5 mg/kg/day to ≤ 5 mg/kg/day. American guidelines recommended baseline visual field (VF) testing and annual screening after five years. Visual field (VF) testing evolved from the Amsler grid to current recommendations of 10–2 automated VF and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The 2012 Canadian recommendations suggested initial VF testing every two years, with SD-OCT after 10 years. Older British guidelines advocated for baseline and annual assessment with Amsler grids during rheumatology clinic visits. The 2018 British guidelines supported baseline and annual screening after five years with 10–2 VF, SD-OCT and fundus autofluorescence.

Conclusions

The newest recommendations are heterogeneous suggesting lower hydroxychloroquine dosing. Retinal toxicity is irreversible and the risk increases over time. Annual screening after five years with automated VF and SD-OCT may be warranted to detect early changes and discontinue therapy if necessary.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^111Qyhpc]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The strengths of the current study include a large number of responses from experienced rheumatologists/lupus experts who regularly prescribe HCQ to their patients, and an estimated cohort of 45 612 patients with SLE. The questionnaire was extensive and used multiple modalities (multiple-choice questions, ranking questions, clinical vignettes) to capture rheumatologists' familiarity with dosing, screening/monitoring and risk factors outlined in the 2016 AAO guidelines.

Limitations of this study included the following: (1) the cross-sectional survey-based data from a convenience sample of self-identified lupus experts may not be representative of the rheumatology community as a whole and thus limit the generalisability of our findings; (2) responses to questions were limited to the options presented to responders in the multiple-choice forms; and (3) the estimation of the occurrence of retinal toxicity did not explore potential associations with blindness (such as cumulative dose of HCQ or comorbidities). Moreover, while the response rate was close to 28%, individuals who chose not to respond may have done so because of their lack of familiarity with the guidelines. The study estimated the occurrence of retinal toxicity and HCQ-associated blindness from reports from rheumatologists. The next steps should include observational data from other large cohorts to confirm the accuracy of the data presented in this study.

### Risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and its subtypes [^115LyMJj]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has some strengths, including the use of a cohort with representation from multiple racial and ethnic groups and long-term follow-up. Hydroxychloroquine exposure was assessed from comprehensive pharmacy dispensing records, which account for adherence by ensuring medication possession and therefore represent a more accurate estimation of exposure than prescribed or reported dose. Outcomes were validated on masked readings of guideline-recommended spectral domain–optical coherence tomography retinopathy scans by expert ophthalmologists, whereas prior studies have relied on physician report or patient self-report of retinopathy or on less sensitive screening modalities; therefore, this study should be less susceptible to misclassification bias.

Our study has several limitations worth noting. We lacked data on hydroxychloroquine blood levels, so we could not test the potential association with hydroxychloroquine retinopathy risk, which is a topic of current debate. As hydroxychloroquine retinopathy is typically asymptomatic until the late stage, early diagnosis must be based on active screening. Therefore, the date of onset could have been earlier than recognized for some patients. Although this is the largest cohort study to our knowledge of risk factors for incident hydroxychloroquine retinopathy to date, there were still small numbers of events within some of the risk categories, and there were a limited number of patients with pericentral retinopathy.

### Practice patterns of screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in south Korea [^114y6Cez]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations requiring careful consideration. We could not exclude ophthalmic examinations performed on participants for purposes other than toxicity screening. To minimize the number of examinations for other purposes (eg, diabetic retinopathy screening), we excluded patients with any ophthalmic disease who had undergone any of the 4 recommended tests prior to hydroxychloroquine initiation. Furthermore, we have confirmed that the data on baseline examinations (eTable 7 in Supplement 1) and monitoring examinations (eTable 8 in Supplement 1) were comparable even after excluding patients with common ophthalmologic diseases and those with diabetes. However, although the tests were performed for other purposes, the same tests recommended for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy screening may also reveal structural or functional abnormalities. This ophthalmic practice may lead to diagnosis of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy based on the characteristic structural and functional defects in the parafoveal or pericentral areas, on which screening practices also focus. In addition, we defined patients at risk as those treated with hydroxychloroquine for 6 months or more; however, no consensus on patients at risk requiring screening examinations currently exists. Daily dose, or dose divided by body weight, should be carefully considered together with duration of hydroxychloroquine use to define the risk of retinopathy, but this information was not available to the present study. Use of typical hydroxychloroquine doses for a few months does entail a very low risk of retinopathy; thus, retinopathy screening is considered unnecessary for such short-term users. However, in a trial of high-dose hydroxychloroquine for cancer, one patient developed subtle changes that were detected on OCT after 11 months. Without information on hydroxychloroquine dose, we used the criteria of hydroxychloroquine use for 6 months or more to include patients at risk of retinopathy who had been receiving diverse hydroxychloroquine doses for different indications. Finally, test quality could not be assessed in our study; for example, a test performed using time-domain OCT could not be discriminated from one performed using SD-OCT because the same health claim code for OCT is used for the different devices. Therefore, even though a quality-assured examination is a prerequisite for assessing adherence to AAO guidelines, we could not evaluate the quality of the screening service in this study.

### Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine retinopathy: screening for drug toxicity [^115bMiSD]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine retinopathy and consider screening for drug toxicity.

Design

Retrospective observational case series.

Methods

Review of clinical records, visual fields, fundus photographs, and fluorescein angiography of six patients from a retina referral practice.

Results

All cases arose because of failure by physicians to avoid dosing above published safe levels. Five cases developed despite accepted ophthalmologic patterns of screening for toxicity. All cases developed parafoveal retinal pigment epithelial atrophic changes and paracentral scotomas to threshold visual field testing.

Conclusions

New cases of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine toxicity continue to develop in a screening environment. Increased ophthalmologic attention to dosing, awareness of location and nature of early visual field defects, and traditional attention to presence or absence of maculopathy can reduce the incidence of this avoidable condition.

### Impact of the revised American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines regarding hydroxychloroquine screening on actual practice [^116NMeH6]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the impact of the revised academy guidelines on screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy.

Design

Retrospective, observational cohort study.

Methods

setting: Private practice of 29 doctors. study population: Total of 183 patients for follow-up and 36 patients for baseline screening. observation procedure: Review of charts, 10–2 visual fields (VFs), multifocal electroretinograms (mfERG), and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images before and after the revised guidelines. main outcome measure: Rates of use of ancillary tests and clinical intervention, costs of screening, follow-up schedules, and comparative sensitivity of tests.

Results

New hydroxychloroquine toxicity was found in 2 of 183 returning patients (1.1%). Dosing above 6.5 mg/kg/d was found in 28 of 219 patients (12.8%), an underestimate because patient height, weight, and daily dose were not determined in 77 (35.1%), 84 (38.4%), and 59 (26.9%), respectively. In 10 of the 28 (35.7%), the dose was reduced, in 2 (7.1%) hydroxychloroquine was stopped, but in 16 (57.1%) no action was taken. The cost of screening rose 40%/patient after the revised guidelines. Fundus autofluorescence imaging was not used. No toxicity was detected by adding mfERG or SD-OCT. In no case was a 5-year period free of follow-up recommended after baseline screening in a low-risk patient.

Conclusions

Detection of toxic daily dosing is a cost-effective way to reduce hydroxychloroquine toxicity, but height, weight, and daily dose were commonly not checked. The revised guidelines, emphasizing mfERG, SD-OCT, or FAF, raised screening cost without improving case detection. The recommended 5-year screening-free interval for low-risk patients after baseline examination was ignored.

### Hydroxychloroquine usage in US patients, their experiences of tolerability and adherence, and implications for treatment: survey results from 3127 patients with SLE conducted by the lupus foundation of America [^115TpMLh]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

HCQ dosing is weight-based, and at present only 200 mg strength tablets are available. It can therefore be challenging to tailor the optimal dosage regimen for each patient. Furthermore, the need to tailor doses has increased since the AAO 2016 HCQ retinopathy guidance was published. Twenty-six per cent of the patients surveyed reported doses above 5 mg/kg/day actual body weight, and consequently some patients may require dose reduction. Currently, complex regimens with different doses on different days of the week or splitting tablets are required to deliver doses between 200 mg and 400 mg. Both of these dosing strategies have a negative impact on adherence. Availability of new dosage forms of HCQ would provide greater flexibility to accurately tailor doses for individual patients, as well as potentially alleviate adherence issues associated with complex HCQ regimens.

### Are the current recommendations for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine screening appropriate? [^116F2dEh]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine and quinacrine are frequently used to treat rheumatic diseases. Ocular toxicity, although infrequent, is one of the potential side effects of antimalarial therapies. Current recommendations are unifocal in being developed by only ophthalmologists who do not treat patients for their rheumatic diseases. The data used to create the recommendations are meager and retrospective. Comanagement of patients with rheumatic disease who are exposed to antimalarial therapies requires a greater interaction between ophthalmologists and rheumatologists.

### Somatotype, the risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, and safe daily dosing guidelines [^117KZ3Jm]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Although the daily dose adjusted by some version of the patient's mass is the only modifiable variable, there are unknown variables yet to be identified. This is highlighted by the group of patients who had retinopathy but never had toxic dosing. The proportion of these was 17 (48.6%), 13 (37.1%), and 12 (34.3%) for daily dosing by IBW (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute algorithm, 6.5 mg/kg/d conversion factor), daily dosing by RBW (5 mg/kg/d conversion factor), and daily dosing by lesser of IBW and RBW, respectively.

Limitations of our study include a patient setting that may not be generalizable, retrospective data collection, use of a single grader for determining retinopathy, and dependence on patient report regarding medication use, liver function, and renal function. These limitations are common to previous studies, and there are no prospective, level I studies of HCR that do not suffer from similar flaws.

### Improving hydroxychloroquine dosing and toxicity screening at a tertiary care ambulatory center: a quality improvement initiative [^112vdgmL]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a commonly used weight-based medication with a risk of retinal toxicity when prescribed at doses above 5 mg/kg/day. The objectives of our study were (1) to characterize the frequency of inappropriate HCQ dosing and retinopathy screening, and (2) to improve guideline-based management by implementing quality improvement (QI) strategies.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed to obtain baseline analysis of HCQ dosing, weight documentation, and retinal toxicity screening to characterize current practices. The primary aim was to increase the percentage of patients appropriately dosed from 30% to 90% over a 10-month period. The secondary aim was to increase the percentage of documented retinal screening from 59% to 90%. The process measure was the number of patients with a documented weight in the chart. The balancing measure was the physician's perceived increase in time spent with each patient due to implemented interventions. QI methodology was used to implement sequential change ideas: (1) HCQ weight-based dosing charts to facilitate prescription regimens; (2) addition of scales to patient rooms to facilitate weight documentation; and (3) electronic medical record (EMR) "force function" involving weight documentation and autodosing prescription.

Results

The percentage of patients being weighed increased from 40% to 92% after 10 months. Appropriate HCQ dosing improved from 30% to 89%. Retinal screening documentation improved by 33%.

Conclusion

Dosing charts in clinic rooms, addition of weight scales, and EMR force function autodosing prescriptions significantly improved appropriate HCQ dosing practices. These interventions are generalizable and can promote safe and guideline-based care.

### The impact of different algorithms for ideal body weight on screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in women [^116vk9zV]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine retinopathy was once considered to be rare with only 47 cases reported between 1960 and 2005. Since that era, increased awareness of the problem and more sensitive methods of detection have suggested that toxicity is not as rare as previously thought. Failure analyses have identified overdosing of patients as the main cause of retinopathy. Retinopathy is rare if dosing is kept below 6.5 mg/kg of IBW, but in practice approximately 12%–56% of patients in the US are overdosed. As a result, increased attention has been focused on assessing the toxicity of daily dosing among screened patients, rather than just detecting retinopathy at the earliest stage possible.

Doing so requires a concept of IBW (synonyms include lean body weight and top normal body weight).–The importance of the concept arises from the preferential partitioning of hydroxychloroquine into lean tissue and away from fat. In ophthalmic case series, various tables and formulas for IBW have been used. Clinically important implications for the screening ophthalmologist, not previously investigated, arise from these different definitions of IBW.

Short, obese patients have long been recognized as being at increased risk for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. In these patients the need to use ideal rather than actual body weight (ABW) to assess daily dosing has been publicized, but incompletely adopted. Emphasis has also been placed on ABW rather than IBW for persons of asthenic build. For this phenotype, use of a larger value for IBW based on height, rather than the smaller ABW, could lead to toxic dosing.

In this report the different algorithms in use are compared for their potential effects on screening. From this analysis, an argument is presented in favor of a preferred algorithm for use by clinicians in daily practice.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for systemic lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to surveillance for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, RCOphth 2020 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining annual monitoring after the initiation of therapy in all patients on hydroxychloroquine treatment in the presence of additional risk factors for retinal toxicity.

Regarding medical management for cutaneous lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to antimalarial agents, EADV 2017 guidelines recommend to administer hydroxychloroquine in a maximum daily dose of 5 mg/kg real bodyweight or chloroquine in a maximum daily dose of 2.3 mg/kg real bodyweight. Do not combine hydroxychloroquine with chloroquine due to the risk of irreversible retinopathy.

Table 1
Strategies and evidence level for maximising hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine treatment in CLE

Long-term therapy with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine carries the risk of developing a 'bull's-eye' macular retinopathy. When these drugs began to be widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and SLE in the 1950s and 1960s at very high daily doses (eg, 1000–1200 mg/day), some patients suffered loss of vision. It was subsequently learnt that daily doses of hydroxychloroquine no higher than 6.5 mg/kg/day based on ideal body weight greatly decreased the risk of antimalarial retinopathy (4 mg/kg/day for chloroquine). These daily dose regimens were used successfully over the next several decades in treating CLE and in mitigating the systemic manifestations of SLE, as well as its comorbidities such as premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

However, in 2016, the American Academy of Ophthalmology published new recommendations on screening for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. Because of concern about increasing incidence of antimalarial retinopathy, these revised guidelines recommended that patients should not receive more than 5 mg/kg/day of hydroxychloroquine based on real body weight (2.3 mg/kg/day for chloroquine). Some rheumatologists and dermatologists have expressed concern that the lower daily doses of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine resulting from these new screening guidelines could result in breakthrough of CLE and SLE disease activities. Increasing the hydroxychloroquine dose for previously hydroxychloroquine-refractory patients with CLE can significantly improve CLE lesions. Therefore, doses of antimalarials should be based on the risk:benefit ratio, although HCQ blood levels may be helpful, and in general, it is best to stay within the dosing guidelines because of eye toxicity.

### Somatotype, the risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, and safe daily dosing guidelines [^117VF1go]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Of all the patient risk factors for hydroxychloroquine (HC) retinopathy (HCR), the only one that is modifiable is daily dosing. Cumulative dose, duration of therapy, renal and liver insufficiency, gender, race, age, pre-existing macular status, and concomitant use of tamoxifen are fixed. Therefore, an emphasis on guidelines for safe dosing is appropriate, since overdosing is common.–The dependence of safe dosing on real body weight (RBW) versus ideal body weight (IBW), and somatotype, has been a topic of discussion since HCR was first described, but the prevailing viewpoint has fluctuated. Weight is especially important for HC dosing because of the known sequestration of HC away from fatty tissues.–

The literature before 2013 suggested that short obese women are at higher risk. In 2013, we reported data indicating that this generalization was untrue and that instead, short, asthenic women were at higher risk. Other studies later confirmed these observations but went further and proposed a new, purportedly safer, method for dosing HC. American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) guidelines had formerly emphasized dosing based on IBW, and our study suggested that the guidelines should be based on the lesser of RBW and IBW. The 2016 version of the AAO guidelines suggested that dosing should be based on RBW using a new dosing conversion factor of 5 mg/kg/d rather than the previous conversion factor of 6.5 mg/kg IBW/d.

The report by Melles and Marmorled to changes in the AAO guidelines, but their results have not been replicated, and they allow higher doses of HC for short, obese patients than previous guidelines. Moreover, they compared dosing by RBW and IBW, but not by the lesser of RBW and IBW as we had recommended. They also analyzed the risk of retinopathy in their data set using a univariate methodology rather than a multivariate methodology, which failed to account for the effects of covariates of potential importance. In this work, using an independent data set, we examine the replicability of the findings of Melles and Marmor, expand the analysis to include dosing by the lesser of RBW and IBW, and use multivariate analysis rather than univariate analysis to assess the risk of retinopathy.

### Optimizing hydroxychloroquine dosing for patients with COVID-19: an integrative modeling approach for effective drug repurposing [^112yEMxu]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Additional toxicities associated with HCQ include retinopathy and gastrointestinal adverse events. The mechanism of irreversible retinal damage associated with HCQ is unknown, but it has been associated with HCQ doses > 5 mg/kg and in patients who receive HCQ for > 5 years. Retinopathy associated with use < 1 month of HCQ has not been reported, and this side effect is less likely in the acute setting. Gastrointestinal toxicity with HCQ is concentration‐related and could be a limiting factor to dosage of HCQ but doses up to 1,200 mg have been reported to be well‐tolerated without adverse events in patients with cancer and rheumatologic disease in other studies.

There were a few limitations to this study. First, clinical HCQ data are limited to nonrandomized studies, and a clear model for the natural rate of viral decline is not well defined. To explore this effect, we compared viral kinetic trends on treatment to the extracted baseline data from Cao et al. (n = 100 hospitalized patients who received supportive care). Second, the translational viral replication was obtained from SARS‐CoV‐1 data. SARS‐CoV‐1 and SARS‐CoV‐2 share an estimated 79.6% sequence homology. Third, we imputed the PK profiles for HCQ using population PK parameters derived from a pool of both healthy and malaria‐infected patients. Fourth, we were not able to predict how concomitant HCQ and azithromycin may impact the risk of QTc prolongation or anticipate how underlying risk factors for QTc prolongation could impact the PK‐QTc relationship due to the lack of available data. Closely monitored clinical trials will be needed to confirm that high‐dose HCQ is safe with or without azithromycin. Finally, our model used plasma HCQ concentrations to predict nasopharyngeal viral loads, which may not fully correlate with clinical improvement or viral load measured at different sites, however, it has generally been accepted that viral decline is a desirable marker leading to clinical improvement. In addition, all relevant assumptions made during the analysis are summarized in Supplementary Table S4.

5.2 Retinal Toxicity

Irreversible retinal damage was observed in some patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate and it is related to cumulative dosage and treatment duration. In patients of Asian descent, retinal toxicity may first be noticed outside the macula.

Risk factors for retinal damage include daily hydroxychloroquine sulfate dosages ≥ 5 mg/kg of actual body weight, durations of use greater than five years, renal impairment, use of concomitant drug products such as tamoxifen citrate, and concurrent macular disease.

Within the first year of starting hydroxychloroquine sulfate, a baseline ocular examination is recommended including best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA), an automated threshold visual field (VF) of the central 10 degrees (with retesting if an abnormality is noted), and spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT). For patients at higher risk of retinal damage, monitoring should include annual examinations which include BCVA, VF and SD-OCT. For patients without significant risk factors, annual retinal exams can usually be deferred until five years of treatment. In patients of Asian descent, it is recommended that visual field testing be performed in the central 24 degrees instead of the central 10 degrees.

If ocular toxicity is suspected, discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate and monitor the patient closely given that retinal changes and visual disturbances may progress even after cessation of therapy.

5.3 Serious Skin Reactions

Serious adverse reactions have been reported with the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate including Stevens- Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). Monitor for serious skin reactions, especially in patients receiving a drug that may also induce dermatitis. Advise patients to seek medical attention promptly if they experience signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions such as blisters on the skin, eyes, lips or in the mouth, itching or burning, with or without fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5), Adverse Reactions (6)]. Discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate if these severe reactions occur.

5.4 Worsening of Psoriasis

Administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in patients with psoriasis may precipitate a severe flare-up of psoriasis. Administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in patients with porphyria may exacerbate porphyria. Avoid hydroxychloroquine sulfate in patients with psoriasis unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the possible risk.

### Association between hydroxychloroquine intake and damage to the outer nuclear layer in eyes without manifest retinal toxicity [^111grYcW]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For numerous years, the medical community has recognized the potential retinal toxicity linked to chloroquine (CQ) and its analog hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Physicians from diverse specialties have integrated HCQ into the treatment of various conditions, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, in addition to exploring broader uses such as diabetes mellitus management. Despite its relatively low cost and favorable safety profile compared to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), retinal toxicity remains a recognized adverse outcome associated with the prolonged use of HCQ. Several factors contribute to an increased risk of retinal toxicity, including extended use (> 5 years), a higher cumulative dose, exceeding the recommended daily dose based on real or ideal body weight, concurrent use of tamoxifen, specific cytochrome P450 gene variations, and preexisting retinal, hepatic, or renal conditions. Prolonged HCQ intake may lead to retinopathy, which is characterized by damage to the parafoveal retina. Cessation of the drug does not arrest the progression of retinopathy or restore vision. Remarkably, patients exhibiting HCQ retinopathy displayed sustained retinal damage on optical coherence tomography (OCT) for more than 3 years following discontinuation of the drug.

### Evaluation of risk factors for retinal damage due to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine [^115X5V34]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To evaluate risk factors for retinal damage due to the intake of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.

Methods

In a retrospective chart review, patients receiving or having received one of the drugs were classified as affected by maculopathy or retinopathy, or as not affected on the basis of the documented findings. Uncertain cases were excluded. The risk factors as postulated by the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and additional factors like diagnosis of underlying disease, total dose, nicotine abuse and the sum of the AAO risk factors were compared between both groups.

Results

51 patients with a history of or ongoing treatment with chloroquine (23 individuals) or hydroxychloroquine (28 individuals) were included. Most of the postulated risk factors were expectedly elevated in the affected group. Significant differences applied to age, duration of intake and the sum of AAO risk factors. Surprisingly, positive smoking history was more frequent in the not affected. The toxic threshold of the daily chloroquine dose was exceeded by most of the patients.

Conclusions

Age and the duration of intake are major risk factors. Smoking seems to be negligible. The sum of AAO risk factors can give an estimation of the individual risk profile. Individual and weight-adapted dosing is especially essential for chloroquine.

### The impact of different algorithms for ideal body weight on screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in women [^115mRxAb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

This study has limitations. Not all algorithms for IBW were included in the analysis and men were not analyzed. Algorithms not published in the ophthalmic literature were excluded. This should not be a major drawback in practice. No case of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in a man was reported in a review of 47 cases from 1960–2005. The statistics for prevalence of potentially toxic dosing using the various algorithms were derived from retrospectively collected data at a single center. They were in broad agreement with earlier published statistics from a separate center. It is possible that a broader sample of centers, and prospectively collected data, would lead to different outcomes. However, even if the actual outcomes were to differ, the nature of the analysis would not, and the issues raised herein are clinically important and previously unaddressed. Until prospectively collected multicenter data are gathered, the concepts discussed here may be useful to clinicians screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, and may reduce the incidence of this frequently preventable iatrogenic condition.

### Temporal trends in glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in Sweden [^116pSsPV]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous disease with a variable course involving multiple organs and requiring different and dynamic treatments. Treatment guidelines have been updated over time as more evidence on treatment effectiveness and safety has accumulated. Acknowledging the increased risk of organ damage associated with long-term use of glucocorticoids (GC), the 2019 update of EULAR guidelines recommended a maximum daily dose of 7.5 mg prednisolone-equivalent GC, which was recently updated to a maximum of 5 mg. In general, GC should only be used during periods of increased disease activity and, when possible, be reduced or discontinued. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is recommended for all patients with SLE, considering the individual's risk for flares and retinal toxicity. However, it is not well understood to what extent new guidelines have led to changes in SLE treatment in practice. Immunosuppressants (IS) and more recently biologic agents are also important options to be considered to control the disease and facilitate GC tapering/discontinuation.

In addition, it is important not to overlook the ABW of the patient. If the ABW is less than the IBW, it is the ABW that should be used in assessing whether daily dosing is potentially toxic. If one uses an algorithm that yields a smaller IBW at a given height, there will be fewer patients in whom a concern exists that ABW is less than IBW. The trade-off, however, is that one will have a higher proportion of patients who are overdosed at the typical dosage range of 400 mg/d.

The commonly quoted threshold of 6.5 mg/kg/d was originally published as the upper limit of safe dosing by Mackenzie, because in his experience with > 900 patients he had never witnessed toxicity if dosing based on ABW stayed below this level. He also reported the mean daily dosing based on ABW in eight patients taking hydroxychloroquine who developed retinopathy. This value was 7.77 mg/kg/d. He then weighed 544 women with rheumatoid arthritis and reported that 14% of them, given the usual 400 mg/d dose of hydroxychloroquine, would exceed the toxic dose threshold based on ABW. The ABW below which usual dosing of 400 mg/d would exceed this toxic threshold was therefore 114.3 pounds (52.0 kg). In our data set, using this ABW cut-off point, 8.3% of women exceeded this toxic threshold. However, since Mackenzie's time, there have now been multiple reported cases of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in patients who developed retinopathy despite taking less than 6.5 mg/kg/d based on IBW, not ABW. Therefore, 6.5 mg/kg/d based on IBW has been transformed from the threshold for safe dosing to the threshold for toxic dosing. Mackenzie's own toxic threshold based on IBW, 8.39 mg/kg/d, is now considered to be set too high. That is, the daily dosing threshold for toxicity has been lowered as more experience has been gained.

Acute, subacute, and chronic cutaneous lupus — mild, ongoing, skin‑predominant disease despite hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and/or topical therapy — "we conditionally recommend adding quinacrine or switching to chloroquine over adding an immunosuppressive agent". Supporting context states "Change in antimalarial therapy is a common dermatology practice, as it may improve mild rash without the need for more aggressive therapy", and "Quinacrine is not associated with increased retinopathy risk and is available through compounding pharmacies at variable cost; addition of quinacrine is preferred over a switch to chloroquine, given that chloroquine has a higher risk for retinal toxicity than HCQ". If chloroquine is chosen, "we suggest every 4–6-month retinal monitoring (Table 5)" and "Chloroquine is an option in patients without major risk factors for retinopathy (Table 5), with the intention to change back to HCQ when rash is better controlled".

### Rapid onset of retinal toxicity from high-dose hydroxychloroquine given for cancer therapy [^115s9gYG]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report rapid onset of retinal toxicity in a series of patients followed on high-dose (1000 mg daily) hydroxychloroquine during an oncologic clinical trial studying hydroxychloroquine with erlotinib for non-small cell lung cancer.

Design

Retrospective observational case series.

Methods

Ophthalmic surveillance was performed on patients in a multicenter clinical trial testing high-dose (1000 mg daily) hydroxychloroquine for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The US Food & Drug Administration-recommended screening protocol included only visual acuity testing, dilated fundus examination, Amsler grid testing, and color vision testing. In patients seen at Stanford, additional sensitive screening procedures were added at the discretion of the retinal physician: high-resolution spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, Humphrey visual field (HVF) testing, and multifocal electroretinography (mfERG).

Results

Out of the 7 patients having exposure of at least 6 months, 2 developed retinal toxicity (at 11 and 17 months of exposure). Damage was identified by OCT imaging, mfERG testing, and, in 1 case, visual field testing. Fundus autofluorescence imaging remained normal. Neither patient had symptomatic visual acuity loss.

Conclusions

These cases show that high doses of hydroxychloroquine can initiate the development of retinal toxicity within 1–2 years. Although synergy with erlotinib is theoretically possible, there are no prior reports of erlotinib-associated retinal toxicity despite over a decade of use in oncology. These results also suggest that sensitive retinal screening tests should be added to ongoing and future clinical trials involving high-dose hydroxychloroquine to improve safety monitoring and preservation of vision.

### Somatotype, the risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, and safe daily dosing guidelines [^113nKe8B]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine whether somatotype influences the risk of hydroxychloroquine (HC) retinopathy (HCR) and whether dosing by real body weight (RBW), ideal body weight (IBW), or the lesser of these better predicts the risk of HCR.

Patients and Methods

A total of 565 patients taking HC for whom height and weight were recorded and a sensitive ancillary testing modality was used including 10–2 visual fields, spectral domain optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence imaging, and multifocal electroretinography were enrolled. Body mass index (BMI) was compared for patients without and with HCR. Logistic regression models of age, cumulative dose, and daily dosing based on RBW, IBW, or lesser of these were compared. Area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic plots was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of RBW, IBW, and lesser of these guidelines for safe dosing. Probability plots for the risk of retinopathy versus BMI were compared for the different recommended guidelines on safe dosing.

Results

A total of 41 patients had HCR. The median BMI was 27.6 (interquartile range [IQR] 24.3, 32.6) and 24.0 (IQR 21.0, 31.6) for patients without and with HCR (P = 0.0102), respectively. AUC for univariate receiver operating characteristic plots of retinopathy versus dosing by RBW, IBW, and lesser of these was 0.71, 0.72, and 0.76, respectively. AUC for multivariate receiver operating characteristic plots of retinopathy versus models incorporating gender, age, cumulative dose, and BMI and differing by including dosing by RBW, IBW, and lesser of these was 0.82, 0.82, and 0.83, respectively. For all of the multivariate logistic models, the risk of retinopathy was higher for lower BMIs.

Conclusion

Short, asthenic women are at higher risk for HCR. The 2011 American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) guidelines are safer for short, obese women. The 2016 AAO guidelines are safer for short, asthenic patients. Choosing daily dosing based on the lesser of the RBW and IBW guidelines is safer for all patients.

### Retinal toxicity in a multinational inception cohort of patients with systemic lupus on hydroxychloroquine [^114oWNvE]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Over follow-up, in addition to the 11 patients with retinal toxicity, another 420 patients stopped HCQ during follow-up. Only 68 patients stopped HCQ in the first 5 years of follow-up (including three in the first year of follow-up), and these were about equally distributed between North American centres (N = 32, 47.1% of 68) and other jurisdictions (N = 36, 52.9% of 68). Table 2 indicates the age, sex, and race/ethnicity of those who stopped or did not stop HCQ at any time during follow-up, suggesting fairly similar baseline demographics in these two groups.

Table 2
Characteristics of patients continuing or stopping HCQ during follow-up

In the Kaplan-Meier curves (figure 1), the crude probability of retinal toxicity was less than 1% until around 10 years of cumulative HCQ use. Figure 1 suggests that the risk of retinal toxicity appeared to increase over time, particularly for patients using HCQ doses above the recommendation (> 5 mg/kg). However, follow-up beyond 10 years was available in only a handful of patients (31 in the group < 5 mg/kg and 30 in the group > 5 mg/kg). Thus, we cannot comment on the statistical significance of differences in outcomes for these two groups.

Figure 1
Kaplan-Meier curves for retinal toxicity at two HCQ mean daily dose levels. HCQ, hydroxychloroquine.

Our hazards regression analyses (table 3) identified that the unadjusted risk of retinal toxicity increased with the age at SLE diagnosis. Non-significant trends for greater risk were observed for those using higher daily HCQ doses, in males and in black patients. None of the patients with retinal toxicity lived in Asia, were currently smoking, had renal damage or had used CQ.

### Guideline for the diagnosis, treatment and long-term management of cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^117Mzjw5]. Journal of Autoimmunity (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cutaneous lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to antimalarial agents, AADV/ADA/CSD 2021 guidelines recommend to administer hydroxychloroquine at a daily dose of ≤ 5 mg/kg real bodyweight or chloroquine at a daily dose of ≤ 2.3 mg/kg real bodyweight in order to avoid the risk of irreversible retinopathy. Do not administer a combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine with chloroquine.

### Hydroxychloroquine-related retinal toxicity [^1147Xbnh]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

HCQ is widely used for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, particularly lupus and RA. It is generally well tolerated, but retinopathy is a concern. Retinopathy is rare, but is sight threatening, generally irreversible and may progress even after cessation of therapy. Damage may be subclinical. Although a number of risk factors have been proposed (such as duration of therapy and cumulative dose), the many exceptions (e.g. retinopathy on low-dose HCQ, or no retinopathy after a very large cumulative dose of HCQ) highlight our limited understanding of the disease process. Novel technologies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) may provide the earliest structural and functional evidence of toxicity in these stages. Along with the well-established technique of central visual field testing (10–2 visual fields), these modalities are increasingly being used as part of screening programmes. The ideal single test with high sensitivity and high specificity for HCQ retinopathy has still not been achieved. Screening for HCQ retinopathy remains an area of considerable debate, including issues of when, who and how to screen. Commonly accepted risk factors include receiving > 6.5 mg/kg/day or a cumulative dose of > 1000 g of HCQ, being on treatment for > 5 years, having renal or liver dysfunction, having pre-existing retinopathy and being elderly. HCQ continues to be a valuable drug in treating rheumatic disease, but clinicians need to be aware of the associated risks and to have arrangements in place that would enable early detection of toxicity.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for systemic lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to surveillance for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, RCOphth 2020 guidelines recommend to discontinue monitoring for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy if patients stop taking hydroxychloroquine (due to retinal toxicity or for other reasons).

### Toxic retinopathy with hydroxychloroquine therapy… [^111o4Mbp]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Because hydroxychloroquine distributes poorly in fatty tissues, 6 it was suggested earlier7, 8 that dosage should be calculated by ideal body weight to reduce the theoretical risk of overdosing obese patients. A daily dose of 6. 5 mg/kg of ideal body weight has been generally recommended based on studies7, 8 that found few cases of severe retinal toxicity below
6. 5 mg/kg of real body weight, but this value has never been evaluated to our knowledge. Because we are reporting only on aggregate data obtained by medical record reviews, informed consent from individual patients was not deemed necessary by the institutional review board. Patients using an intermediate amount of 4. 0 to
5. 0 mg/kg had risk of less than 2% within the first 10 years of use but almost 20% risk after 20 years.

These medication use values are based on pharmacy dispensing information and were on average approximately 20% lower than the prescribed dosage because of variable patient compliance. Figure 3C shows more directly the continuous interaction of use and duration of use in determining the prevalence of retinal toxicity. No dosage is completely safe, but regulation of either factor will greatly reduce the risk from the other. Our data show that, although no hydroxychloroquine use is completely safe, the risk of retinal toxicity can be kept low with careful dosage adjustment and with shorter periods of use. However, the risk rises markedly with concurrent kidney disease, and the prevalence can exceed 50% with use above 5. 0 mg/kg and with duration beyond 20 years. The empirical use limit of 5. 0 mg/kg of real body weight that we suggest should be sufficiently high to provide medical relief for most patients because it is in fact equivalent to the current dosing recommendation of
6.

5 mg/kg of ideal body weight for patients of ordinary habitus9, and most of our patients were being maintained medically on less than 5. 0 mg/kg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate. However, it will be incumbent on physicians to consider compliance in the prescription of this drug. Maintaining daily use at 5. 0 mg/kg or less would keep both the cumulative risk and annual risk of retinal toxicity low, especially for the first 10 years of use. Because hydroxychloroquine takes several months to reach stable blood levels, 19 dosing can be adjusted to weight by omitting or splitting tablets on certain days of the week.

### Hydroxychloroquine dose and the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus flares… [^1154sACr]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine prevents systemic lupus erythematosus flares and is recommended for all patients with SLE. 1 However, its long-term toxicity includes retinopathy, particularly at doses greater than 5 mg/kg per day. 2 This dose-dependent risk led to 2016 ophthalmology guidelines3 and subsequent rheumatology recommendations1 to avoid prescribing hydroxychloroquine doses greater than 5 mg/kg per day. We assessed the association of this dose threshold on lupus flares. There were 308 case periods, including 141 moderate or severe flare periods, and 420 control periods. The adjusted OR for any lupus flare associated with taking hydroxychloroquine doses of 5 mg/kg per day or less vs more than 5 mg/kg per day was 1. 98 and for moderate or severe lupus flares the AOR was 6.
04.

The corresponding AORs were similar across subgroups but only reached significance for patients with baseline SLEDAI scores of 4 or less. The smoothed dose OR curve indicated an apparent threshold near 5 mg/kg per day of hydroxychloroquine for an increased risk of flares. In this case-crossover study within a contemporary SLE cohort, hydroxychloroquine dosing of 5 mg/kg per day or less, in accordance with current ophthalmology and rheumatology guidelines, was associated with a higher risk of lupus flares, including moderate or severe flares. Furthermore, the dose trend analysis also suggested an apparent threshold near 5 mg/kg per day. A recent study demonstrated that a higher risk of lupus flares was associated with any dose reduction, irrespective of the specific dose. 6 Together, these findings suggest reduced efficacy of lower hydroxychloroquine dosing for lupus disease activity, particularly around doses of 5 mg/kg per day or less.

Study limitations include the retrospective study design and the lack of information on medication adherence within each period. Additionally, this study used an academic medical center cohort, and future studies should replicate these findings in diverse settings.

### Retinal toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine: risk factors, screening, and progression despite cessation of therapy… [^112Fjqrp]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

It was hoped that the chemical modification of chloroquine to hydroxychloroquine would abrogate its retinal toxicity. However, while the toxicity is no doubt significantly reduced, the risk is still present and poses a significant clinical challenge. 3–5 Several risk factors have been identified that may increase the likelihood of hydroxychloroquine-related retinal toxicity: daily dosage exceeding 6. 5 mg/kg, obesity. Cumulative dosage was calculated using available information as to years of therapy and total daily dosage. Inherent assumptions included 100% adherence and that the reported/documented length of use was rounded to the nearest year. In patients in whom the daily dosage of hydroxychloroquine could be estimated, when using actual body weight, 8 were taking 6. 5 mg/kg or less and 4 were taking more than this dosage. However, if lean body weight was calculated for all patients, 3 were taking 6.

5 mg/kg or less and 9 were taking more than this recommended dosage. In 1 of these 3 patients, the daily dosage based on actual weight was greater than 6. 5 mg/kg; it exceeded this recommended maximum in 2 of these patients based on lean body weight. When the daily dosage based on actual weight was calculated for the remaining 9 of 10 patients taking hydroxychloroquine alone without evidence of progression, it was greater than 6. 5 mg/kg in 3 of these patients. The dosage exceeded this recommended maximum in 7 of these patients based on lean body weight. One of the most important appears to be dosage, with daily intake believed to be more significant than cumulative dosage. 6, 18, 19 Indeed, the majority of cases of retinal toxicity have been associated with a daily dosage of hydroxychloroquine of 6. 5 mg/kg or more.

6, 18, 19 Of the 12 patients in our series who were receiving hydroxychloroquine for whom daily dosage could be calculated, we identified 8 patients who had developed retinal toxicity despite daily dosages below this recommended threshold. 6, 18 The guidelines produced by the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the Royal.

### Association of hydroxychloroquine use with retinopathy… [^115EWKDz]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance The inner retina appears not to be involved in hydroxychloroquine-induced retinopathy to any clinically relevant degree within the limitations of our sample size. No clinically apparent warning of outer retinal damage was seen in the SD-OCT images of long-term hydroxychloroquine users until the actual appearance of focal retinopathy. Early detection of hydroxychloroquine-induced retinopathy is known to prevent visual acuity loss and serious progression after the therapy is stopped, and these data suggest that screening should seek distinct new areas of retinopathy rather than long-term progressive thinning. We reported recently that inner retinal thickness was identical between mild and severe stages of hydroxychloroquine toxic effects, and it was stable after stopping the therapy. 6 That previous study used a Stanford pixel-by-pixel segmentation paradigm that adjusts for outer retinal disease.

However, important questions remain about whether any damage to the inner or outer retina might begin during hydroxychloroquine use before retinopathy develops and, more critically, whether the outer retina shows any gradual changes that would be warning signs of impending retinopathy. The only significant difference between these groups was in the mean initial daily hydroxychloroquine sulfate dosage per kilogram, which was 5. 6 mg for the short-term users and

1. 2 mg less for the long-term users. The lower average dose in the long-term group came mostly from 3 individuals and may have contributed to their treatment longevity, but the long-term users were still at much greater risk to show toxic effect than patients in the short-term group. 12 The difference in doses was not statistically significant during the follow-up period because some high initial hydroxychloroquine doses were lowered.

The CGCA measurements showed extremely stable values over time in all regions, except for 1 outlying point at the final visit of patient 136. However, this value is actually an error resulting from incorrect retinal segmentation by the CGCA software. Nonetheless, the development of confirmable signs of toxic effects seems to require 1 to 2 years, which supports recommendations for annual routine screening and retesting borderline abnormalities before stopping treatment with a useful medication. 12, 19 Patient 136 was diagnosed as having retinopathy at a relatively early stage before any retinal pigment epithelium damage and thus is not likely to be at risk for foveal damage or a loss of visual acuity. 18.
