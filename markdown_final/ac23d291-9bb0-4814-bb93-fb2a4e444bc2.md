## Question

How should hyponatremia (Na 133) be managed in a patient with uncontrolled diabetes (A1c 8%) and liver cirrhosis secondary to NASH?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage mild hyponatremia (Na 133 mEq/L) in a patient with uncontrolled diabetes (A1c 8%) and NASH-related cirrhosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypotonic hyponatremia and correcting serum sodium for hyperglycemia. Then, I should verify volume status and likely etiology in cirrhosis. Next, I'll stratify severity and symptoms to decide urgency. After that, I will identify and remove contributing factors. I will then implement cirrhosis-appropriate conservative therapy and set safe correction targets with monitoring and rescue strategies. Finally, I'll integrate diabetes management considerations and cirrhosis-specific risks, and summarize a practical plan.

> Let me first confirm whether this is true hypotonic hyponatremia and not a laboratory artifact or translocational effect from hyperglycemia; I need to check serum osmolality, measure serum glucose, correct the measured sodium for glucose using the conventional correction factor (about +1.6 mEq/L per 100 mg/dL glucose above 100), and consider pseudohyponatremia from hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia, because with an A1c of 8% the patient may have episodic hyperglycemia that lowers measured sodium without true hypotonicity, meaning a measured Na of 133 mEq/L could normalize to about 135 mEq/L if glucose is near 200 mg/dL, which would substantially change management and urgency [^113g8d3Y].

> Hold on, let me verify the clinical context and volume status because the management pathway diverges; in NASH-related cirrhosis the most likely pattern is hypervolemic hyponatremia due to portal hypertension with splanchnic vasodilation and nonosmotic vasopressin secretion, so I should examine for ascites, edema, and low effective arterial blood volume, and I should check urine sodium and osmolality since a urine sodium ≤ 30 mmol/L supports low effective arterial volume while diuretics can confound this signal, and urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg indicates impaired free water excretion, all of which would steer me toward water restriction and cirrhosis-specific measures rather than SIADH algorithms [^111Sj5ax] [^115Bfw9m] [^1121fSgV].

> I need to stratify severity and symptoms to avoid overreacting; a sodium of 133 mEq/L is mild chronic hyponatremia in most schemas, and if the patient is asymptomatic or has only mild symptoms, aggressive therapy is not indicated, whereas hypertonic saline is reserved for severe biochemical derangements or significant neurologic symptoms, so I should confirm the absence of moderate to severe symptoms before proceeding conservatively [^113RUmSC] [^115kY957] [^114hpGSU].

> Wait, let me check for iatrogenic or reversible contributors; I should review diuretic exposure and consider holding thiazides entirely, optimizing the loop/aldosterone antagonist regimen only if ascites control demands it, and discontinue or reduce drugs that potentiate vasopressin action such as SSRIs, NSAIDs, and opioids where clinically feasible, because removing provocations often corrects mild hyponatremia without further intervention, and I should concurrently address hyperglycemia since better glycemic control can remove a translocational component and reduce nonosmotic AVP drive in this cirrhotic patient [^112uhRxs] [^111uF9EA] [^113Mdnha].

> Next, I should implement first-line conservative measures tailored to cirrhosis; advising water restriction is appropriate in mild, asymptomatic hyponatremia in cirrhosis, though I need to set a pragmatic target the patient can adhere to and recognize fluid restriction alone is often modestly effective in cirrhosis compared with SIADH, with registry data showing only small daily sodium increases under fluid restriction, so expectation management and close follow-up are key [^113RUmSC] [^113MJDb8].

> I was about to suggest albumin now, but wait, I should verify indications; albumin infusion is favored when hyponatremia is severe or in specific cirrhosis contexts such as post–large-volume paracentesis to improve effective arterial volume and suppress vasopressin, whereas at Na 133 mEq/L routine albumin is not generally indicated unless the sodium worsens or a paracentesis context arises, so I will defer albumin and reassess dynamically [^111Sj5ax] [^112Rw182].

> I should confirm whether vaptans have a role; in cirrhosis, vasopressin receptor antagonists can raise serum sodium but responses are often blunted, risks of overcorrection are real, and guidance recommends using them cautiously, short term only, and generally avoiding them unless a short bridging need exists, so at Na 133 mEq/L with no significant symptoms, I should not reach for tolvaptan and instead prioritize conservative measures and careful monitoring [^116SV8Hu] [^114dznuh] [^11653Q73].

> Now I need to set safe correction targets and monitoring because cirrhosis confers very high ODS risk with overcorrection; my aim should be a minimum daily rise of about 4–6 mEq/L with a hard cap of 8 mEq/L in any 24 hours in advanced liver disease, and if inadvertent overcorrection occurs or a brisk water diuresis emerges, I should be prepared to relower sodium with desmopressin and hypotonic fluid while monitoring closely, keeping in mind laboratory imprecision that can mask a 10 mEq/L rise as 8 mEq/L on reports and justifying conservative targets [^113tJkYu] [^1164gdyE] [^115yzmgu].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring logistics; given the mild degree at baseline, frequent checks every 12–24 hours may suffice initially if clinically stable, but if any active therapy is initiated or the sodium begins to change rapidly, I should increase the frequency to every 4–6 hours and track urine output to detect emerging aquaresis early, ideally managing any escalation in a setting where close biochemical monitoring is possible [^117YPJ9F] [^115yzmgu].

> Let me consider the interplay with diabetes management in cirrhosis; optimizing glycemic control should reduce translocational hyponatremia and improve overall outcomes, and in compensated cirrhosis, metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists can be considered with careful monitoring for volume effects and renal function, while avoiding sulfonylureas given hypoglycemia risk and using insulin thoughtfully, because diabetes also increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis, which strengthens the case for coordinated metabolic control [^115jUZcd] [^114SQ3pV].

> But wait, what about prognosis at this sodium level; even mild hyponatremia in cirrhosis associates with more severe ascites and higher complication rates such as encephalopathy and renal dysfunction, so I should treat Na 133 mEq/L as a relevant risk signal rather than dismiss it, integrate it into overall risk assessment, and consider its trajectory over time [^117CAZaW].

> Finally, let me summarize and ensure internal consistency; first, I will verify true hypotonic hyponatremia by checking serum osmolality and correcting sodium for glucose while excluding pseudohyponatremia, second, I will confirm hypervolemic physiology from cirrhosis clinically and with urine studies, third, given Na 133 mEq/L and no significant symptoms, I will pursue conservative therapy with water restriction, removal of provocations, and optimized glycemic control rather than hypertonic saline or vaptans, fourth, I will cap any correction to ≤ 8 mEq/L per 24 hours in this high-risk cirrhosis context with readiness to relower using desmopressin and hypotonic fluid if needed, and fifth, I will monitor sodium trends and urine output, reserving albumin for worsening hyponatremia or post-paracentesis scenarios, all while reassessing volume status and symptoms at each step so I do not miss a change that warrants escalation [^113Mdnha] [^111Sj5ax] [^113RUmSC] [^113tJkYu] [^115yzmgu].

For a patient with hyponatremia at 133 mmol/L, uncontrolled diabetes (A1c 8%), and NASH cirrhosis, the priority is to **correct for hyperglycemia** and **restrict fluids to 1–1.5 L/day** [^113Mdnha]. This sodium level is mild and often pseudo-hyponatremia from hyperglycemia; after correction, if true hyponatremia persists, manage as hypervolemic hyponatremia with fluid restriction and cautious diuretic use. Avoid rapid correction (limit to **≤ 8 mmol/L per 24 h**) to prevent osmotic demyelination, and reserve hypertonic saline or vaptans for severe or symptomatic cases only [^113tJkYu] [^112vKGeP]. Monitor sodium, glucose, and volume status closely, and address underlying liver disease and diabetes control.

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical significance

In cirrhosis, hyponatremia is **typically hypervolemic**, driven by splanchnic vasodilation, RAAS/ADH activation, and water retention. Diabetes can cause pseudo-hyponatremia via hyperglycemia-induced water shifts [^113Mdnha]. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in cirrhosis, including encephalopathy, ascites, and renal dysfunction [^117CAZaW].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnostic considerations

- **Corrected sodium calculation**: Correct measured sodium for hyperglycemia to distinguish true from pseudo-hyponatremia [^113Mdnha].

- **Volume status assessment**: Determine hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic state to guide therapy [^114Mg1Pm].

- **Laboratory evaluation**: Check serum/urine osmolality, urine sodium, and glucose to clarify etiology [^113Mdnha] [^113g8d3Y].

---

## Management strategies

### General principles

- **Fluid restriction**: First-line for hypervolemic hyponatremia; restrict to 1–1.5 L/day.

- **Diuretic management**: Use cautiously; avoid over-diuresis and monitor renal function.

- **Sodium correction rate**: Limit to ≤ 8 mmol/L per 24 h to avoid osmotic demyelination [^113tJkYu].

---

### Specific considerations in cirrhosis

- **Hypertonic saline**: Reserve for severe symptomatic hyponatremia or imminent transplantation; correct slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L/day) [^112vKGeP].

- **Albumin infusion**: Consider in hypervolemic hyponatremia to improve effective arterial volume [^112Rw182].

- **Vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans)**: Use cautiously and short-term (≤ 30 days) due to liver toxicity risk [^116SV8Hu].

---

### Specific considerations in diabetes mellitus

In diabetes mellitus, **optimize glycemic control** to reduce hyperglycemia-related pseudo-hyponatremia and osmotic shifts, and **review medications** to avoid thiazide diuretics and sulfonylureas while considering metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, or GLP-1 receptor agonists if liver function allows.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Check serum sodium **every 4–6 hours initially**, then daily once stable. Monitor glucose frequently to prevent rapid osmotic shifts, and assess volume status regularly with daily weights.

---

## Potential complications and risks

Avoid rapid correction (> **8 mmol/L/24 h**) to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome [^113tJkYu]. Monitor closely for hepatic encephalopathy, as diabetes increases the risk [^114SQ3pV]. Monitor renal function, especially if diuretics are used.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice. Management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with this syndrome are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the state of management of hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in diverse hospital settings. It specifically examined which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

- **Methods**: The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1,524 adult patients with [Na(+)] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1,034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined syndrome via measurement of relevant laboratory parameters was also analyzed.

- **Results**: The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for a

Analytical limitations of serum sodium measurements must also be considered when setting correction goals and limits. Due to unavoidable imprecision, a laboratory report indicating that the serum sodium has increased by 8 mmol/L might, in reality, reflect an increase of 10 mmol/L. For that reason, when planning therapy, the targeted rate of correction should not be too close to rates that can result in patient harm.

- **Administration of desmopressin**: A synthetic antidiuretic hormone, desmopressin, either after or in anticipation of a water diuresis, has been used to reverse or prevent inadvertent excessive correction of hyponatremia. Both the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel suggest that relowering of the serum sodium should be considered if correction limits have been exceeded. However, the approach should depend on the relative risks of injury from excessive correction.

- **Relowering serum sodium**: The strongest case for relowering the serum sodium to prevent osmotic demyelination can be made in patients at very high risk of developing the disorder (those with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L or patients with heavy alcohol use, severe hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease). It would be reasonable to relower the serum sodium in such patients if it has increased by > 8 mmol/L in < 24 hours. On the other hand, patients who have rapidly become hyponatremic due to self-induced water intoxication related to psychosis or endurance exercise often develop a spontaneous water diuresis that rapidly brings the serum sodium back to normal.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. Report of the hyponatremia registry [^113MJDb8]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Management practices for hyponatremia (HN) are incompletely understood. The HN Registry has recorded diagnostic measures, utilization, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic or hypervolemic HN. To better understand these practices, we analyzed data from 3,087 adjudicated adult patients in the registry with serum sodium concentration of 130 mEq/L or less from 225 sites in the United States and European Union. Common initial monotherapy treatments were fluid restriction (35%), administration of isotonic saline (15%) or hypertonic saline (2%), and tolvaptan (5%); 17% received no active agent.

Median (interquartile range) serum sodium increases during the first day were as follows: no treatment, 1.0 (0.0–4.0) mEq/L; fluid restriction, 2.0 (0.0–4.0) mEq/L; isotonic saline, 3.0 (0.0–5.0) mEq/L; hypertonic saline, 5.0 (1.0–9.0) mEq/L; and tolvaptan, 4.0 (2.0–9.0) mEq/L. Adjusting for initial serum sodium concentration with logistic regression, the relative likelihoods for correction by 5 mEq/L or more (referent, fluid restriction) were 1.60 for hypertonic saline and 2.55 for tolvaptan.

At discharge, serum sodium concentration was under 135 mEq/L in 78% of patients and 130 mEq/L or less in 49%. Overly rapid correction occurred in 7.9% of patients. Thus, initial HN treatment often uses maneuvers of limited efficacy. Despite an association with poor outcomes and the availability of effective therapy, most patients with HN are discharged from hospitals still hyponatremic. Studies to assess short- and long-term benefits of correction of HN with effective therapies are needed.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis: Short of evidence, plenty of potential [^115jUZcd]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Low credibility.

Treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in patients with compensated cirrhosis is challenging due to hypoglycemic risk, altered pharmacokinetics, and the lack of robust evidence on the risk/benefit ratio of various drugs. Suboptimal glycemic control accelerates the progression of cirrhosis, while the frequent coexistence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with T2D highlights the need for a multifactorial therapeutic approach.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed in Medline, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases until July 2023, using relevant keywords to extract studies regarding the management of T2D in patients with compensated cirrhosis.

- **Results**: Metformin, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are promising treatment options for patients with T2D and compensated liver cirrhosis. These options offer good glycemic control with minimal risk of hypoglycemia, while their pleiotropic actions confer benefits on NAFLD and body weight and decrease cardiorenal risk. Sulfonylureas cause hypoglycemia and should be avoided, while specific studies have correlated dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors with an increased risk of decompensation and variceal bleeding. Despite the benefits of thiazolidinediones in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, concerns about edema and weight gain limit their use in compensated cirrhosis. Insulin does not exert hepatotoxic effects and can be administered safely in combination with other drugs; however, the risk of hypoglycemia should be considered.

- **Conclusions**: The management of type 2 diabetes in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis requires careful consideration of the drug's risk/benefit profile due to the complexity of the condition and its associated comorbidities.

In the diagnostic investigations for hyponatremia, the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend measuring serum glucose concentration to exclude hyperglycemic hyponatremia. It is advised to correct the measured serum sodium concentration for the serum glucose concentration if the latter is increased.

Regarding the medical management of ascites, specifically concerning the management of hyponatremia, the AASLD 2021 guidelines recommend setting a goal rate of increase for serum sodium of 4–6 mEq/L per a 24-hour period (not exceeding 8 mEq/L per a 24-hour period) to reduce the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome when correcting chronic hyponatremia is indicated in patients with cirrhosis.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^112NjGpe]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

In addition to the identification of factors associated with hyponatremia correction, this study also provides valuable insights into how oral urea is currently positioned in the treatment of hyponatremia. The majority of patients first received fluid restriction, suggesting that oral urea is typically initiated as a second-line treatment, consistent with existing guidelines. When oral urea was introduced, it was usually combined with fluid restriction, which resulted in a greater increase in plasma sodium levels during the first two days of treatment.

- **Fluid restriction**: Fluid restriction was likely not highlighted in the main analysis, as it was often liberalized during treatment. Garrahy and colleagues demonstrated that the effect of fluid restriction plateaus following a few days.

- **Clinical practice relevance**: It is crucial to determine whether oral urea should always be combined with fluid restriction or if it can also be administered as a first-line treatment without fluid restriction. A previous retrospective study analyzed the effects of oral urea as a first-line treatment without fluid restriction in cancer patients with SIAD-induced hyponatremia. The correction rate in this study was indeed higher (5 mmol/L in 24 hours), potentially due to the lower baseline plasma sodium (123 mmol/L) or low solute intake in cancer patients.

- **Ambulatory study**: In another recent study, oral urea was also given without fluid restriction and produced a modest rise in plasma sodium (2 mmol/L in 7 days). This study was conducted in an ambulatory setting, where transient causes for AVP were removed.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. Report of the hyponatremia registry [^112F9YvR]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The rate of [Na +] rise with tolvaptan was more rapid than reported in clinical trials. With greater efficacy came greater risk. A [Na +] increase > 12 mEq/l per 24 h or > 18 mEq/l per 48 h, predisposing patients to the development of osmotic demyelination syndrome, was observed more often in patients receiving HS or tolvaptan compared with those receiving other treatments.

Pituitary surgery, a situation where SIADH may be transient and resolve suddenly, as well as concomitant use of desmopressin for diabetes insipidus appear to pose a particular risk for overly rapid correction when active therapies are used as well. Although well described with HS, only one case of osmotic demyelination syndrome with the use of a vasopressin-receptor antagonist as monotherapy to correct HN has been reported at the time of writing. No cases of osmotic demyelination syndrome were observed in the 5028 patients in the HN Registry.

For patients with central diabetes insipidus experiencing hypernatremia, the 2018 Society for Endocrinology guidelines recommend correcting serum sodium at a rate of 5 mmol/L in the first hour, or until symptoms improve. In cases of symptomatic hypernatremia developed within 48 hours (acute hypernatremia), correction should be limited to 10 mmol/L per 24 hours.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. Report of the hyponatremia registry [^1139a5xk]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

To assure that entry criteria were met and that the duration of hyponatremia (HN) was evaluable, data from patients who met a prespecified review threshold were subject to review by two members of the study Steering Committee. Discrepancies were resolved by a review by the Steering Committee co-chairmen. Prespecified criteria triggering adjudication are listed in Supplementary Table S4 online. Among those who failed adjudication and were excluded were:

1. Individuals stated to be euvolemic but who presented with elevated blood urea nitrogen:creatinine ratios and/or low urine [Na+] concentrations whose HN responded to administration of normal saline (NS) alone, coincident with a fall in blood urea nitrogen:creatinine ratio.

2. Individuals who were stated to be euvolemic but whose admission findings included edema or anasarca.

3. Individuals with only a single [Na+] < 130 mEq/l who did not receive active treatment for HN.

4. Patients with a qualifying episode of euvolemic or hypervolemic HN who also had a separate episode of hypovolemic HN during the same hospitalization, which would have interfered with computerized parsing of data.

### Hyponatremia: pathophysiology, classification, manifestations and management [^115vy5DK]. International Urology and Nephrology (2014). High credibility.

Hyponatremia is a condition that can be associated with a wide range of symptoms and underlying causes. It is characterized by fatigue, diuretic use, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and restlessness. Other associations include SIADH, nausea, increased water intake, ascites, and hyperproteinemia. Symptoms may extend to pulmonary edema, decreased skin turgor, increased urine sodium, altered mental status, somnolence, reduced serum sodium, and increased blood glucose. The condition can also be linked to Addison's disease, decreased urine sodium, muscle weakness, and strenuous exercise.

Additional manifestations consist of tachycardia, seizure, adrenal insufficiency, as well as a tea and toast diet and malnutrition. Hyponatremia is further associated with heart failure, metabolic acidosis, hyporeflexia, sweating, elevated serum urea, headache, and heavy beer drinking. Metabolic alkalosis, coma, cerebral edema, increased serum uric acid, vomiting, peripheral edema, and cerebral salt wasting can also occur.

Moreover, hyponatremia can lead to increased serum creatinine, orthostatic hypotension, irritability, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and complications common in the elderly such as gait disturbance and dry mucous membranes. Additional symptoms include dysarthria, chronic liver disease, muscle spasms, hyperlipidemia, crackles, hypothyroidism, burns, confusion, diarrhea, liver cirrhosis, and muscle cramps.

### Hyponatremia in cirrhosis: Results of a patient population survey [^117CAZaW]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Low serum sodium concentration is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with cirrhosis, but its prevalence and clinical significance remain unclear. To prospectively evaluate the prevalence of low serum sodium concentration and its association with the severity of ascites and complications of cirrhosis, data were collected on 997 consecutive patients from 28 centers across Europe, North and South America, and Asia over a 28-day period.

The prevalence of low serum sodium concentration, defined as serum sodium concentration ≤ 135 mmol/L, ≤ 130 mmol/L, ≤ 125 mmol/L, and ≤ 120 mmol/L, was 49.4%, 21.6%, 5.7%, and 1.2%, respectively. Notably, the prevalence of low serum sodium levels (≤ 135 mmol/L) was high among both inpatients and outpatients, recorded at 57% and 40%, respectively. The presence of serum sodium < 135 mmol/L was associated with severe ascites, as indicated by a high prevalence of refractory ascites, a large fluid accumulation rate, frequent use of large-volume paracentesis, and impaired renal function compared with normal serum sodium levels.

Moreover, low serum sodium levels were associated with a greater frequency of hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome, although not gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with serum sodium < 130 mmol/L exhibited the greatest frequency of these complications; however, the frequency also increased in patients with mild reductions in serum sodium levels (131–135 mmol/L).

In conclusion, low serum sodium levels in cirrhosis are associated with severe ascites and high complication rates.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^115pq4RC]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Subsequently, several studies confirmed that osmotic demyelination was associated with more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia. Excluding case series on the basis of patient referrals, studies of patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L that include data on correction rates and outcomes are presented in Table 1. The frequency of osmotic demyelination varied widely among studies, depending on pretreatment serum sodium, correction rate, and method of identifying post-therapeutic neurologic sequelae. However, it is apparent that in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the lower the serum sodium and the larger the increase, the more likely that osmotic demyelination will be identified.

- **Table 1**: Post-treatment neurologic sequelae in studies of patients with serum sodium concentrations ≤ 120 mmol/L

When osmotic demyelination syndrome was first described, it was widely believed that to avoid potentially fatal neurologic complications of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, it was important to rapidly raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level above 120 mmol/L and, according to some experts, to as high as 130 mmol/L. At a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, it becomes impossible to both raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level and avoid correction by > 12 mmol/L per day; a choice must be made between the risks of persistent, severe hyponatremia, and the risks of osmotic demyelination. Because a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L is uncommon, a letter was sent to all members of the American Society of Nephrology seeking data on patients with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been recently treated.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^111VoLwe]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

In a study of the safety and tolerability of oral urea, it was found that five patients (3%) experienced overcorrection of hyponatremia. This included three patients whose plasma sodium levels increased by 14 ± 1 mmol/L within 24 hours, and two patients whose plasma sodium levels increased by 24 ± 6 mmol/L over 48 hours. One case of increased plasma sodium was attributed to the development of AVP deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) following neurosurgery.

- **Observations**
- **Baseline plasma sodium**: Patients who experienced overcorrection had significantly lower baseline plasma sodium levels compared to those who did not (123 vs. 127 mmol/L, P = 0.04).
- **Oral urea dosage**: The daily oral urea dose in patients with overcorrection was similar to those without (30 g/day, IQR 30–35 vs 30 g/day, IQR 21–30, P = 0.19).
- **Response to overcorrection**: In response, oral urea and fluid restriction were discontinued in four and three patients, respectively. Three patients underwent plasma sodium relowering therapy using hypotonic fluids (n = 3) and desmopressin (n = 1).
- **No ODS cases**: No cases of suspected osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) were identified.

- **Tolerability**
- **Reported side effects**: 20 patients (12%) reported poor palatability, 10 patients (6%) experienced gastrointestinal complaints, and 1 patient (1%) reported a headache.
- **Treatment discontinuation**: Side effects led to the discontinuation of oral urea in 17 patients (11%).
- **Comparison of formulations**: Side effect incidences were similar between the two oral urea formulations (P = 0.52).

### Oral tolvaptan is safe and effective in chronic hyponatremia [^114dznuh]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Vasopressin antagonists increase the serum sodium concentration in patients who have euvolemia and hypervolemia with hyponatremia in the short term. A serum sodium level of 145 mmol/L led to discontinuation in one patient. The mean serum sodium increased from 130.8 mmol/L at baseline to over 135 mmol/L throughout the observation period (P < 0.001 versus baseline at most points). Responses were comparable between patients with euvolemia and those with heart failure, but more modest in patients with cirrhosis. In conclusion, prolonged administration of tolvaptan maintains an increased serum sodium with an acceptable margin of safety.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^114zYH9K]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH, it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and through laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to alleviate symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear.

Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures and means such as fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, and demeclocycline, with the former two being commonly used. Recently, vasopressin receptor antagonists, known as vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy for SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous for patients because there is no need for fluid restriction, and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably within a short time. Vaptans also seem beneficial for physicians and staff due to their efficiency and reliability. The side effects include thirst, polydipsia, and frequent urination.

In any therapy for chronic SIADH, it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter as higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 hours are critical for preventing overly rapid correction of hyponatremia.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^111nVwLA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. For unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Prognosis of patients with severe hyponatraemia is related not only to hyponatraemia but also to comorbidities and to medical management: results of an observational retrospective study [^111LyDnV]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Our study has certain limitations. First, the retrospective nature, imposing the study of handwritten medical records, limited the access to certain valuable information, including the final diagnosis. Secondly, plasma sodium was not corrected herein by plasma glucose as recommended, as it was difficult to retrospectively obtain blood glucose for each value of plasma sodium. Nevertheless, the low threshold value chosen to characterize severe hyponatraemia makes it unlikely that hyperglycaemia could have completely distorted the relationship between plasma sodium and osmolality. In addition, two studies found identical mortality rates with and without using the correction of osmolality by glucose. On the other hand, in the present series, the relatively limited number of patients from one single centre allowed access to the entire medical records and to correlate the prognosis with a wide variety of parameters. Thus, this is, to our knowledge, the first study demonstrating that prognosis is influenced independently by hyponatraemia itself, by comorbidity, and by medical management.

### A randomized trial of empagliflozin to increase plasma sodium levels in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^116yw39y]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

The treatment options to address the hyponatremia induced by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) are inadequate. The sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, empagliflozin, promotes osmotic diuresis via urinary glucose excretion and, therefore, might offer a novel treatment option for SIAD.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, randomized trial, we recruited 88 hospitalized patients with SIAD-induced hyponatremia (< 130 mmol/L) at the University Hospital Basel from September 2016 until January 2019 and assigned patients to receive, in addition to standard fluid restriction of < 1000 ml/24 h, a once-daily dose of oral empagliflozin or placebo for 4 days. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in plasma sodium concentration after 4 days of treatment. Secondary endpoints included predisposing factors for treatment response and the safety of the intervention.

- **Results**: Of the 87 patients who completed the trial, 43 (49%) received treatment with empagliflozin, and 44 (51%) received placebo. Baseline plasma sodium concentrations were similar for the two groups (median 125.5 mmol/L for the empagliflozin group and median 126 mmol/L for the placebo group). Patients treated with empagliflozin had a significantly higher increase of median plasma sodium concentration compared with those receiving placebo (10 versus 7 mmol/L, respectively; P = 0.04). Profound hyponatremia (< 125 mmol/L) and lower baseline osmolality levels increased the likelihood of response to treatment with empagliflozin. Treatment was well tolerated, and no events of hypoglycemia or hypotension occurred.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^111aNsKQ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

- **Patient and treatment characteristics**: We included 140 hospitalized patients who received oral urea for hyponatremia (Fig. 1). Median baseline plasma sodium was 127 mmol/L (IQR 123–130, Table 1) and ranged between 108 and 134 mmol/L (Fig. 2). The baseline urine osmolality and urine sodium concentration were 525 mOsm/kg (IQR 392–635) and 77 mmol/L (IQR 49–124), respectively [Table 1]. In 55 patients with available urine sodium and potassium, the (urine sodium + potassium)/plasma sodium ratio was > 1 in 30 (55%), indicating that they are unlikely to respond to fluid restriction alone. The most common cause of hyponatremia was SIAD (n = 130, 93%), which was most frequently associated with cancer (n = 49, 35%) [Table 1]. Other causes of hyponatremia were heart failure, thiazide diuretics, primary polydipsia, and low solute intake. Among the 140 included patients, oral urea was used on 161 separate occasions [Table 2]. Oral urea was prescribed at a starting dose of 30 g/day (IQR 22–30) for a median duration of 4 days (IQR 2–7), reaching a cumulative dose of 120 g (IQR 60–210).

In 58 (36%) of the treatment episodes, the oral urea dose was modified 116 times (53% increased, 47% decreased). Fluid restriction was started prior to oral urea in 117 treatment episodes (73%) and continued with oral urea in 104 treatment episodes (65%). Fluid restriction was modified 88 times during 58 treatment episodes (36%) and was usually loosened or discontinued (in 61% and 18% of treatment episodes, respectively). Other less common concurrent treatments included isotonic fluid.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^115XadcF]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

A consistent association between hyponatremia and increased mortality is observed. Whether this is because multimorbid patients with serious underlying conditions are prone to develop hyponatremia, or whether hyponatremia itself is an independent risk factor, is not entirely clear and needs to be clarified in properly designed intervention studies.

A 2013 meta-analysis identified 81 studies comparing death rates in patients with or without hyponatremia, including a total of more than 850,000 patients (nearly 148,000 with hyponatremia). Hyponatremia was significantly associated with an increased risk of overall mortality (relative risk [RR] 2.60; 95% CI, 2.31–2.93; P < .0001), and this was maintained after adjustment for age, sex, and diabetes mellitus. The association was relatively consistent when analyzed by individual underlying condition (heart failure, cirrhosis, pulmonary infection, myocardial infarction). There was an inverse relationship between serum sodium concentration and mortality — indicating higher risk with lower sodium concentrations. The mean difference in serum sodium between individuals who died compared to survivors was 4.8 mmol/L (pNa 130.1 vs 134.9 mmol/L), so even hyponatremia in the mild range was associated with risk. A causal relationship was not able to be established, by the nature of this analysis. The consistency associated irrespective of the underlying condition suggests that the underlying mechanism, if hyponatremia is indeed causal, is not disease-specific.

A follow-up meta-analysis by the same group in 2015 sought to clarify this association.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: Expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious but often overlooked electrolyte imbalance associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving various body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause significant morbidity and mortality due to osmotically induced cerebral edema. Additionally, excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may lead to severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination.

The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts on hyponatremia convened to develop the "Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations", defining strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. Since the publication of that document, several notable developments have emerged. These include new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients.

Therefore, additional guidance was considered necessary, and a panel of hyponatremia experts, including all original panel members, was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia, based on both consensus opinions from experts and the most recent evidence available.

### Hypertonic saline and desmopressin: a simple strategy for safe correction of severe hyponatremia [^111nqQot]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Prompt correction of severe hyponatremia is important, but correction must also be limited to avoid iatrogenic osmotic demyelination. Expert opinion recommends that serum sodium levels not be increased by more than 10–12 mEq/L in any 24-hour period and/or 18 mEq/L in any 48-hour period. However, inadvertent overcorrection is common, usually caused by the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. Report of the hyponatremia registry [^11653Q73]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

As fluid restriction (FR) was the most frequently prescribed initial therapy, we separately analyzed the course of patients after FR. A total of 922 patients (30%) with a baseline sodium level ([Na +]) < 130 mEq/l were treated with FR initially. The majority did not correct [Na +] by an increment of ≥ 5 mEq/l, and the majority of those patients received no additional treatment.

Overly rapid correction of [Na +] occurred in 7.9% of patients overall and was most likely in patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) at 10.7%, and least likely with cirrhosis at 3.6% (P < 0.001, SIADH vs. cirrhosis). Of patients who received no active therapy, 1.4% experienced overly rapid correction. Compared with no therapy, the relative risk (95% confidence interval) for overly rapid correction was 1.6 (0.70–3.57) for FR, 2.35 (0.97–5.65) for normal saline (NS), 12.01 (5.14–28.04) for hypertonic saline (HS), and 8.57 (3.84–19.12) for tolvaptan. Overall, 17.1% of patients receiving HS and 10.8% of patients receiving tolvaptan monotherapy at any time experienced overly rapid correction, which was similar to the results for initial treatment responses.

Included among the overly rapid correction episodes with active therapy is one episode with HS and two with tolvaptan in patients who were also receiving variable doses of desmopressin to treat diabetes insipidus post-parasellar surgery. A further six episodes with tolvaptan occurred after suprasellar or pituitary procedures alone. In total, six of these postoperative cases occurred at a single center. The group with the lowest starting [Na +] was at the greatest risk for overly rapid correction.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^1166gUQF]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

A prospective cohort study from the Netherlands, involving nearly 3,000 hospitalized patients with available sodium measurements over a 3-month period, found that 30% had a recorded sodium level below 136 mmol/L during their admission. A larger Danish prospective study of more than 250,000 inpatients reported that 15% had serum sodium of less than 135 mmol/L at admission. Larger retrospective database studies from Singapore, the United States, and China support this range, with reported rates of sodium less than 135 mmol/L between 14.5% and 28.2%. An outlying US study of nearly 200,000 patients reported only 5.5% had hyponatremia; however, this study employed stricter criteria, requiring two sodium concentrations below 135 mmol/L within 24 hours of admission, which would not capture those with transient initial hyponatremia, only a single result, or hyponatremia that developed later during the hospital stay. Rates of profound hyponatremia are lower, with approximately 2% of patients recording sodium concentrations at or below 125 mmol/L.

There are specific patient subgroups with a higher risk of moderate-profound hyponatremia; for example, following pituitary surgery, a meta-analysis showed 5.6% of cases develop symptomatic hyponatremia. Large database studies may fail to account for factors that can influence the accuracy of sodium measurements. Although many studies seek to exclude translocational hyponatremia due to increased serum glucose, causes of pseudohyponatremia, such as increased serum lipids or proteins, can complicate accurate assessment.

### Hyponatremia in the context of liver disease [^117HWaGN]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in patients with liver disease and is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and a reduced quality of life. In liver transplantation, the inclusion of hyponatremia in organ allocation scores has reduced waitlist mortality. Portal hypertension and the resulting lowering of the effective arterial blood volume are important pathogenetic factors, but in most patients with liver disease, hyponatremia is multifactorial.

Treatment requires a multifaceted approach that tries to reduce electrolyte-free water intake, restore urinary dilution, and increase nonelectrolyte solute excretion. Albumin therapy for hyponatremia is a peculiarity of advanced liver disease. Its use appears to be increasing, while the vaptans are currently only given in selected cases. Osmotic demyelination is a special concern in patients with liver disease. Serial checks of serum sodium concentrations and urine volume monitoring are mandatory.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^112sQu88]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

Oral urea is being used more commonly to treat hyponatremia, but factors contributing to the correction rate are unknown. We hypothesized that clinically relevant factors can be identified to help guide hyponatremia correction with oral urea.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study in two university hospitals including hospitalized patients with hyponatremia (plasma sodium < 135 mmol/L) treated with oral urea. Linear mixed-effects models were used to identify factors associated with hyponatremia correction. Rates of overcorrection, osmotic demyelination, and treatment discontinuation were also assessed.

- **Results**: We included 161 urea treatment episodes in 140 patients (median age 69 years, 46% females, 93% syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis). Oral urea succeeded fluid restriction in 117 treatment episodes (73%), was combined with fluid restriction in 104 treatment episodes (65%), and was given as the only treatment in 27 treatment episodes (17%). A median dose of 30 g/day of urea for 4 days (interquartile range 2–7 days) increased plasma sodium from 127 to 134 mmol/L and normalized hyponatremia in 47% of treatment episodes. Older age (β 0.09, 95% CI 0.02–0.16), lower baseline plasma sodium (β -0.65, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.62), and higher cumulative urea dose (β 0.03, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.03) were independently associated with a greater rise in plasma sodium. Fluid restriction was associated with a greater rise in plasma sodium only during the first 48 hours of treatment (β 1.81, 95% CI 0.40–3.08). Overcorrection occurred in 5 cases (3%); no cases of osmotic demyelination were reported.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^116JUkNn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

After weighing the evidence, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that the correction of hyponatremia be limited to 10 mmol/L in the first day of treatment and 8 mmol/L for every subsequent day thereafter. An expert panel, which included six physicians from the United States and one from Ireland (referred to as the "US/Irish expert panel"), reached similar conclusions but added some nuances.

For chronically hyponatremic patients with a sodium level ≤ 120 mmol/L — such as outpatients consuming conventional volumes of water or those treated with thiazides and hospital-acquired hyponatremia with a known duration of over 48 hours — who are at normal risk of developing osmotic demyelination, the panel recommended a correction limit of 10–12 mmol/L within any 24-hour period and 18 mmol/L over any 48-hour period. They also suggested a minimum correction of 4–8 mmol/L.

- **Increased vigilance**: The panel recommended increased vigilance for patients with a sodium level ≤ 120 mmol/L who are at heightened risk of osmotic demyelination. Factors associated with a higher risk include sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. For these high-risk patients, the US/Irish expert panel advised that correction should not exceed 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period, and the minimum daily correction goal should be 4–6 mmol/L.

In patients without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, the panel noted that a correction by 8–12 mmol/L on the first day of therapy was greater than necessary, but unlikely to cause harm.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^1162Mnj7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

- **What was known**: In patients with chronic hyponatremia, plasma sodium should be gradually corrected to prevent osmotic demyelination. Recent observational studies have reported positive experiences with oral urea for the treatment of hyponatremia, but factors associated with the correction rate are unknown.

- **This study adds**: Older age, lower baseline plasma sodium, and higher cumulative urea dose increase the correction rate of hyponatremia during treatment with oral urea. Combining oral urea with fluid restriction may further increase the correction rate of hyponatremia.

- **Potential impact**: In patients with hyponatremia who are older or have a low initial plasma sodium, oral urea may need to be given for a shorter duration without fluid restriction. Our study also adds to the growing body of evidence that oral urea is generally a safe and effective treatment for hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112qX5xP]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, specifically in the management of hyponatremia, the AASLD 2021 guidelines recommend setting the goal rate of increase of serum sodium at 4–6 mEq/L per 24-hour period (not exceeding 8 mEq/L per 24-hour period). This is to ameliorate the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome when correcting chronic hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.

### Diabetes as a risk factor for hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis patients [^114SQ3pV]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). High credibility.

Aims

It remains unclear whether diabetes increases the risk for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in cirrhotic patients. We examined this question using data from three randomized trials of satavaptan, a vasopressin receptor antagonist that does not affect HE risk, in cirrhotic patients with ascites.

Methods

The trials included 1,198 patients. We excluded those with HE before or at randomization and followed the remaining patients for the one-year duration of the trials. They were examined for HE regularly. We compared rates of first-time overt HE between diabetics and non-diabetic patients using Cox regression, adjusting for:

- **Demographic factors**: gender, age
- **Clinical factors**: ascites severity, cirrhosis etiology, Child-Pugh class
- **Laboratory parameters**: creatinine, bilirubin, INR, sodium, potassium, albumin, platelets
- **Medication use**: lactulose use, benzodiazepine/barbiturate use, spironolactone dose, furosemide dose, potassium-sparing diuretic dose
- **Comorbidity**: CirCom comorbidity score

Results

We included 862 patients of whom 193 (22%) had diabetes. In total, they experienced 115 first-time episodes of overt HE during the follow-up. Fewer diabetics than non-diabetic patients were in Child-Pugh class C at baseline (13% vs. 23%), yet they had a higher cumulative risk of first-time overt HE (26.0% vs. 15.8% after 1 year). Their episodes of first-time overt HE were more likely to progress beyond grade 2 (64% vs. 42% of episodes progressed to grade 3 or 4, p = 0.01 for independence between diabetes and highest HE grade). After the confounder adjustment, the hazard ratio of first-time overt HE for diabetics vs. non-diabetic patients was 1.86.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyponatremia, with respect to serum osmolality, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend viewing hyponatremia as hypotonic hyponatremia in the absence of causes of non-hypotonic hyponatremia, such as:

- **Effective osmoles raising serum osmolality causing hyponatremia**: isotonic or hypertonic glucose, mannitol, glycine, histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate, hyperosmolar radiocontrast media, maltose.

- **Presence of endogenous solutes causing pseudohyponatremia (laboratory artifact)**: triglycerides, cholesterol, protein, IVIG, monoclonal gammopathies.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: Hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114Mg1Pm]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hyponatremia, particularly for severely symptomatic patients, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend deciding on the next steps in managing hypotonic hyponatremia (true hyponatremia). This decision should be made based on the patient's volume status: hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. This approach is suggested in the absence of severe hyponatremia.
