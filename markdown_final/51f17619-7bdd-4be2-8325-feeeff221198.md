## Question

An patients who are allergic to iv iodine do an MRI with contrast

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with a documented iodinated contrast allergy can safely undergo MRI with gadolinium-based contrast. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic differences between iodinated contrast media and gadolinium-based agents and whether cross-reactivity exists. Then, I should verify what major guidelines and high-credibility sources say about using gadolinium in patients with prior iodinated contrast reactions. Next, I will review the actual risk of gadolinium reactions and how it compares to iodinated contrast. After that, I need to check whether premedication is indicated or helpful in this specific cross-class situation. I will then examine special populations and clinical contexts where this approach is commonly used. Finally, I should confirm documentation, site preparedness, and concrete recommendations for practice, including alternatives if gadolinium is also contraindicated [^116mxWFn] [^111Pi5xk].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic distinction, because that drives the entire cross-reactivity question. Iodinated contrast media are iodine-containing small molecules used for X-ray–based imaging, whereas gadolinium-based contrast agents are paramagnetic chelates used for MRI; there is no structural similarity to suggest immunologic cross-reactivity between these classes, and contemporary consensus statements explicitly state there is no pharmacologic similarity to support cross-reactivity from ICM to GBCA or vice versa [^117M2hx3].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check whether major guidelines endorse gadolinium-enhanced MRI when iodinated contrast is contraindicated. The NCCN explicitly recommends MRI with IV gadolinium-based contrast as an alternative when iodinated contrast is contraindicated due to significant allergy, with examples across rectal cancer, colon cancer, uveal melanoma, and bladder cancer pathways, and the ACC/AHA aortic disease guideline supports MRI as a reasonable surveillance alternative to CT when iodinated contrast allergy is present, which aligns with radiology–allergy consensus recommendations to prefer alternative modalities when feasible [^111Pi5xk] [^115e615c] [^116rmDT3] [^113DmLXj] [^116mxWFn].

> I will now examine the risk of gadolinium reactions to ensure we are not substituting one high-risk agent for another. Wait, let me verify the incidence data: large series show acute allergic-like reactions to GBCA are rare, around 0.06–0.17% overall, with severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) on the order of 0.003–0.006%, which is markedly lower than iodinated contrast reaction rates; this supports the safety of GBCA in patients who reacted to ICM, particularly when the clinical question truly requires contrast [^1123iTpG] [^115T6Vw7] [^117B514n].

> But wait, what if the patient had a severe iodinated reaction — does that change the calculus for gadolinium use? I should double-check the consensus on severity-based management. For severe prior ICM reactions, the radiology–allergy consensus advises first considering alternative studies; if no acceptable alternative exists, then agent switching and premedication are reasonable, and the study should be performed in a hospital setting with full anaphylaxis preparedness; this framework supports proceeding with GBCA-enhanced MRI when indicated, with appropriate precautions, rather than defaulting to premedication alone [^116mxWFn] [^11381EJD].

> Hold on, I should verify whether premedication is needed when moving from ICM to GBCA. Initially, I thought premedication might help as a bridge, but let me reconsider: premedication reduces but does not eliminate breakthrough reactions and is not routinely recommended when switching to a different class like GBCA; moreover, premedication is not supported for mild prior ICM reactors and is reserved for select higher-risk scenarios after shared decision-making, so routine premedication solely due to a prior ICM reaction is not indicated when using GBCA [^117T4jha] [^113soQhB] [^1155d3LQ].

> Next, I should review special populations and clinical contexts where this cross-class substitution is commonly implemented. In oncology staging, NCCN frequently pivots to gadolinium-enhanced MRI when iodinated contrast cannot be given; in vascular imaging, MRA with gadolinium is an established alternative to CTA for patients with iodinated contrast allergy; and in emergency settings, noncontrast or gadolinium-enhanced MR protocols are increasingly used when iodinated contrast is contraindicated, reinforcing that this is standard, evidence-aligned practice rather than experimental [^111Pi5xk] [^111xndhU] [^116Qub2u].

> I need to ensure we address documentation and site preparedness, because safe implementation hinges on these operational steps. Accurate EHR documentation should specify the culprit ICM and avoid vague labels like "iodine allergy", and all imaging centers should maintain anaphylaxis-ready environments with trained personnel, medications, and equipment regardless of prior reaction history; this is especially important when administering any contrast to patients with prior HSRs, even across different classes [^117HktsC] [^116Lwo8r] [^114bm9WF].

> Let me consider alternatives if gadolinium is also contraindicated or unavailable. Noncontrast MRI can often answer the clinical question depending on the indication, and in select scenarios noncontrast CT or ultrasound may suffice; for example, MR urography without gadolinium can still evaluate the upper tracts, albeit with reduced sensitivity, and surveillance or problem-solving can sometimes proceed with noncontrast strategies when both ICM and GBCA are not usable [^116GfWTB] [^115YSUXF].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes — patients with a documented iodinated contrast allergy can generally undergo MRI with gadolinium-based contrast because there is no meaningful cross-reactivity, the risk of GBCA reactions is low, and major guidelines endorse this substitution when clinically indicated; premedication is not routinely required solely due to a prior ICM reaction, but standard anaphylaxis precautions and accurate documentation are essential, and in severe prior reactors, consider alternative studies first and, if none are acceptable, proceed with GBCA using agent switching and full hospital-level preparedness [^117M2hx3] [^1123iTpG] [^111Pi5xk] [^116mxWFn].

Patients with an iodinated contrast allergy can generally undergo MRI with gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) because there is **no cross-reactivity** between iodinated and gadolinium agents [^117M2hx3]. GBCAs have a **low allergic reaction rate** (about 0.04–0.1%) [^1123iTpG], and severe reactions are rare [^115T6Vw7]. For patients with a prior severe iodinated contrast reaction, consider premedication and perform the MRI in a monitored setting [^116mxWFn]; for mild reactions, premedication is not routinely required [^113soQhB]. If there is a history of severe gadolinium allergy, avoid GBCAs and use non-contrast MRI or alternative imaging [^111otSWM].

---

## Cross-reactivity between iodinated contrast media and gadolinium-based contrast agents

There is **no pharmacologic similarity** between iodinated contrast media (ICM) and gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), so cross-reactivity is not expected [^117M2hx3]. Allergic reactions to ICM are typically due to the contrast molecule — not iodine — and GBCAs have distinct chemical structures, further reducing the likelihood of cross-reactivity [^113tduGC].

---

## Incidence and severity of allergic reactions to gadolinium-based contrast agents

GBCAs have a **low overall rate of allergic reactions**, with an incidence of approximately 0.04–0.1% [^notfound]. Severe reactions, including anaphylaxis, are rare, occurring in about 0.001–0.01% of administrations [^1123iTpG]. Mild reactions (e.g. rash, itching, mild urticaria) are most common, while moderate reactions (e.g. bronchospasm, angioedema) and severe reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, cardiovascular collapse) are uncommon [^115T6Vw7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Radiology (ACR) and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) provide clear recommendations for patients with iodinated contrast allergies who require MRI with gadolinium contrast:

- **No cross-reactivity**: There is no evidence of cross-reactivity between ICM and GBCAs, making GBCAs safe for patients with iodinated contrast allergies [^117M2hx3].

- **Premedication**: For patients with a history of severe iodinated contrast reactions, premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines may be considered, although evidence supporting premedication for GBCA reactions is limited [^117T4jha].

- **Monitoring**: Patients with a history of severe contrast reactions should undergo MRI in a monitored setting with appropriate resuscitation equipment and personnel available [^116mxWFn].

- **Alternative imaging**: If a patient has a documented severe allergy to gadolinium-based contrast agents, non-contrast MRI or alternative imaging modalities should be considered [^116rmDT3].

---

## Precautions and safety measures

When administering gadolinium contrast to patients with iodinated contrast allergies, the following precautions and safety measures are recommended:

- **Allergy history**: Obtain a detailed allergy history, including the specific contrast agent involved and the severity of the reaction [^117HktsC].

- **Premedication**: Consider premedication for patients with a history of severe contrast reactions, particularly if the clinical indication for contrast-enhanced MRI is strong [^113Y7kAx].

- **Monitoring**: Monitor patients closely during and after contrast administration, with appropriate resuscitation equipment and trained personnel readily available [^114bm9WF].

- **Documentation**: Document the specific contrast agent and reaction details in the patient's medical record to guide future imaging decisions [^117HktsC].

---

## Alternative imaging options

If a patient has a documented severe allergy to gadolinium-based contrast agents or if premedication is contraindicated, **alternative imaging options** include:

- **Non-contrast MRI**: Non-contrast MRI can provide valuable diagnostic information in many clinical scenarios, particularly for soft tissue evaluation [^116Qub2u].

- **Ultrasound**: Ultrasound is a safe alternative that does not involve contrast agents and can be useful in specific clinical contexts [^115YSUXF].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Non-contrast CT may be considered in certain situations, although it involves ionizing radiation and may have limited diagnostic utility compared to contrast-enhanced studies [^115YSUXF].

---

## Conclusion

Patients with iodinated contrast allergies can generally undergo MRI with gadolinium-based contrast agents, as there is **no cross-reactivity** between these two classes of contrast media [^117M2hx3]. GBCAs have a low rate of allergic reactions, and severe reactions are rare [^1123iTpG]. Clinicians should obtain a detailed allergy history, consider premedication for severe reactions, and monitor patients closely during and after contrast administration [^116mxWFn]. If a patient has a documented severe allergy to gadolinium-based contrast agents, alternative imaging options such as non-contrast MRI or ultrasound should be considered [^115YSUXF].

### Iodine and gadolinium contrast reactions: what is the risk and role of premedication, abbreviated protocols, prior history of reactions, and cross-reactivity? [^112XYjf3]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast media and gadolinium-based contrast media can be life-threatening. While corticosteroid premedication or agent-switching may mitigate risk, evidence is largely indirect and based on historical studies; recent literature refutes the efficacy. Guidance on premedication varies between organizations worldwide. No strategy eliminates reactions, and indirect consequences of premedication are substantial. Accelerated regimens are often used for emergencies, but are of questionable efficacy. Identifying "high-risk" patients is complex, but a history of reactions (to the same contrast class) is the biggest risk factor.

### Managing adverse reactions to contrast agents [^116htUVE]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Adverse reactions to iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast agents occur at an incidence of less than 1%. Although the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms are not completely understood, the treatment regimens are well accepted. Skin testing may be helpful in patients with a history of severe allergiclike reaction to aid in the selection of alternative contrast agents. Premedication should only be used for a history of allergiclike reaction. Imaging team members should be familiar with signs and symptoms of contrast reactions to allow for prompt assessment and treatment. A plan of action should be in place for contrast reactions and rehearsed regularly.

### Updated guidelines for intravenous contrast use for CT and MRI [^116hMRGY]. Emergency Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Intravenous (IV) contrast material is used extensively for CT and MRI scans done in emergency departments (ED). Its use is essential to make many critical diagnoses in ED patients. While adverse reactions can occur, newer research has added to our knowledge of IV contrast media tolerance and safety leading to improved and more liberal guidelines for intravenous contrast use. The updated information described in this review article indicates how intravenous contrast can be used safely in more patients, more expeditiously and with fewer precautions than with prior guidelines. This review article explains the basis for the new recommendations for intravenous contrast material use and describes indicated precautions and preparations to avoid adverse reactions for iodinated agents used for CT and gadolinium agents for MRI.

### Intravenous imaging contrast media complications: the basics that every clinician needs to know [^115VWFZr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Intravenous contrast is commonly used in noninvasive imaging procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography and can evaluate blood vessels and better characterize soft-tissue lesions. Although the incidence of adverse events after administration of contrast is low, it is important that clinicians and radiologists minimize risks and respond quickly and effectively when reactions occur. We will discuss a range of adverse events to iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast agents, including allergic-like reactions, nephrotoxicity, extravasation, and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. We will review risk stratification for patients, as well as premedication and treatment of adverse events.

### Guidelines and controversies of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging contrast media [^113NoK4h]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Contrast media is very frequently utilized for computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging examinations to provide improved tissue contrast and aid in diagnosis. While generally very safe, adverse events can occur following contrast media administration. The main safety concerns for contrast media administration are allergic-like reactions, contrast-induced acute kidney injury for iodinated contrast agents, and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis for gadolinium agents. The American College of Radiology provides guidance on appropriate patient selection and strategies to mitigate the risks of these adverse events.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: rectal cancer, version 3.2024 [^111Pi5xk]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Rectal cancer — principles of imaging for initial workup/staging specify chest CT and abdominal CT or MRI, with CT performed with intravenous (IV) iodinated contrast and oral contrast material unless contraindicated, and IV contrast is not required for the chest CT. If IV iodinated contrast is contraindicated because of significant contrast allergy, MRI of the abdomen with IV gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) can be obtained instead. In patients with chronic renal failure (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30 mL/min) who are not on dialysis, IV iodinated contrast material is also contraindicated, and IV GBCA can be administered in select cases. If iodinated and gadolinium contrast are both contraindicated due to significant allergy or chronic renal failure without dialysis, consider MRI without IV contrast or consider FDG-PET/CT imaging. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### A stroke imaging protocol in patients with a history of contrast-induced anaphylaxis [^112MUAP8]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The need for emergent, contrast-enhanced neuroimaging in stroke patients with a history of severe reaction to iodinated contrast represents a unique dilemma in emergency departments. There is currently a lack of evidence-based management protocols for these cases. We describe a protocol established at our institution, based off American College of Radiology (ACR) guidelines and institutional experience, to guide decision-making in these scenarios.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^114e3UWt]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Intravenous (IV) contrast allergy — risk factors and pre-treatment notes that severe anaphylactic reactions with modern non-ionic agents are rare, with severe reactions occurring in 0.04 to 0.22 percent of studies performed, and Visipaque® is reported to be the least allergenic formulation. Seafood allergy and atopic tendencies are not direct risk factors for anaphylaxis associated with non-ionic contrast, whereas a history of previous contrast allergy confers the highest risk but is not an absolute contraindication to IV contrast. Steroid pre-treatment protocols can attenuate or prevent reactions, though evidence of effectiveness is not conclusive; most protocols prescribe multiple doses of oral or IV steroids a minimum of 4 hours prior to image acquisition and contrast infusion, and it is unlikely that pre-treatment administered at less than 4-hour intervals will be effective. Because such protocols may delay diagnosis, consider unenhanced CT to look for fluid, air, and fractures when risk for further delay to definitive study with IV contrast is deemed prohibitive.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^1114zRJv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic imaging for new-onset Bell's palsy — routine imaging not recommended: Clinicians should not routinely perform diagnostic imaging for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy; this Recommendation (against) is based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C and high confidence. Routine imaging is not recommended at the time of initial presentation, and although MRI may show ipsilateral facial nerve enhancement, this does not influence therapy. Imaging is costly and has risks: magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography have risks and considerable cost; computed tomography contrast has a higher risk of iodinated allergic reactions and contrast with either scanner can cause adverse reactions such as allergic contrast reaction, nephropathy, or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis; and CT scans expose patients to ionizing radiation that can increase the future risk of malignancy.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115e615c]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Colon cancer — principles of imaging for initial workup/staging center on C/A/P CT to evaluate local extent and metastatic spread; CT should use intravenous iodinated contrast and oral contrast material unless contraindicated, and intravenous contrast is not required for the chest CT (but usually given if performed with abdominal CT). If IV iodinated contrast material is contraindicated because of significant contrast allergy, then MRI examination of the abdomen and pelvis with IV gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) can be obtained instead; in patients with chronic renal failure (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30 mL/min) who are not on dialysis, IV iodinated contrast material is also contraindicated, and IV GBCA can be administered in select cases. If iodinated and gadolinium contrast are both contraindicated due to significant allergy or chronic renal failure without dialysis, then consider MRI without IV contrast or consider FDG-PET/CT imaging. Consider an abdomen/pelvis MRI to assist with the diagnosis of rectal cancer versus colon cancer (eg, low-lying sigmoid tumor), noting that the rectum lies below a virtual line from the sacral promontory to the upper edge of the symphysis as determined by MRI. Consider MRI of liver for liver metastases if potentially resectable. FDG-PET/CT is not routinely indicated and does not supplant a contrast-enhanced diagnostic CT or MRI and should only be used to evaluate an equivocal finding on a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI or in patients with strong contraindications to IV contrast administration. Consider FDG-PET/CT (skull base to mid-thigh) if potentially surgically curable M1 disease in selected cases or in selected patients considered for image-guided liver-directed therapies (ie, thermal ablation, radioembolization). If liver-directed therapy or surgery is contemplated, a hepatic MRI with intravenous routine extracellular or hepatobiliary GBCA is preferred over CT to assess exact number and distribution of metastatic foci for local treatment planning. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Allergic reactions to iodinated contrast media: premedication considerations for patients at risk [^113RVcdC]. Emergency Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The objectives of this article are to review allergy-type reactions to iodinated contrast media and the protocols utilized to prevent or reduce the occurrence of these adverse reactions in high-risk patients. We will begin by discussing the types or classifications of the adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media. We will then discuss reaction mechanisms, identify the patients at highest risk for adverse reactions, and clarify common misperceptions about the risk. Finally, we will discuss the actions of the medications used to help reduce or prevent allergy-type reactions to iodinated contrast media, the protocols used to help reduce or prevent contrast reactions in high-risk patients, and the potential side effects of these medications. We will also discuss the high-risk patient who has received premedication due to a prior index reaction and discuss the risk of having a subsequent reaction, termed "breakthrough reaction". Identifying patient at high risk for an "allergy-type" reaction to contrast media is an essential task of the radiologist. Prevention of or reduction of the risk of an adverse reaction is critical to patient safety. If an examination can be performed without contrast in a patient at high risk for an allergy-type reaction, it may be appropriate to avoid contrast. However, there are situations where contrast media is necessary, and the radiologist plays a vital role in preventing or mitigating an allergy-type reaction.

### Clinical follow-up in patients with moderate or severe allergic-like reactions to iodinated contrast material [^113RCmC6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine follow-up care in patients with a history of acute allergic-like reaction to iodinated contrast material (ICM), including subsequent imaging management, allergy consultation, and repeat ICM exposure and reactions.

Methods

All patients who had a moderate or severe acute allergic-like reaction to ICM after contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) examination from June 1, 2009, to January 1, 2022, at our institution were included. Chart review was performed to determine (1) whether subsequent imaging was not performed or was altered in these patients, (2) whether the patient underwent a subsequent CECT examination, and (3) whether the patient had an allergist consultation.

Results

A total of 251 patients were identified. One-third of patients (90 of 251, 36%) had at least one change to their subsequent imaging management due to their reaction, including performing an unenhanced CT (62 of 251, 25%) or MRI (22 of 251, 8.8%) instead of a CECT or not performing a CECT when otherwise clinically indicated (20 of 251, 8.0%). Patients with a prior severe reaction were more likely to have a change in management than patients with a prior moderate reaction (severe: 22 of 32 [69%] versus moderate: 68 of 219 [31%], P < .0001). Only 17 patients (6.8%) had an allergy consult for their ICM reaction. A total of 90 patients underwent 274 subsequent CECT examinations. Repeat allergic-like reactions were observed in one quarter of patients (24 of 90, 27%) and a tenth of CECT examinations (29 of 274, 11%).

Discussion

One-third of patients with a history of a moderate or severe allergic-like reaction to ICM had their subsequent imaging care modified due to their reaction.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^1139tKVA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan — An MRI scan creates pictures of the soft tissue but not the bones; an MRI does not use radiation; it uses very strong magnets; the MRI machine looks like a narrow tube that your head, neck, and chest will go inside; you will need an IV for contrast to enhance the pictures; and if you have any metal or implants in your body, you may not be able to have an MRI and must discuss this with your provider. Risks include contrast allergy and discomfort with IV placement, and patients with claustrophobia may be very anxious with this lengthy scan (45–60 minutes); your provider may provide a sedative pill.

### Advances in bladder cancer imaging [^117QctBM]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Patient perspectives

Image acquisition time and tolerability of any proposed scan is important. CT image acquisition is usually within minutes but some research MRI protocols may take up to 1 h. This can impact on patient compliance and predispose results to motion artifacts.

Use of MRI and US are free from ionizing radiation as compared to CT and PET/CT. At our institution a 64-slice multidetector CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is associated with radiation exposure of 16 mSv during imaging; PET/CT is associated with exposure of 14 mSv (PET component 8 mSv; 6 mSv from a rapid image acquisition CT). The clinical significance of these values in terms of inducing second malignancy is small in the context of the overall poor prognosis from muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer at present. MRI scanning also does not require the use of iodine contrast agents that can induce reactions potentially anaphylactic in some individuals. In addition to allergy, intravenous contrast is also omitted for CT scanning in the presence of significant renal impairment.

Technology is rapidly changing so the ability to use this information to identify the most effective intervention for patients is critical. In the future we anticipate it will be routine to tailor a patient's treatment plan to both the physiological and physical characteristics of their disease, to monitor effectiveness of the intervention allowing a more dynamic approach to treatment.

This paper presents a practical questionnaire to be used when a contrast medium examination is requested. The questionnaire is based on the guidelines from the European Society of Urogenital Radiology. Its aim is to identify patients at increased risk of clinically relevant renal and non-renal adverse reactions to iodine-based and MRI contrast agents. The questionnaire should be completed by the referring physician when the examination is requested.

### Management and prevention of hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: a consensus statement from the American college of radiology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^116mxWFn]. Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Iodinated contrast media (ICM) immediate hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) — post-reaction imaging planning includes the following directives: for a history of mild immediate ICM HSRs, switching the contrast agent is recommended when feasible; for a history of moderate immediate ICM HSRs, switching the contrast agent is recommended when feasible, and premedication may be considered; for a history of severe immediate ICM HSRs, it is recommended first to consider alternative studies; when there is no acceptable alternative study, switching the contrast agent is recommended when feasible and premedication is recommended; and for severe immediate ICM HSRs, the study should be performed in a hospital setting with a rapid response team available including personnel, equipment, and supplies to treat anaphylaxis regardless of whether the patient underwent agent switching or premedication.

Iodinated contrast media (ICM) reaction documentation and site preparedness — Documentation of ICM hypersensitivity reactions, including symptoms and the specific inciting agent in the electronic medical record, is recommended to optimize future management. All imaging centers should be prepared to manage an adverse contrast reaction related to the administration of intravenous contrast material in any patient regardless of prior history and should include personnel, equipment, and supplies to treat anaphylaxis, and this includes adequate training of all personnel involved in contrast reaction management.

Iodinated contrast media (ICM) premedication for prior mild reactors — premedication is not recommended for patients with a history of mild reaction, and although premedication is not generally recommended in this patient group, such patients may be premedicated in rare instances after shared medical decision-making between the patient and the health care provider or because of strong patient preferences or clinical circumstances.

### Hypersensitivity reactions after diagnostic nonvascular administration of iodine-based contrast media and gadolinium-based contrast agents and the role of the drug allergy specialist [^113H7GZJ]. European Journal of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The risk of hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) following nonvascular administration of contrast media (CM) for diagnostic studies is very low, likely due to minimal absorption into the systemic circulation. Most published individual cases of HSR after nonvascular CM administration are immediate reactions caused by ionic high-osmolar CM, few by nonionic low-osmolar CM, and none by gadolinium-based contrast agents. Measures to prevent recurrent HSR following nonvascular administration are similar to those recommended to prevent HSR after intravascular CM administration. Premedication as preventive measure has been abandoned, while switching to an alternative CM, preferably based on the results of an allergological analysis, is increasingly advocated. In selected scenarios, preventive measures may be minimized.

### Risk factor analysis of iodinated contrast medium-related hypersensitivity reactions [^112BPfXG]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and outlook

Despite numerous publications, the predictability of ICM-hypersensitivity reactions remains limited. Our analysis shows that many reported risk factors are inconsistent, overlapping, or not clinically relevant. Critically, only four factors should be emphasized: a history of ICM hypersensitivity, acute allergy, the culprit ICM and previously not identified documentation errors. These risks directly affect patient safety and highlight the need for precise identification and consistent reporting, rather than an uncritical accumulation of nonspecific factors.

Interestingly, there is sometimes information in the literature that precautionary measures should be taken in high-risk patients, but there is no explanation of what risk is meant (e.g. for renal insufficiency, a hypersensitivity reaction). Such information is not helpful but rather confusing. Also confusing is the fact that the current literature dealing with risk factors gives no information about prophylaxis.

Sometimes one has the impression that risk factors are listed uncritically or that the underlying mechanisms are unclear to the authors (e.g. that chronically ill patients often have to undergo contrast-enhanced imaging and therefore the disease itself does not represent the risk). Moreover, if one does not understand the pathology of ICM-hypersensitivity reactions, it is not possible to define risks. In the future, intensive training will be necessary, which will ultimately serve to ensure patient safety.

### Management and prevention of hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: a consensus statement from the American college of radiology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^117T4jha]. Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Iodinated contrast media (ICM) hypersensitivity — premedication for prior reactors is addressed with the following guidance: We recommend premedication for patients with a history of severe reactions to ICM for whom an alternative imaging study is not an option and when the untoward consequences of premedication and delayed diagnosis are small, while acknowledging that the evidence supporting this recommendation is of very low quality; in pooled retrospective data, a pooled analysis of 736 patients in five retrospective studies included some moderate and severe reactions, and patients who had prior hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) and received premedication were significantly less likely to experience HSRs (odds ratio = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.25; P < .00001), yet regimens reduce but do not eliminate immediate reaction risk with breakthrough reactions occurring in approximately 2.1% of this patient group; nearly half (48%) of breakthrough reactions may be moderate or severe, and repeat immediate reactions occur in up to 12% of patients with moderate or severe breakthrough reactions; when circumstances imply high risk for serious anaphylaxis (eg, mastocytosis with severe history), the balance favors administering premedication with systemic steroids with or without antihistamines, whereas for patients with a history of moderate reaction, a shared decision-making approach is most appropriate.

An anonymous survey was offered to all patients having screening mammography at a single academic institution from December 27 th 2019 to March 6 th 2020. Survey questions related to: (1) patients' background experiences (2) patients' concern for aspects of MRI and CEM measured using a 5-point Likert scale, and (3) financial considerations.

Results

75% (1011/1349) patients completed the survey. 53.0% reported dense breasts and of those, 47.6% had additional screening. 49.6% had experienced a callback, 29.0% had a benign biopsy, and 13.7% had prior CEM/MRI. 34.7% were satisfied with mammography for screening. A majority were neutral or not concerned with radiation exposure, contrast allergy, IV line placement, claustrophobia, and false positive exams. 54.7% were willing to pay at least $250–500 for screening MRI. Those reporting dense breasts were less satisfied with mammography for screening (p < 0.001) and willing to pay more for MRI (p < 0.001). If patients had prior CEM/MRI, there was less concern for an allergic reaction (p < 0.001), IV placement (p = 0.025), and claustrophobia (p = 0.006). There was less concern for false positives if they had a prior benign biopsy (p = 0.029) or prior CEM/MRI (p = 0.005) and less concern for IV placement if they had dense breasts (p = 0.007) or a previous callback (p = 0.013).

Conclusion

The screening population may accept CEM or MRI as a screening exam despite its risks and cost, especially patients with dense breasts and patients who have had prior CEM/MRI.

### Emergent magnetic resonance angiography for evaluation of the thoracoabdominal and peripheral vasculature [^111xndhU]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Thoracoabdominal and peripheral vasculature pathologies include a variety of severe and life threatening conditions that may be encountered in the emergent setting. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the first-line modality for imaging of the vasculature in this context, but magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) also plays an important and emerging role in the evaluation of carefully selected patients. Intravenous (IV) iodinated contrast is necessary for CTA, although MRA is most useful in patients who cannot receive IV iodinated contrast for reasons including prior severe allergic-like reaction to iodinated contrast, poor IV access, or severe renal insufficiency. Gadolinium-based contrast agents are administered for MRA when possible, as they generally improve the diagnostic quality and shorten the duration of the exam. In most clinical situations, however, noncontrast MRA is sufficient to obtain a diagnostic evaluation. In this review, we discuss the key strengths and limitations of MRA performed in the emergent setting, highlighting the role of MRA in the diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes, aortitis, aortic aneurysm, pulmonary embolism, and peripheral vascular disease.

### Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to iodinated contrast medium and given iodinated contrast during an interventional pain procedure [^113WbAVS]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to iodinated contrast medium, iodinated contrast medium is avoided, antihistamine and steroid premedication are given, or a gadolinium-based contrast agent is employed. Six patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to iodinated contrast medium and who were not premedicated had an unintentional injection of iodinated contrast. None of the patients developed a moderate or severe reaction. All patients had gadopentetate dimeglumine in one of their injections; three had repeated injections of the gadopentetate. The lack of a significant reaction may be due to any or all of the following: questionable history of iodinated contrast reaction, low dose of iodinated contrast given, concomitant injection of (epidural) steroid, and slower absorption from epidural compared with intravenous injection. While it is reassuring to know that there is a low possibility of a moderate to severe reaction in these patients, every effort should be made to avoid this scenario, appropriate drugs and resuscitation equipment should be immediately available, and the patients should be observed adequately and followed for the possibility of late reactions. Recent publications have called for caution in the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents.

Drug and contrast issues

Contrast agents

These include iodinated contrast agents for X-ray based studies (including CT), gadolinium-based contrast agents (BCA) for MRI, and microbubbles for ultrasonography. Each of these agent types has specific safety issues (as summarised in Table 1).

Table 1
Agent type and respective safety issues

Hypersensitivity reactions – duties of radiographer, radiologist or nurse, depending on circumstances and local practices

Before injection of an agent
Be prepared (training provided, resuscitation trolley available, emergency phone numbers posted);
Interrogate the patient for previous reactions, grade, and symptoms

During a reaction:
Adequately treat the symptoms based on the Ring and Messmer classification (Table 2)

Table 2
Symptoms based on the Ring and Messmer classification

After a reaction:
Blood sampling for Histamine and Tryptase dosages;
Consult an allergy specialist for skin testing.

It is worth noting that not all reports from patients of previous allergic reactions represent true hypersensitivity. It is important to make reasonable efforts to differentiate patients with true histories of previous reactions from those who have had previous incidents due to other factors, but believed by the patient to represent "allergy". This differentiation is not always easy, but we should remember that failing to perform an indicated contrast-enhanced study (if true hypersensitivity is not really an issue) may indirectly diminish patient safety.

Nephrotoxicity of iodinated contrast media

Risk factors include: Age > 70 years, reduced renal function (eGFR < 30 ml/min for intra-venous, 45 for intra-arterial injection), large doses, and multiple contrast injections within 48–72 h. Measurement of renal function should be performed prior to injection in at-risk patients. Hydration of high-risk patients is advisable (for hydration protocols see ESUR guidelines).

Metformin

In patients with eGFR > 30 ml/min, metformin administration may be continued normally. If eGFR < 30 ml/min or iodinated contrast is to be given by an intra-arterial route, metformin should be stopped from the time of injection and resumed 48 h later if renal function has not changed.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis

In the past, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis was mainly seen in patients with severe renal insufficiency or on dialysis after injection of linear Gadolinium chelates (high-risk group); most of these agents have been recently withdrawn from the market in Europe.

### Risk factor analysis of iodinated contrast medium-related hypersensitivity reactions [^114G9bHh]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hypersensitivity reactions caused by iodinated contrast media (ICM) are by definition type B adverse reactions and therefore, they are not predictable. To partially limit this uncertainty, since the 1980s, risk factors have been defined and published. Currently, there are so many risks that any patient undergoing a contrast-enhanced imaging examination would have at least one risk. This is not helpful and instead leads to uncertainty again. From both studies and clinical experience, we know that only a small percentage of patients develop hypersensitivity reactions after ICM administration. Therefore, we subjected the risks published to a critical analysis. Based on 126 publications, we identified 43 risks, which were divided into three categories (patient-related, contrast agent-related and management-related risks). We have also mentioned the appropriate management for each risk. After critical assessment, the risk status remains with a history of an ICM-hypersensitivity reaction, acute allergic symptoms, the culprit ICM and documentation errors (e.g. if an iodine allergy is mentioned, a latex allergy is incorrectly suspected as an ICM-allergy or the wrong trigger is documented). In addition, we found that several risks have been named differently, although they cover the same risk situation (e.g. chronic/severe disease and frequent ICM applications). Furthermore, for several of the published risks, no mitigation measures are available. Taken together, of the large number of published risks, only those with risk status should be used clinically in the future. Known risk factors do not influence the nature of type B reactions.

Critical relevance statement For patient safety, it would be advisable in the future to consider the following three risks: a history of an ICM-hypersensitivity reaction, acute allergic symptoms and documentation errors (e.g. if an iodine allergy is mentioned, a latex allergy is incorrectly suspected as an ICM-allergy or the wrong trigger is documented).

Key Points

Risk factors are intended to limit the unpredictability of ICM hypersensitivity reactions.
Currently, risks are nonspecific and ultimately apply to all patients.
We found that identical factors are published under different names.
Four risks are relevant: history of ICM-HSR, acute allergy, the culprit ICM and documentation/management errors.

### MRI evaluation prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI): when to acquire and how to interpret [^116X7hJL]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Emerging indications for MRI

As the number of TAVI procedures increases, there will also be an increase in the number of patients who cannot be optimally evaluated with CTA, echocardiography, or stress echocardiography. Thus, non-contrast MR may have an important role in preoperative evaluation in the following groups of patients:
Patients with history of severe allergic type reaction to intravenous iodinated contrast medium who cannot be administered contrast medium for CTA.
Impaired renal function (acute kidney injury or chronic kidney injury with serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL, or GFR < 30 mL/min/m 2).
Evaluation of severity of aortic stenosis in patients with poor acoustic window and low cardiac output/low gradient AS (aortic stenosis) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
Evaluating severity of aortic stenosis in patients with moderate stenosis by echocardiography but symptomatic for severe stenosis and who have contraindications for stress echocardiography (Appendix A).

Post-gadolinium delayed enhanced imaging has been used to assess the severity of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing TAVI, and it has been demonstrated that there is decreased LVEF recovery after TAVI in the presence of significant delayed enhancement prior to TAVI. Use of Gadolinium however is contraindicated in patients with poor renal function. Gadolinium enhanced MRI is not necessary for the preoperative measurements for TAVI.

### Insight into the dynamic of gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) hypersensitivity: acquisition, persistence and disappearance [^114eoGwA]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis against gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) has been reported in all severity grades but is less frequent than hypersensitivity/allergy against iodinated contrast materials. Once a patient acquires such an adverse reaction a life-long premedication is usually the consequence in concert with GBCA-enhanced MR-imaging procedures. The usefulness of this prophylaxis has been questioned, and discussed controversially during the past. The herein presented case may shed some light into the dynamic of contrast-medium-induced hypersensitivity reactions.

### Management and prevention of hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: a consensus statement from the American college of radiology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^11381EJD]. Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Iodinated contrast media (ICM) hypersensitivity — management by prior reaction severity: For patients with a history of mild immediate ICM hypersensitivity reactions, premedication is not recommended and switching the contrast agent is recommended when the inciting agent is known and feasible; most importantly, no corticosteroid premedication is generally recommended for patients with a prior mild acute hypersensitivity reaction. For patients with a history of severe immediate ICM hypersensitivity reactions, it is recommended first to consider alternative imaging studies; if there is no acceptable alternative, premedication is recommended and either switching the contrast agent or performing skin testing should be considered, and the study should be performed in a hospital setting with a rapid response team available, including personnel, equipment, and supplies to treat anaphylaxis. No premedication is necessary for patients with prior chemotoxic or physiologic reactions or an isolated history of shellfish allergy or iodine allergy including topical povidone-iodine.

### NCCN guidelines insights: uveal melanoma, version 1.2019 [^116rmDT3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). High credibility.

Uveal melanoma — confirmation and imaging for suspected metastasis: Recurrence or metastasis should be confirmed histologically whenever possible or if clinically indicated, with biopsy options noting that biopsy techniques may include core needle biopsy or otherwise fine-needle aspiration, and clinicians should consider genetic testing if it might affect treatment options. The most frequent metastatic site is the liver, and modalities of choice for detection include CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with IV iodinated contrast, CT chest without IV contrast, MRI abdomen with IV gadoxetate disodium-based contrast, or whole-body FDG-PET/CT. In patients with renal failure and/or iodinated contrast allergy, MRI abdomen with gadolinium-based contrast is the preferred study over CT; if no IV contrast can be administered, MRI without contrast is superior to non-contrast enhanced CT. Ultrasound of the liver can be used in select patients but has limited value; brain MRI with IV contrast may be performed only if neurologic symptoms are present, and routine CNS imaging is not recommended. Abdominal imaging should be performed with IV contrast unless contraindicated.

### Contrast media extravasation of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging: management guidelines for the radiologist [^1157NRy9]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Intravenous contrast administration has been of great importance in diagnostic radiology, but it is not without risks either due to the local, systemic allergic reactions or due to subcutaneous extravasation of contrast media. Subcutaneous contrast medium extravasationis an infrequent, yet a well-recognized complication. However, most incidents are minor and can be managed conservatively, but there are a few cases that require immediate surgical intervention. This article discusses the risks factors, clinical manifestations, and conservative and surgical approaches of subcutaneous contrast media extravasation for both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

### Image-guided breast biopsy and localisation: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^114NcjU3]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

MRI-related contraindications

Patients planned for MRI-guided biopsy should undergo the usual precautions including screening for MRI-unsafe or MRI-conditional implants, prior reactions to contrast agent administration, and renal function impairment, as suggested by the EUSOBI recommendations for breast MRI.

The patients do not have to fast on the day of the procedure or discontinue other medications than those related to antiplatelet/anticoagulation therapy, as explained above.

Note E. Informed consent is required before a breast biopsy. Management of antiplatelet/anticoagulation therapy may be adopted. Women should be informed of possible adverse events and any allergies to local anaesthetic drugs should be verified. If an MRI-guided biopsy is planned, allergies to intravenous contrast agents as well as contraindications to MRI should be verified. Informed consent also includes communication between the radiologist and the patient (see the next paragraph).

### Mammography: an update of the EUSOBI recommendations on information for women [^112gbqDt]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

On the basis of still preliminary results, CESM can be considered as an alternative to contrast-enhanced MRI in the case of contraindications to MRI (including the presence of MRI-unsafe devices in the patient's body, claustrophobia and obesity preventing the patient from entering the magnet) or to gadolinium-based contrast injection as well as local conditions of difficult MRI availability due to interesting results obtaining by comparing CESM and MRI in the same patients.

Note J. It is important to note that iodinated contrast agents are frequently used in clinical practice, mostly intravenously injected for contrast-enhanced computed tomography. There are contraindications (history of allergic reactions, renal failure) and possible side effects that require discussion with the patient and the signature of an informed written consent. Thus, the injection of iodinated contrast agents for mammography requires the same precautions used for other contrast-enhanced x-ray-based examination. Before the examination, the radiologist will clarify the risks and benefits associated with the intravenous injection of iodinated contrast agents.

Bladder cancer — abdomen and pelvis imaging for staging in muscle-invasive disease includes CT urography (CTU [computed tomography urography]); magnetic resonance urography (MRU) may be appropriate in patients with poor renal function or iodinated contrast allergy but with GFR > 30 and no acute renal failure; renal ultrasound (US) and CT without contrast with retrograde evaluation for patients who cannot receive either iodinated or gadolinium-based contrast; ureteroscopy if suspected upper tract lesions; FDG-PET/CT (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography; category 2B) may be useful in selected patients with ≥ cT2 disease and may change treatment in patients with ≥ cT3 disease, but FDG-PET/CT should not be used to delineate the anatomy of the upper urinary tract; CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast if not performed with initial evaluation; and MRI of the pelvis without and with IV contrast for local staging, which may be performed in addition to CTU or without contrast if there is a contraindication to contrast. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Allergic-like contrast media reaction management in children [^113oeADG]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The use of contrast materials as part of imaging examinations is common in children of all ages, as these compounds increase image contrast, lesion detection and lesion characterization. Though modern iodinated, gadolinium-based and ultrasound microbubble contrast materials generally are quite safe, acute physiological and allergic-like reactions are possible. The majority of acute contrast reactions in children are mild and self-limited; however, life-threatening reactions can occur. It is our obligation as radiologists to recognize and manage these adverse reactions. The objective of this article is to review the frequency, manifestations and appropriate treatment of acute contrast reactions in the pediatric population.

NMIBC abdomen and pelvis imaging for staging — modalities and special situations: CT urography (CTU) is defined as CT of the abdomen and pelvis without and with intravenous (IV) contrast with excretory imaging; MR urography (MRU) may be appropriate, especially in patients with poor renal function or iodinated contrast allergy but with GFR > 30 and no acute renal failure, and may be performed without gadolinium-based contrast utilizing T2 imaging and native image contrast to evaluate upper tracts, though it will have decreased sensitivity to plaque-like or non-obstructive lesions and metastasis; for patients who cannot receive either iodinated or gadolinium-based contrast material, renal ultrasound (US) or CT without contrast may be utilized in conjunction with retrograde ureteropyelography; consider, in sessile or high-grade tumors, MRI of the pelvis without and with IV contrast for local staging, which may be performed in addition to CTU and can be performed without contrast if renal function does not allow for contrast administration, as early data suggest T2 and diffusion-weighted images may help with local staging.

### Frequency and severity of acute allergic-like reactions to gadolinium-containing I.V. contrast media in children and adults [^115T6Vw7]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to determine the frequency and severity of acute allergic-like reactions to i.v.-administered gadolinium-containing contrast media in children and adults.

Materials and Methods

Pediatric (younger than 19 years) and adult department of radiology contrast material reaction forms involving patients who experienced acute allergic-like reactions to gadolinium-containing contrast media from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2006, were retrospectively evaluated for the specific types of acute allergic-like reactions, reaction management, and patient outcomes. Relevant patient medical information, including documentation of prior gadolinium- or iodine-containing contrast material reaction, premedication before acute allergic-like reaction to i.v. gadolinium-containing contrast material, previous allergic reactions to substances other than contrast media, and history of asthma, was obtained by reviewing electronic medical records.

Results

Seventy-eight thousand three hundred fifty-three (65,009 adult and 13,344 pediatric) i.v. administrations of gadolinium-containing contrast material were performed during the study period. Acute allergic-like reactions were documented after 54 injections (reaction frequency, 0.07%). Forty-eight reactions involved adult patients (adult reaction frequency, 0.07%), and six reactions occurred in pediatric patients (pediatric reaction frequency, 0.04%). Forty (74%) acute allergic-like reactions were mild, 10 (19%) were moderate, and four (7%) were severe. No gadolinium-containing contrast material-related death occurred during the study period. Twenty-six (50%) of 52 patients had one or more presumed risk factors for contrast material reaction.

Conclusion

Adult and pediatric acute allergic-like reactions to i.v.-administered gadolinium-containing contrast media are rare. Most of these reactions are mild; however, moderate and severe reactions that require immediate management do occur.

### Safety of gadobutrol: results from 42 clinical phase II to IV studies and postmarketing surveillance after 29 million applications [^114hNGQZ]. Investigative Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Study Population

The study population of the 42 clinical phase II to IV studies consisted of patients of all ages (term newborns up to patients older than 90 years) with a clinical need for various diagnostic contrast-enhanced MRI. Special attention was paid to patients with specific risk factors, for example, renal impairment, reduced liver function, cardiovascular disorders, general history of allergies, and specific history of allergies to contrast agents. Two studies recruited children aged 0 to 18 years. All patients (or their legal representatives) gave written informed consent before the start of the study.

No selection criteria were applied for patients for whom ADRs were reported to the Pharmacovigilance Department.

Treatments

In the 42 clinical development phase II to IV studies, a total of 6809 patients received gadobutrol, and 2184 received one of the following comparators: Gd-DTPA (n = 1097), gadodiamide (n = 150), gadoversetamide (n = 227), gadoteridol (n = 555), and Gd-DOTA (n = 155). All contrast agents were administered by a single intravenous bolus injection followed by a saline chaser.

Gadobutrol was administered at a dose range from 0.01 mmol/kg to 0.51 mmol/kg bw. Most subjects (n = 4765) received the standard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg bw. Two hundred ninety-two subjects received a dose between 0.01 and less than 0.09 mmol/kg, and 47 patients received 0.31 to 0.51 mmol/kg bw, a dose above the approved dose. The dose for comparators was mainly 0.1 mmol/kg bw.

Study Procedures

In all clinical phase II–IV studies, demographic data and medical history (in particular history of renal, liver, cardiovascular diseases, and allergies) were recorded. Once contrast-enhanced MRI was performed, patients were asked about their well-being in an unsolicited way to gather information about adverse events (AEs). The follow-up period lasted from just the examination day up to 72 hours.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^113XnKfN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI 2019 vascular access — Detection and imaging for clinically significant stenosis — states that the indication for further evaluation and definitive treatment "requires the presence of a clinically symptomatic, significant lesion and not simply the presence of a lesion (ie, asymptomatic stenosis)". Duplex ultrasound is "effective for examining the AV access" peripherally but "ineffective for interrogating the central venous outflow", while "CT and MRI are useful for assessing the central venous system". Catheter‑based venography and arteriography "are invasive procedures but can definitively image" the access and serve as a therapeutic platform. Iodinated contrast "should be used judiciously in patients with CKD/ESKD", carbon dioxide "can be used as an alternative non-nephrotoxic contrast agent" with cautions about intra‑arterial injection and neurologic risk, intravenous ultrasound "can also be helpful in patients with severe contrast allergies", and MRI contrast "gadolinium is relatively contraindicated due to the risk of nephrogenic fibrosis".

### Prospective multicenter assessment of patient preferences for properties of gadolinium-based contrast media and their potential socioeconomic impact in a screening breast MRI setting [^112idUxG]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Selection of an optimal GBCM has gained focus in recent years based on evidence that a tiny quantity of gadolinium administered with GBCM is retained in the brain and body for months or years. The clinical importance of such gadolinium retention is unknown, but is a relevant consideration, especially in young patients and those receiving repeated lifetime administrations (e.g. women at intermediate or high risk for breast cancer undergoing MRI screening). However, choice of gadolinium-based contrast media (GBCM) is more complex than gadolinium retention alone and influenced by its potential benefits (e.g. detection sensitivity) as well as its risks (e.g. adverse reaction rate, intracranial gadolinium retention, cost).

It is currently unclear how patients prioritize this recently emphasized gadolinium retention relative to other GBCM risks and benefits. For example, is a GBCM with low risk of long-term gadolinium retention but low detection sensitivity and high allergic-like reaction rate preferred over a GBCM with higher risk of long-term gadolinium retention, higher detection sensitivity, and lower allergic-like reaction rate? The complex interplay between these factors can leave GBCM selection to provider gestalt, and often without patient input. The aim of this study was to measure preferences for properties of GBCM in an annual screening MRI population at greatest potential risk of GBCM-related side effects. We prospectively studied patients at risk for gadolinium retention at four centers to elicit their implied preferences for GBCM properties.

### Tolerability and diagnostic value of gadoteric acid in the general population and in patients with risk factors: results in more than 84, 000 patients [^112bUsdU]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the tolerability and diagnostic effectiveness of gadoteric acid under daily practice conditions in the general population and at-risk patients.

Materials and Methods

A total of 84,621 patients (45.4% men, 54.6% women, mean age 52.0 ± 16.9 years) were studied in 129 German centers. Patients underwent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using gadoteric acid (Gd-DOTA, Dotarem(®), Guerbet, Roissy CdG, France) as IV contrast medium (mean volume, 16.4 ml). 22.9% of the patients had at least one risk factor (e.g., allergies, previous allergic reaction to a contrast medium, and renal impairment). 554 patients received pretreatment before contrast medium administration (0.7%). Adverse events were documented and image quality was assessed.

Results

A diagnosis was possible in 99.7% of all cases. Image quality was rated good or excellent in 97.1%. Adverse events (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and urticaria) were observed in 0.34% of the examinations and were mostly rated as minor. There were 8 patients with serious adverse events. The adverse event rate was significantly higher in patients with a history of allergies (0.62%; p < 0.001) and in patients with a previous allergic reaction to contrast medium (1.23%; p < 0.001). There was no elevated incidence of adverse events in patients with renal impairment.

Conclusion

Gadoteric acid is a well-tolerated MRI contrast medium in patients with and without risk factors that is associated with a low rate of adverse events and good or excellent image quality in most patients.

### MR imaging of acute bowel pathology: a pictorial review [^116Awd1Y]. Emergency Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this pictorial essay is to describe magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features of acute processes involving the bowel. While computed tomography (CT) is likely to remain the modality of choice in this setting, the advantages of MR include high soft tissue contrast, lack of ionizing radiation, and the ability to administer gadolinium in patients with a history of allergic reaction to iodinated contrast material. With the increasing utilization of abdominal/pelvic MR, radiologists must recognize the MR features of acute bowel pathology. Key MR findings of a variety of causes of acute abdominal pain are illustrated.

Safety beyond the patient: increasing accessibility to MRI and environmental sustainability

Regarding safety procedures before and after single-patient gadolinium-enhanced MRI scans, the Contrast Media Safety Committee of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR-CMSC) guidelines are the current standard of reference and are periodically reviewed and updated. Thinking beyond the safety of the single patient, the choice of intravenous injection of GBCA in radiology should also incorporate MRI cost-effectiveness, also considering MRI access to the patient community. Based on the multiparametric nature of MRI, there has been an open debate on the additional diagnostic benefit provided by contrast-enhanced images. Pre-exam patient work-up, the risk of extravasation, allergy-like or chemotoxic reactions, the risk of gadolinium retention into tissues despite the lack of clinical consequences, the need for additional staff (i.e. nurses, anesthesiologists), longer times for imaging protocols and post-scan safety checks are the main factors that increase the complexity and the patient discomfort when full MRI scan protocols that include GBCA injection are prescribed. In addition, the systematic inclusion of GBCA in MRI protocols reduces the number of MRI scans per h/per day, therefore decreasing accessibility. All these considerations must be taken into account and cost-effectiveness analyses of unenhanced (in some contexts also called abbreviated protocols) vs enhanced full MRI protocols should be promoted in different clinical applications.

### The use of gadolinium in patients with contrast allergy or renal failure requiring coronary angiography, coronary intervention, or vascular procedure [^113Nrniy]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2011). Low credibility.

Coronary artery angiography remains an important procedure for the assessment of coronary arteries. It requires injection of iodinated contrast for the opacification of coronary arteries. Severe allergy to iodine contrast and renal insufficiency are two main problems with iodine-based contrast media. Gadolinium (Gd) has different chemical structure with no cross reactivity with iodine-based contrast media in patients with iodine allergy. The use of Gd is commonly used in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for image enhancement, making it a potential alternative in patients in whom iodine is contraindicated. The aim of this manuscript is to review the available literature on the use of Gd in patients with contraindication to iodine contrast due to allergy or in patients with severe renal failure requiring coronary or vascular procedures.

The incidence of drug-related AEs was 3.5% in the gadobutrol and the comparator group. Serious AEs (including deaths) were similarly low (< 0.1%) in both groups. For gadobutrol, the most frequent drug-related AEs were headache, nausea, dizziness, injection site reactions, feeling hot, and dysgeusia. With the exception of nausea, 0.7% drug-related cases in both groups, all other drug-related AEs were 0.3% or less. Hypersensitivity reactions were sporadic, that is, less than 0.1% (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Incidence of AEs, Clinical Studies Phase II–IV

The most frequent indication for MRI was CNS imaging, followed by MRA and all other single body regions. Drug-related AEs were recorded in 4.2% and 4.6% for CNS and 3.7% and 4.9% for MRA in the gadobutrol and the comparator group, respectively. In 9 of 182 children (4.9%), drug-related AEs were reported (Table 3).

TABLE 3
Incidence of AEs by MRI Indication of Clinical Studies Phase II–IV

There were no remarkable differences in the incidence of drug-related AEs between patients with or without renal impairment, elevated liver enzymes, or cardiovascular diseases. Patients with history of allergies in general — or specifically allergies to contrast agents — experienced slightly more drug-related AEs. Within the small number of 25 patients with history of allergies to contrast agents, 3 (12%) showed a drug-related AE (Table 4).

### NCCN guidelines insights: uveal melanoma, version 1.2019 [^114m25sj]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). High credibility.

Melanoma: Uveal — imaging for detection and staging of metastasis notes the liver as the most frequent site, with lungs, skin/soft tissue, and bones also affected; modalities of choice are CT chest/ abdomen/pelvis with IV iodinated contrast, CT chest with or without IV contrast, MRI abdomen with IV gadolinium-based contrast, or whole-body FDG-PET/CT. In select patients with renal failure and/or iodinated contrast allergy, MR abdomen with gadolinium-based contrast is the preferred imaging study over CT; if no IV contrast can be administered, MR without contrast is superior to non-enhanced CT. Ultrasound of the liver can be used in select patients but has limited value; brain MRI with IV contrast may be performed if neurologic symptoms are present with routine CNS imaging not recommended; abdominal imaging should be performed with IV contrast unless contraindicated.

### Safety of gadoterate meglumine: a review of 35 Years of clinical use and more than 170 Million doses [^113Y7kAx]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Gadoterate meglumine has been used in clinical practice for over 35 years, with over 170 million doses administered. In a previous publication, the accumulated safety data from 50 clinical studies (phase I–IV), 8 PMS studies and postmarketing pharmacovigilance monitoring of over 8000 adverse events reported to Guerbet were comprehensively discussed. In the current review, our aim was to assess the clinical safety of gadoterate meglumine in published literature, primarily focusing on HSRs, NSF, and gadolinium deposition.

Data from the 10 PMS studies included patients of all age groups from neonates to elderly subjects and confirmed the good safety profile of gadoterate meglumine in clinical practice for MRI of the CNS and other body regions and for MRA examinations, with an ADR rate of 0.25% and serious ADR rate of 0.008%.–

Regarding the HSRs, in the published literature, after a total of 437,369 administrations, the reported incidence of reactions ranged from 0% to 0.58%. Although contrast media are considered to be the main culprits in the advent of an HSR, other factors may be involved in the causality of such reactions. In the SECURE PMS study, 6 out of the 10 patients with HSRs had preexisting allergies or previous reaction to contrast media. Braun et al, in the largest PMS study with gadoterate meglumine to-date, reported 13 (< 0.01%) patients who experienced serious adverse events, including HSRs. A number of these patients, who fully recovered, had preexisting risk factors such as history of allergies, bronchial asthma, history of contrast agent reaction, heart disease, etc. In a large cohort study, the absence of premedication, repeated exposures to the culprit GBCA, and a history of HSRs to iodinated contrast media and GBCAs were also identified as the risk factors for HSRs to GBCAs. Moreover, Power et al analyzed HSRs in a prospective study including over 30,000 MRI examinations and reported that almost half of the patients with a HSR had an identifiable risk factor. Overall, the incidence of HSRs with GBCAs is considered rare; patient's clinical history profiling, premedication, or/and skin testing may be considered to reduce complications in high-risk individuals.

### What looks like a contrast reaction may not be a contrast reaction [^113hxSXJ]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse reactions following the application of a contrast medium are always a challenge for radiologists. To date, little consideration has been given to causality analyses. Hypersensitivity reactions in the context of contrast-enhanced imaging procedures may be caused by the contrast agent, but other culprit agens (such as latex allergy) should be also considered.

### RadioComics-santa claus and the breakthrough reaction [^111YJqDE]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Image-guided examinations are required by all medical disciplines and for a majority of patients. Many imaging challenges need to be enhanced, and every year, several 100 million doses of contrast media (iodinated > gadolinium-based) are applied worldwide. Fortunately, most patients tolerate the administration of a contrast medium (CM) well, and only a minority, approximately 2%, of patients exhibit adverse reactions in the form of hypersensitivity. Patients with a history of mild or moderate reactions (such as urticaria, itching, angioedema, slight shortness of breath, and tachycardia, for example) are at increased risk of reacting again. Traditionally, in such patients, prophylaxis is performed as anti-allergic medication with a corticosteroid only or as a combination of corticosteroid plus H1 antihistamine. This premedication before the next CM-enhanced imaging is intended to reduce the frequency of CM-hypersensitivity reactions in patients at risk. However, premedication targets adverse symptoms only, not the cause of allergy, and therefore is not always effective. If premedication fails, allergic symptoms are still observable and are termed a "breakthrough reaction". We could show that they occur significantly more often when the documented diagnoses are inexact or sloppy. We recently tried a fundamentally different approach to communicating the topic of CM-associated adverse effects and invented a new category of comics, which we term radiocomics. Here, we present a radiocomics addressing breakthrough reactions because, in the context of CM, they are largely unknown (Fig. 1).

### Imaging evaluation for suspected pulmonary embolism: what do emergency physicians and radiologists say? [^114HXAmx]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The utility of various imaging techniques and strategies for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism has been studied in randomized control trials and extensively described in the literature. CT and ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy are the mainstays of diagnosis, and MRI is emerging. The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic approach to pulmonary embolism practiced by emergency physicians and advised by radiologists.

Materials and Methods

Questionnaires were sent to emergency physicians and radiologists in Pennsylvania. The questions covered diagnostic strategies for the detection of pulmonary embolism in the usual situations and in clinical circumstances in which the primary imaging technique is considered less desirable.

Results

Sixty-two radiologists and 52 emergency physicians completed the survey. Ninety percent of radiologists and 96% of emergency physicians answered that CT was their first-line choice for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The use of ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy increased in the care of patients with renal failure and allergy to iodinated contrast material. MRI was chosen infrequently.

Conclusion

CT is the overwhelmingly preferred technique for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The role of ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy increases when the use of iodinated contrast material is contraindicated. MRI does not seem to have an important role in practice.

### A five-year-old boy with anaphylaxis reaction to gadolinium-based MR contrast medium: a case report [^112F8una]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Anaphylactic reactions due to gadolinium-based magnetic resonance (MR) contrast media are rare. Their incidence is even lower in pediatric patients. However, when they do occur, they can be life-threatening. Thus, caution must be exercised. MRI tests typically have a longer test duration than CT scans. It is difficult to determine a patient's condition with an MRI because the patient and the operator are separated due to the magnetic field. Moreover, in the case of children, examinations are often conducted after a sedation, making diagnosis more difficult. A monitoring device is required to immediately identify the patient's condition. The operator should always closely monitor the patient with possible side effects in mind. Sufficient training for medical staff in the examination room is needed to take prompt action in the event of any adverse reactions. Thus, close attention is needed and care should be taken. For this reason, it may be useful to educate not only medical staff, but also patients and guardians to recognize that this disease is a fatal emergency. It is important to provide patients with documents recording anaphylaxis symptoms and medical help request methods as there is a possibility of recurrence.

### Management and prevention of hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: a consensus statement from the American college of radiology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^111MQeBR]. Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Prevention of delayed reactions to iodinated contrast media — premedication and agent switching: The available evidence does not support premedication as a strategy to prevent recurrent reactions, with only a small retrospective study showing a possible benefit for steroid use before and after intervention in nonsevere delayed reactions. Cross-reactivity among different ICM agents has been described for both immediate and delayed reactions, with a higher rate in delayed reactions compared with immediate reactions. To date, no formal evidence-based recommendations can be formulated concerning direct switching for patients reporting non-SCAR delayed reactions, and the final decision about direct switching should be made by the patient and treating physician and depends on the indication for the study. For patients with a history of delayed reactions to ICM, there is no evidence to support premedication as a strategy to prevent recurrent reactions; patients with a SCAR to ICM should strictly avoid ICM in the future, and for non-SCAR reactions the decision to use contrast and whether to direct switch should be made by the patient and treating physician depending on the need of the study and the reaction history.

### Lumbar discography using gadolinium in patients with iodine contrast allergy followed by postdiscography computed tomography scan [^111aVCCC]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

A series of four case reports are presented. OBJECTIVE The case reports document completion of lumbar discography with gadolinium contrast followed by successful computed tomography scanning of intradiscal gadolinium.

Summary Of Background Data

Lumbar discography using gadolinium in cases of iodinated contrast allergy with magnetic resonance imaging used to visualize intradiscal gadolinium after the procedure has been described. To the authors' knowledge, there are no reports of gadolinium discography followed by computed tomography scanning of intradiscal gadolinium.

Methods

The reported cases involved a chart review, performance of discography with gadolinium under fluoroscopic guidance, and postdiscography computed tomography scanning of the discs injected during the procedure.

Results

Gadolinium was visible under fluoroscopy in all four cases. It was visualized on postdiscography computed tomography scans performed both early and late after the procedure. Normal discs retained gadolinium for a longer period than discs with annular disruption.

Conclusions

Gadolinium discography is a safe, viable alternative to conventional discography in the setting of a patient with iodinated contrast allergy. Postdiscography computed tomography scans adequately visualize intradiscal gadolinium in a more timely and cost-effective manner than magnetic resonance imaging.

### Prospective multicenter assessment of patient preferences for properties of gadolinium-based contrast media and their potential socioeconomic impact in a screening breast MRI setting [^114Hf3f9]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Patients at intermediate or high risk for breast cancer undergoing screening MRI screening strongly prioritize cancer detection (attribute importance 44.3%) over GBCM-related risks (attribute importance 11.6–19.5%). This is predictable because patients undergo a test when they perceive the benefits outweigh the risks. It also implies that clinically meaningful differences in GBCM relaxivity are likely to be valued by patients. Among GBCM-related risks, patients place greater importance on allergic-like reactions (17.0–19.5%) than gadolinium retention (11.6%), and greater importance on gadolinium retention (11.6%) than out-of-pocket cost (7.5%). These relationships are maintained regardless of patient demographics and background, but the degree of importance patients place on these attributes varies by household income and presence of a college education. We believe these data can be used to inform the selection or innovation of contrast media for patients undergoing repeated lifetime contrast-enhanced MRI — a population potentially at greatest risk of GBCM-related side effects.

GBCM selection from the patient's perspective is more nuanced than the recent focused attention on gadolinium retention. This point is relevant because newly described potential risks like gadolinium retention sometimes can receive outsized importance in clinical decision-making. In our population, gadolinium retention and cost were less important to patients than allergic-like reaction risks and cancer detection sensitivity. The slightly greater importance patients placed on mild vs. severe reactions likely relates to the ranges of tested prevalence (mild, 10–1000/100,000; severe, 1–19/100,000). The rarity of severe reactions likely counterbalanced their severity. This also illustrates that, from the patient's perspective, "nuisance" mild reactions have relevance and that relevance is prioritized over the uncertain clinical importance of gadolinium retention. Reaction rates probably should be considered at least as important as (if not more important than) gadolinium retention during GBCM selection.

### MRI evaluation prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI): when to acquire and how to interpret [^115KnhkR]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is increasingly being used in patients with severe aortic stenosis who are not candidates for surgery. ECG-gated CT angiography (CTA) plays an important role in the preoperative planning for these devices. As the number of patients undergoing these procedures increases, a subset of patients is being recognized who have contraindications to iodinated contrast medium, either due to a prior severe allergic type reaction or poor renal function. Another subgroup of patients with low flow and low gradient aortic stenosis is being recognized that are usually assessed for severity of aortic stenosis by stress echocardiography. There are contraindications to stress echocardiography and some of these patients may not be able to undergo this test. Non-contrast MRI can be a useful emerging modality for evaluating these patients. In this article, we discuss the emerging indications of non-contrast MRI in preoperative assessment for TAVI and describe the commonly used MRI sequences. A comparison of the most important measurements obtained for TAVI assessment on CTA and MRI from same subjects is included.

Teaching Points

- MRI can be used for preoperative assessment of aortic annulus.

- MRI is an alternate to CTA when iodinated contrast is contraindicated.

- Measurements obtained by non-contrast MRI are similar to contrast enhanced CTA.

- MRI can be used to assess severity of aortic stenosis.

Post-ablation imaging features and triggers — Patients who cannot receive IV contrast due to renal dysfunction or allergies should still undergo cross-sectional MRI (preferably, and ideally contrast-enhanced) or CT scan to assess for regression and to monitor for new nodularity or growth. Any growth in size of the treated lesion, lack of regression over time, new nodularity, or enhancement beyond six months from ablation would be concerning and should prompt further investigation, including a biopsy as needed. Immediate post-procedural imaging typically shows the treatment bed to be larger than the pre-treatment tumor size for RFA and for cryoablation due to extension of the iceball beyond the original tumor margin. Radiological evolution is characterized by significant shrinkage and loss of contrast enhancement on CT, and tumors successfully treated by RFA demonstrate progressive decrease in size and enhancement but often minimal shrinkage on cross-sectional imaging. On MRI, the imaging hallmark of successful renal tumor ablation is lack of tumor enhancement with gadolinium-enhanced imaging, and rim enhancement may occasionally be seen early after RFA or cryoablation, which later resolves.

ACC/AHA 2022 aortic disease guideline — surveillance after thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) repair: In patients treated with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), surveillance imaging with computed tomography (CT) is recommended after 1 month and 12 months and, if stable, annually thereafter (COR 1; LOE B-NR). In patients treated with TEVAR, longitudinal surveillance with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reasonable alternative to CT for reduction of long-term radiation exposure or avoidance of an iodinated contrast allergy (COR 2a; LOE B-NR). In patients treated with open repair of the thoracic aorta without residual aortopathy, surveillance imaging with a CT or MRI within 1 year postoperatively and then every 5 years thereafter is reasonable (COR 2a; LOE B-NR). In patients treated with open repair of the thoracic aorta who have residual aortopathy or abnormal findings on surveillance imaging, annual surveillance imaging is reasonable (COR 2a; LOE C-EO).

Intravenous iodinated contrast media (ICM) is widely used in the United States, and it is imperative to provide guidance on the management of adverse reactions to ICM as well as the preparation, planning, and potential premedication for patients with previous reactions. Currently there is a discordance between the American College of Radiology Contrast Manual, which recommends premedication to prevent repeat hypersensitivity reactions to ICM, and the Anaphylaxis 2020 Practice Parameters Update, which recommends against routine administration of glucocorticoids and/or antihistamines to prevent anaphylaxis with prior ICM hypersensitivity reactions. A task force of experts from radiology who are also members of the American College of Radiology Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media and expert allergists/immunologists including members of the Adverse Reactions to Drugs, Biologics and Latex Committee of American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology evaluated the scientific evidence to develop consensus recommendations that are endorsed by both organizations. The task force took into account the strength of evidence and balanced the potential risks of recurrent reactions with those of premedication and product avoidance when making these recommendations to improve and standardize the care of patients who experience or have a history of reaction to ICM.

### Hypersensitivity reactions to contrast media: part 1. management of immediate and non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions in adults. updated guidelines by the ESUR contrast media safety committee [^114Dc3VU]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for HR to ICM can be categorized into patient-related, CM-related, and procedure-related factors. These factors are not yet fully defined and remain a topic of ongoing debate. Most available data do not clearly distinguish between ADR and HR, and are derived from non-controlled, retrospective observational studies that lack comparisons with appropriately matched control groups. Although multiple potential risk factors for HR have been described, it must be emphasized that most patients with these risk factors do not experience any reaction upon administration of CM.

In an overview of risk factors for HR after ICM use (Online Supplement 2), the most consistent factor predicting a future HR is a history of a previous HR to ICM (OR 27.6–198.8), which is reflected in all guidelines. A history of (drug or other) allergic diseases has lower and less consistent predictive values (OR 1.21–6.8). Numerous minor factors such as female sex, age below 50 years, history of (uncontrolled) asthma or chronic urticaria, and multiple co-morbidities (e.g. cardiovascular, oncologic, or chronic liver disease) are less consistent and have weaker predictive values (OR 1.45–3.0) but are used additionally in specific clinical guidelines. The risk from co-morbidities may be attributable to the fact that these patients often undergo multiple imaging procedures with ICM, rather than an inherent predisposition, or may be due to the use of immunomodulatory medications. Anyway, the risk of a history of multiple well-documented allergies or minor risk factors can be additive, leading to a more severe clinical presentation, which may be particularly relevant in unstable patients.

The purpose of this article is to review the benefit and added value and advantages of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared with other cross-sectional imaging in patients presenting with abdominopelvic emergencies. During the past decade, there has been increased utilization of MRI in the emergency department with widespread availability of MR scanners, improvement in rapid imaging techniques, and methods to overcome motion-related artifacts. This has benefited patients at higher risk of radiation, particularly children and pregnant women, and patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast including allergy and renal dysfunction. Still the challenges are: on site MR scanner in the emergency department, after-hour services, as well as availability of time slot to rapidly scan emergency patient. MRI has additional advantages over other imaging modalities due to its high contrast resolution, which allows it to better characterize tissue and fluid collections, and may avoid the need for intravenous contrast. Radiologists must be familiar with the role and added value of MRI, spectrum of imaging findings, and problem-oriented modified MR protocols in abdominal and pelvic emergencies. In part 1, we will discuss the utility of MRI in gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic diseases. In part 2, the authors will focus on the key MR imaging features of female pelvic gynecological diseases, pregnancy related complications, abdominal vascular complications, and renal diseases.

### Hypersensitivity reactions to contrast media: part 2. prevention of recurrent hypersensitivity reactions in adults. updated guidelines by the ESUR contrast media safety committee [^115zVc8g]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Contrast Media Safety Committee (CMSC) of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) updated its guidelines on the prevention of hypersensitivity reactions (HR) to intravascular (intravenous (IV) or intra-arterial (IA)) administration of contrast media (CM).

To prevent a recurrent HR, it is essential to ascertain whether the patient has previously experienced a reaction following a contrast-enhanced examination, with established symptoms of an HR, according to the description included in Part I of this update, based on the American College of Radiology (ACR) Manual on Contrast Media. Additionally, it is a priority to identify the specific CM involved. Unfortunately, the details of previous HR are frequently unavailable or inadequately documented. Therefore, it is recommended to implement a questionnaire to ensure that, among other possible risk factors, information about previous adverse reactions is accurately collected.

It has long been known that the evidence for administering premedication to prevent HR to CM is very weak, and its use is recently getting reduced in multiple countries. The role of the allergologist is expanding, and recently allergy assessments have shown to be cost-effective and have considerably improved the prevention of recurrent HR to CM, allowing for selection of safe alternative CM for follow-up imaging.

The purpose of Part 2 is to provide general recommendations on how to effectively manage a patient with a history of a HR to intravascular administration of CM, who is scheduled for a contrast-enhanced examination. Given the considerable variation in the availability of allergologists across Europe, as well as differences in the types of CM used, these recommendations aim to establish a framework for local protocols tailored to the specific circumstances of each institution.

The following aspects will be covered: In vitro tests to diagnose HR to CM, skin tests (ST), and drug provocation tests (DPT) to identify subjects with true hypersensitivity to one or more specific CM and to identify the safest alternative CM, and measures to prevent or minimize the risk of recurrent HR to CM.

Iodinated contrast media (ICM) skin testing — Trautmann et al (2019) retrospective cohort: A German cohort (n = 45), 32 with history of immediate HSR underwent IDT (1:10) to a battery of ICM and IV challenge with 49-mL total dosed at 30-min increments. ST-positive patients (11) were categorized as allergic and ST-negative patients (21) as nonallergic; all ST-positive patients had moderate to severe anaphylaxis, whereas ST-negative patients had only urticaria. Of 10 allergic patients, all tolerated IV challenge with ST-negative alternative RCM, and the authors note IDT highly sensitive in identifying allergic patients while DPT with ST negative ICM is safe and helps to identify a tolerated alternative ICM.

Contrast reactions

Gadolinium-based contrast agents are used in MR for demonstration of vascular structures or to improve contrast resolution of tissues. In comparison with other radiological contrast agents, Gd-CAs are relatively safe with a high therapeutic ratio and low incidence of anaphylaxis (approximately 1:100 000). The side-effects of Gd-CAs are generally mild and include headache, nausea and vomiting, local burning, skin wheals (2%), itching, sweating, facial swelling and thrombophlebitis. More severe reactions have occurred and radiology staff should be familiar with guidelines related to the management of suspected anaphylaxis.

### Anaphylaxis to iodinated contrast material: nonallergic hypersensitivity or IgE-mediated allergy? [^1165X2GZ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Contrast material is generally well tolerated although approximately 1% of patients who receive low-osmolar nonionic contrast material will develop anaphylaxis symptoms. Because most anaphylactic reactions are mild and nonallergic, clinically mimicking immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy, diagnostic skin testing has been discussed controversially in the past and prophylactic pretreatment drug regimens are recommended instead. In the past 6 years, all patients with contrast material-induced anaphylaxis have been subjected to allergologic diagnostic procedures to clearly differentiate allergic and nonallergic anaphylaxis. Thus the purpose of our study was to identify and differentiate IgE-mediated allergy and nonallergic contrast material-induced hypersensitivity. Furthermore, the objective of our diagnostic procedures was not only to identify the culprit contrast material but also to find alternative contrast material for future radiologic interventions.

Subjects and Methods

We evaluated 96 patients with anaphylaxis symptoms after contrast material application using standardized intradermal skin testing. In patients with positive skin tests, the IgE-mediated allergy was further evaluated with in vitro and challenge tests.

Results

In four patients (suffering from anaphylaxis grades 2 and 3) out of the 96 (4.2%), skin tests and basophil activation tests strongly suggested IgE-mediated allergy to the contrast materials iopromide (two patients), iomeprol, and iopentol. In two patients with allergies to iopromide and iomeprol, alternative nonionic monomer contrast materials were tolerated, as identified in controlled challenge tests with iopamidol and iopromide, respectively.

Conclusion

The evaluation of patients with contrast material-induced anaphylaxis (at least those with anaphylaxis ≥ grade 2) should always include appropriate skin tests ensuring that patients with an IgE-mediated allergy are not missed. Moreover, allergologic testing may identify a contrast material of the group of nonionic monomers that will be tolerated in future radiologic interventions.

### Risk factor analysis of iodinated contrast medium-related hypersensitivity reactions [^11786Vki]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Cross-reactive ICM

Currently, the application of a non-culprit contrast agent is established radiological practice. In this context, the question arises as to which alternative contrast agent is safest. Although the chemical structures of ICM molecules are all very similar, there are minimal differences. Based on these differences, Schmidt et al distinguished eight groups of ICM. Theoretically, cross-reactivity can occur within such a group. Consequently, it seems logical to select the alternative ICM from a group that does not belong to the culprit one to avoid cross-reactivity.

However, it turns out that the risks within and outside these chemical ICM-groups do not meet expectations (although individual data give a different impression). This means there need not be any reactivity within the chemical group. In other words, each patient appears to have an individual reaction pattern, without the chemical groups of the ICM seeming to play a significant role. Consequently, radiologists do not need to know the chemical groups, but, if necessary, should send the patient for an allergy test to determine the individual reaction profile.

Risk status: none to low.

Management: apply non-culprit ICM.

Materials and methods

Literature search

We performed a careful literature search by using the PubMed online database and the following keywords in different combinations: "iodinated contrast media", "hypersensitivity", "allergy", "allergy-like reaction", and "risk factor". We also searched in detail for keywords such as "age", "gender", "history of ICM hypersensitivity", for example. In addition, we searched literature from other sources, such as the reference lists of identified publications.

We included review papers, original papers, case reports, adverse drug reactions (ADR) induced by ICM, and paper languages in either English or German that were freely available online. We excluded papers that deal with contrast-induced acute kidney injury, focus on gadolinium-based and ultrasound contrast agents and/or are presented in other languages.

Risk definition and classification

We define risk for the acquisition of ICM-HSR as a special condition (e.g. previous history of ICM hypersensitivity, acute allergic asthma) or insufficient documentation of such a condition in the past in individual patients. The aim of identifying risks is to carry out adequate risk management, i.e. to develop strategies to minimize or completely control the risks. In the first step, we classified the risks in terms of the cause (patient-, ICM-, and procedure-/management-related risks). In the second step, we specifically listed the risks. Then we analyzed their risk status as high, medium, low or non-existent. Finally, we provide recommendations for individual management based on literature data and our expertise.

Definition of type A and B reactions

According to Rawlins and Thompson, type A reactions are predictable, common, and related to the pharmacological properties of the drug. In contrast, type B reactions are hypersensitivity reactions (allergy (allergy test positive, either intradermal or patch test) and non-allergy) that are unpredictable, uncommon, and usually not related to the pharmacological properties of the drug. We mainly focus on type B reactions, but also mention type A reactions when it helps to understand the whole context for completeness. The term "adverse reaction" covers all reaction types (i.e. type A and B reactions). Where necessary, we explain the term in the text.

Iodinated contrast media myths — general allergy as a risk factor: In 1975, a prospective study of doctors associated with adverse reaction to high-osmolality contrast media (HOCM) in 112 of 203 patients described an association of allergy with a greater rate of adverse reaction from contrast infusion, concluding that "the overall incidence of adverse reactions in patients with allergy is about twice that in the general population". This study had several methodologic weaknesses including questionnaire-only data without corroborating testing, no verification of self-described allergic conditions, and lack of distinction between anaphylaxis-type reactions and vasovagal, hemodynamic, or other adverse reactions.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^1141TmRS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Imaging for primary tinnitus — utility, risks, and costs: Computerized tomography (CT) uses ionizing radiation with a typical head CT exposure of 4 mSv, which is equivalent to approximately 40 chest radiographs or 10 mammograms, and background radon exposure is estimated at 2 mSv annually. Iodinated contrast introduces risks including allergic reactions and nephrotoxicity, with severe or very severe reactions ranging from 0.22% to 0.04%, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more expensive and often less accessible, with gadolinium linked to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and procedure noise that may exacerbate preexisting tinnitus. Example costs reported are $392 to $668 for a head CT angiographic study and $529 to $871 for a head MRI with and without contrast. Given the low yield and potential downsides, routine imaging of isolated or primary tinnitus has reduced utility, and imaging should be directed by the presence or absence of associated symptoms such as unilateral or asymmetric hearing loss or cranial neuropathy.

### CT and MR imaging of cystic renal lesions [^111tJ799]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

CT or MRI: advantages and disadvantages

Contrast-enhanced CT is the modality of choice in evaluating cystic renal masses. Narrow detector thickness (< 1 mm) and intravenous administration of contrast agent are mandatory to detect thin septa and small enhancing nodules. Also, demonstration of enhancing areas helps differentiate solid components from hemorrhage or debris. MRI is used when CT is contraindicated (e.g. patients with allergy to iodinated contrast agent) or as a problem-solving modality for equivocal findings. Indeed, MRI can show some septa that are less apparent at CT and demonstrate definitive enhancement in those cysts that show only equivocal enhancement at CT. As a consequence, renal cysts can be placed in a higher Bosniak category with MRI than with CT.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^116P1D1a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult neck mass imaging — intravenous contrast use indicates that regardless of whether CT or MRI is performed, intravenous contrast should always be used, unless there is a contraindication, such as contrast allergy, renal insufficiency, or prior diagnosis that excludes the use of contrast, because contrast improves characterization of the mass, particularly with regard to distinguishing cystic from solid lesions; it helps map lesion borders; and it improves identification of potentially small primary sites in the upper aerodigestive tract. There is rarely added benefit to performing a noncontrast CT scan prior to contrast administration, and ordering a CT with and without contrast should be avoided because of the doubled radiation dose. Renal insufficiency may preclude contrast administration in both CT and MRI examinations, and the MRI contrast agent gadolinium is responsible for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, a rare but highly morbid condition associated with fibrosis of the skin, joints, eyes, and organs. In the setting of severe renal insufficiency, a noncontrast MRI offers a small benefit over noncontrast CT because of its inherent superior soft tissue characterization.

ASCRS surveillance — radiographic imaging after stage II/III colon or rectal cancer: After completing treatment for stage II/III colon or rectal cancer, radiographic surveillance should typically include cross-sectional chest and abdominopelvic CT imaging. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. Imaging typically uses CT with intravenous and oral contrast or MRI for contrast allergies, and the current NCCN guidelines recommend abdominopelvic imaging every 6 to 12 months for a total of 5 years with the caveat that obtaining imaging more frequently than yearly is a lower grade practice recommendation; the grade for this statement was changed from 1B to 1A.

### Reactions to both nonionic iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast media: incidence and clinical characteristics [^117RT71F]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective or our study was to assess the incidence rate and clinical characteristics of allergiclike reactions in patients who received both nonionic iodinated contrast medium (ICM) and gadolinium-based contrast medium (GBCM).

Materials and Methods

Acute allergiclike reactions in patients who received both ICM and GBCM to nonionic ICM or GBCM injections during a 5-year period were analyzed. Allergy preparation was not administered when patients received a different type of contrast material. Acute allergiclike reactions to both ICM and GBCM were evaluated.

Results

Of 302,858 contrast injections (155,234 ICM and 147,624 GBCM) during a 5-year period, 1006 (752 ICM and 254 GBCM) acute allergiclike contrast reactions were reported. The overall rate of reaction to ICM was 0.48% (95% CI, 0.45–0.52%), and the overall rate of reaction to GBCM was 0.17% (95% CI, 0.15–0.19%). A total of 19,237 patients received at least one ICM injection and one GBCM injection, with a total of 56,310 injections (19,237 initial injections and 37,073 subsequent injections). Nine patients had reactions to both ICM and GBCM with the primary reaction rate of 9/19,237 (incidence rate, 0.047%; 95% CI, 0.044–0.050%), and the secondary reaction rate of 9/37,073 (incidence rate, 0.024%; 95% CI, 0.023–0.026%). All secondary reactions in patients who had a reaction to both ICM and GBCM were mild. None of the patients required medication for the treatment of the secondary reaction.

Conclusion

An allergiclike reaction to both nonionic ICM and GBCM was an extremely rare event that presented as a mild acute reaction without significant clinical consequences despite the fact that an allergy preparation was not administered.

### Hypersensitivity reactions to contrast media: part 1. management of immediate and non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions in adults. updated guidelines by the ESUR contrast media safety committee [^1123iTpG]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of inducing HR by the type of nonionic ICM remains inconclusive. Whereas individual studies found moderate predictive values for (severe) IHR (OR 3.1–6.8) for iomeprol and iopromide with variable comparators, a recent meta-analysis did not have sufficient data for analysis of HR.

Recent studies in large adult patient cohorts focusing on HR after GBCA have shown low incidence rates of 0.06–0.17%, with severe reactions occurring in 0.003–0.006%. In the largest Korean cohort, incidence was higher, for IHR 0.4% and for NIHR 0.04%.

What is outlined above for risk factors for HR to ICM also applies to GBCA. In an overview of risk factors for HR after GBCA use (Online Supplement 3), a prior HR to GBCA had the highest risk (12-fold higher frequency). A history of allergic diseases had a moderate predictive value (OR 2.83). Minor factors like female sex, age below 50 years, type of MRI, and outpatient status have weaker predictive values (OR 1.4–2.0).

The specific GBCA agent seems more important with higher frequencies or predictive values (OR 3.0–8.0) for gadobutrol, gadoteridol, gadobenate, and gadoxetate. In a meta-analysis, the overall rate of IHR was 0.09%, with severe reactions occurring in 0.005%. Linear nonionic GBCA had a lower rate (0.015%), while nonionic macrocyclic GBCA (0.16%) and linear ionic GBCA with protein-binding (0.17%) had higher IHR rates.

### Management and prevention of hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: a consensus statement from the American college of radiology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^1135J6sw]. Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis to iodinated contrast media — diagnostic criteria, monitoring window, and tryptase testing should be considered when the acute onset of illness occurs "within minutes after intravenous ICM administration and in the absence of other known allergens or triggers", and anaphylaxis is considered likely if "any two or more of these criteria are met": involvement of skin or mucosal tissue, respiratory compromise, reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction with the note that severe hypotension may preclude other symptoms and should be considered when there is no other source within minutes of intravenous ICM, or significant or persistent vomiting and/or severe diarrhea with the note that such gastrointestinal symptoms alone do not meet the criteria. Because most anaphylaxis cases occur "within 15 to 30 minutes after administration of contrast", monitoring of routine patients who have received intravenous ICM "should fall within this time frame". For adjunctive confirmation, "A serum tryptase value elevated above baseline collected between 30 minutes and several hours (ideally 2 hours but potentially up to 4 to 6 hours) after symptom onset supports a diagnosis of anaphylaxis", though it "has no role in acute diagnosis and management", and "A serum tryptase that is not elevated lacks optimal sensitivity to rule out a diagnosis of anaphylaxis".

### MR lumbar discography with intradiscal gadolinium in patients with severe anaphylactoid reaction to iodinated contrast material [^116z9nRW]. Pain Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Describe our experience using discography with intradiscal gadolinium and MR lumbar discography in patients with a history of severe anaphylactoid reaction to iodinated radiocontrast agents.

Design

Observational study of 14 patients.

Methods

From 1997 to 1999, 14 patients were referred for lumbar discography with intradiscal gadolinium followed by MRI. Patients with a history of a severe anaphylactoid reaction to iodinated radiocontrast media or those who refused the use of iodinated contrast material were included in the study.

Results

In fourteen patients, 58 discs were studied. The post discography MRIs identified seven annular tears and seven annular fissures. None of the fourteen patients reported symptoms suggestive of allergic reaction either during or after discography.

Conclusions

Discography using intradiscal administration of gadolinium followed by MRI provides a method of obtaining a clinically pertinent study in a subset of patients who likely would not be offered the procedure, secondary to severe anaphylactoid reactions to iodinated contrast materials.

### Don't routinely order low-or iso-osmolar radiocontrast… [^117BVBw8]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Although the exact mechanism for contrast media reactions is unknown, there is no cause and effect connection with seafood allergy. Consequently there is no reason to use more expensive agents or pre-medication before using contrast media in patients with a history of seafood allergy. A prior history of anaphylaxis to contrast media is an indication to use low- or iso-osmolar agents and pretreat with corticosteroids and antihistamines. Patients with a history of seafood allergy are not at elevated risk for anaphylaxis from iodinated contrast media. Similarly, patients who have had anaphylaxis from contrast media should not be told that they are allergic to seafood.

Patients with a history of seafood allergy who are labeled as being at greater risk for adverse reaction from contrast infusions experience considerable morbidity from unnecessary precautions, including but not limited to denying them indicated roentgenographic procedures and adverse effects from pretreatment with antihistamine and/or corticosteroid medications. Regardless of whether these patients truly have IgE-mediated allergies to seafood, there is no evidence in the medical literature that indicates they are at elevated risk for anaphylaxis from contrast infusion compared with the history-negative general population. In a random telephone survey of 5, 529 households with a census of 14, 948 individuals, seafood allergy was reported by 3. 3% of survey respondents. According to current U. S. population estimates for 2013, this corresponds to 10, 395, 000 Americans.

The mechanism for anaphylaxis to radio-iodinated contrast media relates to the physiochemical properties of these media and is unrelated to its iodine content. Further, although delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to iodine have rarely been reported, IgE-mediated reactions to iodine have not, and neither type of reaction would be related to IgE-mediated shellfish allergy nor to contrast media reactions. Patients with a history of prior anaphylaxis to contrast media are at elevated risk for anaphylactic reaction with re-exposure to contrast media. Patients with asthma or cardiovascular disease, or who are taking beta blockers, are at increased risk for serious anaphylaxis from radiographic contrast media.

### Iopamidol… [^117MfpCH]. Wikipedia (2008). Low credibility.

Iopamidol, sold under the brand name Isovue among others, is a nonionic, low-osmolar iodinated contrast agent, developed by Bracco Diagnostics. It is available in various concentrations, from 200 to 370 mgI/mL. Medical uses Iopamidol is indicated for angiography throughout the cardiovascular system, including cerebral and peripheral arteriography, coronary arteriography and ventriculography, pediatric angiocardiography, selective visceral arteriography and aortography, peripheral venography, and adult and pediatric intravenous excretory urography and intravenous adult and pediatric contrast enhancement of computed tomographic head and body imaging. It is also indicated for intrathecal administration in adult neuroradiology including myelography, and for contrast enhancement of computed tomographic cisternography and ventriculography.

Isovue-M 200 is indicated for thoraco-lumbar myelography in children over the age of two years. As with other iodinated contrast agents there are concerns regarding safety, particularly relating to effects on renal function and allergic type reaction. Early generations of intravenous contrast carried considerable nephrotoxicity, necessitating continual assessment of renal function. IV and PO fluids are encouraged post operation to facilitate excretion of contrast. Shellfish allergies have previously thought to have crossover with iodine allergies with caution being advised with regards to the use of iodinated contrast in patients with shellfish, however shellfish have been demonstrated to be due to proteins produced by the organisms, not due to iodine.
