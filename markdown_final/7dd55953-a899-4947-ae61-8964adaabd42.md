## Question

Which parameters should be monitored when initiating Losartan in a patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which parameters should be monitored when initiating losartan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline assessment and risk stratification. Then, I should detail first-dose precautions. Next, I will set the early follow-up laboratory timeline, followed by longer-term surveillance. I need to incorporate dose titration strategy and combination therapy, review drug–drug interactions, and address special populations such as pregnancy, CKD, hepatic impairment, the elderly, pediatrics, and acutely ill patients. Finally, I will link monitoring to outcomes and ensure a safety net for adherence and quality gaps.

> Let me first confirm the baseline assessment elements I cannot skip: measure blood pressure properly (triplicate seated clinic readings and, if feasible, home BP monitoring or ambulatory BP to anchor targets and detect white-coat effects), check serum potassium and creatinine with eGFR, assess intravascular volume status, document all prescribed/OTC drugs that raise potassium or impair renal perfusion (e.g. NSAIDs), and in women of childbearing potential, check pregnancy status because losartan is contraindicated in pregnancy; if hepatic disease is suspected, obtain LFTs; in diabetes/CKD, get a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio to quantify baseline proteinuria and future response [^112HDwCB] [^112h5r8W] [^113jWG18] [^111r5wu5] [^112nufoN] [^111UGunH] [^112LaArK] [^1111gGqm].

> Hold on, I should verify the initial dosing and any adjustments before we monitor: standard starting dose is 50 mg once daily, with a lower 25 mg start in mild to moderate hepatic impairment due to markedly increased exposure; in elderly patients, no routine adjustment is needed; in CKD, exposure is higher, but the label does not require dose reduction — monitor more frequently instead; twice-daily split dosing can improve trough coverage if needed based on BP profile, so I should consider it if end-of-dose BP is suboptimally controlled [^111UGunH] [^114nNq1n] [^1172Jxfr].

> Wait, let me verify early safety in the first 24 hours: the main acute risk is symptomatic hypotension in volume-depleted states or with interacting drugs; I need to ensure euvolemia, review and avoid NSAIDs that can attenuate BP response and precipitate renal dysfunction, and educate the patient about orthostatic precautions and symptom reporting; if NSAIDs must be used, plan renal function monitoring more closely [^1149fizo] [^111r5wu5].

> Next, I should review the early follow-up labs: for high-risk patients (CKD, CHF, baseline K+ > 4.5 mmol/L, or eGFR < 60), check serum potassium and creatinine/eGFR within 1 week of initiation or dose increase; for others, recheck at about 10–14 days, and after any clinically significant medication or volume status change; I should also have the patient record daily home BP for the first 1–2 weeks to inform titration and detect hypotension [^113jWG18] [^111r5wu5] [^112HDwCB].

> I will now examine longer-term surveillance once a dose is stable: repeat potassium and creatinine periodically and after each dose change, with closer intervals in CKD, the elderly, and those on potassium-raising agents; maintain home BP monitoring to track control, adding ambulatory BP when diagnostic clarification is needed; in patients with diabetes or CKD, reassess UACR around 3 months because losartan's antiproteinuric effect is typically evident by then and correlates with kidney outcomes; continued periodic UACR monitoring helps link therapy to cardiovascular risk reduction [^111r5wu5] [^112oho4f] [^112LaArK] [^1111gGqm].

> Let me think about titration and when to combine therapy: if BP is not at goal and labs are acceptable, uptitrate losartan to 100 mg daily, noting that further dose increases above 100 mg often add little BP effect; for proteinuria, 100 mg appears near-optimal; if BP remains above target, add a low-dose thiazide such as hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg, which substantially augments BP lowering; initial combination therapy achieves faster BP control and uniform responses across renin phenotypes in trials, but I should individualize based on patient risk and monitoring capacity [^1172Jxfr] [^113tdYZK] [^113yZN6o] [^111N7KCo] [^113gqDFC].

> I need to ensure I am not missing key drug–drug interaction monitoring: avoid dual RAS blockade with ACE inhibitors or aliskiren due to increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal dysfunction; if lithium is co-prescribed, plan lithium level monitoring; avoid or minimize NSAIDs and monitor renal function if unavoidable; be alert that rifampin can reduce losartan exposure and blunt efficacy, prompting BP reassessment; systematically review all potassium-raising agents (e.g., potassium-sparing diuretics, trimethoprim) before and after initiation [^1149fizo] [^111UGunH] [^111r5wu5].

> But wait, what about special populations and conditions: in pregnancy, losartan is contraindicated — test before initiation in women of childbearing potential, counsel on contraception, and if exposure occurs, stop the drug and arrange serial ultrasounds; neonates exposed in utero require monitoring for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia; in pediatrics, pharmacokinetics are broadly comparable to adults, but I should maintain the same renal and potassium surveillance; in acutely ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients not previously on ARBs, initiating losartan raised safety concerns with hypotension in one RCT — avoid starting in that setting, whereas continuation of chronic ARBs is generally supported by other trials; remember losartan is not dialyzable, so toxicity must be managed supportively [^112nufoN] [^114nNq1n] [^113yZN6o] [^1149fizo] [^111UGunH].

> I should double-check that the monitoring I propose is tied to meaningful outcomes to keep the plan patient-centered: in LIFE and related labeling analyses, losartan-based therapy reduced stroke compared with atenolol despite similar office BP, underscoring the importance of sustained control and appropriate combinations; in diabetic nephropathy, losartan reduced doubling of creatinine and ESRD and lowered proteinuria by roughly a third, often within 3 months — hence tracking BP and UACR together is clinically actionable [^1134vNNs] [^112Qv6My] [^112LaArK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about systems reliably catching everything: real-world data show lab monitoring at initiation is frequently missed, so I should build prompts for baseline and follow-up potassium/creatinine, document OTC NSAID avoidance, and ensure a clear plan for critical value callbacks; partnering with pharmacists and using structured HBPM improves safety and adherence to the monitoring calendar [^116aWMYx] [^112HDwCB] [^1155QSMJ].

> Let me summarize the cadence so I don't miss a step: baseline BP/HBPM, potassium, creatinine/eGFR, UACR when indicated, pregnancy test when relevant, and medication/volume status review; start 50 mg daily (25 mg if hepatic impairment), ensure euvolemia, avoid NSAIDs; recheck potassium and creatinine/eGFR at 1 week in high-risk or 10–14 days otherwise with HBPM review; titrate to 100 mg if needed, add thiazide if still above goal; once stable, continue periodic labs and BP monitoring, and reassess UACR at about 3 months to confirm renal response; throughout, manage interactions and special populations proactively [^113jWG18] [^111r5wu5] [^111UGunH] [^111N7KCo] [^112LaArK].

---

Monitor **blood pressure** and **renal function** (serum creatinine/eGFR) at baseline, 1–2 weeks [^113jWG18], and after dose changes, then every 3–6 months [^111r5wu5]. Check **serum potassium** at the same intervals [^113jWG18], especially in CKD, diabetes, or with potassium-sparing drugs [^1149fizo]. Assess for **hypotension** [^116VsGSP], dizziness, and angioedema at each visit; monitor for hyperkalemia symptoms (muscle weakness, arrhythmias) [^111r5wu5] and renal impairment (reduced urine output, fatigue). Review all medications for interactions (NSAIDs, lithium, potassium supplements, other RAAS inhibitors) and avoid losartan in pregnancy [^112nufoN]. Educate patients on home BP monitoring [^112h5r8W], adherence, and when to seek care.

---

## Blood pressure monitoring

- **Baseline measurement**: Obtain baseline blood pressure before initiating losartan therapy [^111N7KCo].

- **Initial follow-up**: Reassess blood pressure within 1–2 weeks after starting therapy or adjusting the dose [^113jWG18].

- **Ongoing monitoring**: Continue regular blood pressure monitoring at each clinic visit to ensure therapeutic efficacy and detect hypotension [^111r5wu5].

---

## Renal function monitoring

Losartan can affect **renal function** [^112LaArK], particularly in patients with preexisting renal impairment [^111UGunH] or those taking concomitant nephrotoxic or renally active medications [^1149fizo]. Measure **baseline serum creatinine** and estimate **eGFR** before initiation, reassess within 1–2 weeks [^113jWG18] after starting or adjusting the dose, and continue periodic monitoring every 3–6 months [^111r5wu5] during chronic therapy. Increase vigilance in chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or heart failure [^113jWG18].

---

## Serum potassium monitoring

Losartan can cause **hyperkalemia** [^1149fizo], particularly in patients with renal impairment or diabetes [^113jWG18], or in those taking potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or other potassium-raising drugs [^111r5wu5]. Obtain baseline **serum potassium**, recheck within 1–2 weeks [^113jWG18] after initiation or dose changes, and monitor periodically every 3–6 months thereafter, with closer surveillance in high-risk patients [^116aWMYx].

---

## Clinical signs and symptoms monitoring

Monitor for **clinical signs and symptoms** associated with losartan therapy, including:

- **Hypotension**: Dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, especially in volume-depleted or elderly patients.

- **Hyperkalemia**: Muscle weakness, fatigue, cardiac arrhythmias [^1149fizo].

- **Renal impairment**: Reduced urine output, swelling, fatigue.

- **Angioedema**: Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (rare but serious).

---

## Drug interactions and special considerations

- **NSAIDs**: Concurrent use may reduce antihypertensive efficacy and increase the risk of renal impairment [^1149fizo].

- **Lithium**: Losartan may increase serum lithium levels, necessitating close monitoring of lithium concentrations [^1149fizo].

- **Dual RAS blockade**: Avoid concurrent use with ACE inhibitors or aliskiren due to increased risk of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal impairment [^1149fizo].

- **Pregnancy**: Losartan is contraindicated during pregnancy due to fetal toxicity risks [^112nufoN].

---

## Patient education and adherence monitoring

Encourage regular **home blood pressure monitoring** [^112h5r8W] with documented logs, reinforce **medication adherence** and attendance at scheduled follow-up visits, and instruct patients to promptly report symptoms of hypotension, hyperkalemia, or angioedema.

---

Patients starting losartan require **monitoring of blood pressure, renal function, and serum potassium** [^113jWG18] at baseline, 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose changes, and periodically thereafter [^111r5wu5]. Clinical signs of hypotension, hyperkalemia [^1149fizo], and renal impairment [^111UGunH] should be assessed, and drug interactions or contraindications should be considered.

### Arbli [^112nufoN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Fetal and neonatal adverse reactions associated with the use of drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system during pregnancy can include oligohydramnios. This may lead to reduced fetal renal function, resulting in anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations (including skull hypoplasia), hypotension, and even death. In cases where no suitable alternative therapy exists, it is crucial to inform the pregnant patient of the potential risks to the fetus.

For patients taking losartan during pregnancy, serial ultrasound examinations are recommended to assess the intra-amniotic environment, with fetal testing considered based on gestational age. If oligohydramnios is detected, losartan should be discontinued unless it is deemed lifesaving for the mother. It is important to recognize that oligohydramnios may not be evident until after the fetus has sustained irreversible damage.

Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to losartan should be closely monitored for symptoms such as hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. In such cases, it is vital to support blood pressure and renal perfusion, potentially requiring exchange transfusions or dialysis as necessary to reverse hypotension and restore renal function.

First, appropriate monitoring of patients at the initiation and shortly after the commencement of therapy with RAASi is critical. Careful monitoring and cautious dose adjustment are absolutely essential to successfully maintain high‐risk patients on maximal RAASi therapy.

Before starting or changing the RAASi dose, it is necessary to completely review prescribed medications, such as trimethoprim or β-blockers, both shown to increase serum potassium, and over-the-counter medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. In addition, assessing intravascular volume status is essential. An accurate assessment of the patient's ideal weight is helpful in this regard. Patients significantly lower than their target body weight may already be sodium avid and not provide the distal sodium delivery needed to support potassium excretion. Conversely, patients who are significantly greater than their target body weight may have cardiac decompensation, which will reduce renal blood flow, activate the RAAS, and reduce distal sodium delivery.

It is important to avoid starting or increasing the RAASi dose until patients are optimized with regard to intravascular volume, have stable kidney function, and when other medications that increase serum potassium have been stopped or reduced as much as possible. Clearly, starting RAASi in the setting of hyperkalemia is not advisable. Repeat laboratory testing 10 to 14 days after delaying or after starting or changing the RAASi dose is important and should include close monitoring once a stable RAASi dose is achieved.

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: The Stockholm creatinine measurements (SCREAM) project [^113jWG18]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE‐I) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have demonstrated efficacy in reducing blood pressure and proteinuria, slowing progression of kidney disease, and improving outcomes in patients with heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and post–myocardial infarction. However, these medications have also been associated with adverse events, including hyperkalemia. Although adverse events can occur at any level of kidney function, the risk is thought to be greatest in those with chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure. Thus, concern for adverse effects may lead to underutilization in the subgroups of patients who are expected to derive the greatest benefit.

Clinical detection of hyperkalemia requires laboratory evaluation, and close laboratory monitoring is recommended during ACE‐inhibitor or ARB use. The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline on chronic kidney disease evaluation and management recommends assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and potassium within one week after initiating or increasing the dose of an ACE‐I or ARB, regardless of baseline potassium level. The 2004 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) suggests a more detailed algorithm: monitor laboratory values within the first four weeks after initiation or dose change for high-risk patients (defined as having systolic blood pressure, potassium levels above 4.5 mmol/L, or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²) and within four to twelve weeks for all other.

### Antihypertensive efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers as monotherapy as evaluated by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: A meta-analysis [^111DPqCt]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are available in different dosages, and it is common clinical practice to uptitrate if the blood pressure goal is not achieved with the initial dose. Data on the incremental antihypertensive efficacy with uptitration are scarce. It is also unclear if the antihypertensive efficacy of losartan is comparable with other ARBs.

We systematically reviewed PubMed/EMBASE/Cochrane databases for all randomized clinical trials until December 2012 reporting 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) for the most commonly available ARBs in patients with hypertension. Reduction in ABP with ARBs was evaluated at 25% of the maximum (max) dose, 50% of the max dose, and at the max dose. Comparison was made between the 24-hour BP-lowering effect of losartan at 50 mg and 100 mg and other ARBs at 50% max dose and the max dose, respectively. Sixty-two studies enrolling 15,289 patients (mean age 56 years; 60% men) with a mean duration of 10 weeks were included in the analysis. Overall, the dose-response curve with ARBs was shallow, with a decrease of 10.3/6.7 (systolic/diastolic), 11.7/7.6, and 13.0/8.3 mmHg with 25% max dose, 50% max dose, and with the max dose of ARBs, respectively. Losartan at a dose of 50 mg lowered ABP less well than other ARBs at 50% max dose by 2.5 mmHg systolic (P < 0.0001) and 1.8 mmHg diastolic (P = 0.0003). Losartan at 100 mg lowered ABP less well than other ARBs at max dose by 3.9 mmHg systolic (P = 0.0002) and 2.2 mmHg diastolic (P = 0.002).

In this comprehensive analysis of the antihypertensive efficacy of ARBs by 24-hour ABP…

### Effects of losartan on patients hospitalized for acute COVID-19: A randomized controlled trial [^116VsGSP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

We could not identify any markers of risk for hypotension. Hypotension may have occurred in acute COVID-19 because of the vasodilating actions of losartan in this setting. Patients with hypotensive SAEs had a much higher mortality rate than those without such events. The increased risk suggests, for the first time, serious safety concerns with the use of ARBs in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. ARBs should probably not be added to the usual care for these patients.

In four RCTs of ARBs in patients hospitalized for acute COVID-19 who had not been on ARBs prior to admission, telmisartan significantly decreased mortality compared to usual care, whereas three other small trials found no effect of ARBs on mortality. One trial found that losartan use was associated with fewer vasopressor-free days than usual care. Other RCTs regarding continuing or discontinuing ARBs in patients hospitalized for acute COVID-19 showed no differences in primary outcomes. Hypotension and other safety concerns with ARBs were not found in other trials, perhaps because losartan dosing differed (e.g. 50 mg twice per day in one trial vs. 100 mg daily in our trial). Subsequently, recommendations were made to continue ARBs in patients admitted for acute COVID-19 who are already on those drugs.

- **Strengths**: Our trial's strengths include a multisite, two-country, randomized design enhancing generalizability, a rigorous protocol, safety monitoring by independent medical monitors and a DSMC, and careful losartan dosing titration.

- **Limitations**: Our trial was stopped for safety concerns, and limitations arise from this early termination.

### Clozaril [^117EqMbg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Two separate management algorithms are provided below: one for patients in the general population, and the other for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia.

- **Clozaril treatment and monitoring in the general patient population**: Obtain a complete blood count (CBC), including the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) value, prior to initiating treatment with Clozaril to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/µL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than 1500/µL are considered within the normal range and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient's ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/µL for the first 6 months of treatment, the monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/µL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter.

	- Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours, if clinically appropriate.

- **Clozaril treatment and monitoring in patients with benign ethnic neutropenia**: Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than "standard" laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25–50%) and some Middle Eastern ethnic groups.

The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Patients with nonfatal events remained in the trial, allowing for an examination of the first event of each type, even if it was not the initial event (e.g. a stroke following an initial myocardial infarction would be counted in the analysis of stroke). Treatment with losartan resulted in a 13% reduction (p = 0.021) in risk of the primary endpoint compared to the atenolol group; this difference was primarily due to an effect on fatal and nonfatal stroke.

- **Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier estimates**
	- Kaplan-Meier estimates of the primary endpoint of time to cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, or nonfatal myocardial infarction are shown for the groups treated with losartan and atenolol. The risk reduction is adjusted for baseline Framingham risk score and level of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy.

Treatment with losartan reduced the risk of stroke by 25% relative to atenolol (p = 0.001).

- **Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier estimates**
	- Kaplan-Meier estimates of the time to fatal/nonfatal stroke in the groups treated with losartan and atenolol are provided. The risk reduction is adjusted for baseline Framingham risk score and level of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy.

### The randomized Olmesartan and Diabetes Microalbuminuria Prevention (ROADMAP) observational follow-up study: Benefits of RAS blockade with olmesartan treatment are sustained after study discontinuation [^115zwmxL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

In this analysis, patients were assigned to the following cohorts according to their previous study medication in the ROADMAP study. Eight hundred seventy-seven patients had been in the former placebo (Pb) group and 881 had been in the former olmesartan (OM) group. The mean follow-up in both groups during the observational follow-up (OFU) was 3.3 ± 0.6 years. The patient populations in the two OFU groups were comparable and representative of the entire ROADMAP cohort, as depicted with regard to demographics, vital signs, and laboratory parameters. Seventy-eight (8.9%) of the former patients on placebo and 54 (6.1%) of the former patients on olmesartan who participated in the OFU had developed microalbuminuria already during the preceding ROADMAP study. Both numbers are slightly lower than the numbers in the entire ROADMAP cohort (9.8% and 8.2%, respectively).

- **Blood pressure control**: During the OFU period, 88.3% of the patients received antihypertensive drugs with comparable distributions in both groups. A similar use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), or calcium channel blockers was reported. However, more patients from the former placebo group received a beta-blocker or a diuretic.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112h5r8W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

A strength of the PATHWAY studies is the use of home blood pressure (BP) monitoring as the primary outcome measure. Measured over a number of days and averaged, this value is a better prognostic marker of cardiovascular disease than clinic pressure and avoids misclassification due to the "white coat effect" seen with clinic measures. Although some guidelines now recommend 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements for initial diagnosis, this is not a practical alternative to home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) for routine monitoring of treatment. Within a trial environment, the use of serial ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for primary outcome measurements can compromise power by increasing dropout rates.

In addition to the use of HBPM, we conducted a substudy assessing left ventricular (LV) mass. Consistent with the large reductions in BP over phases 1 and 2 in the combination therapy group and over phase 2 in the monotherapy group, our substudy found a greater than 10% reduction in LV mass, which compares favorably with the reduction seen in other studies. The absence of a difference in LV mass between groups confirms the rejection of the never-catch-up hypothesis and demonstrates the rapidity with which cardiovascular risk (for which LV mass is the best surrogate) can be reversed by good BP control.

The British Hypertension Society Research Network took a lead role in the design of ACCELERATE (Aliskiren and the calcium channel blocker Amlodipine combination as an initial treatment strategy for hypertension control), a previous trial addressing questions similar to those in PATHWAY-1. That study was unable to address the question of individual variability.

### Regression of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy by losartan compared with atenolol: the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) trial [^114DiV3G]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

An echocardiographic substudy of the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) trial was designed to test the ability of losartan to reduce left ventricular (LV) mass more than atenolol.

- **Methods and results**: A total of 960 patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on the screening ECG were enrolled at centers in 7 countries and studied by echocardiography at baseline and after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of randomized therapy. Clinical examination and blinded readings of echocardiograms in 457 losartan-treated and 459 atenolol-treated participants with ≥ 1 follow-up measurement of LV mass index (LVMI) were used in an intention-to-treat analysis. Losartan-based therapy induced a greater reduction in LVMI from baseline to the last available study than atenolol, with adjustment for baseline LVMI and blood pressure and in-treatment pressure (-21.7 ± 21.8 versus -17.7 ± 19.6 g/m²; P = 0.021). Greater LVMI reduction with losartan was observed in women and men, participants > 65 or < 65 years of age, and with mild or more severe baseline hypertrophy. The difference between treatment arms in LVH regression was due mainly to reduced concentricity of LV geometry in both groups and a lesser increase in LV internal diameter in losartan-treated patients.

- **Conclusions**: Antihypertensive treatment with losartan, plus hydrochlorothiazide and other medications when needed for pressure control, resulted in greater LVH regression in patients with ECG LVH than conventional atenolol-based treatment. Thus, angiotensin receptor antagonism by losartan has been shown to be more effective.

### Toward personalized management of chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^113XbxJY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic hypertension complicates 1% to 2% of pregnancies, and it is increasingly common. Women with chronic hypertension are an easily recognized group who are in touch with a wide variety of healthcare providers before, during, and after pregnancy, mandating that chronic hypertension in pregnancy be within the scope of many practitioners. We reviewed recent data on management to inform care and future research. This study is a narrative review of published literature. Compared with normotensive women, women with chronic hypertension are at an increased risk of maternal and perinatal complications. Women with chronic hypertension who wish to be involved in their care can do so by measuring blood pressure at home. Accurate devices for home blood pressure monitoring are now readily available.

The diagnostic criteria for superimposed preeclampsia remain problematic because most guidelines continue to include deteriorating blood pressure control in the definition. It has not been established how angiogenic markers may aid in the confirmation of the diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia when suspected, beyond information provided by routinely available clinical data and laboratory results. Although chronic hypertension is a strong risk factor for preeclampsia, and aspirin decreases preeclampsia risk, the effectiveness specifically among women with chronic hypertension has been questioned. It is unclear whether calcium has an independent effect in preeclampsia prevention in such women. Treating hypertension with antihypertensive therapy halves the risk of progression to…

### Effects of losartan or atenolol in hypertensive patients without clinically evident vascular disease: a substudy of the LIFE randomized trial [^112Qv6My]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). High credibility.

Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are reduced by treatment with the angiotensin II AT(1)-receptor antagonist losartan compared with conventional treatment with the beta-blocker atenolol in patients with hypertension and electrocardiogram-defined left ventricular hypertrophy, many of whom had known vascular disease.

- **Objective**: To determine whether losartan reduces cardiovascular event rates in lower-risk hypertensive patients without clinically evident vascular disease.

- **Design**: Subgroup analysis of a randomized trial.

- **Setting**: The Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study.

- **Patients**: The study involved 6886 men and women (57% women) aged 55 to 80 years (average, 66 years) with essential hypertension (sitting blood pressure, 160 to 200/95 to 115 mm Hg [average, 174/98 mm Hg]) and electrocardiogram-defined left ventricular hypertrophy who did not have clinically evident vascular disease.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomly assigned to once-daily double-blind treatment with losartan or atenolol.

- **Measurements**: An end point committee ascertained end points, including cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction.

Results indicated that blood pressure was reduced similarly by both losartan and atenolol. The primary composite end point occurred in 282 losartan-treated patients (17.5 per 1000 patient-years) and in 355 atenolol-treated patients (21.8 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.95]; P = 0.008). Cardiovascular death occurred in 103 losartan-treated patients and 132 atenolol-treated patients (relative risk, 0.80 [CI, 0.62 to 1.04]; P).

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112HDwCB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Readings were performed in triplicate, morning and evening, after 10 minutes of seated rest. Clinic BP measurements were recorded in triplicate after 10 minutes of seated rest at each study visit using the participant's own Microlife monitor. Plasma renin mass was measured at baseline, using the Diasorin Liaison automated chemiluminescent immunoassay for direct renin. A full biochemical series was taken at regular intervals for safety.

A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging substudy was undertaken at three of the participating centers where magnetic resonance imaging capacity for research studies existed (Cambridge, Leicester, and Dundee) to measure left ventricular (LV) mass at baseline and after treatment for 12 months. In these centers, all participants were offered the magnetic resonance imaging substudy until at least 60 participants had been recruited. All cardiac magnetic resonance imaging data were collected using a common protocol and processed by clinicians blinded to treatment and other demographics at a central site at Leicester using manual contours drawn with CMR42 software (Circle Cardiovascular Imaging) with exclusion of the papillary muscles and trabeculations and normalized for body mass.

All adverse events considered related to treatment were recorded on the electronic case record form and coded by the data management center on the basis of the medical dictionary for regulatory activities. Serious adverse events were documented and reported to the chief investigator and to regulatory authorities, in accordance with local and national regulations.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to clinical and laboratory monitoring, EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring the adequacy of treatment with zinc salts during all stages of treatment. This is achieved by measuring 24-hour urinary copper excretion and serum non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper or serum exchangeable copper whenever available.

### Escalation process of critical values when these cannot be communicated on first attempt: A hospital-wide process improvement project [^1155QSMJ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Low credibility.

Since laboratory critical values reflect such an abnormal pathologic state that there is imminent danger to the patient, it is crucial to deliver the result upon initial call, with an escalation process when the initial call cannot occur. In our 8-hospital system, one of the hospitals used the escalation procedure twice as frequently compared with the other hospitals. This work presents hospital-wide quality improvement processes that decreased escalation of critical value calls to reach the same proportion of escalated calls compared to other hospitals in the system.

- **Methods**: The laboratory met weekly with leaders of different hospital areas and quality management. They presented the interventions they implemented, and the laboratory monitored their progress.

- **Results**: Monitoring and reviewing with providers the importance of critical values temporarily decreased escalated calls from 25% to 18%. Having a dedicated phone to call critical values in each hospital area decreased the calls in a sustained fashion, which now fluctuate between 9% and 14%. Other interventions, including having a dedicated person receiving critical value results, did not decrease escalated critical value calls.

- **Conclusions**: Having a dedicated phone in each hospital area that receives the initial critical value call simplifies and standardizes the process.

- **Drug interactions**:

	- **Moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors**: Concomitant administration of strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) with JESDUVROQ is contraindicated due to a marked increase in daprodustat exposure [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant administration of moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. clopidogrel) increases daprodustat exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Reduce the starting dose of JESDUVROQ by half when initiating treatment in patients on clopidogrel or a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor, except in patients whose starting dose is already 1 mg. Monitor hemoglobin and adjust the dose of JESDUVROQ when initiating or stopping therapy with clopidogrel or a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor during treatment with JESDUVROQ [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

	- **CYP2C8 inducers**: CYP2C8 inducers (e.g. rifampin) may decrease daprodustat exposure, which may result in the loss of efficacy. Monitor hemoglobin and adjust the dose of JESDUVROQ when initiating or stopping therapy with CYP2C8 inducers during treatment with JESDUVROQ [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Atacand [^111DJrpw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan potassium, administered at their highest recommended doses once daily, were compared in two randomized, double-blind trials. In a total of 1,268 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were not receiving other antihypertensive therapy, candesartan cilexetil 32 mg lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg on average more than losartan potassium 100 mg, when measured at the time of either peak or trough effect. The antihypertensive effects of twice-daily dosing of either candesartan cilexetil or losartan potassium were not studied.

The antihypertensive effect was similar in men and women and in patients both older and younger than 65. Candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in black patients (usually a low-renin population). This has been generally true for angiotensin II antagonists and ACE inhibitors.

In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the antihypertensive effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil was maintained, and there was no rebound after abrupt withdrawal.

There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil in controlled trials.

The antihypertensive effects of Atacand were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to < 6 years old and 6 to < 17 years of age in two randomized, double-blind multicenter, 4-week dose-ranging studies. There were 93 patients 1 to < 6 years of age, 74% of whom had renal disease, who were randomized to receive an oral dose of candesartan cilexetil.

### Sustained tubulo-interstitial protection in SHRs by transient losartan treatment: an effect of decelerated aging [^112rSt23]. American Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Hypertensive target organ damage exhibits characteristics of accelerated cell turnover and aging, potentially developing during the evolution of hypertension. In the kidney, high cell turnover is predominantly limited to tubular cells. This study aimed to investigate whether transient intervention in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) could lead to reduced tubular cell turnover and attenuate the renal aging process and tubulo-interstitial damage in the long term.

- **Methods**: SHRs were prehypertensively treated with losartan (20 mg/kg/day) or hydralazine (4 mg/kg/day) for weeks 4–8, compared to Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Groups were assessed at weeks 8 and 72, except for the hydralazine group. At both time points, tubular cell proliferation and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were evaluated. At week 72, aging parameters, including telomere length, were measured. Renal damage was assessed using a semiquantitative scale (0–4) by evaluating the parenchyma (atrophy) and vasculature (media thickness).

- **Results**: Treatments effectively reduced SBP in young SHRs (P < 0.01), but only losartan reduced renal cell proliferation. Proliferative cell nuclear antigen levels were as follows: untreated SHRs (2.8 ± 0.8), losartan-treated SHRs (1.3 ± 0.3), hydralazine-treated SHRs (3.0 ± 0.6), and WKY rats (0.1 ± 0.1 cells/mm²). In losartan-treated SHRs, tubular proliferation remained reduced, and renal telomere length was significantly increased compared to untreated SHRs (fold: untreated 1.0 ± 0.1, losartan-treated 2.8 ± 0.3, P < 0.01). Untreated SHRs exhibited higher renal damage scores (median 2.0, range 1–3; P < 0.007), unlike losartan-treated SHRs (median 1.0, range 0–2).

- **Specific populations**: Losartan pharmacokinetics have been investigated in various populations.

	- **Geriatric patients**: In elderly patients (65 to 75 years), plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite are similar to those in young hypertensives, indicating no dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

	- **Pediatric patients**: Pharmacokinetic parameters after multiple doses of losartan (average dose 0.7 mg/kg, range 0.36 to 0.97 mg/kg) were studied in 25 hypertensive patients aged 6 to 16 years. The pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite were generally consistent across the age groups studied and comparable to historical pharmacokinetic data in adults. The principal pharmacokinetic parameters in adults and children are detailed in Table 2, which follows below.

	- **Table 2: Pharmacokinetic parameters in hypertensive adults and children aged 6 to 16 following multiple dosing**
		*Mean ± standard deviation
		†Harmonic mean and standard deviation
		‡Median*

	- **Male and female patients**: Studies showed that plasma concentrations of losartan were about twice as high in female hypertensives compared to males, although concentrations of the active metabolite were similar between genders, implying no dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

	- **Racial or ethnic groups**: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### The effects of short-term omission of daily medication on the pathophysiology of heart failure [^1135Z2gD]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Twenty patients (80% men, mean LVEF 32 ± 9%, median NT‐proBNP 962 ng/L) were enrolled in the study. Most patients had mild symptoms, with 16 in NYHA class II. All patients were treated with loop diuretics and beta‐blockers, mainly carvedilol; 18 received either an ACE inhibitor or ARB, but only 7 (35%) received a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, which was consistent with guidelines for patients with predominantly NYHA class II HF at the time the study was conducted.

Measurements were made during visits with medication taken or omitted. With omission of HF therapies for 48 hours, six patients (30%) reported an increase in exertional breathlessness with a deterioration in NYHA class by one rank. Omission of medications was associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure (from 131 to 152 mmHg, P < 0.001) and plasma NT‐proBNP, which almost doubled (from 962 to 1883 ng/L, P < 0.001), and a fall in serum creatinine (from 135 to 118 µmol/L, P = 0.012). Despite omission of diuretics, weight did not change, and despite omission of beta‐blockers, heart rate remained stable. Amongst echocardiographic measurements, LV and LA volumes and IVC diameter increased: LV end‐diastolic volume (LVEDV) by +11% (P = 0.008), LAV max by +21% (P < 0.001), and IVC diameter by +18% (P = 0.004).

### Reduction in albuminuria translates to reduction in cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients: Losartan intervention for endpoint reduction in hypertension study [^1111gGqm]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Few data are available to clarify whether changes in albuminuria over time translate to changes in cardiovascular risk. The aim of the present study was to examine whether changes in albuminuria during 4.8 years of antihypertensive treatment were related to changes in risk in 8,206 patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study. Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) was measured at baseline and annually. Time-varying albuminuria was closely related to risk for the primary composite endpoint: when UACR decreased during treatment, risk was reduced accordingly.

When the population was divided according to median baseline value (1.21 mg/mmol) and median year 1 UACR (0.67 mg/mmol), risk increased stepwise and significantly for the primary composite endpoint from those with low baseline/low year 1 (5.5%), to low baseline/high year 1 (8.6%), to high baseline/low year 1 (9.4%), and to high baseline/high year 1 (13.5%) values. Similar significant, stepwise increases in risk were seen for the components of the primary composite endpoint: cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction.

The observation that changes in UACR during antihypertensive treatment over time translated to changes in risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was not explained by in-treatment level of blood pressure. We propose that monitoring of albuminuria should be an integrated part of the management of hypertension. If albuminuria is not decreased by the patient's antihypertensive therapy, further investigation and adjustment may be necessary.

- **Monitoring response to therapy and dose adjustment**: Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin every two weeks for the first month and then every four weeks thereafter. When adjusting doses of JESDUVROQ, consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, and hemoglobin variability. Do not increase the dose of JESDUVROQ more frequently than once every four weeks. If the dose of JESDUVROQ needs to be adjusted, increase or decrease by one dose level at a time (see Table 3). Decrease the dose of JESDUVROQ if hemoglobin increases rapidly (e.g. greater than 1 g/dL over two weeks or greater than 2 g/dL over four weeks) or if the hemoglobin exceeds 11 g/dL. If hemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dL, interrupt treatment with JESDUVROQ. When the hemoglobin is within the target range, treatment may be restarted at one dose level lower (see Table 3). Treatment with JESDUVROQ should not be continued beyond 24 weeks of therapy if a clinically meaningful increase in hemoglobin level is not achieved. Alternative explanations for an inadequate response should be sought and treated before restarting therapy. Note: 24 mg is the maximum recommended once daily dose.

- **Dosage modification for hepatic impairment**: Reduce the starting dose of JESDUVROQ by half (see Table 1 and Table 2) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), except in patients whose starting dose is already 1 mg. Use of JESDUVROQ in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) is not recommended [see use in specific populations (8.6), clinical pharmacology (12.3)].

### Arbli [^112N7C5c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The LIFE study, a multinational double-blind study, compared losartan and atenolol in 9,193 hypertensive patients with ECG-documented left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with myocardial infarction or stroke within six months prior to randomization were excluded. Participants were randomized to receive once-daily losartan 50 mg or atenolol 50 mg. To achieve the goal blood pressure of less than 140/90 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) was added first if needed and, if necessary, the dose of losartan or atenolol was then increased to 100 mg once daily. If required, additional antihypertensive treatments, such as increased doses of hydrochlorothiazide therapy to 25 mg, or the addition of other diuretic therapies, calcium-channel blockers, alpha-blockers, or centrally acting agents, were incorporated into the treatment regimen. However, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, or beta-blockers were not used.

Of the randomized patients, 4,963 (54%) were female and 533 (6%) were Black. The mean age was 67, with 5,704 (62%) aged 65 or older. At baseline, 1,195 (13%) had diabetes, 1,326 (14%) had isolated systolic hypertension, 1,469 (16%) had coronary heart disease, and 728 (8%) had cerebrovascular disease. Baseline mean blood pressure was 174/98 mmHg in both treatment groups. The mean length of follow-up was 4.8 years. At the end of the study or at the last visit before a primary endpoint, 77% of the losartan-treated group and 73% of the atenolol-treated group were still taking study medication.

### Self-monitoring of oral anticoagulation: Does it work outside trial conditions [^113SpksZ]? Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: We have audited the acceptability and efficacy of self-monitoring of oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) when offered at the start of initial anticoagulant treatment. Recruitment was non-selective, excluding only patients for whom self-monitoring was inappropriate. Of all patients, 26% (44% of eligible patients) agreed to self-monitor. Most published studies use the number of eligible patients as the denominator, making it difficult to accurately assess total uptake. However, we believe that our uptake of 26% represents an improvement on previous UK studies.

Similar to previous studies, a significant number of patients (14%) dropped out during or shortly after training. Nevertheless, the majority of patients who started self-monitoring completed their course of treatment or continued to self-monitor after the audit period (94%). A recent systematic review reported that only 14% of eligible patients in the UK would conduct long-term monitoring of OAT, while 36% of eligible patients referred to our anticoagulation clinic were able and willing to self-monitor when offered self-monitoring at the start of anticoagulation. Consistent with previous studies, self-monitoring patients were younger than the overall clinic population, although we found no gender-related difference in uptake.

The percentage time in range (%TIR) for self-monitoring patients in this audit is similar to that observed in previous UK studies and a recent study performed in the Netherlands, and is superior to that in a large Spanish study. Most other studies of self-monitoring of OAT were performed in countries where specialized hospital anticoagulant clinics are not available.

### Monitoring technologist reading skills in a sperm morphology quality control program [^111NcNDk]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

The value of sperm morphology as a predictor of a man's fertilizing potential has often been challenged due to differing classification systems distinguishing normal from abnormal spermatozoa. This study aimed to monitor the reading skills of 53 laboratory technologists enrolled in a continuous quality control program for sperm morphology assessment.

- **Design**: Prospective analytical study.

- **Settings**: Academic hospital and academic institution setting.

- **Patients**: Sperm samples from the sperm donor program as well as andrology technicians from sub-Saharan Africa.

- **Interventions**: Papanicolaou-stained sperm slides were prepared and shipped quarterly to participating laboratories. Papanicolaou-prestained sperm morphology slides were used as test material for 21 months.

- **Main outcome measures**: A new statistical model was developed to record reading skills of the participating technicians. Reading skills were classified as marginal (5.7% of cases), good (11.3% of cases), and excellent (83% of cases).

- **Results**: Participants maintained their morphological reading skills and agreed with the reference laboratory by not exceeding a standard deviation limit of 0.2 to set stringent standards for the program.

Conclusions indicate that technician proficiency can be monitored using the results of a quality control program. A continuous quality control program can only be initiated after intensive training; baseline values at the onset of the quality control program serve as an internal reference value.

### Correlates of pulse pressure reduction during antihypertensive treatment (losartan or atenolol) in hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (the LIFE study) [^115fmHCi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

In hypertensive patients, pulse pressure is related to hypertension-induced target organ damage and the risk of cardiovascular events. However, the correlates of pulse pressure reduction during antihypertensive treatment have been less extensively investigated. We examined pulse pressure changes in relation to clinical and echocardiographic findings before and after 2 years of antihypertensive treatment in 767 patients, aged 55 to 80 years (mean age 66), participating in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension study. Over 2 years, blood pressure and pulse pressure were reduced from 173/98 to 147/84 mm Hg, and from 75 to 63 mm Hg, respectively, with both changes achieving statistical significance.

- **Characteristics of patients with low pulse pressure reduction**: Patients with a pulse pressure of ≥ 63 mm Hg after 2 years of treatment (n = 349) were generally older, shorter, included more women, and had more cases of isolated systolic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, albuminuria, and echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline. They also experienced a smaller decrease in mean blood pressure and the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio over the 2 years (all p < 0.05).

Thus, among hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, older age and less reduction in mean blood pressure were significant factors associated with a smaller reduction in pulse pressure.

### Aliskiren in combination with losartan reduces albuminuria independent of baseline blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy [^116eHJRc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) contributes to the development and progression of proteinuria and decline in renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our post hoc analysis assessed the influence of baseline BP on the antiproteinuric effect in the Aliskiren in the Evaluation of Proteinuria in Diabetes (AVOID) study.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: In the AVOID study, 599 hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy received 6 months of aliskiren (150 mg force titrated to 300 mg daily after 3 months) or placebo added to losartan (100 mg) daily and optimal antihypertensive therapy. Changes in early morning urinary albumin:creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at week 24 were assessed by subgroups of baseline BP: Group A (prespecified target), < 130/80 mmHg (n = 159); Group B, < 140/90 mmHg but ≥ 130/80 mmHg (n = 189); and Group C (insufficient BP control), ≥ 140/90 mmHg (n = 251).

- **Results**: Mean baseline BP (mmHg) levels for Groups A, B, and C were 120/71, 133/78, and 145/81, respectively. BP during the trial was nearly identical to baseline levels in all groups. The antiproteinuric effects of aliskiren were consistent across subgroups of baseline BP (19 to 22% reduction versus placebo). In Group C, the decline in eGFR was significantly lower with aliskiren than with placebo (P = 0.013).

- **Conclusions**: Aliskiren (300 mg) added to losartan (100 mg) plus optimal antihypertensive therapy provides antiproteinuric effects independent of BP in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. Renal function was better preserved with aliskiren in patients with insufficient BP control.

### The association of smoothness index of central blood pressure with ambulatory carotid femoral pulse wave velocity after 20-week treatment with losartan in combination with amlodipine versus hydrochlorothiazide [^111gmx7L]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure parameters was a key focus of this research. Clinical blood pressure (BP) was obtained in the sitting position with a pressure cuff placed at either the right or left brachial area, using a semi-automated sphygmomanometer (HEM-7080IC; Omron Healthcare Co, Kyoto, Japan). After 5 minutes of rest, BP was measured three times with an interval of 2 minutes, and the mean pressure was used for analysis.

- **Ambulatory blood pressure measurements**: Measurements of blood pressures (BPs), ambulatory augmentation index (AAIx), ambulatory pulse pressure amplification (APPA), and ambulatory carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (AcfPWV) were performed for 24 hours with 30-minute intervals using the previously validated, automated oscillometric device (Mobil-O-graph 24 h PWA monitor; IEM Gmbh, Stolberg, Germany).

	- **Definition of time periods**: Daytime and night-time were defined by a narrow fixed interval method. BPs during the period between 0800 and 2100 hours were regarded as daytime BP, and BPs during the period between midnight and 0500 hours were regarded as night-time BP. The 24-hour BP was calculated using the following formula: daytime BP x [1–(sleep duration in hours/24)] + night-time BP x (sleep duration in hours/24). Nocturnal dipping was defined as night-time brachial SBP divided by daytime brachial SBP x 100 (%).

- **Study drug administration**: All patients took the study drug at the time of starting the ambulatory monitoring. Pulse pressure amplification (PPA) was defined as the ratio of brachial systolic blood pressure (SBP) to central systolic blood pressure (CSBP). The augmentation index at heart rate of 75 beats per minute (AAIx75) was calculated by calibrating the AAIx.

- **Smoothness index calculation**: The smoothness index was calculated using hourly changes of the study parameters from baseline to 20-week treatment. It was defined as the average of hourly changes divided by the standard deviation of those hourly changes.

Reduction in the risk of stroke: The LIFE study was a multinational, double-blind study comparing losartan and atenolol in 9193 hypertensive patients with ECG-documented left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with myocardial infarction or stroke within six months prior to randomization were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive once-daily losartan 50 mg or atenolol 50 mg. If the goal blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg) was not reached, hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) was added first, and if needed, the dose of losartan or atenolol was then increased to 100 mg once daily. If necessary, other antihypertensive treatments (e.g. increase in dose of hydrochlorothiazide therapy to 25 mg or addition of other diuretic therapy, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, or centrally acting agents, but not ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, or beta-blockers) were added to the treatment regimen to reach the goal blood pressure.

In efforts to control blood pressure, the patients in both arms of the LIFE study were coadministered hydrochlorothiazide the majority of the time they were on the study drug (73.9% and 72.4% of days in the losartan and atenolol arms, respectively).

Of the randomized patients, 4963 (54%) were female, and 533 (6%) were Black. The mean age was 67, with 5704 (62%) age ≥ 65. At baseline, 1195 (13%) had diabetes, 1326 (14%) had isolated systolic hypertension, 1469 (16%) had coronary heart disease, and 728 (8%) had cerebrovascular disease. Baseline mean blood pressure was 174/98 mmHg in both treatment groups. The mean length of follow-up was 4.8 years.

### Medical measures in hypertensives considered resistant [^113txVYa]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Lastly, and perhaps most important, is the use of chemical adherence testing (CAT). CAT is based on the detection of drugs or drug metabolites in urine or serum. Urine drug or drug metabolite detection is at present limited to quantifying whether the drug is present or not, and some drugs, for example, telmisartan, do not have renal elimination. Furthermore, some drugs may be present for days after the last dose. On the other hand, measurements of serum drug concentrations may be used not only to detect antihypertensive drugs but also to allow quantification of drug levels in serum.

As a measure toward practical use for clinicians, serum reference ranges 12–24 hours after the last dose for the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs in Norway, measured by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, have been suggested. We believe these values may be useful for clinicians or departments seeking to utilize CAT in the management of difficult-to-control hypertensives and have replicated the serum reference ranges in Table 3. The serum reference ranges were calculated based on pharmacokinetic properties and were validated against a limited sample of patient measurements. It should be kept in mind that these ranges are not correlated to drug response, i.e. BP-lowering effect.

A possible advantage of this method is that it can be used to optimize drug dosage and prescription, providing a potential for personalized medicine. In addition, it provides information regarding the biological half-life of the drugs. Despite its advantages, these methods…

### Measuring the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in the primary care setting [^112oho4f]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Traditional clinical trials in hypertension measure the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs but may not fully assess their effectiveness in clinical practice. Community-based trials can provide this information but are limited because usually, they are of open-label design and potentially subject to observer bias. Therefore, we used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), an automated and objective measure of blood pressure (BP), to overcome these shortcomings in a large community-based trial.

- **Methods**: Patients with hypertension, either untreated or currently on treatment, were started on or switched to the angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan 40 mg daily. After 2 weeks, if office BP remained ≥ 140/85 mm Hg, the dose was increased to 80 mg. If necessary, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg was added following a further 4 weeks and continued for the final 4-week period. Baseline and treatment ABPM measurements were completed in 940 previously untreated patients and 675 previously treated patients.

- **Results**: The average reduction for the entire cohort was -10.7/-6.5 mm Hg. Among patients whose baseline BP was ≥ 130/85 mm Hg, the mean decrease in 24-hour BP was 16.8/11.4 mm Hg. Based on ABPM criteria, the BP was fully controlled (< 130/85 mm Hg) in 70% of patients. Based on office measurement criteria.

### Arbli [^113yZN6o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) to losartan 50 mg once daily resulted in placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions of 15.5/9.2 mmHg. Analysis of age, gender, and race subgroups of patients showed that men and women, as well as patients over and under 65, had generally similar responses. Losartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in Black patients, who usually belong to a low-renin population.

- **Pediatric hypertension**: The antihypertensive effect of losartan was studied in one trial enrolling 177 hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years old. Children who weighed less than 50 kg received 2.5, 25, or 50 mg of losartan daily, whereas patients who weighed 50 kg or more received 5, 50, or 100 mg of losartan daily. Children in the lowest dose group were given losartan in a suspension formulation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The majority of the children had hypertension associated with renal and urogenital disease. The sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) on entry into the study was higher than the 95th percentile level for the patient's age, gender, and height. At the end of three weeks, losartan reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, measured at trough, in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, the two higher doses (25 to 50 mg in patients less than 50 kg; 50 to 100 mg in patients 50 kg or more) reduced diastolic blood pressure by 5 to 6 mmHg more than the lowest dose used (2.5 mg in patients less than 50 kg; 5 mg in patients 50 kg or more). The lowest dose, corresponding to an average daily dose of 0.07 mg/kg, did not appear to offer conclusive results.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^115qvnat]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Home systolic blood pressure (BP) measurements were analyzed across different phases of the study. Means at each visit for both the monotherapy and combination therapy arms were assessed. Specifically, the unadjusted mean home systolic BP (95% confidence interval) was recorded at each visit. Responder rates were evaluated at the end of each phase, and additional measurements were taken at the highest dose of combination therapy compared to each monotherapy, categorized by tertiles of renin mass measured prior to treatment. BP indicates blood pressure; HCTZ, hydrochlorothiazide.

By the end of phase 3, more than 75% of participants in both groups achieved target BP (Table S4), with no significant difference between groups at the conclusion of either phase 2 or 3. Conversely, only 40% of initial monotherapy responses were at target by the end of phase 1, with this increasing to 50% for all monotherapy responses (i.e. either losartan or HCTZ, as detailed in Tables S5 and S6). A post hoc analysis identified only 35 participants for whom initial monotherapy was the best treatment option (Table S7).

In the monotherapy arm crossover, while losartan and HCTZ showed greater effectiveness in younger and older participants respectively, the age-related effect was slight. Notably, losartan 100 mg proved more effective than HCTZ 25 mg for the majority of participants older than 55 years (Table 3). Participants in the highest renin tertile experienced a greater response to losartan by 3.7 mm Hg and a lesser response to HCTZ by 4.3 mm Hg compared to those in the lowest tertile, amounting to an overall treatment difference of 8 mm Hg (Table 3, P < 0.001).

The primary endpoint of the study was the time to first occurrence of any one of the following events: doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (need for dialysis or transplantation), or death. Treatment with losartan resulted in a 16% risk reduction in this endpoint (see Figure 4 and Table 4). Treatment with losartan also reduced the occurrence of sustained doubling of serum creatinine by 25% and ESRD by 29% as separate endpoints, but had no effect on overall mortality (see Table 4).

The mean baseline blood pressures were 152/82 mmHg for losartan plus conventional antihypertensive therapy and 153/82 mmHg for placebo plus conventional antihypertensive therapy. At the end of the study, the mean blood pressures were 143/76 mmHg for the group treated with losartan and 146/77 mmHg for the group treated with placebo.

- **Figure 4**: Kaplan-Meier curve for the primary composite endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease (need for dialysis or transplantation), or death.

- **Table 4**: Incidence of primary endpoint events.

The secondary endpoints of the study were change in proteinuria, change in the rate of progression of renal disease, and the composite of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes (hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction, revascularization, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or cardiovascular death). Compared with placebo, losartan significantly reduced proteinuria by an average of 34%, an effect that was evident within 3 months of starting therapy, and significantly reduced the rate of decline.

### Optimal antiproteinuric dose of losartan in nondiabetic patients with nephrotic range proteinuria [^113tdYZK]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Although the antiproteinuric response to antihypertensive treatment is the main predictor of renoprotective efficacy in long-term renal disease, at the time of writing, dose-finding studies of antihypertensives have been based only on blood pressure. We aimed to find the optimal antiproteinuric dose of the angiotensin II antagonist losartan. An open-label, dose-response study using subsequent 6-week treatment periods was performed in 10 nondiabetic patients with proteinuria of 5.8 ± 0.8 g/d and a mean arterial pressure of 103 ± 3.7 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication. All patients had normal to moderately impaired renal function.

After the baseline period, five periods followed with a daily losartan dose of 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 50 mg and a recovery without losartan. At the end of each period, proteinuria and mean arterial pressure were measured. The consecutive doses of losartan had a similar antihypertensive response (-11.3 ± 2.8% by the 100-mg dose). The optimal antiproteinuric response was reached at 100 mg of losartan (-30 ± 8%). The 50-mg dose (-13 ± 7%) was less effective, and the 150-mg dose (-28 ± 8%) was not more effective. A 100-mg dose of losartan is optimal for reduction of proteinuria in nondiabetic patients with nephrotic range proteinuria.

### Role of a clinical pharmacist in managing diabetic nephropathy: an approach of pharmaceutical care plan [^114zRKCr]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Initially, for three consecutive months, with an interval of 30 days, we monitored the laboratory values and diabetic diet. Later, the patient was monitored trimonthly up to one year. The glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the CKD-EPI creatinine equation. The values trend for the first three months of serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate were 2.8 mg/dL, 2.6 mg/dL, 1.5 mg/dL and 24 ml/min, 26 ml/min, 51 ml/min, respectively. Further results showed significant improvement in the 6th, 9th, and 12th months. The values of serum creatinine in the 6th, 9th, and 12th months were 1.3 mg/dL, 1.1 mg/dL, and 0.9 mg/dL, whereas the glomerular filtration rate in the 6th, 9th, and 12th months were 61 ml/min, 74 ml/min, and 94 ml/min. This data can be shown in Table 1.

Table 1: Laboratory reports after pharmaceutical care

The dietary habits were also monitored by pharmacist personal visits. The diet was assessed using two dietary assessment tools: dietary records and a food frequency questionnaire. The objective of these assessment tools is to provide a diet with low protein and low to medium glycemic load and glycemic index.

A day-wise record book was given to the patient to monitor the diet. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was evaluated every week to determine the highest and lowest frequency of food items. Based on the FFQ, dietary corrections were made in accordance with the glycemic index and glycemic load.

### The precision interventions for severe and/or exacerbation-prone (PrecISE) asthma network: An overview of network organization, procedures, and interventions [^115MDuun]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Participants undergo laboratory studies as part of a safety review to (1) determine their inclusion or exclusion for the study at the time of initial screening and (2) monitor for adverse events (AEs) during interventions. All safety lab results are transmitted from the core laboratory (PPD, Inc) to the Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) for review by medical monitors, after which unblinded data are forwarded to investigation sites (see Blinding and medical monitors below). Laboratory studies conducted for the initial safety review are listed with their guiding parameters in Table IV.

For each parameter, a key consideration in study design was to determine logical, clinical thresholds. As an example, clinicians readily understand the difference between a hemoglobin value that is below the lower limit of normal (determined by a 95% confidence interval, approximately 12.8 g/dL for men and 11.9 g/dL for women in most laboratories), a value that meets the definition of anemia as defined by the World Health Organization, a value that raises significant clinical concern (e.g. below 10 g/dL), and a "panic" value that requires immediate confirmation and treatment (e.g. below 7–8 g/dL).

Even for a straightforward variable such as hemoglobin, there are age-related declines in men but not women. Similarly, there are differences based on age, sex, and/or race for blood platelet and neutrophil counts, and for estimated glomerular filtration rate. Exclusion criteria, and criteria that trigger review for AEs during an intervention, were chosen with these issues in mind. We elected to deploy different threshold values for the evaluation of neutropenia.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute promyelocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to treatment monitoring, ELN 2019 guidelines recommend interpreting an increase in white blood cell counts greater than 10×10⁹/L after treatment initiation with all-trans retinoic acid and/or arsenic trioxide as a sign of all-trans retinoic acid/arsenic trioxide-induced differentiation. Patients should not be reclassified as having high-risk disease based on this increase.

### Low doses of losartan and trandolapril improve arterial stiffness in hemodialysis patients [^1163uphD]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Hemodialysis patients have uremic dyslipidemia, represented by elevated serum intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDL-C) levels, and an increased cardiovascular mortality rate. This study was performed to determine the low-dose effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril on pulse wave velocity (PWV), which predicts cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients.

- **Methods**: Serum lipid levels and PWV were monitored for 12 months in 64 hemodialysis patients who were administered low doses of losartan or trandolapril or a placebo.

- **Results**: At the start of the study, there were no differences in patient characteristics among the 3 groups. PWV tended to increase in the placebo group during the 12-month study period but decreased significantly in the losartan and trandolapril groups, and decreases in PWV were similar in the losartan and trandolapril groups. There were no changes in blood pressure, hematocrit, erythropoietin dose, ankle-brachial index, serum lipid levels, serum 8-isoprostane levels, or serum C-reactive protein levels during the 12-month study period, but there was an increase in serum triglyceride levels in the losartan group and a decrease in serum IDL-C levels in the losartan and trandolapril groups.

- **Conclusion**: In hemodialysis patients, trandolapril is as effective as losartan in decreasing PWV independent of its depressor effect and in suppressing elevated IDL-C levels. Long-term blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may have a beneficial effect.

Following oral administration, plasma concentrations and AUCs of losartan and its active metabolite are increased by 50% to 90% in patients with mild (creatinine clearance of 50 to 74 mL/min) or moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 49 mL/min) renal insufficiency. Renal clearance was reduced by 55% to 85% for both losartan and its active metabolite in patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency. Neither losartan nor its active metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Following oral administration in patients with mild to moderate alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite were, respectively, 5-times and about 1.7-times those in young male volunteers. Compared to normal subjects, the total plasma clearance of losartan in patients with hepatic insufficiency was about 50% lower, and the oral bioavailability was about doubled. Use a starting dose of 25 mg for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Losartan has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.8)].

No clinically significant drug interactions have been found in studies of losartan potassium with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin, cimetidine, and phenobarbital. However, rifampin has been shown to decrease the AUC of losartan and its active metabolite by 30% and 40%, respectively. Fluconazole, an inhibitor of…

### Phenotype-directed management of hypertension in pregnancy [^1126KJBZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

A 31-year-old G2P1 presented to the Hypertension Consultation Clinic at 16 weeks of gestation with a history of severe preeclampsia requiring delivery at 31 weeks. During this pregnancy, her blood pressures at 7 and 12 weeks were 119/83 and 132/83. Her blood pressures at her initial clinical visits at 16 and 22 weeks, while on no antihypertensive medications, ranged from 104/64 to 118/71 with overall normal hemodynamic parameters. No medications were initiated at those visits; however, her referring provider was advised to initiate atenolol 12.5 mg twice a day if blood pressures persistently exceeded 135/85.

At 26 weeks, an ultrasound demonstrated fetal growth at the 11th centile. She returned at 30 weeks having been started on atenolol 25 mg once a day in the morning and 12.5 mg once a day in the evening by her primary provider due to elevated blood pressures at home. At this assessment, her blood pressures were 114/68, 115/70, and 101/69, with a cardiac output (CO) of 8.8, a total peripheral resistance (TPR) of 724, and a heart rate (HR) of 82. A follow-up growth ultrasound on that day showed stable fetal growth with an estimated fetal weight again in the 11th percentile.

Given her increasing CO and reported elevated blood pressures at home, her atenolol dosage was increased to 25 mg twice a day. By 33 weeks, her blood pressures were normal at 102/70, 114/74, and 122/71, but her CO had dropped to 6.2 and her TPR had increased to 1135. A growth ultrasound demonstrated an estimated fetal weight in the 8th percentile, now accompanied by an elevated umbilical artery Doppler.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113gqDFC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

We found a large average difference in home systolic blood pressure (HSBP) favoring the initial use of combination therapy compared with initial monotherapy across the first 8 months of the study (phases 1 and 2); there was no discernible subset of patients in whom this difference was not observed. It was largely due to the superiority of combination therapy in the first 16 weeks (phase 1), with margins of almost 8 and 10 mm Hg, respectively, for home and clinic systolic blood pressure. Although combination therapy is expected to show superior efficacy and is recommended for stage 2 hypertension by some guidelines, this has not yet become the norm in routine practice. Consequently, we incorporated a number of planned measurements in the study design that we believed, if positive, would help to change practice.

The first of the additional measurements was the co-primary endpoint of HSBP at 32 weeks, the prespecified time point for evaluation of the never-catch-up hypothesis that initial less intense blood pressure (BP) control results in subsequently poorer BP control. This hypothesis was rejected. Never catching up in the ASCOT and VALUE trials, from which the hypothesis arose, may be more a consequence of suboptimal treatments being combined rather than optimal treatments being started sequentially. In contrast, our other original comparisons provide strong support for the rationale of initial combination. A unique feature of PATHWAY-1 is the "trial within a trial" of a randomized monotherapy crossover trial, the aims of which were to ensure that each participant's best therapy at maximal force-titrated dose was co…

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111N7KCo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Guidelines for hypertension vary in their preference for initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy, stratified by patient profile; therefore, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of these approaches.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a 1-year, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 605 untreated patients aged 18 to 79 years with systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 95 mm Hg. In phase 1 (weeks 0–16), patients were randomly assigned to initial monotherapy (losartan 50–100 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg crossing over at 8 weeks) or initial combination (losartan 50–100 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg). In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve the target. Hierarchical primary outcomes were the difference from baseline in home systolic, averaged over phases 1 and 2 and, if significant, at 32 weeks. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, and the difference in home systolic BP responses between tertiles of plasma renin.

Home systolic BP after initial monotherapy fell 4.9 mm Hg (range: 3.7–6.0 mm Hg) less over 32 weeks (P < 0.001) than after initial combination but caught up at 32 weeks (difference 1.2 mm Hg [range: −0.4 to 2.8 mm Hg], P = 0.13). In phase 1, home systolic BP response to each monotherapy differed substantially between renin tertiles, whereas response to combination therapy was uniform and at least 5 mm Hg more than to monotherapy. There were no differences in withdrawal rates among the treatment groups.

### Arbli [^1172Jxfr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hypertension**: The antihypertensive effects of losartan were principally demonstrated in four placebo-controlled, 6-to-12-week trials with dosages ranging from 10 to 150 mg per day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 115. These studies allowed for comparisons of two doses (50 to 100 mg/day) as once-daily or twice-daily regimens, peak and trough effects, and response variations by gender, age, and race. Additionally, three studies assessed the effects of combining losartan with hydrochlorothiazide.

- **Study details**: The four losartan monotherapy studies involved a total of 1,075 patients randomized to various doses of losartan and 334 to placebo. The 10 and 25 mg doses showed some effect at peak (6 hours after dosing) but only small and inconsistent trough (24-hour) responses. Doses of 50, 100, and 150 mg once daily resulted in statistically significant systolic/diastolic mean decreases in blood pressure compared to placebo, with decreases ranging from 5.5 to 10.5/3.5 to 7.5 mmHg. Notably, the 150 mg dose did not produce a greater effect than the 50 mg to 100 mg doses. Twice-daily dosing at 50 to 100 mg/day consistently yielded larger trough responses than once-daily dosing at the same total daily dose. Peak (6-hour) effects were uniformly larger than trough effects, with trough-to-peak ratios for systolic and diastolic responses ranging from 50% to 95% and 60% to 90%, respectively.

### The adequacy of laboratory monitoring in patients treated with spironolactone for congestive heart failure [^1134Pu2R]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

This study was designed to determine the adequacy of monitoring patients receiving spironolactone as well as spironolactone's relationship to hyperkalemia. After the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) demonstrated a 30% mortality benefit for treating severe heart failure patients with spironolactone, acceptance of this drug was overwhelming. Hyperkalemia and worsening renal function were rare in RALES, but laboratory monitoring was frequent. In clinical practice, the incidence of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function and the adequacy of follow-up is unknown.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the monitoring of congestive heart failure (CHF) patients with spironolactone initiation after the publication of RALES. All potassium and creatinine determinations at baseline and within three months following therapy initiation were assessed. Increased potassium was defined as any [K] ≥ 5.5 mEq/l and severe hyperkalemia as any [K] ≥ 6.0.

- **Results**: A total of 840 patients had new prescriptions for spironolactone. Of these, 91% had baseline laboratory values, and 34% did not have any serum potassium or creatinine determined within three months. Patients seen in the cardiology clinic were more likely to have appropriate follow-up.

### Starting antihypertensive drug treatment with combination therapy: Controversies in hypertension - con side of the argument [^1142ib5F]. Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

In the double-blind PATHWAY-1 study (Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension With Algorithm-Based Therapy Trial), of 796 screened patients, 605 (76.0%) were randomized and 432 (71.4%) completed the 1-year follow-up period. Eligible patients were untreated, aged 18 to 79 years, and had a self-measured home systolic/diastolic BP of ≥ 150/ ≥ 95 mm Hg. They were randomized to initial monotherapy with losartan 50 to 100 mg/d (N = 151) or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg/d (N = 150), crossing over at 8 weeks (switching to the alternative monotherapy), or initial combination treatment with losartan 50 to 100 mg/d plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg/d (N = 304).

In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve target BP. The primary endpoint was the change in the systolic home BP (target systolic/diastolic home BP > 140/ > 90 mm Hg). The original protocol prespecified the time of the primary endpoint at the end of phase 2, namely, 32 weeks after randomization, at which time all patients were receiving the same therapy. The statistical analysis plan, published before the data lock and unblinding, introduced two hierarchical co-primary endpoints. The first was the reduction in the systolic home BP averaged over phases 1 and 2, testing for the superiority of initial combination therapy over monotherapy. The co-primary endpoint, to be tested only if the first hypothesis was confirmed, was the reduction in systolic home BP at week 32.

### Efficacy and safety of the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: the INHERIT randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111gzRS6]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). High credibility.

No medical treatment has been reliably shown to halt or reverse disease progression in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but the results of several pilot studies have suggested beneficial effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers on left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, which are predictive of an adverse outcome. We aimed to assess the effect of the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan on left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

- **Methods**: In this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult patients (aged 18 years and older) with obstructive or non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were randomly assigned via a computer-based system to losartan (100 mg per day) or placebo for 12 months. Patients and investigators were masked to assigned treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in left ventricular mass as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) or CT. Efficacy analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population (all patients with data available at the 12-month follow-up). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01447654.

- **Findings**: Between Dec 1, 2011, and May 1, 2013, 318 patients were screened. 133 patients (mean age 52 years [SD 13], 35% women) consented and were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 69) or losartan (n = 64). 124 (93%) patients completed the study and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis for the primary endpoint. After 12 months, we noted no significant difference in the change in left ventricular mass.

### Laboratory monitoring of drugs at initiation of therapy in ambulatory care [^116aWMYx]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Product labeling and published guidelines reflect the importance of monitoring laboratory parameters for drugs with a risk of organ system toxicity or electrolyte imbalance. Limited information exists about adherence to laboratory monitoring recommendations. The objective of this study was to describe laboratory monitoring among ambulatory patients dispensed medications for which laboratory testing is recommended at therapy initiation.

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of patients in 10 geographically distributed health maintenance organizations who were newly prescribed medications with recommended laboratory test monitoring. The main outcome measure was the proportion of initial drug dispensing without recommended baseline laboratory monitoring for 35 newly initiated drugs or drug classes.

- **Results**: One hundred seven thousand, seven hundred sixty-three of 279,354 (39%) initial drug dispensings occurred without recommended laboratory monitoring. Patients without monitoring were younger than patients who had monitoring (median 57 vs 61 years, p < 0.001). Thirty-two percent of dispensings where a serum creatinine was indicated did not have it evaluated (range across drugs, 12% to 61%); 39% did not have liver function testing (range 10% to 75%); 32% did not have hematologic monitoring (range 9% to 51%); and 34% did not have electrolyte monitoring (range 20% to 62%) (p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Substantial opportunity exists to improve laboratory monitoring of drugs for which such monitoring is recommended.

### Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and first lockdown on pregnancy monitoring in France: The COVIMATER cross-sectional study [^1161b94M]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Changes in pregnancy monitoring at the initiative of pregnant women

For the present study, women who voluntarily changed their pregnancy monitoring during the lockdown were defined as those who reported at least one of the following in the questionnaire: (i) foregoing pregnancy examinations, (ii) voluntarily postponing or cancelling pregnancy consultations, and (iii) delaying the start of monitoring (i.e. not starting monitoring despite a gestational age of over 15 weeks).

The reasons for changes in pregnancy monitoring were explored through 13 binary questionnaire items covering different themes, including lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and organizational problems, specifically personal and healthcare-based.
