## Question

Eliquis and dialysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using Eliquis (apixaban) in patients on dialysis, including dosing, safety, efficacy, and practical management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of apixaban in dialysis and how that informs dosing. Then, I should verify what the FDA label actually says versus what major guidelines recommend. Next, I will review randomized and observational evidence for atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism in dialysis patients. After that, I need to check for accumulation and drug-level monitoring data. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, indication-specific dosing approach and highlight key uncertainties and monitoring needs, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic foundation, because dosing hinges on it. Apixaban is about 27% renally cleared, with hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion accounting for the rest, and it has high protein binding and a moderate volume of distribution, which limits dialytic removal; hemodialysis removes roughly 4% of a dose, and CRRT clearance is modest and variable, so dialysis does not meaningfully enhance apixaban elimination in a way that would drive routine dose changes [^115Z2Cpm] [^115vJBDb] [^116E6rT7]. Wait, let me verify the accumulation concern: multiple-dose PK in hemodialysis shows accumulation over the first week, with 2.5 mg twice daily achieving exposure comparable to 5 mg twice daily in non-CKD, whereas 5 mg twice daily leads to supratherapeutic levels, reinforcing caution with the higher dose in ESRD [^115vJBDb].

> Next, I should review the regulatory labeling, because it often conflicts with guideline nuance. The FDA label permits use of apixaban in ESRD on dialysis for NVAF and for VTE treatment/prophylaxis, stating no dose adjustment is required for renal impairment alone, but for NVAF the dose should be reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily if at least two of age ≥ 80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL are present; importantly, the label acknowledges limited clinical experience in CrCl < 15 mL/min and that stroke/bleeding benefits in dialysis are uncertain [^notfound] [^113BhS4e]. Hold on, I should verify the VTE language: yes, the label says no renal dose adjustment for VTE indications, including dialysis, though this is based on limited PK/PD data rather than dialysis-specific RCTs [^113BhS4e].

> Now, I will examine guideline positions, because they refine how to apply the label. ACC/AHA/ACCP 2024 guidelines advise that for AF with ESRD or on dialysis, it is reasonable to use warfarin or an evidence-based dose of apixaban, with the evidence-based dose in dialysis generally interpreted as 2.5 mg twice daily given PK and observational data; this is a conditional recommendation reflecting low-certainty evidence [^116XVdrJ] [^116XVdrJ]. KDIGO 2024, in contrast, lists apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily as "unknown" for ESRD and dialysis due to insufficient RCT evidence, emphasizing individualized decisions and the need for more data [^114GtHiZ]. I should double-check that this aligns with the FDA's allowance; yes, KDIGO's caution coexists with FDA's permissive labeling, underscoring the evidence gap.

> Next, I should review randomized evidence for atrial fibrillation in dialysis, because this is the crux of the controversy. The RENAL-AF RCT was underpowered and stopped early, showing no significant difference in major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding between apixaban (mostly 5 mg twice daily) and warfarin, with numerically more bleeding and deaths in the apixaban arm; stroke rates were low and similar, so no efficacy advantage was demonstrated, and the trial cannot be used to claim noninferiority or superiority [^114T3AXm] [^112kD2H8]. The AXADIA-AFNET 8 trial compared apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily to phenprocoumon and also found no significant differences in safety or efficacy outcomes, again reflecting limited power and uncertainty [^1138VGSX]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these RCTs suggest equipoise rather than clear benefit, and they cannot settle the optimal dose question definitively.

> I will now examine observational data for AF, because larger datasets can complement small RCTs. Multiple cohort analyses show that apixaban is associated with lower major bleeding than warfarin in dialysis patients with AF, with some studies suggesting mortality benefits when using standard-dose apixaban, though confounding and short follow-up limit causal inference; notably, Siontis et al. found lower major bleeding with both 5 mg and 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin, and lower stroke and death with 5 mg twice daily, whereas reduced-dose apixaban did not show a stroke benefit, raising concern about underdosing [^1131Wn36] [^112NTBYT] [^111yKMiJ]. But wait, what if we compare apixaban to no anticoagulation? Some analyses suggest no stroke reduction versus no therapy and higher bleeding with 5 mg twice daily, reinforcing the need to individualize and avoid reflexive anticoagulation in very high bleeding risk patients [^117BbGF9].

> Next, I should review evidence for venous thromboembolism in dialysis, because dosing may differ by indication. Large retrospective cohorts consistently show lower major bleeding and fewer recurrent VTE events with apixaban compared with warfarin in ESRD, with no clear mortality difference; these findings support apixaban as a reasonable alternative to warfarin for VTE treatment in dialysis, albeit with low-certainty evidence [^113AQjwZ] [^111X9geE] [^111pYGFB]. I need to ensure we distinguish initial treatment from maintenance; standard VTE treatment uses 10 mg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg twice daily, and while some clinicians reduce to 2.5 mg twice daily in ESRD, this is off-label and supported only by limited PK and observational data, so I should flag this as uncertain and individualized [^113uGnxG] [^111gbSqm].

> Let me consider accumulation and drug-level monitoring, because this affects safety. Early PK work showed accumulation over 8 days with both 2.5 and 5 mg twice daily, with 5 mg producing supratherapeutic exposure, which is why many experts prefer 2.5 mg twice daily in dialysis despite the FDA's broader label [^115vJBDb]. More recent drug-level monitoring cohorts suggest that 2.5 mg twice daily yields troughs comparable to non-CKD patients on 2.5 mg twice daily and lower than non-CKD on 5 mg twice daily, with about 14% below detection, whereas 2.5 mg once daily frequently results in subtherapeutic levels; importantly, higher measured levels correlate with bleeding, especially with concomitant antiplatelets, supporting selective drug-level testing when available to identify accumulation or underexposure [^116yNDEt] [^116HEfnW] [^11564QuU]. Hold on, I should verify that these programs measured pre-dialysis troughs; yes, they targeted sampling before dialysis after the long interval to better detect accumulation, which is a practical approach if monitoring is pursued [^115oMKzF].

> I should now synthesize a practical, indication-specific approach, while acknowledging uncertainty. For atrial fibrillation in dialysis, the most defensible, evidence-aligned dose is 2.5 mg twice daily, reserving 5 mg twice daily only for carefully selected patients with low bleeding risk and strong stroke prevention needs, and even then with caution given supratherapeutic exposure in PK studies; this aligns with guideline preference for reduced dosing and with observational signals that 5 mg may improve stroke outcomes at the cost of more bleeding, whereas 2.5 mg may under-treat some patients [^111kWapd] [^115vJBDb] [^1131Wn36]. For VTE treatment, standard dosing of 10 mg twice daily for 7 days then 5 mg twice daily is FDA-labeled and reasonable in dialysis, with consideration of 2.5 mg twice daily only if bleeding risk is very high and alternatives are limited, recognizing this is off-label and supported by limited data; for VTE prophylaxis after surgery, no renal dose adjustment is recommended and standard 2.5 mg twice daily is appropriate [^113BhS4e] [^113uGnxG] [^111gbSqm]. I need to ensure I emphasize that all of this remains individualized, with shared decision-making given the evidence gap.

> Next, I should review safety modifiers and monitoring, because dialysis patients have unique risks. Concomitant antiplatelet therapy, prior bleeding, frailty, and frequent heparin exposure during dialysis increase bleeding risk and may tilt toward lower doses or avoidance; if anticoagulation is used, consider periodic anti-Xa levels where available to identify accumulation or underdosing, especially early after initiation or dose changes, and reassess bleeding and thrombotic events regularly [^117849i1] [^116yNDEt] [^115oMKzF]. I should double-check that no validated target range exists; correct, there is no established therapeutic window, so interpretation is relative to reference populations and clinical context, which limits routine monitoring but supports selective use when the stakes are high [^116HEfnW].

> Finally, I need to reconcile conflicting guidance and state the bottom line clearly. The FDA label allows both 5 mg and 2.5 mg twice daily for NVAF in dialysis depending on dose-reduction criteria, and permits standard VTE dosing without renal adjustment, but this is based on limited PK/PD data and absent large, definitive RCTs; conversely, ACC/AHA/ACCP and nephrology guidance lean toward 2.5 mg twice daily for AF in dialysis due to accumulation concerns and the balance of observational data, while KDIGO highlights the evidence gap and advises individualized decisions [^113BhS4e] [^111kWapd] [^114GtHiZ]. Therefore, the most conservative, evidence-aligned approach is to prefer 2.5 mg twice daily for AF in dialysis, use standard VTE dosing when indicated, avoid 5 mg twice daily for AF unless benefits clearly outweigh risks and monitoring is feasible, and reassess anticoagulation needs periodically as kidney function, bleeding risk, and comorbidities evolve [^115vJBDb] [^111kWapd] [^113BhS4e].

Eliquis (apixaban) is **FDA-approved for use in dialysis patients** [^113BhS4e] for atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism, with no routine dose adjustment required for renal impairment alone [^113BhS4e]. For atrial fibrillation, use **2.5 mg twice daily** if the patient is ≥ 80 years, weighs ≤ 60 kg, or has serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL; otherwise, 5 mg twice daily is standard [^113BhS4e]. For VTE, use standard dosing (10 mg twice daily for 7 days, then 5 mg twice daily) [^113uGnxG] [^117CTwqT]. Apixaban is not dialyzable [^115vJBDb], so timing around dialysis is not critical. Monitor for bleeding and drug interactions, and consider anti-Xa levels if available to guide therapy [^116HEfnW].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of apixaban in dialysis patients

- **Renal clearance**: ~27% of apixaban is renally cleared; hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion account for the rest [^115Z2Cpm].
- **Dialysis removal**: Hemodialysis removes ~4% of apixaban, so dialysis has minimal impact on drug exposure [^115vJBDb].
- **Accumulation risk**: Despite minimal renal clearance, accumulation can occur in ESRD; monitor closely [^115vJBDb].

---

## FDA-approved dosing recommendations

| **Indication** | **Standard dose** | **Dose adjustment for dialysis patients** |
|-|-|-|
| Atrial fibrillation (stroke prevention) | 5 mg twice daily | 2.5 mg twice daily if ≥ 80 years, ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL [^115KReKv] |
| Venous thromboembolism (treatment) | 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, then 5 mg twice daily | No adjustment required [^113BhS4e] |
| Venous thromboembolism (prophylaxis) | 2.5 mg twice daily | No adjustment required [^113BhS4e] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting use in dialysis patients

- **RENAL-AF trial**: Apixaban 5 mg twice daily vs warfarin in dialysis patients with AF; no significant difference in bleeding or stroke, but apixaban was noninferior for bleeding [^notfound].
- **AXADIA-AFNET 8**: Apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily vs phenprocoumon; no significant differences in safety or efficacy [^1138VGSX].
- **Observational data**: Apixaban is associated with lower major bleeding than warfarin in dialysis patients with AF or VTE [^1131Wn36] [^113AQjwZ].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Bleeding risk**: Elevated in dialysis due to uremic platelet dysfunction; monitor closely [^117849i1].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase apixaban levels; adjust dose or avoid [^1138Kjw6].
- **Monitoring**: Routine anti-Xa levels are not required but may help in select cases (e.g. bleeding, suspected accumulation) [^116HEfnW].

---

## Comparison with other anticoagulants

Compared with warfarin, apixaban has **lower major bleeding risk** and no routine INR monitoring [^1131Wn36] [^113AQjwZ]. Compared with other DOACs, apixaban has **more dialysis data** and is preferred over dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban in ESRD [^notfound].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Dosing**: Use label-based dosing; adjust to 2.5 mg twice daily for AF if criteria are met [^115KReKv].
- **Timing**: Administer at any time relative to dialysis; minimal removal by dialysis [^115vJBDb].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for bleeding, drug interactions, and adherence; consider anti-Xa levels if available [^116HEfnW].
- **Individualization**: Tailor to bleeding risk, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^111kWapd].

---

Eliquis is **appropriate for dialysis patients** when indicated, with dosing individualized to indication and patient factors; monitor bleeding and interactions, and use anti-Xa levels selectively to optimize safety and efficacy [^111kWapd].

age greater than or equal to 80 years
body weight less than or equal to 60 kg
serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL

Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis

Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ELIQUIS did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, administration of ELIQUIS at the usually recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] will result in concentrations of apixaban and pharmacodynamic activity similar to those observed in the ARISTOTLE study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar stroke reduction and bleeding risk in patients with ESRD on dialysis as was seen in ARISTOTLE.

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery, and Treatment of DVT and PE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment, including those with ESRD on dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ELIQUIS did not enroll patients with ESRD on dialysis or patients with a CrCl < 15 mL/min; therefore, dosing recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (anti-FXa activity) data in subjects with ESRD maintained on dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis-can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies? [^112g1uki]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Apixaban has emerged as a safe and practicable alternative to vitamin K antagonists. In patients on hemodialysis however, use and dosing of apixaban are controversial.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved apixaban for use in patients on hemodialysis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) vote against its use in this population. Other authorities like the American College of Cardiology and the Heart Rhythm Society (AHA/ACC/HRS) or the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies of Germany (AWMF) take intermediate positions refraining from a contraindication but referring to the moderate quality of evidence.

Pharmacokinetic properties that encourage the use of apixaban in patients on hemodialysis are considerable non-renal excretion (73%) lack of active metabolites and partial removal by hemodialysis. However, high plasma protein binding (87%) and a large volume of distribution (21 L) limit effective clearance increasing the risk of accumulation.

Results from cohort studies and from the AXADIA-AFNET 8 trial showed superiority and non-inferiority respectively, comparing apixaban to vitamin K antagonists in patients on hemodialysis. However, the evidence regarding appropriate dosing is contradictory with suggestions of 5 mg twice daily, 2.5 mg twice daily, or no respective difference. In addition, even 2.5mg once daily might be considered, as inter-individual variability of drug level is high, serious bleedings do occur with 2.5 mg twice-daily and prophylactic indications (e.g. access flow difficulties) are known challenges.

As a result, clinicians are faced with the conundrum of implementing a promising therapy without indubitable evidence regarding efficacy, dosing and safety. This is reflected by frequent off-label under-dosing making investigations regarding appropriate dosing and risk of accumulation an unmet need.

Drug monitoring is a legitimate approach to approximate a patient's risk of an overtly strong or rather weak exposure to anticoagulant effect under a given dose. However, only three studies with very few patients have been providing apixaban trough levels in patients on hemodialysis so far with none of them investigating a dose of 2.5 mg once daily.

Here we provide results from a 5 years apixaban drug-monitoring program. We investigated drug levels from different dosing regimens, associated factors, risk factors for accumulation, bleeding risk and we provide comparative data from non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) reference populations.

Specific Populations

The effects of level of renal impairment, age, body weight, and level of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban are summarized in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Effect of Specific Populations on the Pharmacokinetics of Apixaban

* ESRD subjects treated with intermittent hemodialysis; reported PK findings are following single dose of apixaban posthemodialysis.

†Results reflect CrCl of 15 mL/min based on regression analysis.

‡Dashed vertical lines illustrate pharmacokinetic changes that were used to inform dosing recommendations.

§No dose adjustment is recommended for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients unless at least 2 of the following patient characteristics (age greater than or equal to 80 years, body weight less than or equal to 60 kg, or serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL) are present.

Gender: A study in healthy subjects comparing the pharmacokinetics in males and females showed no meaningful difference.

Race: The results across pharmacokinetic studies in normal subjects showed no differences in apixaban pharmacokinetics among White/Caucasian, Asian, and Black/African American subjects. No dose adjustment is required based on race/ethnicity.

Hemodialysis in ESRD subjects: Systemic exposure to apixaban administered as a single 5 mg dose in ESRD subjects dosed immediately after the completion of a 4-hour hemodialysis session (postdialysis) is 36% higher when compared to subjects with normal renal function (Figure 3). The systemic exposure to apixaban administered 2 hours prior to a 4-hour hemodialysis session with a dialysate flow rate of 500 mL/min and a blood flow rate in the range of 350 to 500 mL/min is 17% higher compared to those with normal renal function. The dialysis clearance of apixaban is approximately 18 mL/min. The systemic exposure of apixaban is 14% lower on dialysis when compared to not on dialysis.

Protein binding was similar (92%-94%) between healthy controls and ESRD subjects during the on-dialysis and off-dialysis periods.

Pediatric Patients: Apixaban reached maximum concentration (Cmax) in pediatric patients approximately 2 hours after single-dose administration. In pediatric patients, apixaban has a total apparent clearance of about 3.0 L/h.

An exploratory analysis in pediatric patients did not reveal relevant differences in apixaban exposure based on gender or race.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis-can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies? [^116HEfnW]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our investigation provides evidence, that drug levels from hemodialysis patients taking 2.5 mg apixaban twice daily are approximately comparable to those from non-CKD populations taking the same reduced dose; but are lower compared to non-CKD populations taking the standard dose of 5 mg twice daily. Individual under-dosing needs to be considered, with 2.5 mg twice daily and even more so with 2.5 mg once daily dosing. There is considerable inter- and intra-individual variability. Higher drug levels and concomitant antiplatelet therapy might result in higher risks of bleeding.

Target ranges for apixaban drug levels do not exist and the correlation between drug levels and bleeding is poor. However, in light of contradictory recommendations and challenging risk-benefit analyses regarding anticoagulation in patients on hemodialysis, drug level monitoring can be a contributory tool. This applies in particular to the detection of drug levels at the edges of the spectrum (e.g. below detection limit or beyond the 95 th percentile of non-CKD reference populations). Here, our study provides valuable practical guidance to improve safety and appropriate dosing in hemodialysis patients on apixaban.

### A randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of apixaban for prevention of recurrent thrombosis after thrombectomy of hemodialysis vascular access [^111jUvdY]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

Dialysis vascular access thrombosis poses a substantial challenge for individuals undergoing hemodialysis. The efficacy and safety of apixaban, a direct oral coagulation factor Xa inhibitor, in preventing recurrent access thrombosis have yet to be explored. Here, a multicenter randomized control study (NCT04489849) enrolled hemodialysis patients to evaluate this who underwent successful endovascular thrombectomy within 48 hours. Participants were assigned to standard care or standard care plus apixaban, 2.5 mg twice daily for three months. The trial design involved open-label administration, with independent adjudication of endpoints. The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent access thrombosis within three months after thrombectomy. A total of 186 patients with well-balanced baseline characteristics were enrolled, 93 randomized to the apixaban group and 93 to the control group. The apixaban group demonstrated a significantly lower rate of access thrombosis at three months than the control group (24.0% vs. 40.8%; hazard ratio, 0.52 [95% confidence interval 0.31–0.88]), along with a significantly better primary patency failure rate (32.2% vs. 49.5%, 0.57 [0.36–0.91]). Safety outcomes showed comparable death rates and major bleeding incidents but significantly higher incidence of minor bleeding in the apixaban group (22.6% vs. 7.5%). The effect of apixaban did not show interaction in subgroups of different access types, antiplatelet usage, severity of comorbidities, or history of thrombosis. Thus, apixaban effectively reduced the risk of recurrent thrombosis in hemodialysis vascular access post-thrombectomy. Despite a minor increase in bleeding adverse effects, the net clinical benefit favors the use of apixaban in this context.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis-can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies? [^116yNDEt]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inconsistent study results and contradictory recommendations from health authorities regarding the use of apixaban in patients on hemodialysis have generated considerable uncertainty among clinicians, making investigations of appropriate dosing an unmet need.

Methods

We analyzed pre-dialysis apixaban drug levels from a tertiary care dialysis unit, comparing 2.5 mg once versus twice daily dosing. We applied mixed-effects models including dialysis modality, adjusted standard Kt/V, ultrafiltration, and dialyzer characteristics. We included an exploratory analysis of bleeding events and compared the drug levels of our dialysis patients to those from non-CKD reference populations taking the standard dose of 5 mg twice daily.

Results

We analyzed 143 drug levels from 24 patients. Mean (SD) age at first drug level measurement was 64.7 (15.9) years (50% female), median (IQR) follow-up was 12.5 (5.5–21) months. For the apixaban 2.5 mg once and twice daily groups, median (IQR) drug levels were 54.4 (< 40–72.1) and 71.3 (48.8–104.1) ng/mL respectively (P < 0.001). Levels were below the detection limit in 30% (with 2.5 mg once daily) and 14% (with 2.5 mg twice daily) respectively. Only dosing group (twice versus once daily) was independently associated with higher drug levels (P = 0.002). Follow-up did not suggest accumulation. The 95 th percentile of drug levels did not exceed those of non-CKD populations taking 5 mg twice daily. Median (IQR) drug levels before a bleeding (8 episodes) were higher than those without a subsequent bleeding: 111.6 (83.1–129.3) versus 54.8 (< 40–77.1) ng/mL (P < 0.001). Concomitant antiplatelet therapy was used in 86% of those with bleeding events versus 6% without bleeding events (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Drug monitoring may be a contributory tool to increase patient safety. Despite non-existing target ranges, drug levels on both edges of the spectrum (e.g. below detectability or beyond the 95 th percentiles of reference populations) may improve decision-making in highly individualized risk-benefit analyses.

### Safety outcomes of apixaban compared with warfarin in patients with end-stage renal disease [^116BVFcZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines make no specific recommendations on the selection of direct oral anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis. Based on these guidelines, warfarin remains the anticoagulant of choice in these patients.

Objective

To compare bleeding rates in patients receiving apixaban or warfarin with ESRD undergoing chronic hemodialysis.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective, institutional review board-approved cohort analysis. Patients with ESRD undergoing chronic hemodialysis and receiving anticoagulation therapy with either apixaban or warfarin were included in this study. All data were collected from paper charts and electronic medical records and included documentation of bleeding events and related interventions. The primary outcome of this study was clinically relevant major bleeding events. Secondary outcomes included clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events and minor bleeding events.

Results

A total of 160 patients were included in this study (warfarin group, n = 120; apixaban group, n = 40). There were 7 major bleeding events in the warfarin group compared with zero in the apixaban group (P = 0.34). There were similar rates of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events (12.5% vs 5.8%, P = 0.17) and minor bleeding (2.5% vs 2.5%, P = 0.74) events in patients receiving apixaban and warfarin.

Conclusions

There were no observed differences in bleeding rates in patients receiving apixaban compared with those receiving warfarin. Apixaban may be a cautious consideration in hemodialysis patients until there is further insight into the effect of subsequent, multiple doses on drug accumulation and clinical outcomes.

### Perioperative management of patients on new oral anticoagulants [^1151nDDJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer an alternative to warfarin for preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. NOACs are expected to replace warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists for most of their indications in the future. Knowledge of the use of NOACs in the perioperative period is important for optimal care.

Methods

Studies that reported on the use of NOACs were identified, focusing on evidence-based guidance relating to the perioperative period. PubMed was searched for relevant articles published between January 2000 and January 2014.

Results

The anticipated expanded clinical use of NOACs such as rivaroxaban (Xarelto™), apixaban (Eliquis™) and dabigatran (Pradaxa™) has the potential to simplify perioperative anticoagulant management because of fewer drug-drug interactions, rapid onset of action, predictable pharmacokinetics and relatively short half-lives. However, coagulation status cannot be monitored by international normalized ratio and no antidotes are currently available. In elective surgery, it is important to discontinue the use of NOACs, with special consideration of renal function as route of elimination. Guidelines for the management of bleeding complications in patients on NOACs are provided, and may be considered for trauma and emergency surgery. Haemodialysis could be considered for bleeding with use of dabigatran. Better options for reversal of the effects of NOACs when bleeding occurs may follow with novel drugs.

Conclusion

Management of NOACs in elective and emergency conditions requires knowledge of time of last intake of drug, current renal function and the planned procedure in order to assess the overall risk of bleeding. Currently no antidote exists to reverse the effects of these drugs.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^114Z4kzp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Phase III trials involving DOACs have excluded patients with severe renal dysfunction (CrCl < 30 mL/min) or dialysis. 22, 23, 25 Apixaban exhibits minimal renal clearance, but the clinical significance of this is uncertain and there are varying recommendations regarding when to dose adjust. 10, 38, 60 Patients with CrCl < 25 mL/min were excluded in both AF and VTE trials using apixaban. 24, 61, 62 Nonetheless, FDA‐approved prescribing information requires no dose adjustment for apixaban in patients with renal impairment alone, including patients with end‐stage renal disease and those on hemodialysis. 10 To qualify for apixaban dose adjustment, one must meet at least 2 of the following characteristics; just remember your ABCs:
Age ≥ 80 years.
Body weight ≤ 60 kg.
Creatinine (serum) ≥ 1.5 mg/dL.

The Europeans provide an alternative guidance, recommending standard dosing for CrCl > 30 mL/min, reduced dose for CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min, and avoidance for CrCl < 15 m/min. 38 The 2018 AF guidelines recommend both warfarin and apixaban for patients with end‐stage renal disease (CrCl < 15 m/min or on dialysis). 28 However, warfarin has little proven benefit and a large risk of harm in end‐stage renal disease. There is growing evidence that apixaban in patients with AF and advanced CKD or end‐stage renal disease may be associated with a lower risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin 63, 64 or, at the very least, similar rates of bleeding. 65

Rivaroxaban use in severe CKD, particularly in patients on dialysis, is quite contentious. The package labeling states that rivaroxaban can be used in patients on dialysis, albeit at a reduced dose. However, this is based on limited pharmacokinetic data. 9 The limited observational data suggested varying effects on bleed risk compared with warfarin in patients with stage 5 CKD or on dialysis. 59, 66 Regardless, major guidelines and consensus documents do not recommend use of rivaroxaban in patients with stage 5 CKD or on dialysis. 59

### Apixaban for patients with atrial fibrillation on hemodialysis: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^114T3AXm]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There are no randomized data evaluating the safety or efficacy of apixaban for stroke prevention in patients with end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis and with atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

The RENAL-AF trial (Renal Hemodialysis Patients Allocated Apixaban Versus Warfarin in Atrial Fibrillation) was a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-outcome evaluation (PROBE) of apixaban versus warfarin in patients receiving hemodialysis with AF and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥ 2. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to 5 mg of apixaban twice daily (2.5 mg twice daily for patients ≥ 80 years of age, weight ≤ 60 kg, or both) or dose-adjusted warfarin. The primary outcome was time to major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Secondary outcomes included stroke, mortality, and apixaban pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetic sampling was day 1, day 3, and month 1.

Results

From January 2017 through January 2019, 154 patients were randomly assigned to apixaban (n = 82) or warfarin (n = 72). The trial stopped prematurely because of enrollment challenges. Time in therapeutic range (international normalized ratio, 2.0–3.0) for warfarin-treated patients was 44% (interquartile range, 23%-59%). The 1-year rates for major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 32% and 26% in apixaban and warfarin groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.63–2.30]), whereas 1-year rates for stroke or systemic embolism were 3.0% and 3.3% in apixaban and warfarin groups, respectively. Death was the most common major event in the apixaban (21 patients [26%]) and warfarin (13 patients [18%]) arms. The pharmacokinetic substudy enrolled the target 50 patients. Median steady-state 12-hour area under the curve was 2475 ng/mL×h (10th to 90th percentiles, 1342–3285) for 5 mg of apixaban twice daily and 1269 ng/mL×h (10th to 90th percentiles, 615–1946) for 2.5 mg of apixaban twice daily. There was substantial overlap between minimum apixaban blood concentration, 12-hour area under the curve, and maximum apixaban blood concentration for patients with and without a major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding event.

Conclusions

There was inadequate power to draw any conclusion regarding rates of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding comparing apixaban and warfarin in patients with AF and end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis. Clinically relevant bleeding events were ≈10-fold more frequent than stroke or systemic embolism among this population on anticoagulation, highlighting the need for future randomized studies evaluating the risks versus benefits of anticoagulation among patients with AF and end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis-can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies? [^11564QuU]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We provided results from apixaban drug level monitoring in hemodialysis patients on different dosing regimens. We investigated risk factors for increased drug level, an analysis with regard to bleeding events and provided a literature comparison to non-CKD populations.

With regard to a 2.5 mg twice daily dosing in patients on hemodialysis, our median drug levels were comparable to those from non-CKD-populations, taking the same reduced dose, published among others by the European Union summary of product characteristics) although with a larger 5 th – 95 th percentile range (71 [< 40–141] versus 56 [24–103], 79 [34–162], 63 [11–90] ng/mL). However, our median (5 th – 95 th percentiles) drug levels appeared considerably lower in comparison to non-CKD-reference populations taking the standard dose of 5 mg twice-daily. Hence, looking at drug level data only, our results suggest, that 2.5 mg twice daily is not associated with overtly increased drug exposition compared to non-CKD patients for whom licensure studies were performed. On the contrary, our results rather suggest, that with 2.5 mg twice daily (14% below detection limit), and even more so with 2.5 mg once daily dosing (30% below detection limit), individual patients are probably under-dosed, arguing for more routine drug monitoring. It is worth mentioning however, that some patients on 2.5 mg once daily dosing showed comparable drug level to other patients on 2.5 mg twice-daily schedules. In addition, 2.5mg once daily dosing might still confer valuable prophylactic benefits e.g. for long-term patency of venous accesses.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis-can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies? [^115A8vVC]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Population

Chronic hemodialysis patients from a tertiary care center at the university hospital of Bern, Switzerland.

Study type

Retrospective analysis of 5 years health-related data, available from routine clinical practice.

In- and exclusion criteria

We included all adult patients under apixaban treatment at the initiation of the study that gave their informed consent to further use of health-related data. Inclusion was independent of apixaban dosing or indication. We excluded patients on peritoneal dialysis and those on home hemodialysis. Only scheduled apixaban drug level measurements were included. We excluded drug levels that had been taken in other departments, during emergencies or before surgical procedures.

### The use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in dialysis patients – A systematic review [^113Dy1er]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

This systematic review showed that of all four NOACs apixaban and rivaroxaban in low dose appear to be the best candidates for safe use in dialysis patients. Firstly, the PK properties of NOACs vary and apixaban and rivaroxaban were associated with less drug accumulation compared with edoxaban and dabigatran. Secondly, apixaban and rivaroxaban were evaluated in the only two RCTs conducted so far with similar stroke rates as warfarin treated and without significantly more bleeding events. Yet, caution is advised since both studies were underpowered regarding stroke and bleeding outcomes. Cohort studies comparing apixaban high dose (5 mg) with low dose (2.5 mg) suggest a lower risk of stroke with high dose but also a higher risk of bleeding with high dose apixaban. Apixaban versus no anticoagulation was compared in one cohort study and did not lower the risk of stroke compared with non‐treated regardless of apixaban dosage. Cohort studies comparing rivaroxaban with VKA yielded conflicting results. Currently, widespread use of NOACs in dialysis patients is limited by adequately sized RCTs, but several apixaban trials are underway. Clinicians are advised to individualize treatment and carefully weigh the risk of stroke versus bleeding especially in patients with a prior history of bleeding before prescribing NOACs to dialysis patients.

### Safety and efficacy of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [^1136FAF8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Because of a lack of comparative data on anticoagulant use in the advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) population, guidelines recommend warfarin for atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment in these patients. However, apixaban has specific dosing recommendations in CKD leading to use in clinical practice.

Objective

To evaluate major bleeding, stroke, and thromboembolism rates in patients with CKD stage 4, stage 5, and dialysis on apixaban or warfarin therapy.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with advanced CKD receiving apixaban or warfarin. The primary outcome was the occurrence of major bleeding at 3 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included occurrence of major bleeding, occurrence of ischemic stroke, and recurrence of VTE at 3 to 6 and 6 to 12 months.

Results

A total of 604 patients were included in the analysis. The percentage of apixaban and warfarin patients with a major bleed at 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 12 months were 8.3% versus 9.9% (P = 0.48), 1.4% versus 4% (P = 0.07), and 1.5% versus 8.4% (P < 0.001), respectively. There were no differences in rates of ischemic stroke or recurrent VTE at any time period. Conclusion and Relevance: Patients with advanced CKD taking apixaban had similar bleeding rates at 3 months compared with those taking warfarin. However, those who continued therapy had higher major bleeding rates with warfarin between 6 and 12 months. This study provides knowledge on the effects of a direct oral anticoagulant in a population that was excluded from all major trials.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^111X9geE]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Patients with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at significantly increased risk for both thrombosis and bleeding relative to those with normal renal function. The optimal therapy of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with ESKD is unknown.

Objective

To compare the safety and effectiveness of apixaban relative to warfarin in patients with ESKD and acute VTE.

Design, Setting and Participants

New‐user, active‐comparator retrospective United States population‐based cohort with inverse probability of treatment weighting, using the United States Renal Data System data from 2014 to 2018. We included adults with ESKD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis who were newly initiated on apixaban or warfarin for an acute VTE.

Main Outcome and Measures

The coprimary outcomes were major bleeding, recurrent VTE, and all‐cause mortality within 6 months of anticoagulant initiation. Secondary outcomes were intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding. The primary analyses were based on intent‐to‐treat defined by the first drug received and accounted for competing risks of death. Sensitivity analyses included varied follow‐up time, as‐treated analyses, and dose‐specific apixaban subgroups.

Results

The apixaban and warfarin cohorts included 2302 and 9263 patients, respectively. Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70–0.94), intracranial bleeding (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48–0.98), and gastrointestinal bleeding (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.96). Recurrent VTE and all‐cause mortality were not significantly different between the groups.

Conclusion

Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of bleeding relative to warfarin when used to treat acute VTE in patients with ESKD on dialysis.

### Apixaban in patients on haemodialysis: a single-dose pharmacokinetics study [^114akRsf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant inhibiting factor Xa, has been proven to reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation-related stroke and thromboembolism in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. Patients on renal replacement therapy, however, were excluded from randomized controlled trials. Therefore, uncertainty remains concerning benefits, dosing and timing of intake in haemodialysis population.

Methods

We conducted a Phase II pharmacokinetics study in which 24 patients on maintenance haemodialysis were given a single dose (2.5mg or 5mg) of apixaban, either 30min before or immediately after dialysis on the mid-week dialysis day.

Results

Apixaban 5mg resulted in higher area under the curve (AUC₀–48) in comparison with 2.5mg, although significance could only be reached for dosing pre-dialysis (2.5mg versus 5mg, P = 0.008). In line, peak concentrations (Cₘₐₓ) after dosing pre-dialysis were significantly higher in the 5mg than in the 2.5mg groups (P = 0.02). In addition, dialysis resulted in significant reduction of drug exposure. AUC₀–48 pre-dialysis were on average 48% (2.5mg) and 26% (5mg) lower than the AUC₀–48 post-dialysis, in line with Cₘₐₓ. As a result, a dose of 2.5mg post-dialysis and a dose of 5mg pre-dialysis resulted in similar AUC₀–48. In contrast, significant differences were found between the 5mg group post-dialysis and the 2.5mg group pre-dialysis (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Our data suggest that exposure to apixaban in patients on maintenance haemodialysis is dependent not only on drug dose but also on timing of intake relative to the haemodialysis procedure.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116XVdrJ]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Severe CKD and dialysis — anticoagulation considerations note that the role of anticoagulation in patients with AF and severe CKD, including those on dialysis, is controversial. The pivotal clinical trials of apixaban excluded patients with CrCl < 25 mL/min, but FDA-approved labeling was extended to include those with end-stage renal failure, including those on hemodialysis. A pharmacokinetic study found apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily produced drug levels approximating those seen with 5 mg twice daily in normal renal function, suggesting 2.5 mg is a more appropriate dose in such patients. Observational data are mixed: a Medicare cohort found no difference in thromboembolism but less major bleeding with apixaban versus warfarin, while another analysis found increased risk of thromboembolism and fatal or intracranial bleeding with apixaban 5 mg twice daily versus no anticoagulation but not with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. Two small trials of apixaban versus warfarin in hemodialysis did not show differences in safety or efficacy outcomes but reported significantly more bleeding than stroke events.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients on chronic dialysis [^112WuC4Z]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dialysis is a lifesaving therapy for patients with severely impaired kidney function. Unfortunately, the mortality and morbidity rates among patients on dialysis are still high and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death of patients on haemodialysis. The drug treatment of patients on dialysis is complex because the levels of scientific evidence are low; these individuals are systematically excluded from large, randomized controlled trials of cardiovascular therapy.

The main indications for oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism and (for VKAs only) valvular heart disease — all of which are highly prevalent among patients on dialysis. Indeed, in clinical trials, VKAs and DOACs have been compared in patients with atrial fibrillation and acute venous thromboembolism.

In chronic kidney disease (CKD), a major thromboembolic risk is paradoxically associated with a major haemorrhagic risk. Hence, the prescription of oral anticoagulants in CKD patients is challenging, and the quest for a 'perfect' oral anticoagulant continues. Although patients on dialysis were excluded from the pivotal Phase III trials of DOACs, the results of three recent, small, multicentre, randomized controlled trials in dialysis patients with atrial fibrillation were published recently. Two of these three trials compared apixaban with VKAs: one was inconclusive (due to inadequate power), and the other (with 97 patients) did not find any differences in safety or efficacy outcomes. In the third trial, the composite outcome of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and major bleeding complications was significantly less frequent among patients on rivaroxaban, relative to patients on VKAs. No clinical trials have been performed for the other indications.

Drug level over time

We did not see signs of accumulation in 25 cases that provided at least 2 measurements (Fig. 2). In these patients, first drug level measurement took place at a median (IQR) of 14 (8–30) days after initiation of apixaban (available data for 15 cases) with a total follow-up time of median (IQR) 12 (2–16) and a range of 1–51 months intake (available data for all cases).

### Anticoagulation for patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation and end-stage renal disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114pHUCE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

To date, only the cautious use of apixaban 5 mg twice daily has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients undergoing dialysis. However, the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial and most cohort studies have excluded patients undergoing dialysis, and thus the evidence remains weak. In a previous meta‐analysis by Kuno et al, apixaban 5 mg twice daily was surprisingly shown to reduce death compared with warfarin or no anticoagulation. In addition, apixaban 2.5 or 5 mg twice daily was further proposed to be associated with less bleeding but equivalent efficacy in preventing thromboembolism than warfarin. However, only 1 study on the use of apixaban was included in that study, whereas our study included 6 studies with apixaban. In our analysis, apixaban 5 mg twice daily was associated with a more preferred net clinical benefit. We also studied the combined effect of apixaban with either a usual dose or a low dose. Consistent with the previous study, apixaban was demonstrated to be better than warfarin regarding safety among patients with advanced CKD. We further found that apixaban was comparable with no anticoagulation regarding safety and efficacy. Our pooled analysis added a randomized controlled trial involving rivaroxaban and 7 studies with apixaban. However, the resultant major bleeding rate was greater only in the patients who received rivaroxaban, whereas the risk in the patients who received dabigatran was comparable to those who received apixaban of either dose.

### A randomized controlled trial comparing apixaban with the vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon in patients on chronic hemodialysis: the AXADIA-AFNET 8 study [^1138VGSX]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) by non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is the first-line therapy for most patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) to prevent stroke and systemic embolism on the basis of robust data demonstrating equal efficacy with less severe bleeding compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKA). Exceptions for therapy with NOACs are patients with mechanical heart valves – or rheumatic heart disease. The available trials provide good evidence for the safety and efficacy of NOACs in patients with mild to severe renal failure (chronic kidney disease [CKD] stage II through IV) but excluded individuals with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on chronic hemodialysis. Therefore, whether NOACs are safe and effective in patients with AF on hemodialysis is uncertain. This is of relevance, as patients on hemodialysis who are initiated on VKA show a high risk of bleeding. – Moreover, use of VKA accelerates vascular calcifications in patients with CKD and especially those on hemodialysis, thus further contributing to advanced arteriosclerosis. In rare cases, use of VKAs in hemodialysis may lead to the life-threating complication of calciphylaxis. Therefore, alternatives for VKA are of growing interest because with the increasing prevalence of older age, AF, and cardiovascular comorbidities, the group of patients with terminal renal failure is also growing rapidly.

Some retrospective and small, prospective, nonrandomized studies in the past suggested that NOACs might be safe and effective in patients on hemodialysis. – The NOAC apixaban is mainly eliminated by means of metabolization and excretion in the liver, rendering apixaban a suitable NOAC in patients with AF on hemodialysis. The investigator-initiated, multicenter, PROBE (prospective randomized open blinded end point) outcome assessment trial AXADIA–AFNET 8 (Compare Apixaban and Vitamin K Antagonists in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and End-Stage Kidney Disease) compared the NOAC apixaban (2.5 mg BID) with VKA therapy in patients with AF on hemodialysis.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^111pYGFB]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at significantly increased risk for both thrombosis and bleeding relative to those with normal renal function. The optimal therapy of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with ESKD is unknown.

Objective

To compare the safety and effectiveness of apixaban relative to warfarin in patients with ESKD and acute VTE.

Design, Setting and Participants

New-user, active-comparator retrospective United States population-based cohort with inverse probability of treatment weighting, using the United States Renal Data System data from 2014 to 2018. We included adults with ESKD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis who were newly initiated on apixaban or warfarin for an acute VTE.

Main Outcome and Measures

The coprimary outcomes were major bleeding, recurrent VTE, and all-cause mortality within 6 months of anticoagulant initiation. Secondary outcomes were intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding. The primary analyses were based on intent-to-treat defined by the first drug received and accounted for competing risks of death. Sensitivity analyses included varied follow-up time, as-treated analyses, and dose-specific apixaban subgroups.

Results

The apixaban and warfarin cohorts included 2302 and 9263 patients, respectively. Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70–0.94), intracranial bleeding (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48–0.98), and gastrointestinal bleeding (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.96). Recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality were not significantly different between the groups.

Conclusion

Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of bleeding relative to warfarin when used to treat acute VTE in patients with ESKD on dialysis.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients on chronic dialysis [^115zmVfE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The present safety analysis provides reassurance regarding the off-label use of DOACs in people on dialysis. Specifically, we observed a non-significantly lower risk of bleeding in the DOACs group, relative to the VKA group. The results of the major clinical trials that paved the way for the regulatory approval of DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation (such as Randomized Evaluation of Long Term Anticoagulant Therapy (RE-LY), Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE), Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (ENGAGE AF-TIMI)) show that DOACs were associated with lesser bleeding events. Furthermore, the trend towards the greater safety of DOACs has also been observed in various large cohort studies of medical-administrative databases. Clinical trials of apixaban vs warfarin in patients with ESKD on dialysis failed to show differences but those was probably due to a lack of power. However, a retrospective analysis of a US healthcare reimbursement database indicated that apixaban was associated with a lower risk (vs warfarin) of major bleeding in patients on dialysis.

Given the potentially favourable risk–benefit ratio in dialysis patients, DOAC might be a good alternative treatment to VKAs. The burden of taking a VKA is not negligible for a patient on dialysis; the treatment is complicated by potential drug–diet interactions, the need for more frequent blood sampling for therapeutic monitoring, and an elevated risk of cardiovascular calcification and calciphylaxis.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^115y95Bf]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Patients with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at significantly increased risk for both thrombosis and bleeding relative to those with normal renal function, which makes anticoagulation particularly challenging. Furthermore, patients with ESKD initiating anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE) are typically hospitalized to receive parenteral heparin when starting warfarin, putting them at risk for hospital‐associated complications, including heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia. A safe, effective therapy for this high‐risk population is needed.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban — have provided options for the management of VTE but have not been extensively evaluated in individuals with ESKD for this indication. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran have been associated with a higher risk of bleeding than warfarin in patients with ESKD who are anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation (AF) in observational studies. A small randomized study of reduced dose rivaroxaban (10 mg daily) versus warfarin noted similar rates of major bleeding, stroke, and systemic embolism in this population although it was underpowered to demonstrate noninferiority for these clinically important outcomes. Apixaban may be safer than warfarin, with recent evidence supporting lower bleeding rates in patients with ESKD treated for AF.RENAL‐AF, an open randomized controlled trial (RCT) of apixaban versus warfarin for atrial fibrillation in patients on hemodialysis was halted prematurely due to slow accrual. Therefore, high‐quality RCT data evaluating DOACs for patients with ESKD and AF are lacking. Similarly, the safety and effectiveness of apixaban relative to warfarin in patients with ESKD and acute VTE have not been extensively studied. There is reason to speculate that bleeding risk and risk of recurrent thrombosis could be different in patients with AF compared to VTE treated with apixaban. Patients with VTE are generally treated with higher doses of apixaban (10 mg twice daily for 1 week followed by 5 mg twice daily); in AF, there is no role for doses greater than 5 mg twice daily at treatment initiation, and some patients can be treated with 2.5 mg twice daily, depending on patient factors. In contrast, in VTE, the use of less than 5 mg twice daily — regardless of patient characteristics — is off‐label. We sought to characterize recent trends in the use of apixaban to treat VTE in ESKD and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of apixaban compared to warfarin. We hypothesized a lower bleeding risk and similar effectiveness of apixaban when compared to warfarin.

### The use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in dialysis patients – A systematic review [^11415NaN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are used for prevention of thromboembolic events, but their use in dialysis patients is debatable. This study investigated the available evidence for the use of NOACs in dialysis patients. Online databases were systematically searched for eligible studies including pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, cohort studies, and randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing NOAC with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or no anticoagulant treatment. Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of bias tool were used for quality assessment. Twenty studies were identified (nine PK studies, two RCTs, and nine cohort studies). Most of the studies investigated apixaban or rivaroxaban. In dialysis patients, less accumulation was reported with apixaban and rivaroxaban compared to dabigatran and edoxaban. PK studies indicate that high dose apixaban or rivaroxaban should be avoided. The two RCTs (rivaroxaban/apixaban vs. VKA) were small and underpowered regarding stroke and bleeding outcomes. Most cohort studies found apixaban superior to VKA, whereas comparison of rivaroxaban with VKA yielded conflicting results. Cohort studies comparing apixaban high dose (5 mg) with low dose (2.5 mg) twice daily suggest a lower risk of stroke with high dose but also a higher risk of bleeding with high dose. Apixaban versus no anticoagulation was compared in one cohort study and did not lower the risk of stroke compared with non-treated regardless of apixaban dosage. Widespread use of NOACs in dialysis patients is limited by adequately sized RCTs. Available evidence suggests a potential for use of apixaban and rivaroxaban in reduced dose.

Abstract

Non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are used for prevention of thromboembolic events, but their use in dialysis patients is debatable. This study investigated the available evidence for the use of NOACs in dialysis patients. Online databases were systematically searched for eligible studies including pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, cohort studies, and randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing NOAC with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or no anticoagulant treatment. Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of bias tool were used for quality assessment. Twenty studies were identified (nine PK studies, two RCTs, and nine cohort studies). Most of the studies investigated apixaban or rivaroxaban. In dialysis patients, less accumulation was reported with apixaban and rivaroxaban compared to dabigatran and edoxaban. PK studies indicate that high dose apixaban or rivaroxaban should be avoided. The two RCTs (rivaroxaban/apixaban vs. VKA) were small and underpowered regarding stroke and bleeding outcomes. Most cohort studies found apixaban superior to VKA, whereas comparison of rivaroxaban with VKA yielded conflicting results. Cohort studies comparing apixaban high dose (5 mg) with low dose (2.5 mg) twice daily suggest a lower risk of stroke with high dose but also a higher risk of bleeding with high dose. Apixaban versus no anticoagulation was compared in one cohort study and did not lower the risk of stroke compared with non‐treated regardless of apixaban dosage. Widespread use of NOACs in dialysis patients is limited by adequately sized RCTs. Available evidence suggests a potential for use of apixaban and rivaroxaban in reduced dose.

### Outcomes associated with apixaban use in patients with end-stage kidney disease and atrial fibrillation in the United States [^1131Wn36]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis were excluded from clinical trials of direct oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation (AF). Recent data have raised concerns regarding the safety of dabigatran and rivaroxaban, but apixaban has not been evaluated despite current labeling supporting its use in this population. The goal of this study was to determine patterns of apixaban use and its associated outcomes in dialysis-dependent patients with ESKD and AF.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries included in the United States Renal Data System (October 2010 to December 2015). Eligible patients were those with ESKD and AF undergoing dialysis who initiated treatment with an oral anticoagulant. Because of the small number of dabigatran and rivaroxaban users, outcomes were only assessed in patients treated with apixaban or warfarin. Apixaban and warfarin patients were matched (1:3) based on prognostic score. Differences between groups in survival free of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and death were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were derived from Cox regression analyses.

Results

The study population consisted of 25523 patients (45.7% women; 68.2 ± 11.9 years of age), including 2351 patients on apixaban and 23172 patients on warfarin. An annual increase in apixaban prescriptions was observed after its marketing approval at the end of 2012, such that 26.6% of new anticoagulant prescriptions in 2015 were for apixaban. In matched cohorts, there was no difference in the risks of stroke/systemic embolism between apixaban and warfarin (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.69–1.12; P = 0.29), but apixaban was associated with a significantly lower risk of major bleeding (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59–0.87; P < 0.001). In sensitivity analyses, standard-dose apixaban (5 mg twice a day; n = 1034) was associated with significantly lower risks of stroke/systemic embolism and death as compared with either reduced-dose apixaban (2.5 mg twice a day; n = 1317; HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37–0.98; P = 0.04 for stroke/systemic embolism; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45–0.92; P = 0.01 for death) or warfarin (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42–0.97; P = 0.04 for stroke/systemic embolism; HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46–0.85; P = 0.003 for death).

Conclusions

Among patients with ESKD and AF on dialysis, apixaban use may be associated with a lower risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin, with a standard 5 mg twice a day dose also associated with reductions in thromboembolic and mortality risk.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^1129ay5S]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The apixaban and warfarin cohorts included 2302 and 9263 patients, respectively (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 4). The mean age of individuals in the apixaban and warfarin cohorts was 59.8 years (standard deviation [SD] 15.1 years) and 58.3 (SD 15.2). The apixaban and warfarin cohorts were 45.9% and 44.6% White, respectively, and were 55.3% and 54.1% female (Table 1). The dialysis modality at the index date was hemodialysis for 93.8% and peritoneal dialysis for 6.2%. The groups were similar even prior to weighting and were very well‐matched after weighting (Table 2). The proportion of apixaban users in the study population increased markedly during the study period from 2% in 2014 to 47% in 2018 (Supporting Information: Appendix Figure 2). Half of the patients in the apixaban cohort filled prescriptions exclusively for 5 mg tablets (50.0%), while 40.5% exclusively filled 2.5 mg tablets and 9.5% filled a combination of the two tablet strengths. The mean daily dose per patient for apixaban users was 6.7 mg (SD 3.0 mg).

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients on chronic dialysis [^115izBdV]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Although patients on dialysis were excluded from the pivotal Phase III trials of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), the results of randomized controlled trials comparing apixaban or rivaroxaban vs vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in dialysis patients with atrial fibrillation were published recently.
Of these trials, one was inconclusive due to inadequate power, one with 97 patients did not find any differences in safety or efficacy outcomes, and one found that the composite outcome of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and major bleeding complications was significantly less frequent among patients on rivaroxaban, relative to patients on VKAs.
Most of the retrospective cohort studies comparing these two drug classes were performed in the USA, where, in contrast to Europe, apixaban has been approved for the treatment of non-valvular fibrillation in patients on haemodialysis.

This study adds:

The fact that patients on dialysis are excluded from large, cardiovascular disease–focused randomized controlled trials (such as those with DOACs) significantly limits the evidence needed to make clinical decisions.
In the present study of a large, nationwide, incident cohort of new oral anticoagulant users on maintenance dialysis, the initiation of DOAC therapy (compared with the initiation of VKA therapy) was associated with a significantly lower risk of thromboembolism and a non-significantly lower risk of major bleeding.
Our real-world study of patients on dialysis is one of the first of its type to have assessed the effectiveness and safety of off-label DOAC prescription (relative to VKA prescription) in Europe.

Potential impact:

These results are reassuring with regard to the off-label use of DOACs and might facilitate the establishment of an expert consensus and guidelines on antithrombotic therapy in patients with end-stage kidney disease.

### Safety and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin for atrial fibrillation in end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis: a meta-analysis of randomized control trials [^116uyzEq]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are commonly encountered, with ESRD itself serving as a well-established risk factor for AF. 1 The 2018 AF guidelines have recommended apixaban across all the spectrums of renal impairment, including patients on hemodialysis (HD), and the 2019 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society updated guidelines have suggested careful consideration of reduced dose of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with ESRD. 2, 3 The current data on the safety and efficacy of warfarin versus DOACs in patients with AF with ESRD and HD is variable. This study aimed to perform a study-level meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of warfarin and DOACs in patients with AF who require dialysis.

### The use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in dialysis patients – A systematic review [^1132s9Es]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Medium credibility.

The criteria used for starting anticoagulant therapy regardless of NOAC or VKA are debatable and vary between studies. In terms of AF in the dialysis population, the risk of stroke due to short lasting episodes of asymptomatic AF (e.g. detected by continuous monitoring) might be substantially lower than that of permanent AF or symptomatic AF diagnosed by usual care yet with a similar risk of bleeding if anticoagulant therapy is initiated. Furthermore, anticoagulant treatment does not eliminate the risk of stroke. In some patients, especially those prone to bleeding, alternatives such as left atrial appendage occlusion could be a better alternative instead of anticoagulant therapy.

Currently, three upcoming RCTs will investigate use of apixaban in ESRD patients. ALAXIA compares apixaban versus phenprocoumon in HD patients, whereas SAFE‐D compares apixaban with warfarin or no anticoagulants in both HD and PD patients. The Swedish SACK trial will compare apixaban versus no anticoagulation in patients with eGFR < 15 +/− dialysis. In addition, the AVKDIAL and DANWARD trials will investigate VKA versus no anticoagulant treatment in dialysis patients with AF. Until then, available evidence suggests a potential for use of apixaban and rivaroxaban in reduced dose as an alternative to VKA in dialysis patients if anticoagulant treatment is deemed necessary.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients on chronic dialysis [^113Jnpa2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

At the start of the study period, DOACs accounted for 5.4% of the oral anticoagulant treatments in France. This proportion rose to 12% by 2020, even though none of the four DOACs is currently approved by the European Medicines Agency for use in patients on dialysis. However, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of apixaban in these patients in late 2012, and so most of the observational studies in this population were performed in the USA. Indeed, Siontis et al. 's retrospective cohort study of Medicare recipients registered in the US Renal Data System found that DOACs were increasingly prescribed to patients with atrial fibrillation on dialysis and that 26.6% of new anticoagulation prescriptions in 2015 were for apixaban.

For decades, VKAs have formed the mainstay of thromboembolic event prevention in patients on dialysis and who are eligible for oral anticoagulation. However, the thromboembolism risk reduction associated with VKAs was lower for patients on dialysis than for patients without end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and there was even a potentially greater risk of bleeding because of VKA-associated platelet dysfunction. According to data from clinical trials and from real-world studies, anticoagulation in VKA-treated patients on dialysis is suboptimal and is associated with a significantly greater risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Indeed, in the RENAL-AF trials of apixaban vs warfarin, the median time in the therapeutic range was only 44% in warfarin-treated patients; the latter were three times more likely to be subtherapeutic [international normalized ratio (INR) < 2.0] than supratherapeutic (INR > 3.0). The difficulty of obtaining effective anticoagulation with VKA might explain our observation of a lower thromboembolism risk with DOACs than with VKAs.

### Apixaban pharmacokinetics at steady state in hemodialysis patients [^115vJBDb]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether warfarin is protective or harmful in patients with ESRD and atrial fibrillation. This state of equipoise raises the question of whether alternative anticoagulants may have a therapeutic role. We aimed to determine apixaban pharmacokinetics at steady state in patients on hemodialysis. Seven patients received apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily for 8 days. Blood samples were collected before and after apixaban administration on days 1 and 8 (nondialysis days). Significant accumulation of the drug was observed between days 1 and 8 with the 2.5-mg dose. The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours increased from 628 to 2054 ng h/ml (P < 0.001). Trough levels increased from 45 to 132 ng/ml (P < 0.001). On day 9, after a 2.5-mg dose, apixaban levels were monitored hourly during dialysis. Only 4% of the drug was removed. After a 5-day washout period, five patients received 5 mg apixaban twice daily for 8 days. The area under the concentration-time curve further increased to 6045 ng h/ml (P = 0.03), and trough levels increased to 218 ng/ml (P = 0.03), above the 90th percentile for the 5-mg dose in patients with preserved renal function. Apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily in patients on hemodialysis resulted in drug exposure comparable with that of the standard dose (5 mg twice daily) in patients with preserved renal function and might be a reasonable alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients on dialysis. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily led to supratherapeutic levels in patients on hemodialysis and should be avoided.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients on chronic dialysis [^1144aVH2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Most of the retrospective cohort studies comparing these two drug classes were performed in the USA, where, in contrast to Europe, apixaban has been approved for the treatment of non-valvular fibrillation in patients on haemodialysis. However, recent reports suggest that in Europe, DOACs are used off-label in patients on dialysis. Hence, it is important to collect data on the safety and effectiveness of these off-label prescriptions. In the absence of strong evidence from clinical trials, observational studies of routine clinical practice can provide insights into the effectiveness and safety of medications.

In the present comparative study, we sought to assess the thrombotic and bleeding risks associated with the approved use of VKAs vs the off-label use of DOACs in patients on dialysis. We took an opportunity to use data from the French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN) registry, which is linked to the French national healthcare system database (Système National des Données de Santé, SNDS).

### Anticoagulation for patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation and end-stage renal disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113i9suc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the findings of this study updated the latest evidence for the use of anticoagulants in patients with end‐stage renal disease undergoing dialysis. Among DOACs, dabigatran and rivaroxaban were associated with a lower risk of thromboembolism, whereas fewer bleeding events were demonstrated in the patients receiving apixaban. VKAs were associated with worse safety and efficacy. There was no significant difference in the prognosis in the patients who did not receive anticoagulants compared with those who received either DOACs or VKAs. The anticoagulation strategy should therefore be tailored individually.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total subjects in the ARISTOTLE and AVERROES clinical studies, > 69% were 65 years of age and older, and > 31% were 75 years of age and older. In the ADVANCE-1, ADVANCE-2, and ADVANCE-3 clinical studies, 50% of subjects were 65 years of age and older, while 16% were 75 years of age and older. In the AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT clinical studies, > 32% of subjects were 65 years of age and older and > 13% were 75 years of age and older. No clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed when comparing subjects in different age groups.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation The recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]:

- age greater than or equal to 80 years

- body weight less than or equal to 60 kg

- serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL

Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis

Clinical efficacy and safety studies with apixaban tablets did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, administration of apixaban tablets at the usually recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] will result in concentrations of apixaban and pharmacodynamic activity similar to those observed in the ARISTOTLE study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar stroke reduction and bleeding risk in patients with ESRD on dialysis as was seen in ARISTOTLE.

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery, and Treatment of DVT and PE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment, including those with ESRD on dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Clinical efficacy and safety studies with apixaban tablets did not enroll patients with ESRD on dialysis or patients with a CrCl < 15 mL/min; therefore, dosing recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (anti-FXa activity) data in subjects with ESRD maintained on dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Clarification for apixaban dosing in patients with impaired… [^11771HKv]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

To the Editor: We thank the authors for a very well-written and thorough review of the current treatment landscape for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Table 1 reviews direct oral anticoagulant dosing, including renal dose adjustments. Apixaban renal dosing was included as 2. 5 mg orally twice daily if at least one criterion is met: serum creatinine

1. 5 mg per dL or more, age 80 years or older, or weight 60 kg or less. The AMPLIFY trial looked at apixaban for treatment of deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism and excluded patients with a serum creatinine level of 2. 5 mg per dL or greater, or a creatinine clearance less than 25 mL per minute per

3. 73 m 2 and patients on dialysis were not included in clinical trials; all the conclusions we drew from the literature regarding these patients were based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. However, as Drs. Naik and Ragheb correctly state, the manufacturer does not recommend any adjustment for renal insufficiency, age, or weight when treating venous thromboembolism. 1 According to the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, no renal adjustment is necessary for apixaban when used to treat venous thromboembolism, even in patients with end-stage renal disease and/or patients on hemodialysis.
2. Upon further consideration and to provide a recommendation that is most consistent with current knowledge, we would like to remove our recommendation for dose adjustment of apixaban.

However, we recommend careful monitoring for any patient prescribed apixaban for venous thromboembolism whose renal function falls outside of the population that was studied in clinical trials.

### Balancing the risks of stroke and bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation and renal dysfunction [^1116sVzR]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The study does not probe anticoagulation for AF in patients on dialysis, and the existing literature is of a conflicting nature. The VALKYRIE trial showed superiority of xarelto vs VKA. The AXADIA-AFNET 8 trial of apixaban 2.5 mg vs VKA found no difference in safety and efficacy outcomes, and despite anticoagulation, end-stage renal disease patients remained at high risk for cardiovascular events, bleeding, and death. Similarly, an observational study reported a significantly higher incidence of fatal or intracranial bleeding events with apixaban vs no anticoagulation.

Thus, despite guidelines recommending dose modification based on CrCl, the hesitation to use DOACs in moderate to severe CKD has led to off-label dosing. This necessitates attention, as there have been concerning reports linking underdosing in CKD to a higher risk of stroke and thromboembolism, including a 5-fold higher risk of stroke with low-dose vs standard-dose apixaban. A United States Renal Data System study found that standard-dose apixaban was better at lowering stroke, systemic embolism, and death compared to low-dose apixaban and VKA.

End‐Stage Renal Disease

Currently available NOACs are primarily renally excreted. Dabigatran is 80% renally excreted, while the renal excretion of factor Xa inhibitors ranges between 6% and 13% (betrixaban) and 50% (edoxaban). 112 Clinical trials included patients with mild to moderate renal disease with assigned lower study dose in most of these trials. Rivaroxaban 15 mg once per day 13, 15 and edoxaban 30 mg once per day 16 were used in patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min. The dose of apixaban was reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily in the presence of 2 of 3 factors (age > 80 years, weight < 60 kg, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or greater). The proportion of patients with moderate renal disease (creatinine clearance of 30–49 mL/min) that enrolled in these trials ranged between 15% and 21%. In a study of 14 264 patients with nonvalvular AF and creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min, rivaroxaban 15 mg per day had similar efficacy and safety compared with dose‐adjusted warfarin. 113 A meta‐analysis of 10 trials and 40 693 patients with creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min suggested that NOACs are noninferior to standard anticoagulation, and they are associated with less bleeding. 114 However, clinical trials excluded patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban and < 25 mL/min for apixaban) and those on dialysis. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of NOACs in these patient populations. Despite the dearth of data, there is a reported increase in the number of NOAC prescriptions in patients on dialysis. 115 In pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic simulation studies, most NOAC administration in patients on dialysis could potentially result in higher levels compared with those without renal impairment. 116, 117, 118 In a small pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety study, patients with end‐stage renal disease on dialysis (n = 8) had a modest increase (36%) in apixaban area under the curve and no increase in apixaban maximal concentration compared with subjects with normal renal function (n = 8). Hemodialysis had a limited impact on apixaban clearance. 119 These data resulted in the Food and Drug Administration revising the label of apixaban and recommending that 5 mg twice daily can be used in patients with end‐stage renal disease on hemodialysis, while 2.5 mg twice daily should be used in patients who are older than 80 years of age or weigh < 60 kg. Until clinical data on the safety and efficacy of other NOACs in patients with end‐stage renal disease or on dialysis become available, apixaban could be used with caution while other NOACs should not be used in these patients. VKAs have been the standard anticoagulation treatment, although a clear benefit over risk has not been demonstrated, and more data are needed for this challenging group of patients. 120

### Meta-analysis on risk of bleeding with apixaban in patients with renal impairment [^1152Rkuy]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Apixaban is a novel oral anticoagulant which is approved for the management of atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. There have been concerns regarding bleeding risks with apixaban in patients with renal impairment. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of bleeding with apixaban in these patients. Relevant studies were identified through electronic literature searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and clinicaltrials.gov (from inception to February 24, 2014). Phase III randomized controlled trials that compared apixaban with conventional agents (vitamin K antagonist and/or warfarin, low molecular weight heparin, aspirin, and placebo) were included. We defined mild renal impairment as creatinine clearance of 50 to 80 ml/min and moderate to severe renal impairment as creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min. Study-specific risk ratios were calculated, and between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistics. In 6 trials involving 40,145 patients, the risk of bleeding with apixaban in patients with mild renal impairment was significantly less (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.96, I(2) = 13%) compared with conventional anticoagulants. In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, the risk of bleeding with was found to be similar (risk ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 2.10, I(2) = 72%). In conclusion, compared with the conventional agents, bleeding risk with apixaban in patients with mild and moderate to severe renal insufficiency is lower and similar, respectively.

Apixaban: The RENAL-AF and AXADIA Trials

The RENAL-AF trial compared the safety and efficacy of apixaban with warfarin in patients on maintenance hemodialysis with documented nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥ 2. Study participants were randomly allocated to apixaban 5 mg twice daily or dose-adjusted warfarin to achieve a target INR of 2–3. The reduced dose of apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) was used if participants were ≥ 80 years old or had a body weight ≤ 60 kg. The initial target size was 762 patients but the lower than anticipated recruitment rate led to the premature interruption of the study after enrollment of 154 participants. The median follow-up was 11 months. The median age was 68 years, 36% of participants were women, and 58% had diabetes. The median CHA₂DS₂ -VASc score was 4; 25% of participants had a history of stroke and the median time since dialysis initiation was 3 years. In the warfarin group, TTR was 44% with patients being 3 times more likely to be subtherapeutic than supratherapeutic. The 1-year incidence of the primary outcome (major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding) was 31.5% in the apixaban arm and 25.5% in the warfarin arm (HR 1.20; 95% CI: 0.63–2.30). With regards to the secondary outcomes, the 1-year event rates for stroke or SE were 3.0 and 3.3% in the apixaban and warfarin groups, respectively, while 21 deaths occurred in the apixaban group (26%) versus 13 in the warfarin group (18%). The study was not adequately powered but failed to establish noninferiority or superiority of apixaban compared with warfarin in ESKD.

### Apixaban dosing patterns versus warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation receiving dialysis: a Retrospective cohort study [^112NTBYT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Objectives

Comparison of clinical outcomes across anticoagulation regimens using different apixaban dosing or warfarin is not well-defined in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) who are receiving dialysis. This study compared these outcomes in a US national cohort of patients with kidney failure receiving maintenance dialysis.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

Patients receiving dialysis represented in the US Renal Data System database 2013–2018 who had AF and were treated with apixaban or warfarin.

Exposure

First prescribed treatment with apixaban dosed according to the label, apixaban dosed below the label, or warfarin.

Outcome

Ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality.

Analytical Approach

Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weighting. Analyses simulating an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach as well as those incorporating censoring at drug switch or discontinuation (CAS) were also implemented. Inverse probability of censoring weighting was used to account for possible informative censoring.

Results

Among 17,156 individuals, there was no difference in risk of stroke/systemic embolism among the label-concordant apixaban, below-label apixaban, and warfarin treatment groups. Both label-concordant (HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.55–0.81]) and below-label (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.55–0.84]) apixaban dosing were associated with a lower risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin in ITT analyses. Compared with label-concordant apixaban, below-label apixaban was not associated with a lower bleeding risk (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.78–1.34]). In the ITT analysis of mortality, label-concordant apixaban dosing was associated with a lower risk versus warfarin (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78–0.92]) while there was no significant difference in mortality between below-label dosing of apixaban and warfarin (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.89–1.05]). Overall, results were similar for the CAS analyses.

Limitations

Study limited to US Medicare beneficiaries; reliance on administrative claims to ascertain outcomes of AF, stroke, and bleeding; likely residual confounding.

Conclusions

Among patients with nonvalvular AF undergoing dialysis, warfarin is associated with an increased risk of bleeding compared with apixaban. The risk of bleeding with below-label apixaban was not detectably less than with label-concordant dosing. Label-concordant apixaban dosing is associated with a mortality benefit compared to warfarin. Label-concordant dosing, rather than reduced-label dosing, may offer the most favorable benefit-risk trade-off for dialysis patients with nonvalvular AF.

### Apixaban versus warfarin for treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients receiving long-term dialysis [^113AQjwZ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The association of apixaban compared with warfarin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients receiving maintenance dialysis is not well studied.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries receiving dialysis using United States Renal Data System data from 2013 to 2018. The study included patients who received a new prescription for apixaban or warfarin following a venous thromboembolism diagnosis. The outcomes were recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and death. Outcomes were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression for intention-to-treat and censored-at-drug-switch-or-discontinuation analyses. Models incorporated inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights to minimize confounding and informative censoring.

Results

In 12,206 individuals, apixaban, compared with warfarin, was associated with lower risks of both recurrent venous thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.43 to 0.77) and major bleeding (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.98) in the intention-to-treat analysis over 6 months of follow-up. However, there was no difference between apixaban and warfarin in terms of risk of all-cause death (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.16). Corresponding hazard ratios for the 6-month censored-at-drug-switch-or-discontinuation analysis and for corresponding analyses limited to a shorter (3-month) follow-up were all highly similar to the primary analysis.

Conclusions

In a large group of US patients on dialysis with recent venous thromboembolism, we observed that apixaban was associated with lower risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism and of major bleeding than warfarin. There was no observed difference in mortality.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114hXpmi]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — anticoagulation recommendations specify the following: For patients with AF at elevated risk for stroke and CKD stage 3, treatment with warfarin, or preferably, evidence-based doses of direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitors is recommended to reduce the risk of stroke. For patients with AF at elevated risk for stroke and CKD stage 4, treatment with warfarin or labeled doses of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is reasonable to reduce the risk of stroke. For patients with AF at elevated risk for stroke and who have end-stage CKD (CrCl < 15 mL/min) or are on dialysis, it might be reasonable to prescribe warfarin (INR 2.0–3.0) or an evidence-based dose of apixaban for oral anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke.

### Oral anticoagulation for patients with Atrial fibrillation on long-term hemodialysis [^111yKMiJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients on long-term dialysis are at increased risk of bleeding. Although oral anticoagulants (OACs) are recommended for atrial fibrillation (AF) to reduce the risk of stroke, randomized trials have excluded these populations. As such, the net clinical benefit of OACs among patients on dialysis is unknown.

Objectives

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of OACs in patients with AF on long-term dialysis.

Methods

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched through June 10, 2019, for studies that investigated the efficacy and safety of different OAC strategies in patients with AF on long-term dialysis. The efficacy outcomes were ischemic stroke and/or systemic thromboembolism, all-cause mortality, and the safety outcome was major bleeding.

Results

This study identified 16 eligible observational studies (N = 71,877) regarding patients on long-term dialysis who had AF. Only 2 of 16 studies investigated direct OACs. Outcomes for dabigatran and rivaroxaban were limited to major bleeding events. Compared with no anticoagulants, apixaban and warfarin were not associated with a significant decrease in stroke and/or systemic thromboembolism (apixaban 5 mg, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30 to 1.17; apixaban 2.5 mg, HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.93; warfarin, HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.16). Apixaban 5 mg was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality (vs. warfarin, HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.93; vs. apixaban 2.5 mg, HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.90; vs. no anticoagulant, HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.90). Warfarin was associated with a significantly higher risk of major bleeding than apixaban 5 min/2.5 mg and no anticoagulant (vs. apixaban 5 mg, HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.88; vs. apixaban 2.5 mg, HR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.82; vs. no anticoagulant, HR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.50). Dabigatran and rivaroxaban were also associated with significantly higher risk of major bleeding than apixaban and no anticoagulant.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis showed that OACs were not associated with a reduced risk of thromboembolism in patients with AF on long-term dialysis. Warfarin, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban were associated with significantly higher bleeding risk compared with apixaban and no anticoagulant. The benefit-to-risk ratio of OACs in patients with AF on long-term dialysis warrants validation in randomized clinical trials.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use in chronic kidney disease and dialysis patients with venous thromboembolism: a systematic review of thrombosis and bleeding outcomes [^113VKAZ2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate how treatment with DOACs for VTE affects thrombosis and bleeding outcomes compared to warfarin in CKD and dialysis patients.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted for studies evaluating VTE and bleeding outcomes with DOAC use in CKD and dialysis patients. Searches conducted through EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception to September 22, 2020.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case series with ≥ 10 patients included.

Data Synthesis

From 7286 studies, nine studies met inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference between DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) and warfarin for reducing recurrent VTE and bleeding events in moderate CKD patients. The risk of overall major bleeding increased when the degree of kidney impairment increased. There was no significant difference between apixaban and warfarin for VTE outcomes in dialysis patients.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

There continues to be a controversial debate whether it may be more beneficial to use DOACs versus warfarin in CKD/dialysis patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). The risk vs benefit of using DOACs in the CKD/ESKD population should continue to be evaluated for each individual patient.

Conclusion

Apixaban may be used cautiously as an alternative in acute VTE treatment in severe CKD patients. Insufficient evidence is available to suggest the use of dabigatran and rivaroxaban in this patient population. The benefit of using DOACs in this population for VTE treatment should be weighed against the potential bleeding risk in patients with CKD.

### Effect of peritoneal dialysis in end-stage renal disease on apixaban pharmacokinetics [^113nzqht]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Limited pharmacokinetics data are guiding the use of apixaban in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis but none on peritoneal dialysis. Apixaban could be an alternative to harmful warfarin anticoagulation. Before conducting studies to explore the efficacy and safety of apixaban in this patient population, a pharmacokinetic study was required which is essential to determine the appropriate dosage. The objective of the ApiDP ('APIxaban et Dialyse Péritonéale') study was then to assess the effect of peritoneal dialysis in ESRD patients on the pharmacokinetic parameters of apixaban. ApiDP was a prospective, controlled pharmacokinetics trial (NCT04006093) which included participants in two French University hospitals. Each ESRD patient on peritoneal dialysis was matched to a volunteer with normal renal function based on age, weight and sex to act as control. A single oral 5 mg dose of apixaban was administered and adequate blood and urine ± dialysate samples were collected for determination of pharmacokinetic parameters during 72 h. ESRD patients were undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis at enrollment and the peritoneal dialysis scheme was standardized at the time of apixaban administration: patients received four exchanges per day with dialysate volumes of 2 L per exchange: Dianeal ® (6 h), Nutrineal ® (6 h), Physioneal 40: 1.36% ® (4 h) and Extraneal ® (8 h) solutions. The pharmacokinetic parameters of apixaban were derived from plasma concentration–time curve using a 1-compartment open model. The apparent first-order rate constant (ke) was determined by least squares regression analysis of the terminal phase of the plasma concentration–time curves. The resulting parameters were calculated as follows: apparent half-life (T 1/2) from the relation T 1/2 = Ln2/ke; apparent volume of distribution (V/F) from D/C 0 where D is the administered dose and C 0 the plasma concentration extrapolated at time 0; AUC 0 -inf, the area under the concentration–time curve extended to infinity from AUC 0 -inf = AUC 0–24 h + (C 24 h/ke), AUC 0–24 h being calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule over the interval of 0 to 24 h; apparent total plasma clearance, ratio of total plasma clearance on bioavailability (Cl/F) from the equation Cl/F = D/AUC 0 -inf. The maximum plasma concentration (C max) and the time required to reach C max (T max) were observed from the concentration–time profile for each participant. The peritoneal dialysis extraction ratio (PDER) (fraction of apixaban in the dialysis solution) was estimated for the first 24 h period using the following equation: PDER(%) = (Dd/D) × 100, where Dd is the total amount of drug recovered in the peritoneal dialysis fluid at the end of the 24 h period following apixaban administration. The total amount of apixaban recovered in urine (Du) and the renal extraction ratio (RER) were so determined for the first 24 h period. Renal and peritoneal clearances (Cl r and Cl p, respectively) were calculated during the 24 h period that followed apixaban administration using the following relations: Cl r = Q 24h urine/AUC 0–24 h and Cl p = Q 24h dialysate/AUC 0–24 h.

### The use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in dialysis patients – A systematic review [^114jfdTZ]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, Europe and the United States treat dialysis patients differently in terms of apixaban. FDA has approved use of apixaban in dialysis patients, and a growing number of patients are now treated with apixaban which in 2015 accounted for roughly 25% of new anticoagulation prescriptions for ESRD patients in the United States. The FDA approval has been met with some skepticism due to a lack of apixaban RCTs in ESRD. FDA approval was allegedly primarily based on PK data originating from a small study by Wang et al.in which eight HD patients and eight healthy subjects were treated with apixaban 5 mg resulting in comparable maximum blood concentrations and anti‐factor Xa activity. So far, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)has not approved apixaban for use in patients with eGFR < 15 ml/min including dialysis patients.

Three cohort studies compared rivaroxaban with warfarin with somewhat different results. The largest of these by Coleman et al. found similar stroke prevention and lower risk of bleeding with rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in a mixed cohort primarily consisting of CKD 5 and dialysis patients. Contrary to this, in a cohort of HD patients, Chan et al.found that rivaroxaban was associated with increased risk of both stroke and bleeding compared with warfarin treatment. The Valkyrie studywas the only RCT investigating rivaroxaban. Despite of the relatively small sample size, the study was a well‐designed RCT with a long follow‐up period of 18 months plus an extended follow‐up phase. Moreover, the choice of 10 mg rivaroxaban dose was based on a dose‐finding study, although one might argue that stroke prevention potentially could be suboptimal with a 10 mg dose. The two cohort studies mentioned above both reported higher rivaroxaban dose. In contrast, the Taiwanese cohort studyfound a lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism alongside a similar incidence of bleeding as warfarin treated in the subgroup of patients treated with 10 mg of rivaroxaban. The incidence of major bleeding and stroke outcomes may be more evident in a larger study with more patients, yet the results from the Valkyrie study seem promising. Thus, in dialysis patients, low dose rivaroxaban (10 mg) may be a suitable alternative to VKA, but larger rivaroxaban RCTs are required prior to widespread use.

### Practical issues in clinical scenarios involving CKD patients requiring antithrombotic therapy in light of the 2017 ESC guideline recommendations [^111gQR8i]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

As has been stated in our previous work, evidence for the safety and benefit of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in advanced CKD is very limited, with concerns regarding their metabolism in patients with minimal renal function and the associated risk of drug accumulation. Thus, where OAT is necessary, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are favored. A similar rationale applies to the use of clopidogrel in favor of other antiplatelet agents since evidence of their safety and efficacy in CKD categories G4 and G5 is minimal.

Even if there are no RCTs supporting NOAC use in G5D CKD patients, a 2018 meta-analysis of five observational studies showed that, among patients with advanced CKD and ESRD, the use of apixaban was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding compared to warfarin, and was found to be relatively effective with no excess risk of thromboembolic events. Moreover, a 2018 KDIGO conference report " suggests consideration of the lower dose of apixaban 2.5 mg orally twice daily in CKD G5/5D to reduce bleeding risk until clinical safety data are available ". Both of these papers showed that, in advanced CKD, apixaban is safer than warfarin in terms of bleeding and could allow the design of future studies in CKD populations requiring 'triple therapy' (e.g. using apixaban instead of VKAs, plus DAPT). However, with respect to ischemic events, the ESC Update stated that: " Lower NOAC regimens as compared to those tested in approval studies are expected to decrease bleeding risk, but the trade-off between bleeding and ischaemic (i.e. stroke prevention) outcomes remains largely undefined ".

### Comparison of novel oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116e32kX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) including apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban have been approved by international regulatory agencies to prevent venous thromboembolism as well as treat atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, alterations in their metabolism in the setting of CKD may impact their efficacy and lead to an increased risk of bleeding. This review summarizes the current literature on the efficacy and safety of these agents in individuals with moderate CKD.

Recent Findings

In clinical trials, the use of the NOACs in patients with moderate CKD has demonstrated efficacy and safety similar to those seen with vitamin K antagonists. However, no universal reversal agent for the anticoagulant effect of the NOACs exists in the setting of bleeding. Limited data have demonstrated that hemodialysis has been effectively used to aid in reversing the effects of dabigatran, and the use of prothrombin complex concentrate has also been used for serious and major adverse bleeding events with some success.

Summary

As the use of the NOACs in patients with CKD increases, it will be important to monitor their safety, and clinicians who prescribe them should carefully monitor kidney function and recognize the potential for adverse effects.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^116xzNEc]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this retrospective cohort study, we found that the use of apixaban to treat acute VTE in ESKD increased dramatically between 2014 and 2018. In 2018, nearly an equal proportion of patients with ESKD received an apixaban‐based and warfarin‐based strategy for acute VTE. In our primary analysis, we found that apixaban was associated with lower bleeding compared to warfarin. Additionally, a signal suggesting a lower rate of recurrent VTE for apixaban relative to warfarin (a co‐primary analysis) was present. Our findings were generally robust in sensitivity analyses including those that censored patients when they were no longer exposed to the therapies of interest. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we found that a relatively large percentage of the apixaban group was given an off‐label, lower dose in keeping with prior studies.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved apixaban to treat AF in December 2012 and VTE in August 2014. Although the drug is partially renally cleared, there are no recommended dosing adjustments for patients with VTE and renal insufficiency. In patients with AF and ESKD, a retrospective cohort study showed a lower risk of major bleeding, thromboembolism, and mortality among apixaban‐treated patients compared to those treated with warfarin. A meta‐analysis showed a lower risk of mortality among apixaban‐treated patients with AF and ESKD compared to warfarin‐treated patients.

Several studies also suggest the superiority of apixaban for the treatment of VTE relative to other agents. An analysis of data from four commercial claims databases plus Medicare claims found that among patients with CKD, the risks of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were lower in apixaban‐treated patients than in warfarin‐treated patients. Our analysis includes an additional 2 years of Medicare claims data (2017 and 2018) and focuses exclusively on patients with ESKD receiving dialysis. A recently published analysis using USRDS data to compare apixaban and warfarin to treat acute VTE in patients with ESKD also found a lower adjusted hazard ratio of major bleeding but also noted a significantly lower adjusted hazard ratio of recurrent VTE than in our study. Our analysis differed from that by Wetmore et al. in terms of covariates, the relationship of VTE diagnosis and index prescription timing for inclusion to cohort, the technique for ensuring patients were on maintenance dialysis, controlling for year of index prescription, and definition of recurrent VTE.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in chronic kidney disease: an update [^116BkKxS]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are variably eliminated by the kidneys rendering their use potentially problematic in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or necessitating appropriate dose adjustment.

Recent Findings

Both observational and limited randomized trial data for DOACs compared with no treatment or with warfarin for patients with atrial fibrillation on maintenance dialysis were recently published. In a randomized trial in patients on hemodialysis, there was no significant difference in vascular calcification between patients who received rivaroxaban with or without vitamin K2 or vitamin K antagonists. A randomized trial of apixaban versus warfarin was terminated owing to poor enrollment and preliminary results identified no difference in clinical outcomes between groups. However, valuable pharmacodynamic data will be forthcoming from that trial. In observational research, among patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, there were opposing trends in the associations of apixaban initiation versus no oral anticoagulation with ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke and no association was present with the overall risk of stroke or embolism. In another study comparing apixaban with warfarin initiation, apixaban was associated with less bleeding. Regular-dose apixaban (5mg twice daily) associated with reduced rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, whereas no such association was present for those prescribed the reduced dose (2.5mg twice daily).

Summary

DOACs may be used after appropriate dose adjustment for an established clinical indication in patients with advanced CKD. Quality evidence for oral anticoagulation, with any specific agent or dose, for stroke prevention in hemodialysis continues to be lacking.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis-can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies? [^112w6p3J]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

None of the dialysis-associated parameter were independently associated with drug levels. This was somewhat unexpected. Apixaban has a molecule size of 459.5 Dalton, a protein binding of 87% and a distributional volume of 21 L. Thus, a fractional removal by hemodialysis is expected. Small prospective pharmacokinetic studies show a reduction in AUC by hemodialysis of -14% (pre/post) and -26% (AUC-48h) for a 5 mg dose and a AUC-48h reduction of -48% for a 2.5 mg dose. Potentially, our inter-individual differences in dialysis dose were too small. However, in light of low sample numbers and retrospective analyses, interpretation of multivariable regression results is limited. Intake of a second dose of 2.5 mg of apixaban per day was consistently associated with higher drug level. This highlights at least a rough relationship between amount of intake and steady state drug level, again supporting drug monitoring as an additional mean for individual dose finding.

Our analysis does not suggest drug accumulation over time independent of dosing regimen and length of follow-up. In contrast, pharmacokinetic analyses revealed significant accumulation in hemodialysis patients during the first 8 days. Our data did not allow valid analyses of drug levels within the first few days after starting the drug. However, with regard to our follow-up period (IQR 5.5–21 months), our data clearly support the picture of a non-accumulating steady state.

Our study has several strengths. It is the second largest analysis of apixaban drug levels in hemodialysis to date with the longest follow-up. It is the only investigation incorporating apixaban drug levels from 2.5 mg once daily dosing and comprehensive dialysis-related covariates. In addition, we provide a comparative review to drug levels from non-CKD populations facilitating interpretation of drug levels and supporting sensible decision making regarding appropriate dosing.

The main limitations of our study are its retrospective nature, limiting precise specification of timing of drug intake and a reliable integration of residual kidney function. Drug levels of our study however, do picture long-term results from a tertiary care real-life setting. The analysis of bleedings must be considered exploratory as drug level measurements were infrequent and number of patients and bleeding events were small. The selection of covariates is overly inclusive. However, selected dialysis-associated factors represent important confounders, which have not been comprehensively investigated in studies of apixaban in patients on hemodialysis.

### Pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance of apixaban during in vitro continuous renal replacement therapy [^116E6rT7]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Apixaban, a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) agent, has emerged as a potential alternative therapy for the treatment of VTE and NOAF over UFH and LMWH in the ICU population due to its more reliable dose-exposure-response relationship, lack of required monitoring, decreased drug-drug interactions, and improved safety profile. Pharmacokinetic studies in otherwise healthy subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on intermittent hemodialysis (HD) indicate that HD has a limited overall impact on the clearance (CL) of apixaban. However, data regarding CL by conventional HD cannot be accurately extrapolated to CRRT given the differences in modes, durations of therapy, types of hemofilters used, and blood, ultrafiltration, and dialysate flow rates. Unfortunately, robust PK data in patients receiving CRRT are scarce and often include only small numbers of critically ill patients on many different forms of CRRT with heterogeneous flow rates, filter types, dosing, and sampling schemes, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. As such, in vitro CRRT models are useful for generating precise assessments of sieving/saturation coefficients (SC/SA) across different modes, flow rates, filter types, and points of dilution while eliminating the variability introduced by the patient. As recognized by the U. S Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), these models can be used to guide dosing in the absence of, or when combined with, in vivo data and have been shown to accurately predict in vivo total body clearance (CL T), allowing for data derived from in vitro investigations to be utilized in estimating clinical dosing regimens.

Although apixaban may represent a safer and more efficacious alternative to UFH and LMWH in ICU patients, the lack of PK data to inform appropriate dosing in patients undergoing CRRT currently precludes its use in a significant proportion of the critically ill population. As such, the objective of this study was to evaluate the PK and dialytic clearance of apixaban during in vitro CRRT in order to provide initial guidance on optimal dosing in this population.

### Pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance of apixaban during in vitro continuous renal replacement therapy [^1174B9Qk]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) occur in up to 37 and 46% of critically ill patients, respectively, and are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). Parenteral anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the current mainstay therapy for VTE and NOAF in this population given its rapid onset of action and short half-life. Due to the potential for serious adverse effects with UFH, activated thromboplastin time (aPTT) monitoring and dose titration are required to maintain exposures within a narrow therapeutic index. Despite the assistance of dosing algorithms and decades of clinical experience, > 75% of hospitalized patients fail to achieve aPTTs within goal range during the first 24–48 h after UFH initiation and only 29% are able to sustain them. In the critically ill ICU population, only approximately 50% of patients achieve therapeutic aPTTs within this same time frame, largely secondary to pathophysiologic and pharmacokinetic (PK) derangements such as sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), which can necessitate renal replacement therapy (RRT) in up to 70% of patients. Alternatively, despite minimal PK alterations, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has demonstrated detrimental pharmacodynamic (PD) properties, including increased thrombin generation time and an increased risk of bleeding in patients receiving RRT. Given the challenges in optimizing the use of UFH and LMWH in the ICU setting, more reliable anticoagulation therapies are desperately needed for managing critically ill patients, especially those requiring extracorporeal organ support such as continuous RRT (CRRT).

### Perioperative management of apixaban in patients with advanced CKD undergoing a planned invasive procedure [^117Up3aT]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

Oral anticoagulation therapy is used for both the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) and the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). AF and VTE are both common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Approximately 15% to 20% of patients on dialysis have AF.CKD is consistently identified as a risk factor for bleeding, including anticoagulation-associated bleeding. As a result, the prevention of AF/VTE-related morbidity in patients with CKD is difficult. There is growing interest in using apixaban in patients with kidney dysfunction due to its convenience and low dependence on renal elimination. Limited pharmacokinetic data have shown that patients with advanced CKD experience modest increases in apixaban area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentration-time values compared with patients with normal kidney function after a single dose. Dialysis has little effect on apixaban levels.

Up to 15% to 20% of patients on anticoagulation therapy require perioperative interruption of their therapy every year. Interruption of apixaban in patients with advanced CKD can be challenging due to altered pharmacokinetics and delayed clearance. There is no data to guide clinicians facing this situation. The perioperative management of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with advanced CKD was identified as an important area for future research by the American College of Chest Physicians. We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of consecutive apixaban-treated patients with advanced CKD who underwent a planned invasive procedure between June 2019 and March 2023, with the goal of describing the perioperative management of apixaban in this population and to determine the postoperative risks of major bleeding (MB), thromboembolism, and death. The study was approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114Scaud]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) dosing by renal function specifies creatinine clearance (CrCl) bands (> 95, 51–95, 31–50, 15–30, and < 15 or on dialysis) with the following doses. Apixaban lists 5 or 2.5 mg twice daily across all CrCl categories, with the footnote that if at least 2 of serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL, age ≥ 80 y, or body weight ≤ 60 kg are present, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily; the ARISTOTLE trial excluded patients with creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL or calculated CrCl < 25 mL/min. Dabigatran is 150 mg twice daily for CrCl > 95, 51–95, and 31–50; 75 mg twice daily for 15–30; and contraindicated for < 15 or on dialysis. Edoxaban is contraindicated when CrCl > 95 and when < 15 or on dialysis; 60 mg once daily is listed for 51–95 and 30 mg once daily for 31–50 and 15–30. Rivaroxaban is 20 mg once daily for > 95 and 51–95; 15 mg once daily for 31–50 and 15–30; and 15 mg once daily for < 15 or on dialysis, with the note that it is not recommended for other indications when CrCl < 15 mL/min and pharmacokinetic data are limited. The table notes that other, nonrenal considerations such as drug interactions may also apply and highlights that some gray-area doses were not studied in pivotal trials.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Table 4 — anticoagulation dosing for venous thromboembolism (VTE) details direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and low–molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) regimens with renal considerations. Apixaban initial treatment is 10 mg orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg orally twice daily, and after ≥ 6 months of initial therapy either 5 mg orally twice daily or 2.5 mg orally twice daily can be considered. Rivaroxaban initial treatment is 15 mg orally twice daily with food for the first 21 days followed by 20 mg orally once daily with food, and after ≥ 6 months either 20 mg orally daily with food or 10 mg orally daily with or without food can be considered; avoid use in patients with a CrCl of < 15 mL/min. Dabigatran is dosed 150 mg orally twice daily when preceded by 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, and patients with severe renal impairment (a CrCl of ≤ 30 mL/min) and those receiving hemodialysis were not enrolled, with no dosing recommendations in that population. Edoxaban is 60 mg orally once daily when preceded by at least 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, with dose reduction to 30 mg once daily for patients with a CrCl 15–50 mL/min or body weight ≤ 60 kg. In cancer-associated VTE, dalteparin is 200 units/kg subcutaneously once daily for 1 month then 150 IU/kg once daily for months 2–6; enoxaparin is 1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily subcutaneously, with dose reduction to 1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily for patients with a CrCl of < 30 mL/min.

### Being precise with anticoagulation to reduce adverse drug reactions: are we there yet? [^115Z2Cpm]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Renal impairment

Approximately 77% of dabigatran, 36% of rivaroxaban, 27% of apixaban, and 50% of edoxaban are excreted by the kidneys as active drug. Expectedly, DOAC pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that renal impairment is associated with elevated systemic exposure. In patients with severe renal impairment, as defined by creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min, the plasma concentration area under the curve (AUC) of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban were increased by 6-fold, 65%, 44% and 72%, respectively. Product labelling of DOACs recommends dose reduction for patients with CrCl 15–50 mL/min and avoidance of use in patients with advanced renal dysfunction (CrCl < 15 mL/min) and in those on haemodialysis. A sub-group analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 clinical study suggested that edoxaban-treated patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min are potentially at a slightly higher risk of stroke/systemic embolism compared to those treated with warfarin, but with lower bleeding risk. As such, the edoxaban drug label recommends edoxaban is used only after a careful individualised assessment of thromboembolic and bleeding risks in patients with high CrCl.

Elderly

Age and renal function are intricately related. GFR gradually declines with ageing at a rate of ~1 ml/min/year after the age of 30, with an accelerated decrease in GFR after 65 years of age. To ensure the efficacy and safety of DOACs in elderly patients, renal function should be monitored annually in those with CrCl > 50 mL/min and 2 to 3 times per year in those with CrCl 30–49 mL/min.

Non-adherence is also of concern as DOACs have short half-lives and missed doses could decrease efficacy, increasing the risk of thromboembolic events. Other factors such as poly-pharmacy, cognitive impairment, hospitalisation, history of bleeding and/or falls are common in the elderly, which could lead to over- or under-dosing of DOACs.

### A multicenter analysis of factors associated with apixaban-related bleeding in hospitalized patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis [^1128cFoQ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved a labeling change for apixaban to include recommendations for patients with severe renal impairment and patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), though these recommendations are largely based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data.

Objective

Identify variables associated with bleeding events in hospitalized patients with ESRD on HD receiving apixaban.

Methods

This retrospective, multicenter cohort study evaluated hospitalized patients with ESRD on HD receiving apixaban from January 1, 2013, through March 31, 2016. Correlational analysis and logistic regression were completed to identify factors associated with bleeding.

Results

A total of 114 adults were included in the analysis. The median length of stay (LOS) was 6.2 (interquartile range = 3.8–11.9) days and bleeding events occurred in a total of 17 patients (15%). A weak correlation was identified for higher cumulative apixaban exposure, increased number of HD sessions while receiving apixaban, and increased hospital LOS (P < 0.05; correlation coefficient < 0.40). When controlling for confounders, logistic regression revealed that composite bleeding events were independently increased by continuation of outpatient apixaban (odds ratio = 13.07; 95% CI = 1.54–110.54; P = 0.018), increased total daily dose of apixaban (odds ratio = 1.72; 95% CI = 1.20 to 2.48; P = 0.003), and total HD sessions while receiving apixaban (odds ratio = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.06–3.92; P = 0.033).

Conclusion

The association between these factors and increased bleeding should prompt concern for long-term anticoagulation with apixaban in patients with ESRD receiving chronic HD.

### Evaluation of standard versus reduced dose apixaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with severe renal disease (ESRD-VTE) [^111gbSqm]. Thrombosis Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There are no clear dosing recommendations when using apixaban for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment in patients with severe or end-stage renal disease; clinical trials excluded patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 25 mL/min or on dialysis. This study compares bleeding rates in patients with severe or end-stage renal disease taking standard versus reduced dose apixaban for VTE treatment.

Materials and Methods

This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records between January 1, 2013, and August 31, 2021. This study included patients 18 years or older who had severe or end-stage renal disease when prescribed apixaban for VTE treatment. Severe or end-stage renal disease was defined as at least one of the following: CrCl < 25 mL/min, SCr > 2.5 mg/dL, CKD stage 4 or 5, or on dialysis. The primary endpoint was rate of clinically relevant bleeding within six months of starting apixaban. Secondary endpoints were VTE recurrence within six months of starting apixaban, time to clinically relevant bleed, and time to VTE recurrence.

Results

A total of 203 patients were included in the final analysis (n = 125 on 5 mg; n = 78 on 2.5 mg). Clinically relevant bleeding rate was significantly higher in the standard dose group (14.4% vs 3.8%, p = 0.02). Rates of VTE recurrence appear similar (6.4% vs 7.7%, p = 0.21).

Conclusions

A reduced dose of apixaban may be considered when treating VTE in patients with severe or end-stage renal disease.

### The use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in dialysis patients – A systematic review [^117849i1]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Medium credibility.

Both NOAC and VKA treatment increase the bleeding risk significantly, which is a major hazard to the patients regardless of the drug used, and most cohort studies in dialysis patients have failed to demonstrate a benefit from VKA treatment in terms of stroke prevention. Besides, VKA treatment, unlike NOACs, increases the risk of calcifylaxis, a life‐threatening syndrome of vascular calcification, typically attributed to warfarin‐induced deficiency of vitamin K‐dependent calcification inhibitors.

Even without anticoagulant therapy, ESRD patients on dialysis have increased risk of bleeding usually attributed to uremia‐induced platelet dysfunction and impaired interaction between platelets and the vessel wall. Adding to this are factors such as frailty, comorbidity, high prevalence of antiplatelet drugs, and the regular use of low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH) given in order to minimize clotting in the dialysis filter during hemodialysis (HD) treatment. Thus, when comparing bleeding risk in dialysis patients, HD patients have a 1.5‐fold higher risk compared with peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients which could be attributed to LMWH.HD patients also have a higher underlying risk of bleeding due to intermittent puncture of the vascular access with needles. A previous bleeding history is another important risk factor, and dialysis patients belonging to this subgroup are reported to be at the highest risk of a new bleeding event.

Consequently, the added benefit of stroke prevention in dialysis patients with AF could be outbalanced by an increased risk of bleeding. This, in conjunction with absence of large‐scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in ESRD, makes use of NOACs in dialysis patients debatable. This debate has recently intensified after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved use of apixaban in ESRDcausing increased utilization of apixaban among dialysis patients in the United States.

The aim of this systematic review was to search the existing literature in order to find out whether NOACs can be safely used in dialysis patients and if the PKs of NOACs are significantly different in dialysis patients. An additional aim was to locate intervention studies in dialysis patients comparing NOAC with VKA treatment including upcoming studies.

4 DISCUSSION

This study reviewed the existing literature on the use of NOACs in dialysis patients. Of the 20 studies included, nine were PK studies. Only two studies were RCTs, and the majority (nine) were retrospective cohort studies. Six studies were recruiting/ongoing (five RCTs) or without results (one PK study). PK studies in dialysis patients showed that multiple doses of apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) gave higher exposure at steady state compared with single dose. The RENAL‐AF PK substudyshowed that 5 mg apixaban twice daily or 2.5 mg apixaban twice daily if patients were ≥ 80 years or weighed ≤ 60 kg was similar to apixaban levels in non‐ESRD patients. However, the results were only extracted from an abstract with limited description of data collection and methodology. More valid data on apixaban PK can be found in the PK study by Mavrakanas et al.despite a lower number of patients. This study showed that treatment for 8 days resulted in significant accumulation with both 2.5 and 5 mg apixaban twice daily. Especially 5 mg twice daily led to supratherapeutic levels, whereas the reduced dose of 2.5 mg twice daily resulted in drug exposure that was comparable with that of the standard dose in patients with preserved renal function. Interindividual variability could be underestimated due to the low number of patients, but unlike most other PK studies, multiple doses were given over 8 days which is arguably better compared with single dose studies when assessing drug accumulation. Thus, the best apixaban PK study suggests that a dose of 5 mg twice daily should be avoided in dialysis patients regardless of age and weight.

Betrixaban is mainly eliminated via the hepatobiliary system, with limited renal involvement in clearance. However, betrixaban can neither be recommended nor contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency, as this agent has not been evaluated in this setting. 67

Contrary to other DOACs, edoxaban displays a decrease in efficacy compared with warfarin in patients with an intact renal clearance (CrCl > 95 mL/min), which led to the FDA's issuing a warning about the use of this agent in individuals with normal‐high CrCl. 11 However, a post hoc analysis of the ENGAGE AF (Edoxaban Versus Warfarin in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) trial showed that edoxaban remained safe and effective in patients with normal renal function. 68

Knowledge of when and how to renally dose adjust is imperative to appropriate DOAC prescribing. This is best highlighted in recent studies suggesting that up to 32% of patients experience inappropriate DOAC dosing, 69, 70, 71 the most common form being subtherapeutic dosing due to renal insufficiency, the greatest risk factor influencing deviation from FDA‐approved doses. 69 Inappropriate dosing of DOAC carries grim consequences, with increased risk for thrombotic and bleeding complications resulting from subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic dosing, respectively. 72

In summary, DOACs are safe and effective in patients with moderate CKD (CrCl 30–50 mL/min). Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban should undergo dose adjustment for renal impairment and should be avoided for severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min). Edoxaban should be avoided in those with normal renal function (> 95 mL/min). Apixaban and betrixaban undergo the least amount of renal elimination and may be the DOACs of choice in severe renal impairment. See Figure 1 for suggested DOAC use based on patient renal function.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the most updated network meta‐analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation in patients with AF receiving renal replacement therapy. The major findings of this study are (1) VKA was associated with the least net clinical benefit compared with DOACs or no anticoagulation, (2) apixaban 5 mg twice daily was associated with the lowest risk of all‐cause death, (3) dabigatran and rivaroxaban demonstrated the greatest efficacy in preventing thromboembolism, and (4) dabigatran and apixaban were associated with better safety.

Although CKD is associated with an elevated risk of thromboembolism, the use of anticoagulation in individuals with AF and end‐stage renal disease undergoing dialysis has long been under debate. Studies comparing warfarin, DOACs, and no anticoagulation have reported discordant results in such patients. VKAs have been traditionally administered to individuals with long‐term dialysis to prevent thromboembolism secondary to AF. A retrospective study suggested that VKAs could mitigate all‐cause death and ischemic stroke; however, characterization of the potential confounding factors was not feasible due to the nonrandomized nature of the study. In addition, dose adjustment, albeit tailored by prothrombin time, remains clinically challenging due to the concomitant use of heparin during dialysis and altered metabolism caused by frequent uremia. In a pooled analysis of 14 observational studies, VKAs were shown to be associated with an increased rate of bleeding and no significant improvement in the risk of thromboembolism in patients undergoing long‐term dialysis. Suboptimal compliance with VKA therapy in such patients is another major concern. In the present study, we comprehensively included all studies comparing VKAs with either no anticoagulation or DOACs and confirmed a higher bleeding rate as well as no significant mitigation in thromboembolism with VKA therapy.

Measurement of apixaban

The unit's drug monitoring program was set to measure apixaban drug levels on a regular base targeting measurements every three to six months allowing for individual measurements according to the treating physician. Measurements were performed before the start of the dialysis treatment at the beginning of the week (after two days without dialysis - long interval). The time of drug level monitoring after not one but two days without dialysis was chosen to detect overtly high drug level assuming only partial dialyzability.

Blood samples were obtained before administration of anticoagulants. After discarding the first 5–10 mL of blood, around 3 mL of blood were drawn using 4.3 mL citrate-plasma tubes and sent for analyses within 1 hour. The central laboratory of University Hospital Bern used the BIOPHEN TM Heparin LRT Anti-Xa chromogenic assay and the BIOPHEN TM Apixaban Calibrator, both HYPHEN BioMed®. Anti-Xa activity is determined via an accredited chromogenic substrate method and a proportional concentration output is provided in ng/mL via a serial dilution calibration process. Hereby, drug concentration is measured indirectly.

Patients were under apixaban 2.5 mg once or twice daily. In patients were times of prescribed drug intake (morning, midday or evening) matched starting times of their dialysis sessions (2 sessions were offered at our center, morning or midday), trough level could be determined: For once daily dosing, trough level could be determined if drug intake and dialysis sessions both took place in the morning or at midday. For twice daily dosing (morning and evening), trough level could be determined if dialysis sessions started in the morning. If no trough level determination was possible (e.g. once daily drug intake in the evening and start of dialysis session in the morning or twice daily drug intake and start of dialysis session at midday), level were regarded as random. In a few instances, drug levels were taken after the dialysis session to obtain post-dialysis trough level (e.g. twice daily dosing, dialysis at midday). Whenever possible, the treating physician tried to align medication and dialysis schedules to enable regular apixaban trough level monitoring. We decided against time-based analyses, as it was impossible to retrospectively figure out exact timing of drug intake. Whenever trough level obtainment was possible (24 hours level in once daily dosing, 12 hours level in twice daily dosing), the dialysis care team routinely instructed patients in advance to postpone drug intake until blood had been sampled.

### The use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in dialysis patients – A systematic review [^113vS88N]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis treatment have a high prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF). Despite the high prevalence of AF, it is unclear whether dialysis patients should be anticoagulated. Non‐vitamin K anticoagulants (NOACs) also known as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are often used to prevent stroke in patients with AFand as prophylaxis after thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis and lung embolism. Four different NOACs, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxabanare currently available. Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, whereas rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban are direct factor Xa inhibitors. In non‐renal patients, NOACs are now mainly used instead of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) such as warfarin.NOACs are easier to handle, since regular blood sampling for monitoring is not necessary unlike VKAs where the narrow therapeutic range is affected by several food and drug interactions. All NOACs are in varying degrees renally excreted; however, pharmacokinetic (PK) properties are somewhat different in terms of renal clearance, the degree of protein binding, and the potential for removal by dialysis treatment as outlined in Figure 1.

FIGURE 1
Characteristics of oral anticoagulants. 1 FPP: fresh‐frozen plasma. 2 4F‐PCC: four‐factor prothrombin complex concentrate

Accordingly, there is a potential for drug accumulation if NOACs are used in patients with acute or chronic renal failure. The effect and safety of NOACs compared with VKA treatment with warfarin was investigated in four large phase 3 trials in patients with AF: RE‐LY, ROCKET‐AF, ARISTOTLE, and ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48. However, none of these included end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on dialysis treatment. Currently, the European Heart Rhythm Association does not recommend use of NOACs in CKD patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl)15 ml/minand dialysis patients with AF are therefore in Europe predominantly treated with VKA. Yet, a large proportion of dialysis patients with AF receive no anticoagulation, due to the lack of available evidence and the known risks with VKA treatment.

2.2 Study selection

We screened a total number of 1650 articles (Figure 2). NO PK studies in PD patients were found except for the ApiDP trial registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov database but without published data and could therefore not be included. An open‐label RCT conducted in HD patients (RENAL‐AF) was also found via ClinicalTrials.gov. Results from this study have not been published yet but were presented at the American Heart Association Annual meeting in 2019 (AHA 2019). By searching the title name in Pubmed, an abstract with PK results was found and a presentation with the trial results was found via the American College of Cardiology website. Two upcoming studies about apixaban versus warfarin in dialysis patients and two with warfarin versus no anticoagulant treatment were identified via ClinicalTrials.gov. After screening and removal of duplicates, 47 studies (combination of PKs studies, RCTs, and observational cohort studies and upcoming studies) were at first hand eligible for inclusion. Finally, after excluding 21 studies conducted in CKD stage 3–4 patients, only 20 studies were found eligible, and six studies were ongoing/recruiting without results (five RCTs and one PK study).

2.3 Risk of bias in the studies

Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the risk of bias, and thereby, the quality of all eight cohort studies was included.NOS ranks the studies with a star system based on three categories. The categories are (1) selection of study groups, (2) the comparability of the groups, and (3) the ascertainment of either outcome or exposure of interest. A high number of stars awarded to one study indicate that the study has high quality. The two RCTs included were quality assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (ROSB). The tool is based on seven categories: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, selective reporting, other sources of bias, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, and incomplete outcome data. Each category is evaluated as having high, low, or unclear risk of bias.

### A systematic review of direct oral anticoagulant use in chronic kidney disease and dialysis patients with atrial fibrillation [^1135gh33]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a lack of clear benefit and a potential risk of bleeding with direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dialysis patients with atrial fibrillation. The objective of this study was to evaluate how treatment with DOACs affects stroke and bleeding outcomes compared with warfarin or aspirin.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials, cohort studies and case series, and searched electronic databases from 1946 to 2017. Studies evaluating stroke and bleeding outcomes with DOAC use in CKD and dialysis patients were included.

Results

From 8008 studies, 10 met the inclusion criteria. For moderate CKD patients (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60mL/min/1.73 m2), there was no difference in stroke outcomes between dabigatran 110mg [hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.51–1.21], rivaroxaban (HR 0.82–0.84, 95% CI 0.25–2.69) and edoxaban (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.65–1.18) versus warfarin. Dabigatran (150mg twice daily) and apixaban reduced risk of stroke or systemic embolism significantly more than warfarin for moderate CKD patients (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34–0.89 and HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39–0.94, respectively). Edoxaban and apixaban were associated with reduced major bleeding events (HR 0.50–0.76) compared with warfarin. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran 110mg and 150mg showed no significant difference in major bleeding versus warfarin. In hemodialysis (HD) patients, there was no difference in stroke outcomes between apixaban, dabigatran [relative risk (RR) 1.71, 95% CI 0.97–2.99] or rivaroxaban (RR 1.8, 95% CI 0.89–3.64) versus warfarin. In HD patients, rivaroxaban and dabigatran were associated with an increased major bleeding risk (RR 1.45–1.76), whereas there was no major bleeding difference with apixaban compared to warfarin.

Limitations

The heterogeneity of major bleeding and stroke definitions of the 10 included studies.

Conclusions

Clinicians should continue to weigh the risk of stroke versus bleeding before prescribing DOACs in the CKD and dialysis population.

### Apixaban reduces the risk of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding compared to warfarin in patients with end stage renal disease; a systematic review and meta-analysis of ten studies [^115A2cBE]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Optimal anticoagulation in patients with end-stage renal disease ESRD is a matter of debate since these patients are not included in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Evolving data are in favor of apixaban compared to warfarin.

Methods

We extracted data from 2 RCTs, 5 retrospective cohort studies and 3 large data-based studies. Both dosing regimens of apixaban, standard or reduced, were accepted. In most studies characteristics of patients were balanced between arms. Patients with either atrial fibrillation (AF) or venous thromboembolism (VTE) were included. Quality of studies was graded as high and the funnel plot did not detect any publication bias. In total we analyzed the outcome of 6693 ESRD patients treated with apixaban and 19,836 treated with warfarin. Our analysis was performed by using the random effects model. We report our data as Risk Ratio (RR) and associated 95% confidence interval values (95%, CI).

Results

The RR (95% CI) of major bleeding was 0.69 (0.57–0.84) p = 0.0002 in favor of apixaban vs warfarin with heterogeneity to be statistically significant I 2 63% p = 0.004. Meta-regression analysis with year of publication as moderator shows in bubble plotting that studies published earlier than 2018 were plotted as outliers. The RR (95% CI) of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) was 0.74 (0.64–0.87) p = 0.0002 favoring again apixaban. Standard apixaban dose over reduced dose is less hemorrhagic compared to warfarin. Overall, in our study the risk of thrombosis in both arms was statistically non-different.

Conclusions

In our study we observed less hemorrhagic events with apixaban in ESRD patients compared to warfarin.

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^1138Kjw6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of apixaban PO (also known as Eliquis):
- **AIS**: use extreme caution in patients with AF transitioning from apixaban to warfarin.
- **Bleeding**: use caution in patients taking other drugs affecting hemostasis, including antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs.
- **Increased serum apixaban levels**: use caution in patients taking P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir). Reduce the dose of apixaban from 5–10 mg BID by 50%. Do not use P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients receiving 2.5 mg BID of apixaban.

### The use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in dialysis patients – A systematic review [^117BbGF9]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Medium credibility.

Siontis et al.did the largest cohort study. More than 25,000 dialysis patients with AF were included for comparison of apixaban (n = 2,351) with warfarin (n = 23,172). The study reported that apixaban was associated with similar risk of stroke but less risk of bleeding compared with warfarin. The study was also able to differentiate stroke and bleeding outcomes based on apixaban dose. Both 5 and 2.5 mg twice daily were associated with significantly lower risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin, whereas stroke prevention was best with 5 mg twice daily in comparison with either reduced dose (2.5 mg twice daily) or warfarin. A large and broad study population is a big advantage regarding bleeding and stroke outcomes compared with the smaller studies. By sheer size, the findings by Siontis et al.have more weight but several limitations should be mentioned. Due to the observational design, residual selection bias likely affected the results to some extent. Apixaban adherence and quality of the VKA treatment (time in therapeutic range) were not included. Discontinuation rates were high (about two thirds of patients in each group were no longer taking the anticoagulant 1 year after the initial prescription), and the observation period was short (mean follow‐up < 1 year). Collectively, these aspects make the comparison between apixaban and VKA difficult and highlights the need of adequately sized RCTs.

Comparison of NOAC (apixaban) treatment versus no anticoagulant therapy in dialysis patients with AF was investigated by Mavrakanas et al. In this study, apixaban did not lower the risk of stroke compared with non‐treated regardless of apixaban dosage and could reflect poor treatment adherence. The risk of fatal or intracranial bleeding events was higher on apixaban compared with no treatment especially with 5 mg apixaban twice daily. Ideally, VKA treated should have been included as a third group to facilitate comparison with the study by Siontis et al. Overall, comparison with the latter study is difficult due to a markedly lower stroke incidence most likely caused by methodological differences such as patient population (incident vs. prevalent population) and outcome definition (ischemic stroke vs. any stroke). Yet, the fact that fewer bleeding events were observed with the reduced dose compared with the standard dose, in line with PK data, suggest that the low dose regimen of apixaban potentially could be a better treatment option compared with standard dose and VKA treatment.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^115JjFU3]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Our apixaban cohort was 26% smaller than that of Wetmore et al. which may be due to the fact that we rigorously excluded AF patients (they excluded AF patients only in a sensitivity analysis) and patients who were no longer on dialysis. We also used a more restrictive definition of recurrent VTE including only those patients with an event 21 days or more after the index event and requiring that the VTE code is in the primary position. Of note, our findings on recurrent VTE were not consistent with Wetmore et al. We included a broader range of bleeding outcomes, and we conducted a subanalysis for off‐label dosing of apixaban which was quite common: over 1/3 of apixaban‐treated patients received off‐label dosing. Finally, we accounted for temporal trends by adjusting for the year of enrollment in our modeling. Given that over the course of the study, apixaban use increased from less than 2% of ESKD patients treated for VTE to almost half, the risk for confounding due to secular trends is substantial.

The package inserts for both dabigatran and rivaroxaban indicate they are renally cleared and must be dose‐reduced in patients with CKD; the inserts make no dosing recommendations for VTE in ESKD. Early pharmacokinetic evaluation of apixaban, however, allowed for it to be labeled and administered to patients with ESKD without dose adjustment. Recent single‐center studies evaluating the safety and effectiveness of apixaban for the treatment of VTE in severe CKD and ESKD suggest that it is associated with a lower bleeding risk than warfarin, with similar effectiveness.

Our findings suggest that physicians are increasingly comfortable using apixaban to treat acute VTE in patients with ESKD. Apixaban offers several potential advantages over warfarin including no requirement for bridging therapy with a heparin infusion and no need for therapeutic monitoring. We suspect that many physicians still use a warfarin‐based strategy in the ESKD population due to concerns about safety and effectiveness, affordability, concerns about reversibility, or based on defaulting to a "tried and true" strategy given limited early data with apixaban in the ESKD population.

### Anticoagulation for patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation and end-stage renal disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116Jqufq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common comorbidity in patients with end‐stage renal disease, with a reported prevalence of around 10%. Shared risk factors for AF and chronic kidney disease (CKD) constitute a vicious cycle, and both can lead to a prothrombotic state. Nevertheless, patients with coexisting AF and end‐stage renal disease are associated with a remarkably elevated risk of major bleeding. Although anticoagulation has been well established to improve the prognosis of individuals with AF, randomized controlled trials have predominantly excluded those under maintenance dialysis. Observational studies have also reported contradictory results regarding the administration of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), and no anticoagulation. Current evidence is thus inadequate to solidly endorse any anticoagulants or whether to administer anticoagulants in this population.

VKAs have traditionally been used to prevent systemic embolism in patients with AF, but few studies have focused on patients undergoing dialysis. Such patients have an elevated risk of thromboembolism; however, a meta‐analysis found that VKAs were associated with an insignificant protective effect on embolism, potentially due to limited longevity in patients with AF and CKD. In addition, VKAs also contribute to an increased risk of bleeding. Unstable renal function, drug–drug interactions, and dietary factors all affect the prothrombin time when patients are undergoing dialysis. Evidence supporting DOACs in patients on renal replacement therapy is also scarce. Only apixaban has been approved for such patients in limited regions on the basis of a small‐sized pharmacokinetic study involving 8 patients. Furthermore, it is challenging to estimate the bleeding risk in patients undergoing dialysis. An observational study suggested that the HAS‐BLED score was useful only to predict bleeding rate at the catheter puncture site, and clinical parameters of the score, except for renal function impairment, failed to stratify the risk of systemic embolism.

The aim of this network meta‐analysis was therefore to elucidate the safety and efficacy of anticoagulants in patients with AF and end‐stage renal disease undergoing dialysis. Different types of DOACs and 2 dosages of apixaban were compared with VKAs as well as no anticoagulation.

METHODS

Data source, study design, and population

The United States Renal Data System (USRDS) is a national data system that collects, analyses, and distributes information about chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESKD in the United States. It includes all available Medicare Parts A, B, and D claims data from affected individuals and supplements this with extensive data provided by dialysis centers. The USRDS includes information about these Medicare beneficiaries' healthcare service use including inpatient and outpatient encounters and outpatient prescription medication use. We used institutional claims, physician/supplier (carrier), and Medicare part D claims from 2006 to 2018 and MedPAR (inpatient) and outpatient claims from 2011 to 2018 from the USRDS. This study received approval from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Institutional Review Board and the protocol was posted on(NCT04818151) upon initiation.

We performed a new‐user, active‐comparator retrospective cohort study. Patients aged 18 years or greater with ESKD on dialysis, and fee‐for‐service Medicare as their primary insurance, who were newly initiated on either apixaban or warfarin between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2018, were eligible for inclusion. We required 6 months of continuous Medicare enrollment in Parts A, B, and D before initiation of anticoagulation for inclusion. For cohort entry, we required a diagnosis of VTE using the International Classification of Disease (ICD)‐9 and ICD‐10 codes (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 1) from 30 days before to 7 days after the initial prescription for apixaban or warfarin. We excluded patients with a claim indicating AF or who were admitted to hospice within the 6 months prior to anticoagulant initiation. Additionally, we excluded patients with any anticoagulant use (DOAC or warfarin) in the 30 days prior to cohort entry or 60 or more cumulative days of anticoagulant treatment (DOAC, warfarin, unfractionated heparin, or low‐molecular‐weight heparin) for any diagnosis in the 6 months prior to cohort entry (Supporting Information: Appendix Figure 1).
