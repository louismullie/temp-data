## Question

Best medication to treat acne to entire back

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about selecting the best medication for acne covering the entire back (truncal acne). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about severity classification and how that drives therapy. Then, I should verify the unique challenges of truncal skin and how they influence formulation and adherence. Next, I will review first-line topical options and their evidence base, followed by escalation to systemic therapy when indicated. After that, I need to consider special populations and contraindications, and finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise regimen with monitoring and counseling points anchored to guidelines and pivotal trials [^1174pMVk] [^115osGxh] [^116VWvay].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity framing, because treatment hinges on this. Truncal acne is common, often underrecognized, and carries a high risk of scarring and dyspigmentation, so I need to ensure I am not undertreating based on facial-centric norms; I should classify severity using lesion type and burden, psychosocial impact, and scarring risk, and remember that patients with psychosocial burden or scarring are considered to have severe disease and candidates for isotretinoin per AAD 2024 [^116VWvay] [^115sg9Qn] [^112CYLLY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "best" before I weigh the unique challenges of the back. The back has a large surface area, occlusion from clothing, friction, and thicker stratum corneum, all of which can reduce topical penetration and adherence; I need to check that my regimen accounts for ease of application, tolerability, and the risk of bleaching fabrics from benzoyl peroxide, and I should remember that evidence specific to truncal acne is limited, so extrapolation from facial protocols is common but must be explicit [^116VWvay] [^111bWZCP].

> Next, I should review first-line topical therapy for mild-to-moderate truncal acne. Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on multimodal topical therapy: AAD 2024 recommends fixed-dose combinations that pair a retinoid with benzoyl peroxide or with a topical antibiotic plus benzoyl peroxide to target multiple pathogenic pathways and mitigate resistance; trifarotene 50 μg/g cream is the only topical retinoid with FDA labeling for both facial and truncal acne and showed significant truncal efficacy in two phase III trials, which strengthens its role for back acne specifically [^115osGxh] [^113GESw5] [^115ZaowM].

> I will now examine practical topical choices and formulations for the back. Benzoyl peroxide cleansers or short-contact foams/gels at 5–10% can cover large areas efficiently and reduce C. acnes without resistance; pairing with a topical retinoid such as adapalene or trifarotene addresses comedogenesis and inflammation, and fixed combinations like adapalene–benzoyl peroxide can simplify application; I should confirm that patients are counseled on gradual titration, moisturizers, and fabric protection to improve adherence and tolerability [^115osGxh] [^114XxfeM] [^111bWZCP].

> But wait, what if the acne is moderate-to-severe or refractory to topicals on the back? I need to ensure I escalate appropriately: oral antibiotics should be combined with topical benzoyl peroxide and ideally a topical retinoid to limit resistance and enhance efficacy; sarecycline has supportive truncal data showing faster IGA success on the back compared with placebo, and doxycycline or minocycline remain common choices per guidelines, with explicit plans to limit duration and transition to maintenance topicals [^112F13V6] [^114qZUEL] [^116xjWk8].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of isotretinoin because this is often decisive for extensive back disease. For severe nodulocystic truncal acne, or for moderate disease with scarring or high psychosocial burden, oral isotretinoin is the most effective therapy and should be offered; low-dose regimens (about 0.25–0.4 mg/kg/day) achieve comparable clearance with fewer adverse effects than higher dosing, and intermittent dosing is less effective and not preferred; I need to ensure REMS compliance, baseline labs, pregnancy prevention, and counseling on mucocutaneous effects and mood monitoring [^115sg9Qn] [^116FkXmK] [^115QuYv6].

> Let me consider hormonal therapy in adult women with truncal acne, and I should double-check the evidence base. Spironolactone is increasingly used off-label and can improve chest and back acne in many patients, with large case series showing substantial clearance rates; combined oral contraceptives are also effective, though both typically require 3–6 months for full effect, so I should set expectations and consider early combination with topicals while monitoring blood pressure, menstrual effects, and potassium if indicated [^113YwTcV] [^113tb9RE] [^111sXWYh].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contraindications. Isotretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy and requires strict pregnancy prevention; tetracyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy and in children under 8 years; for patients with skin of color, I should anticipate higher risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and keloidal scarring and plan early, effective therapy and maintenance to prevent sequelae; in adolescents, I should balance efficacy with adherence and tolerability and avoid prolonged antibiotics [^116Va5KA] [^116xjWk8].

> Next, I should review maintenance because relapse is common. After control, maintenance with a topical retinoid (such as adapalene or trifarotene) and intermittent benzoyl peroxide helps prevent recurrence; I should confirm patients understand that topicals take 6–8 weeks to show benefit and that early irritation is manageable with moisturizers and gradual titration to sustain adherence [^115osGxh] [^111sXWYh] [^113eHCtC].

> Let me synthesize a practical, severity-based regimen, and I will double-check each step against guidelines. For mild-to-moderate truncal acne, start a topical retinoid such as trifarotene or adapalene plus benzoyl peroxide (cleanser or gel) to the back, consider a fixed-dose combination to simplify, and counsel on application technique and fabric protection; for moderate-to-severe disease, add an oral antibiotic such as sarecycline or doxycycline with continued benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoid, limit the antibiotic course to about 3 months, and transition to maintenance topicals; for severe nodulocystic or scarring disease, proceed to isotretinoin with appropriate monitoring and shared decision-making [^115osGxh] [^112F13V6] [^115sg9Qn].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that any single topical could be "best" for the entire back; I should correct that to emphasize that combination therapy tailored to severity and patient factors is the most reliable approach, with trifarotene standing out as the only topical retinoid with dedicated truncal efficacy data, while benzoyl peroxide remains foundational for antimicrobial effect and retinoids address comedogenesis and inflammation; shared decision-making, adherence support, and timely escalation are key to outcomes [^115ZaowM] [^115osGxh] [^111bWZCP].

---

The best medication for back acne is **oral isotretinoin** for severe or refractory cases, as it is the most effective therapy with high remission rates [^115sg9Qn] [^114htwt7]. For moderate disease, **oral antibiotics** (doxycycline, minocycline, sarecycline) combined with topical benzoyl peroxide and a topical retinoid are recommended [^112F13V6] [^114qZUEL]. Topical therapy alone (benzoyl peroxide, adapalene, trifarotene) is suitable for mild disease or as maintenance [^111sXWYh] [^115ZaowM]. Treatment should be individualized based on severity, tolerability, and patient preference, with isotretinoin considered for severe or scarring acne [^115sg9Qn].

---

## Topical medications

Topical medications are **first-line for mild-to-moderate back acne** and as maintenance after systemic therapy [^115osGxh]. They target multiple pathogenic factors — including inflammation, bacterial overgrowth, and abnormal keratinization [^1151Czj9].

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Efficacy** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Benzoyl peroxide | Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory | Effective for mild-to-moderate acne; prevents antibiotic resistance | Irritation, dryness, bleaching of clothing |
| Topical retinoids (adapalene, tazarotene, trifarotene) | Normalize keratinization, reduce inflammation | Effective for comedonal and inflammatory acne; trifarotene has specific truncal data | Irritation, photosensitivity |
| Topical antibiotics (clindamycin, erythromycin) | Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory | Effective when combined with benzoyl peroxide | Resistance risk if used alone |

---

Topical retinoids are particularly effective for back acne because they target **microcomedones** and prevent new lesions [^111bWZCP] [^112Lzqd6]. Trifarotene, a fourth-generation retinoid, has **specific evidence for truncal acne** and is effective and well tolerated [^115ZaowM] [^111bWZCP].

---

## Systemic antibiotics

Systemic antibiotics are indicated for **moderate-to-severe back acne**, particularly with extensive inflammatory lesions [^112F13V6]. They reduce bacterial load and inflammation but should be used with topical therapy to prevent resistance [^116xjWk8].

| **Antibiotic** | **Efficacy** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Doxycycline | Effective for moderate-to-severe acne | Gastrointestinal upset, photosensitivity |
| Minocycline | Effective and well tolerated | Rare hypersensitivity reactions, dizziness |
| Sarecycline | Narrow-spectrum tetracycline effective for truncal acne | Gastrointestinal upset, dizziness |

---

Sarecycline, a narrow-spectrum tetracycline, has **specific evidence for back acne** and is effective and well tolerated [^114qZUEL].

---

## Hormonal therapies

Hormonal therapies are indicated for **women with moderate-to-severe back acne**, particularly with hyperandrogenism or menstrual flare-ups [^115MMGcb]. They reduce androgen-mediated sebum production and inflammation [^notfound].

- **Spironolactone**: Effective for women with persistent acne; improves back acne and is well tolerated long term [^113YwTcV].
- **Combined oral contraceptives**: Effective for women with hormonal acne; improve back acne significantly [^113tb9RE].

---

## Oral isotretinoin

Oral isotretinoin is the **most effective treatment for severe, nodular, or refractory back acne** [^115sg9Qn]. It targets all pathogenic factors — sebum production, bacterial colonization, abnormal keratinization, and inflammation — and achieves high remission rates [^112Lzqd6] [^113T7S3y].

- **Efficacy**: Highly effective with long-term remission; considered first-line for severe nodular acne [^111YVv6F] [^115TrYKP] [^11121thf].
- **Limitations**: Teratogenicity, psychiatric effects, hepatotoxicity, hyperlipidemia, and mucocutaneous side effects require careful monitoring [^115eKbEy].

---

## Comparative effectiveness

Isotretinoin is **superior to other treatments** for severe back acne, achieving the highest remission rates and long-term control [^116VWvay]. For moderate disease, **combination therapy** (oral antibiotics plus topical benzoyl peroxide and retinoids) is effective and well tolerated [^114iXepC]. Topical therapy alone is suitable for mild disease or as maintenance after systemic therapy [^111sXWYh].

---

## Patient-specific factors

Treatment choice should be **individualized** based on severity, lesion type, patient preference, and contraindications:

- **Severity**: Severe nodular acne warrants isotretinoin; moderate disease benefits from systemic antibiotics plus topicals; mild disease responds to topicals alone [^11121thf] [^114iXepC] [^115TrYKP].
- **Gender**: Hormonal therapies are appropriate for women with hormonal acne [^112riNbE].
- **Tolerance**: Side effects and adherence influence therapy choice and success [^114Tdqyp] [^115SANvA].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Severe or refractory back acne**: Oral isotretinoin is the best medication, achieving high remission rates and long-term control [^116VWvay].
- **Moderate back acne**: Systemic antibiotics (doxycycline, minocycline, sarecycline) combined with topical benzoyl peroxide and retinoids are effective [^114iXepC].
- **Mild back acne**: Topical therapy (benzoyl peroxide, adapalene, trifarotene) is appropriate and effective [^115ZaowM].

Treatment should be **individualized** based on severity, patient preference, and tolerability, with isotretinoin reserved for severe or refractory cases [^115sg9Qn].

### Therapeutic update: acne [^112MYvUh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a multi-factorial disease affecting a significant proportion of the population. A patient-centered approach is most effective for the treatment of acne, focusing both on life style interventions as well as pharmacologic therapy. Lifestyle modifications include dietary counseling, as a link between dietary choices and acne continues to grow. Pharmacologic regimens must account for the severity of disease, emergence of resistant bacterial strains and ease of patient compliance. Combination topical therapy is often required for patients with mixed inflammatory and comedonal acne, while oral medications are frequently needed for severe cases or those involving large surface areas such as the chest or back. With or without a photosensitizer, light based treatments present an alternative or adjuvant to traditional pharmacologic therapy. Novel formulations of existing medications in addition to original compounds continue in development, expanding therapeutic possibilities for the future. With the emergence of antibiotic resistance, we are forced to prescribe antibiotics more responsibly, while exploring alternatives to this longstanding standard of care. This article discusses current and emerging therapies for the treatment of acne.

### Truncal acne: a neglected entity [^116VWvay]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Truncal acne – acne vulgaris involving the chest, back, or shoulders – is thought to be present in more than half of patients with acne. Because the study of acne has been focused on the face, there are sparse data in the literature about the clinical characteristics and management options for truncal acne. It is thought that the pathogenic process is similar between the face and the back, suggesting that treatments studied on the face may be suitable for use on the back. It is not uncommon for patients to omit discussion of truncal acne with their treating physician, and it is likely that non-facial acne is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Scarring and pigmentary problems are common sequelae of acne on the trunk, underscoring the need for early and effective treatment as a preventive measure.

Truncal acne merits consideration and should be more thoroughly studied. Initiating treatment with a topical retinoid combined with an antimicrobial agent is logical for most patients with truncal acne, and mirrors recommendations for facial acne; however, there are additional considerations for truncal acne such as extension of the lesions, risk of antibiotic resistance due to large surface areas treated for a prolonged duration, accessibility of lesions, and discoloration of clothing or bedding due to topical products. Oral isotretinoin is the treatment of choice when truncal acne is severe. This article reviews available information as well as recent recommendations for treatment.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: current treatments and future prospects [^113KPk7C]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As knowledge of acne pathogenesis expands, novel approaches for targeting inflammation are rapidly emerging in the form of topical, systemic, procedural, and combination therapies. New or modified medications within familiar classes, the repurposing of drugs used to treat other inflammatory conditions, and the development of novel treatment modalities may all be efficacious in treating acne. Some of these treatments have the added benefit of decreasing and treating acne sequelae, including atrophic scarring and dyspigmentation. The diverse mechanisms of action include direct bactericidal activity against C. acnes, inhibition of pro-inflammatory factor release, reduction of oxidative stress, activation of the immune system, and modulation of the microbiome. With growing concerns over antimicrobial resistance and with certain individuals unable to tolerate well-established therapies, additional treatment options that are safe and effective in all skin types and colors are needed.

### Acne vulgaris [^114htwt7]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit resulting from androgen-induced increased sebum production, altered keratinisation, inflammation, and bacterial colonisation of hair follicles on the face, neck, chest, and back by Propionibacterium acnes. Although early colonisation with P acnes and family history might have important roles in the disease, exactly what triggers acne and how treatment affects the course of the disease remain unclear. Other factors such as diet have been implicated, but not proven. Facial scarring due to acne affects up to 20% of teenagers. Acne can persist into adulthood, with detrimental effects on self-esteem. There is no ideal treatment for acne, although a suitable regimen for reducing lesions can be found for most patients. Good quality evidence on comparative effectiveness of common topical and systemic acne therapies is scarce. Topical therapies including benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and antibiotics when used in combination usually improve control of mild to moderate acne. Treatment with combined oral contraceptives can help women with acne. Patients with more severe inflammatory acne usually need oral antibiotics combined with topical benzoyl peroxide to decrease antibiotic-resistant organisms. Oral isotretinoin is the most effective therapy and is used early in severe disease, although its use is limited by teratogenicity and other side-effects. Availability, adverse effects, and cost, limit the use of photodynamic therapy. New research is needed into the therapeutic comparative effectiveness and safety of the many products available, and to better understand the natural history, subtypes, and triggers of acne.

### Safety considerations and monitoring in patients treated with systemic medications for acne [^115eKbEy]. Dermatologic Clinics (2016). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris, a disorder of the pilosebaceous unit, is one of the most commonly encountered conditions in dermatology practice. Effective treatment of acne vulgaris is important in that it can prevent psychosocial distress and physical scarring. Systemic therapeutic options are available for moderate to severe acne. It is imperative that the safe and effective treatment revolves around the health care provider's familiarity of side effects of various treatments. In this article, the side effects and monitoring guide for the most commonly prescribed systemic agents for acne vulgaris are reviewed.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: current treatments and future prospects [^116Va5KA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epidemiology

Acne vulgaris is one of the most encountered dermatologic conditions by dermatologists worldwide. Although the true prevalence is difficult to approximate, it is estimated to affect about 9% of the population. In the US alone, 5 million physician visits are attributed to acne annually, costing > 2 billion dollars. Cumulative prevalence approaches 100% in adolescence and decreases with age, affecting up to 64% of individuals aged 20–29 years and 43% of individuals aged 30–39 years, respectively. Age, oily skin, family history, and obesity are all risk factors for developing acne. While well-powered studies comparing acne in various racial and ethnic groups are lacking, acne is regarded as very common across global populations.

Clinical Presentation

Acne is classified morphologically, including comedonal, inflammatory, nodulocystic, and mixed phenotypes with varying severity. Acne can affect the face, chest, and back, or a combination of these areas. Scarring and pigmentary changes are frequent, with post-inflammatory dyspigmentation and keloidal scarring being more common in skin of color.

Quality of Life

Acne may profoundly impair quality of life by limiting self-esteem and self-confidence, placing individuals at a significantly increased risk for developing psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety. Acne is associated with increased risk of self-injury and suicide attempts, highlighting the concerning and significant connection between acne and mental health. The widespread presence of acne along with its effects on quality of life underscore the importance of having a broad spectrum of treatment options targeting its various pathogenetic factors.

### Making the case for early treatment of acne [^116LMfvF]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Early acne can be defined as the occurrence of acne at its onset, primarily in preteens, or as acne at its earliest severity (ie, mild to moderate). Although the majority of patients with acne are treated by dermatologists, most, particularly mild to moderate cases, could be successfully managed by primary care physicians. Therefore, it is important for physicians to understand the benefits of treating all types of acne, not just the most severe. Awareness of the emotional impact of acne, particularly in adolescence, as well as recognition of possible scarring are important considerations. To achieve optimal results, physicians should be familiar with classification and severity grading of acne. Also, in-depth knowledge of available acne medications will streamline and optimize treatment regimens. Recognizing, treating, and monitoring the progress of early acne may lead to quicker, better clinical outcomes and improved quality of life.

### SUPPLEMENT INDIVIDUAL ARTICLES: update on truncal acne: a review of treatments for a neglected disease and the Re-emergence of tazarotene [^111bWZCP]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris of the trunk carries with it a major psychosocial impact and an unmet need for adequate management. Approximately 50% of patients with facial acne also exhibit involvement of the back, chest, and/or upper arms. The trunk poses a therapeutic challenge given its occlusion by clothing, the tendency for mechanical rubbing, a sebum physiology that differs from the face, as well as the fact that there is a large surface area for topical therapies to cover. Furthermore, truncal acne is underreported for a variety of reasons such as cultural barriers, sentiments of embarrassment, and prioritization of facial acne. To date, few medications have been studied specifically for truncal acne. In this article, an updated review of truncal acne and available therapies is provided. The most recent evidence for tazarotene, a third-generation retinoid previously approved for psoriasis and facial acne vulgaris over two decades ago, is also reviewed and compared to trifarotene, a fourth-generation retinoid that is the only approved tropical retinoid for both facial and truncal acne.

### Truncal acne vulgaris: the relative roles of topical and systemic antibiotic therapy [^114ZXuiz]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Information is limited on the management of truncal acne vulgaris. Survey results suggest that most dermatologists commonly prescribe oral antibiotic therapy when treating acne involving the chest and back. This article reports therapeutic outcomes based on an investigator-blinded, randomized, 10-week observational trial completed in patients presenting with moderate or severe truncal acne vulgaris. One group received treatment with benzoyl peroxide (BP) 9% cleanser daily, clindamycin 1% foam daily, and doxycycline 100 mg twice daily. The other group received BP cleanser 9% daily and doxycycline 100 mg twice daily without clindamycin 1% foam. Baseline, week 6, and week 10 evaluations were completed. Efficacy parameters included inflammatory and total lesion count reduction, and investigator global assessment. Global evaluations of treatment response were recorded and skin tolerability was also evaluated. This trial was designed to capture observational experience reflective of treatment of patients with truncal acne in a private practice dermatology setting.

### Randomized phase 3 evaluation of trifarotene 50 μ g / g cream treatment of moderate facial and truncal acne [^115ZaowM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris often affects the face, shoulders, chest, and back, but treatment of nonfacial acne has not been rigorously studied.

Objectives

Assess the safety and efficacy of trifarotene 50 μg/g cream, a novel topical retinoid, in moderate facial and truncal acne.

Methods

Two phase III double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled, 12-week studies of once-daily trifarotene cream versus vehicle in subjects aged 9 years or older. The primary end points were rate of success on the face, as determined by the Investigator's Global Assessment (clear or almost clear and ≥ 2-grade improvement), and absolute change from baseline in inflammatory and noninflammatory counts from baseline to week 12. The secondary end points were rate of success on the trunk (clear or almost clear and ≥ 2-grade improvement) and absolute change in truncal inflammatory and noninflammatory counts from baseline to week 12. Safety was assessed through adverse events, local tolerability, vital signs, and routine laboratory testing results.

Results

In both studies, at week 12 the facial success rates according to the Investigator's Global Assessment and truncal Physician's Global Assessment and change in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts (both absolute and percentage) were all highly significant (P < .001) in favor of trifarotene when compared with the vehicle.

Limitations

Adjunctive topical or systemic treatments were not studied.

Conclusion

These studies demonstrate that trifarotene appears to be safe, effective, and well tolerated in treatment of both facial and truncal acne.

### Update in retinoid therapy of acne [^112Lzqd6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of acne, the most common skin disease, is complex and multifactorial. Clinical experience has demonstrated that parallel targeting of various pathogenetic factors, achieved either by mono- or combination therapy with appropriate drugs, represents the most effective approach to treating acne. Topical retinoids have been shown to expulse mature comedones, reduce microcomedone formation, and exert immunomodulatory effects. They have broad anti-acne activity without the risk of inducing bacterial resistance, which justifies their use as first-line treatment in most types of noninflammatory and inflammatory acne and makes them uniquely suitable as long-term medication to maintain remission after cessation of initial combination therapy. Systemic isotretinoin as a monotherapeutic agent strongly affects all four major pathogenetic factors and has been, in the hand of experienced dermatologists, a potent and safe agent for the treatment of severe and recalcitrant acne forms for more that 20 years. However, patient counseling, careful monitoring, and evaluation and management of adverse events are necessary. The use of isotretinoin has experienced a drawback now that its indication has been lowered from a first-line to a second-line medication.

### Truncal acne and scarring: a comprehensive review of current medical and cosmetic approaches to treatment and patient management [^111BkGx4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin disorders worldwide. It typically affects skin areas with a high density of sebaceous glands such as the face, upper arms, chest, and/or back. Historically, the majority of research efforts have focused on facial acne vulgaris, even though approximately half of patients with facial lesions demonstrate truncal involvement. Truncal acne vulgaris is challenging to treat and poses a significant psychosocial burden on patients. Despite these characteristics, studies specifically examining truncal acne vulgaris are limited, with treatment guidelines largely derived from facial protocols. Therefore, truncal acne remains an understudied clinical problem. Here, we provide a clinically focused review on the epidemiology, evaluation, and available treatment options for truncal acne vulgaris. In doing so, we highlight knowledge gaps with the goal of spurring further investigation into the management of truncal acne vulgaris.

### Practical considerations in acne treatment and the clinical impact of topical combination therapy [^113jUK2G]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a highly prevalent, multifactorial disease process affecting the pilosebaceous units of the dermis. The effects of acne are profound both physically and psychosocially across all age groups and ethnicities; therefore, prompt recognition and appropriate treatment are critical. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches range from simple monotherapy to multimodal treatments with a variety of topical and systemic agents. Optimal patient outcomes in acne management, however, are based both on treatment efficacy as well as overall patient satisfaction. In an effort to comprehensively address these key clinical considerations in acne management, we examine the diverse nature of acne patients, the factors in optimizing treatment outcomes, and the clinical impact of current medications, particularly topical combination therapy.

### Guidance on the diagnosis and clinical management of acne [^117DAfyF]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

This article discusses the effects of acne (sometimes referred to as acne vulgaris), how to diagnose it confidently and how to distinguish it from rosacea, and the options available for treatment, especially in primary care. We also suggest when referral to dermatology should be considered, and try to anticipate some frequently asked questions.

### New insights into the management of acne: an update from the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne group [^117L3WgE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

The Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne published recommendations for the management of acne as a supplement to the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology in 2003. The recommendations incorporated evidence-based strategies when possible and the collective clinical experience of the group when evidence was lacking. This update reviews new information about acne pathophysiology and treatment-such as lasers and light therapy-and relevant topics where published data were sparse in 2003 but are now available including combination therapy, revision of acne scarring, and maintenance therapy. The update also includes a new way of looking at acne as a chronic disease, a discussion of the changing role of antibiotics in acne management as a result of concerns about microbial resistance, and factors that affect adherence to acne treatments. Summary statements and recommendations are provided throughout the update along with an indication of the level of evidence that currently supports each finding. As in the original supplement, the authors have based recommendations on published evidence as much as possible.

### Can we define acne as a chronic disease? If so, how and when? [^117JgjFJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

There is widespread misunderstanding of acne amongst both the medical and lay community, who often perceive the condition to be a simple, self-limited affliction of adolescents. Because many think that the disease "will go away on its own", they do not feel an urgency to aggressively treat acne. However, very often the reality is that acne treatment can be quite difficult. Furthermore, acne can be a devastating disease for the patient, since it manifests on visible body parts and in children near puberty, who are vulnerable both socially and psychologically. Most typically, acne is not an acute disease but rather a condition that continuously changes in its distribution and severity. Usually, acne treatment is necessary for many months and sometimes years. Despite treatment, acne may cause scarring and associated negative psychological effects. It is important for both patients and physicians to be aware that very effective treatments are available. It is also important to realize that new studies have proven the benefit of maintenance therapy with topical retinoids; these agents can minimize the potential for relapse, which is part of the natural history of acne. This article reviews the evidence suggesting that acne is a chronic disease in at least a subset of individuals. The members of the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne believe that acne should be recognized and investigated as a chronic disease. This will change expectations of clinical trial design and treatment and will highlight gaps in the knowledge of acne epidemiology. The result should be an improvement in patient outcomes.

### Management of truncal acne with oral sarecycline: pooled results from two phase-3 clinical trials [^114qZUEL]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease that affects the face, chest, and back. While truncal acne is present in at least 50% of patients, clinical studies have focused predominantly on facial acne.1,2 Few treatments to date have been evaluated for truncal acne. Sarecycline is a narrow-spectrum, third-generation, tetracycline-class oral drug approved for the treatment of acne. Pivotal phase-3 studies show that sarecycline is safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment for moderate to severe acne vulgaris.

Method

Pooled analysis was performed for truncal acne results with sarecycline from the two phase 3 studies. Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) success was evaluated at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12.

Results

Chest IGA success rate were significantly greater with sarecycline versus placebo at weeks 3 (11.84% vs 7.71%, respectively; P = 0.0192), 6 (18.81% vs 14.03%, respectively; P = 0.0390), and 12 (33.42% vs 20.77%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Back IGA success rate was also significantly greater with sarecycline versus placebo group at weeks 3 (12.13% vs 7.04%, respectively; P = 0.0023), 6 (18.42% vs 14.34%, respectively; P = 0.0412), 9 (29.05% vs 19.88%, respectively; P = 0.0004) and 12 (33.07% vs 21.91%, respectively; P < 0.0001)Conclusion: Sarecycline efficacy for truncal acne was observed within 3 weeks after treatment, supporting sarecycline as an optimal choice for oral treatment of moderate to severe truncal acne. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(6):634–640. doi:10.36849/JDD.6204.

### Expert committee recommendations for acne management [^1151Czj9]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

In 2003, an international committee of physicians and researchers in the field of acne, working together as the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne, developed consensus guidelines for the treatment of acne. These guidelines were evidence based when possible but also included the extensive clinical experience of this group of international dermatologists. As a result of the evaluation of available data and the experience, significant changes occurred in the management routines for acne. The greatest change arose on the basis of improved understanding of acne pathophysiology. The recommendation now is that acne treatments should be combined to target as many pathogenic factors as possible. A topical retinoid should be the foundation of treatment for most patients with acne, because retinoids target the microcomedo, the precursor to all acne lesions. Retinoids also are comedolytic and have intrinsic antiinflammatory effects, thus targeting 2 pathogenic factors in acne. Combining a topical retinoid with an antimicrobial agent targets 3 pathogenic factors, and clinical trials have shown that combination therapy results in significantly faster and greater clearing as opposed to antimicrobial therapy alone. Oral antibiotics should be used only in moderate-to-severe acne, should not be used as monotherapy, and should be discontinued as soon as possible (usually within 8–12 weeks). Because of their effect on the microcomedo, topical retinoids also are recommended as an important facet of maintenance therapy.

### ARTICLE: a novel antibiotic just for acne [^1172sc9s]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Dermatologists consistently rank as the most frequent prescribers of systemic antibiotics, and one of the most common diagnoses for which we recommend these agents is acne vulgaris. Up to three quarters of the antibiotics that dermatologists prescribe are in the tetracycline class.1 Even though dermatology as a specialty is well-known for off-label prescribing, it may be surprising to note that no systemic antibiotic had been FDA approved solely for treatment of acne&mdash; until recently.

### Long-term use of spironolactone for acne in women: a case series of 403 patients [^113YwTcV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited data regarding the long-term outcomes of spironolactone use for women with acne and its effect on truncal acne.

Objective

To comprehensively describe outcomes of patients treated with spironolactone in routine clinical practice, including long-term outcomes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective case series of 403 adult women treated for acne with spironolactone at an academic medical center between 2008 and 2019. Rates of objective, as assessed by Comprehensive Acne Severity Scale scores, and subjective acne clearance were evaluated, as well as rates of treatment discontinuation, dosage changes, and drug survival. Logistic regression was used to assess for association between incidence of menstrual adverse effects and combined oral contraceptive use.

Results

As evaluated by Comprehensive Acne Severity Scale scores, at the first follow-up, 75.5%, 84.0%, and 80.2% of patients with available data had reduction or complete clearance of acne on the face, chest, and back, respectively. The mean drug survival was 470.7 days. Menstrual adverse effects were less common among those using combined oral contraception (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.50).

Limitations

This study was conducted at a single academic medical center.

Conclusions

Spironolactone improves clinical outcomes and is well tolerated for many adult women with acne using it for an extended duration.

### Identifying and appraising patient-reported outcome measures on treatment satisfaction in acne: a systematic review [^114DTbrm]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Core outcome sets are consensus‐based minimum outcome measures that should be reported in clinical trials of a specific disease or target condition. Outcomes can be conceived as constructs or domains, credibly established by patients and other relevant stakeholders, reflecting what is to be measured in trial participants to evaluate the effect of an intervention. Outcome measures are instruments or tools to measure the quality or quantity of the intervention on each of the domains. These measures can range from clinical examinations to patient responses to questionnaires to laboratory findings and to imaging studies. Outcome measures to be included in a core outcome set are based on a systematic search, assessment of quality and recommendations to a voting panel for inclusion of only one outcome measurement for each domain where possible. In the absence of an adequate measure, a need for development would be established.

In clinical trials investigating acne treatments, multiple outcome measures have been used with no established standards. This multiplicity, heterogeneity and lack of quality have been problematic in data synthesis by impeding comparative outcomes research and contributing to resource wastage. An international consensus on a core outcome set for clinical trials in acne could address this unmet need by standardizing and harmonizing existing outcome measures, and identifying those that might be lacking.

Development of an acne core outcome set for acne clinical trials was initiated with the Acne Core Outcomes Research Network (ACORN), initially funded by a US National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases grant (1U01AR065109‐01). In a landmark study involving stakeholders worldwide, including 307 patients or their parents, 218 healthcare professionals, 45 nonclinical researchers, 17 industry employees and nine journal editors, the most important domains for an acne core outcome set were identified. These included satisfaction with appearance, extent of dark marks and scars, long‐term acne control, signs and symptoms, satisfaction with treatment, health‐related quality of life and adverse events (AEs).

A hierarchy of treatment satisfaction can extend from procedures, therapies, activity limitations and dietary restrictions, along with included medications. A more circumscribed concept of satisfaction with intervention or medication impacting on disease signs/symptoms and potential side‐effects is relevant to clinical trials.

In this study, we focused on addressing treatment satisfaction in acne clinical trials, more specifically on satisfaction with any intervention or with the (general) care received. Our aims were to identify patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMS) of satisfaction with acne treatments and to evaluate their quality with COnsensus‐based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) methodology.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^111sXWYh]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Key learning points

Early effective treatment for acne may prevent scarring and pigment changes.
Topical treatments are first line for mild/moderate acne but patients need information on how to avoid adverse effects and advice that treatments take 6–8 weeks to work.
Oral antibiotics can be used as second-line treatment, or for moderate or severe acne, when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment.
Most guidelines suggest that duration of oral antibiotics for acne should be limited to 3 months, although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests up to 6 months.
Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are an alternative treatment for women but can take 3–6 months to work.
There is a growing evidence for use of spironolactone in women with persistent acne (off-label use at present), which is also likely to take 3–6 months to work.
Maintenance topical treatment should be continued when discontinuing oral treatments.

### Adverse effects of acne medications: recognition and management [^114Tdqyp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a very common chronic inflammatory disease of the skin. The clinical features of acne range from non-inflammatory comedones to inflammatory nodules. While often perceived as an adolescent disease, the prevalence remains high into adulthood, and the manifestations can have detrimental psychosocial effects. It is therefore not surprising that many patients are motivated to seek treatment. The existing treatment strategies for acne are complex due to the multifactorial pathogenesis of the disease. Although it is difficult to cure, four categories of medications have proved efficacious in reducing acne lesions: topical agents, systemic antibiotics, systemic retinoids, and hormonal agents. Unfortunately, these medications can cause adverse effects that may limit their use. Typically, these adverse effects are mild and transient and can be remedied by altering the dose or frequency of the offending agent. However, more serious adverse effects can occur that pose a significant health risk to the patient. Understanding how to recognize and manage the adverse effects of common acne therapies is imperative to providing the safest and most appropriate treatment for each patient. This article focuses on the recognition and management of adverse effects associated with current acne medications.

### Oral isotretinoin: new developments relevant to clinical practice [^111YVv6F]. Dermatologic Clinics (2016). Low credibility.

Oral isotretinoin is unrivalled in efficacy and remission capability for treatment of acne. In addition to appropriate monitoring and continued vigilance for safety concerns, appropriate dosing to mitigate avoidable dose-dependent adverse effects is the responsibility of prescribers. Low-dose regimens are better tolerated and effective in inducing acne clearance. Although much progress has been made since the advent of isotretinoin, there remain many unanswered questions regarding optimization to maximize response while minimizing the potential for avoidable adverse events. The ongoing availability of isotretinoin is imperative to patients with acne, their caregivers, and physicians.

### An algorithm integrating acneceuticals into the management of acne vulgaris [^116PVRne]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common, chronic cutaneous disorder with numerous efficacious prescription and procedural treatments. Therapy, however, is hampered by medication intolerability and compromised by non-adherence. The use of acneceuticals is an effective way to improve patient outcomes.

Methods

A panel of 5 dermatologists met for a consensus conference in October 2023 to identify a practical acne treatment and maintenance algorithm integrating acneceuticals with prescription medications and procedures.

Results

The algorithm stratifies the use of acneceuticals first as monotherapy, adjunctive therapy, or maintenance therapy and then further diverges by skin phenotype (oily or dry/sensitive) and primary lesion morphology (comedonal or inflammatory). Finally, specific acneceuticals are recommended for each phenotypic description.

Conclusion

The algorithm is intended to serve as a guideline for integrating active nonprescription skin care into prescription acne therapy, improving efficacy, tolerability, and adherence, resulting in superior patient outcomes. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24(4):376–380. doi:10.36849/JDD.8887.

### Acne treatment review and future perspectives [^112eF9nc]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne affects approximately 9% of people worldwide and is the most common skin condition in the United States. There are abundant topical and oral treatment options available for patients with acne. First-line agents include topical retinoids, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and combinations of these agents. For recalcitrant or more severe acne, oral medications, including oral antibiotics, isotretinoin, or hormonal therapy, may be considered. This review will also discuss the many advances being made in the treatment of acne vulgaris, from the development of microencapsulated medications to targeted treatments.

Therapeutic actives for acne have changed little in the last decade. Recognition that acne is an inflammatory condition, not an infectious one, has led to a call for reduction in antibiotic use, which has culminated in a re-evaluation of our nonantibiotic choices. Spironolactone and oral contraceptives have become more acceptable first-line choices, and earlier use of isotretinoin has been proposed.

### Topical vehicle formulations in the treatment of acne [^114XxfeM]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Topical treatment is the mainstay of acne therapy. The most commonly prescribed topical medications for acne include benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, and retinoids. Despite their effectiveness in treating mild to moderate acne vulgaris, these topical medications are found to be irritating, and are historically associated with poor tolerability and diminished patient adherence. Thus, choosing the right formulation that will be effective and well tolerated is essential. Novel formulations that optimize drug concentration and utilize improved delivery vehicles have helped to enhance the tolerability and efficacy, and allow for less frequent application or co-application of drugs that were previously considered incompatible. This article will review the goals of topical therapy for the treatment of acne, in addition to common therapies and their challenges. Advanced formulations and combination formulations of benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, and tretinoin will also be discussed. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(6 Suppl):s6–10.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^11722LS1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Early effective treatment for acne improves patient well-being and may prevent permanent scars or pigment changes. Initial management includes a range of topical treatments, with the option of adding oral antibiotics for patients with more severe acne. There are significant opportunities for reducing oral antibiotic prescribing in acne. These include: promoting effective use of topical treatments; avoiding prolonged courses of oral antibiotics; coprescribing topical treatments alongside oral antibiotics; continuing topical treatments as maintenance treatment and considering alternatives, such as the combined contraceptive pill and spironolactone in primary care. When acne is unresponsive to these measures, timely referral for consideration of isotretinoin should be initiated.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^113HZAsS]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally, affecting over 0·5 billion people. Acne can have a detrimental physical, psychological and social impact. Acne severity may be determined by clinical presentation (number and type of lesions), secondary sequelae (scarring, pigmentation), and its psychological and social impact on the patient. Uncertainty around acne treatment effectiveness may be a barrier to treatment. Various topical, oral and physical acne treatments are available, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness, especially in relation to acne severity.

Network meta‐analysis (NMA) allows simultaneous estimation of relative effects for any number of treatments, even if some have not been directly compared in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), provided that treatments create a 'network of evidence' where every treatment is linked to at least another treatment through direct comparisons.,

Two NMAs assessing the effectiveness of treatments for acne vulgaris have been published to date, both focusing on mild‐to‐moderate acne. Therefore, our study examined the relative effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments separately for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, as determined by clinician‐assessed morphological features, to identify suitable first‐line treatments.

### Reviewing the global burden of acne: how could we improve care to reduce the burden? [^112eHnka]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acne (also known as acne vulgaris) remains the most common inflammatory dermatosis treated worldwide, as estimated by global skin disease prevalence studies. Latest reports suggest that the prevalence may be increasing in adolescents and adults, particularly female adults. The concept of 'burden of skin disease' is multidimensional and can be difficult to quantify in light of different healthcare systems across the globe. In acne, the resulting burden may vary according to patient demographics, access to treatments and duration of the disease. The visible nature of acne, symptoms and sequelae all contribute physically and psychosocially to the overall burden of disease, as do the costs required for management. Acne typically presents in adolescence at a time of significant transition. Profound effects on functional status have been demonstrated, along with a strong impact on interpersonal relationships, social functioning and mental health. The high prevalence of acne also presents an economic burden for society. The widespread and prolonged use of antibiotics introduces a potential added burden through resulting antimicrobial resistance. A James Lind Alliance Acne Priority Setting Partnership has identified numerous areas to inform future research, which would help to improve acne management and reduce the burden. The lack of standardized assessments is a major issue in acne trials and challenges the ability to compare treatments and perform meta-analyses. This paper reviews the current literature on burden of acne, identifies areas of treatment uncertainties and summarizes the work of the Acne Core Outcome Research Network as a means of supporting a reduction in the burden of disease.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111u9x2K]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A strength of our review and NMA was the inclusion of a wide range of acne treatments and, subsequently, a much larger number of RCTs (112 for mild‐to‐moderate and 67 for moderate‐to‐severe acne) than either of the two previously published NMAs. Furthermore, our NMA assessed treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne. The NMA results informed national clinical guidance. Our methodology enabled evidence synthesis from direct and indirect treatment comparisons and allowed simultaneous inference on all treatments. Our NMA employed class models to gain precision on the effects of treatments within the same class and to connect networks disconnected at the treatment level, thus allowing consideration of a wider evidence base. We measured efficacy using the percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline, as this is commonly reported across RCTs or can often be estimated using other available data, which allowed inclusion of a large evidence base in the respective analyses. Another validated efficacy measure, the Investigator Global Assessment scale, recommended by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the assessment of effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of acne vulgaris, was used by fewer studies in our dataset; therefore, had we selected this outcome to measure efficacy, we would have limited our evidence base.

Dietary interventions (e.g. milk‐free diet, low glycaemic load diet), which may have an effect on acne vulgaris and its response to treatment, were not included in this review but were assessed in another review conducted to inform the NICE guideline. Although we searched for treatments for acne vulgaris at any body site, the majority of the RCTs included in our review focused on facial acne. This is a limitation of the evidence base and not of the review per se. Another potential limitation of our review was its focus on evidence published in the English language, following NICE guidance. On the other hand, evidence suggests that use of language restrictions in systematic review‐based meta‐analyses in conventional medicine does not introduce systematic bias. Furthermore, as the purpose of our NMA was to inform national guidance in England, we focused on pharmacological treatments that are available in the UK. This resulted in the exclusion of a number of potentially effective drug treatments for acne from the NMA, as they were not licensed in the UK at the time of the analysis (e.g. topical dapsone, topical tetracyclines). Final searches for evidence were conducted in May 2020, and it is possible that new evidence (and new treatments) have emerged since.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114iXepC]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Various treatments for acne vulgaris exist, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness in relation to acne severity.

Objectives

To identify best treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, as determined by clinician‐assessed morphological features.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and network meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, published up to May 2020. Outcomes included percentage change in total lesion count from baseline, treatment discontinuation for any reason, and discontinuation owing to side‐effects. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool and bias adjustment models. Effects for treatments with ≥ 50 observations each compared with placebo are reported below.

Results

We included 179 RCTs with approximately 35 000 observations across 49 treatment classes. For mild‐to‐moderate acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological – combined retinoid with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) [mean difference 26·16%, 95% credible interval (CrI) 16·75–35·36%]; physical – chemical peels, e.g. salicylic or mandelic acid (39·70%, 95% CrI 12·54–66·78%) and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) (35·36%, 95% CrI 17·75–53·08%). Oral pharmacological treatments (e.g. antibiotics, hormonal contraceptives) did not appear to be effective after bias adjustment. BPO and topical retinoids were less well tolerated than placebo. For moderate‐to‐severe acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological – combined retinoid with lincosamide (clindamycin) (44·43%, 95% CrI 29·20–60·02%); oral pharmacological – isotretinoin of total cumulative dose ≥ 120 mg kg⁻¹ per single course (58·09%, 95% CrI 36·99–79·29%); physical – photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) (40·45%, 95% CrI 26·17–54·11%); combined – BPO with topical retinoid and oral tetracycline (43·53%, 95% CrI 29·49–57·70%). Topical retinoids and oral tetracyclines were less well tolerated than placebo. The quality of included RCTs was moderate to very low, with evidence of inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence. Uncertainty in findings was high, in particular for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy. However, conclusions were robust to potential bias in the evidence.

Conclusions

Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy were most effective for mild‐to‐moderate acne. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical pharmacological treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy were most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Further research is warranted for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy for which evidence was more limited.

What is already known about this topic?
Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally.
Several topical, oral, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris exist.
Network meta‐analysis (NMA) synthesizes direct and indirect evidence and allows simultaneous inference for all treatments forming an evidence network.
Previous NMAs have assessed a limited range of treatments for acne vulgaris and have not evaluated effectiveness of treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

What does this study add?
For mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical treatment combinations, chemical peels, and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light; blue light) are most effective.
For moderate‐to‐severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) are most effective.
Based on these findings, along with further clinical and cost‐effectiveness considerations, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends, as first‐line treatments, fixed topical treatment combinations for mild‐to‐moderate acne and fixed topical treatment combinations, or oral tetracyclines combined with topical treatments, for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^1135W71s]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

While endorsing key aspects of expert opinion with hard data and providing some new insights, this systematic review has highlighted existing important gaps in the evidence about how best to utilize oral spironolactone in managing acne in women, including clarifying the optimum dose and dosing regimen to maximize benefits and minimize the risk of side effects, the lowest effective dose, the possible requirement for concomitant therapies and what these should be, which types of acne are likely to be responsive, and how effective spironolactone is compared with standard therapies. It is interesting to note that several current acne guidelines and treatment recommendations include spironolactone on the basis of consensus and/or expert opinion. Others either do not mention spironolactone, or specifically say it is regarded as ineffective, not recommended or there is insufficient evidence to support its use. All, including those that purport to be evidence-based, have failed to identify the majority of studies that were included in this systematic review. Although there were five relevant studies that, to date, have proved unobtainable (two of which were almost certainly duplicate publications of included case series), we are confident that all the RCTs evaluating spironolactone for acne in women have been retrieved and no clinical trial evidence has been overlooked. Until such time as higher quality evidence becomes available, guideline developers will have to continue to rely on recommendations largely based on expert experience or reached via consensus of expert panels. While this review has identified some very-low-quality evidence which showed that the 200 mg daily dose was statistically significantly more effective than placebo versus inflamed lesions, it has also confirmed that this dose is associated with a significantly greater risk of adverse side effects than lower doses. Hence, there would appear to be no merit in using these higher doses for managing acne, except in exceptional circumstances (e.g. in obese women with PCOS). Data from the multiple case series suggest that any future RCT examining lower doses is likely to generate results that confirm the effectiveness and better safety profile of doses ≤ 100 mg/day.

### Young people's perceptions of acne and acne treatments: secondary analysis of qualitative interview data [^113vhikv]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Time taken for topical treatment to work

Participants spoke about feeling frustrated and annoyed with topical treatments as they perceived them as ineffective, possibly because they expected them to work 'instantly'. This was linked to a process of 'trial and error' of going back to their GP for alternative treatments because they wanted something they thought would be more effective. This often resulted in participants trying what they perceived as stronger treatments, such as oral antibiotics.

'I decided that I'd rather just go straight back to the stronger [um] medication than have to spend a a long time trying the topical creams which I was pretty sure weren't gonna… I mean maybe they would work but it would just take [er] a lot longer than if I went back to the treatment I was on before that was actually working'.
'I can't really remember the names of them I'm afraid. I think both of us expected results more quickly than they were plausibly going to come and so there was quite a pattern of kind of trying something for a couple of weeks and then just moving on to the next thing'.
One participant was told that her topical treatment might take a while to work, which appeared to help her to feel less 'disheartened' at the absence of 'instant' results.

'So I was never too… and that's always been expressed to me which I think is helpful, is that there are very few medications which are like an overnight [um] cures because I think once you do, you know, get the courage up to go to a doctor and then if you're un‐, non‐, if you're not aware that it's not gonna be fixed overnight it's probably quite disheartening when, you know, you go maybe a month and you can't see a change. [um] But I mean you really just have to keep at it because I don't know why but the medication doesn't work instantly. [Um] but that's always been stressed to me which has been really helpful'.

Transitivity and inconsistency checks

A basic NMA assumption is that the distribution of effect modifiers is the same across treatment comparisons ('transitivity' assumption). To control for potential effect modifiers, we aimed to reduce heterogeneity in populations and treatments across RCTs included in the NMAs. For this reason, we stratified analyses by acne severity, using clear criteria and excluding RCTs with populations of all severity levels or with unclear acne severity. Treatments such as hormonal contraceptives are relevant only to females, and thus analyses were conducted separately for males and females where appropriate. Treatments were assigned to treatment classes using detailed definitions, considering differentiation in dosing (e.g. oral isotretinoin, chemical peels vs. topical acids) and excluding treatments administered using suboptimal dosing. As age is a potential effect modifier, we reviewed the study samples' age ranges in the included RCTs. Other effect modifiers might be present in the dataset, but these were either unknown or could not be explored as they were not consistently reported (e.g. socioeconomic factors).

Violations of the transitivity assumption may lead to inconsistency, i.e. conflict between the direct and indirect evidence estimates of the same treatment comparisons. This was assessed statistically by undertaking global inconsistencyand node‐split tests. Details on inconsistency checking methods are provided in Appendix S4 (see Supporting Information).

Bias adjustment models

Bias adjustment models were fitted for all outcomes to downweight trials at high or unclear risk of bias (assessed using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool)on domains where sufficient variability in ratings was observed across studies. Additional bias adjustment models tested for bias associated with small sample size studies. Analyses assumed possible bias in comparisons of active interventions vs. inactive control. In analyses where there was indication of the presence of such biases, results from bias‐adjusted models were considered. Details on bias adjustment methods and respective codes are shown in Appendix S5 (see Supporting Information).

Threshold analysis

Threshold analysis was undertaken on the efficacy outcome to assess the robustness of NMA‐based recommendations to potential biases or sampling variation in the included evidence. Results of threshold analysis describe how much each data point would have to change (e.g. if adjusted for bias) before the conclusion changes and what the revised conclusion would be. Appendix S6 (see Supporting Information) reports threshold analysis methods.

### Unmet needs in the management of acne vulgaris: a consensus statement [^115r98L1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin condition in the US, affecting up to 50 million Americans. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) guidelines on acne treatment were developed to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, grading, and treatment of acne in adolescents and adults to support clinicians in their therapeutic decision-making process. The most recent acne guidelines were published in 2016, and the approach to care and the therapeutic landscape of acne have evolved since that time. The Acne Management Consensus Roundtable was convened in 2022 to discuss unmet needs in the management of acne. The main focus of the meeting was the role of androgens in acne pathology; the evaluation of clascoterone, the first topical anti-androgen that specifically addresses sebum production in acne; and the identification of the place of clascoterone in therapy. Clascoterone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acne in patients 12 years and older in 2020. This report aims to highlight important limitations of the 2016 AAD treatment guidelines and to familiarize practitioners with clascoterone and its indication, efficacy and safety profile, and potential use across diverse patient populations. With its new mechanism of action, clascoterone may be able to fulfill important unmet needs in acne treatment. Baldwin H, Farberg AS, Frey C, et al.

Statistical analysis

To account for the uncertainty around input parameter point estimates, a probabilistic analysis was undertaken, with input parameters being assigned probability distributions. Subsequently, 10 000 model iterations were performed, each drawing random values out of the distributions fitted onto the model input parameters. The mean costs and QALYs for each treatment were calculated by averaging across the 10 000 iterations. The net monetary benefit (NMB) for each intervention was estimated for each iteration and averaged across the 10 000 iterations, determined by the formula:where E and C are the effects (QALYs) and costs of each intervention respectively, and λ represents the willingness to pay (WTP) per QALY, set at the NICE lower cost‐effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per QALY. The intervention with the highest NMB is the most cost‐effective. The mean ranking by cost‐effectiveness (out of 10 000 iterations) is also reported for each intervention, with a rank of 1 indicating highest cost‐effectiveness.

Supplementary Data S8 reports the model input values with probability distributions and additional sensitivity analyses conducted to test the robustness of the results.

Model validation

The economic model was constructed following the guideline committee's expert advice. All inputs and model formulae were systematically checked. The model was tested for logical consistency. The results were discussed with the committee to confirm plausibility.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114D7zTx]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our analysis explored the relative cost‐effectiveness of a wide range of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne stratified by severity level. All treatments were more cost‐effective than treatment with placebo (modelled as GP visits without active treatment). For mild‐to‐moderate acne, the most cost‐effective treatments included topical treatment combinations and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light). For moderate‐to‐severe acne, the most cost‐effective treatments included topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, and oral isotretinoin.

To our knowledge, this is the first analysis exploring the relative cost‐effectiveness of a wide range of treatment options for acne from a healthcare perspective, considering, in addition to drug acquisition costs, HCP resource use, including costs associated with inadequate response to treatment or relapse. Previous economic studies (identified through a systematic search conducted to inform the NICE guideline)made limited comparisons of acne treatments, and the majority considered exclusively drug acquisition costs. A number of studies were simple cost analyses and most of them were characterized by important methodological limitations (Supplementary Data S10). Therefore, no robust conclusions can be drawn from the existing economic literature.

In our analysis, we used efficacy and discontinuation data derived from a large systematic review and NMA. This approach combines direct (i.e. head‐to‐head comparisons) and indirect evidence (e.g. comparisons through a common comparator) and allows simultaneous comparisons across all options while preserving randomization. There was some inconsistency between the direct and indirect evidence synthesized in the NMA, possibly reflecting heterogeneity in populations, treatments or study design across the included RCTs. However, NMA conclusions were robust to potential bias in the evidence. The RCTs included in the NMAs were of moderate to very low quality. The strengths and limitations of the source NMA and included RCTs should be considered when interpreting the cost‐effectiveness results.

The size of the evidence differed considerably across the examined treatments. Topical treatments had the largest evidence base on efficacy (several topical treatments had > 500 observations each), followed by oral treatments alone or combined with topical treatments, whereas the evidence for physical therapies (chemical peels, photochemical therapies, PDT) was based on < 300 observations for each treatment class.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^113eHCtC]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is very common and can have significant negative impact on people. While sometimes a transient problem, acne may persist for many years and often leads to permanent scars or pigment changes. Guidelines unanimously advise topical treatments as first-line, although differ in recommending either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) alone or in combination. Guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advises counselling patients regarding avoidance of skin irritation when starting topical treatments and promoting adherence (treatments take 6–8 weeks to work). Oral antibiotics are currently overprescribed for acne but have a role when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment. Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are also effective and there is growing evidence for the use of spironolactone for women with persistent acne. Recent guidance from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency regarding isotretinoin has implications for specialist prescribing and monitoring, and increasing public awareness of potential risks of mental health problems and sexual dysfunction. Although acne is associated with psychiatric disorder, the mental health effects of isotretinoin remain controversial.

Treatment outcomes

Efficacy of each treatment class relative to placebo is shown in Table 1 for mild‐to‐moderate acne and Table 2 for moderate‐to‐severe acne. In each analysis, treatment classes have been ordered from best to worst using their mean ranking for females. For mild‐to‐moderate acne, bias‐adjusted results are presented, as there was indication of bias owing to small study size in this evidence; base‐case results (before bias adjustment) are shown in Appendix S15 (see Supporting Information). Large uncertainty in the results for most treatments was indicated by wide 95% CrIs around mean effects and rankings.

Table 2
Network meta‐analysis: treatment efficacy (percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline) in moderate‐to‐severe acne: treatment class effects vs. placebo and rankings

No evidence of effect on treatment discontinuation for any reason was found for any treatment class compared with placebo at either acne severity level. In mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical retinoids, BPO and their combination showed higher discontinuation owing to side‐effects compared with placebo; in moderate‐to‐severe acne (bias‐adjusted analysis), topical retinoids alone or combined with an oral tetracycline, oral cocyprindiol alone or combined with an oral tetracycline, and oral tetracycline alone showed higher discontinuation owing to side‐effects compared with placebo (Appendix S15).

Relative effects between all pairs of treatment classes (including results from indirect and available head‐to‐head comparisons) are reported in Appendix S16 (see Supporting Information).

Threshold analysis

After excluding antibiotic monotherapies, physical treatments and oral isotretinoin, which the committee considered unsuitable first‐line treatments owing to associated potential harms or lack of routine availability and use, threshold analysis suggested that conclusions for mild‐to‐moderate acne were fairly robust to changes in the evidence. In moderate‐to‐severe acne, a moderate change in the evidence would lead to BPO entering the top four efficacious treatments that were eligible for a recommendation (Appendix S17; see Supporting Information).

### Current issues in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^11745Dtg]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extraordinarily common skin condition in adolescents. The mainstays of acne treatment have remained largely unchanged over recent years. In the context of increasing antibiotic resistance worldwide, there is a global movement away from antibiotic monotherapy toward their more restrictive use. Classically reserved for nodulocystic acne, isotretinoin has become the drug of choice by dermatologists for moderate to severe acne. Given the virtually ubiquitous nature of acne in teenagers, there remains an appreciable need for novel therapies. In this article, we will cover the currently used acne treatments, evaluate the issues and data supporting their use, explore the issues of compliance and the mental health implications of acne care, and recommend directions for the field of acne management in adolescents in the years ahead.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^115trdeK]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hormonal contraceptives are only suitable for females. Therefore, depending on data availability, separate analyses were conducted for males and females for some outcomes. Analyses included both parallel and split‐body/face RCTs; because of inclusion of the latter, for each treatment we report number of observations rather than number of participants.

Three outcomes at treatment endpoint were analysed using NMA techniques, as they were deemed to be clinically important and were applicable to all treatments:
efficacy, expressed as percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline (%CFB)
treatment discontinuation for any reason (reflecting acceptability)
treatment discontinuation owing to side‐effects (reflecting tolerability).

A fourth outcome, prevention of scarring at any follow‐up, was selected for NMA, but insufficient data were identified.

Titles and abstracts of identified studies were screened by two reviewers for inclusion against protocol criteria, until a good interrater reliability was observed (agreement ≥ 90%). Initially 10% of references were double‐screened; as interrater agreement was > 90%, the remaining references were screened by one reviewer. Full texts of studies included after the first sift were acquired and checked for eligibility. The following data were extracted from included studies: country, study population, intervention details, outcome data, and potential risk of bias assessed using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool version 2.0. All data extraction was double‐checked by a second reviewer. Disagreements were resolved via discussion between the two reviewers, and consultation with a senior reviewer if necessary.

### Young people's perceptions of acne and acne treatments: secondary analysis of qualitative interview data [^113ys6PQ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Understanding of different topical treatments

Frustration with the trial and error process seemed to be influenced by people's perception that they had tried all the topical treatments available. They described their treatment as 'the one from the pharmacy' or 'the one my mum bought me'. With some assuming that branded topical products such as 'Clearasil' were the same as topical treatments prescribed by the GP, possibly leading them to wish to try other medications such as oral antibiotics as a first‐line treatment. Many participants either said they were confused, or appeared to be confused, with regard to the different functions, ingredients and medical names of topical treatments, frequently getting them mixed up with one another.

'I'm not sure, I've had loads, I've had like benzoyl something, I think I've had. [er] I'm not sure what this one was called actually, I've pretty much been on everything so you can factor it was like one of them. [laughs] [er] so I'm, I'm not sure what it was actually called'.
Uncertainty about the effectiveness of topical treatments

Many participants were uncertain whether topicals were effective, as they reported how they were only 'keeping their acne at bay'. In addition, some participants spoke about how discontinuing treatment once their skin was clear, or because of side‐effects, would make their acne worse and therefore perceived treatment as ineffective because they had been hoping for a 'cure'.

'I remember the problem was that it tended to make my skin really dry after a while, so you had to stop the treatment. But that was the best one that was working for me. So it really wasn't, so I did it like for a month or two and then my skin got really dry. Then I stopped for a month and then it like came back. So you're just repeating it over and over and over again. You're not really getting a definite cure. So that's, yeah, that's annoying'.
For some, keeping the acne under control was not enough and they were seeking something that would clear it completely.

'It was kind of just sort of a keeping it at a certain level as opposed to absolutely like clearing your whole skin and making it sort of a lot better'.

### Recent advances in acne pathogenesis: implications for therapy [^114pLNGA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acne pathogenesis is a multifactorial process that occurs at the level of the pilosebaceous unit. While acne was previously perceived as an infectious disease, recent data have clarified it as an inflammatory process in which Propionibacterium acnes and innate immunity play critical roles in propagating abnormal hyperkeratinization and inflammation. Alterations in sebum composition, and increased sensitivity to androgens, also play roles in the inflammatory process. A stepwise approach to acne management utilizes topical agents for mild to moderate acne (topical retinoid as mainstay ± topical antibiotics) and escalation to oral agents for more resistant cases (oral antibiotics or hormonal agents in conjunction with a topical retinoid or oral isotretinoin alone for severe acne). Concerns over antibiotic resistance and the safety issues associated with isotretinoin have prompted further research into alternative medications and devices for the treatment of acne. Radiofrequency, laser, and light treatments have demonstrated modest improvement for inflammatory acne (with blue-light photodynamic therapy being the only US FDA-approved treatment). However, limitations in study design and patient follow-up render these modalities as adjuncts rather than standalone options. This review will update readers on the latest advancements in our understanding of acne pathogenesis and treatment, with emphasis on emerging treatment options that can help improve patient outcomes.

### The use of acneceuticals to improve acne care: introduction of a new term and review of the literature [^11744mVZ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne is a multifactorial inflammatory skin condition that commonly presents to the dermatology clinic. Treatment generally involves the use of pharmaceutical agents and procedural techniques. Recently, the importance of over-the-counter skin care in acne has been recognized in many studies. This paper introduces the term acneceuticals to encompass a wide range of FDA- monographed, yet non-prescription ingredients proven to alter the structure and function of acneic skin.

Methods

A panel of 8 dermatologists with an interest in acne and skin care performed a literature review of active skin care in acne. The role of acneceuticals in the treatment of acne - as monotherapy, adjunctive, and maintenance therapy - was evaluated using a modified Delphi approach. Studies were limited to in vivo human trials involving acne. Individual actives were assessed separately.

Results

The quality of evidence was moderate-to-low for many of the ingredients. Most of the actives included in the final assessment had been studied in vehicle-controlled, blinded, often comparative studies but enrolled a small number of subjects. In these studies, the acneceuticals were found to reduce lesion count, reduce sebum production, and improve efficacy of existing pharmacologic therapies.

Conclusion

Acneceuticals have demonstrated benefits in treating acne, alone or in conjunction with established pharmaceutical agents. These data allow us to make quality recommendations for our patients that should be a part of every patient encounter. The recommendations also serve as a guide for patients searching the internet for beneficial self-care products. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24(3):281–288. doi:10.36849/JDD.8817.

### Tretinoin (tretinoin cream) [^114yteGV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Tretinoin Cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly.

Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment.

Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance.

During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy.

Therapeutic results should be noticed after 2 to 3 weeks but more than 6 weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen.

Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms.

Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied (see PRECAUTIONS).

Acne systemic antibiotic stewardship — Monotherapy with oral antibiotics is strongly discouraged, and the use of topical maintenance regimens cannot be overemphasized. Topical therapies can accomplish continued efficacy months after the discontinuation of systemic antibiotics, and the work group's consensus suggests that such maintenance is paramount to reducing antibiotic resistance. Other attempts to limit antibiotic use revolve around different dosing recommendations, such as pulse dosing and submicrobial dosing, but no alternative dosing routines consistently appear superior to standard dosing. Limiting systemic antibiotic use is urged because of the reported associations of inflammatory bowel disease, pharyngitis, C difficile infection, and the induction of Candida vulvovaginitis. While limiting the use of systemic antibiotics is necessary, the work group's consensus agrees there are a subset of patients for whom alternative therapies are inappropriate and who may require a longer course of antibiotics even while taking topical medications.

### Approaches to limit systemic antibiotic use in acne: systemic alternatives, emerging topical therapies, dietary modification, and laser and light-based treatments [^111Y1gKc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acne is one of the most common diseases worldwide and affects ∼50 million individuals in the United States. Oral antibiotics are the most common systemic agent prescribed for the treatment of acne. However, their use might be associated with a variety of adverse outcomes including bacterial resistance and disruption of the microbiome. As a result, multiple treatment guidelines call for limiting the use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of acne, although actual prescribing often does not follow these guidelines. In this review, the rationale for concerns regarding the use of oral antibiotics for the management of acne is reviewed. In addition, we will discuss our approach to complying with the intent of the guidelines, with a focus on novel topical agents, dietary modification, laser and light-based modalities, and systemic medications, such as spironolactone, combined oral contraceptives, and oral isotretinoin.

Demographics of Patients with Acne

Acne prevalence is estimated to be 9.4% worldwide. Prevalence is highest in adolescents and young adults and decreases with age beyond 30 years. After teenage years, acne remains more common in women than men, occurring in approximately one-half of women in their 20s, one-third in their 30s, and one-quarter in their 40s.

In the United States, acne is the most common condition presenting to dermatologists. Despite greater numbers of teenage boys than girls with acne, almost two-thirds of dermatology visits due to acne are attended by female individuals. Approximately two-thirds of visits are made by patients < 25 years of age, with the mean age of those seeking treatment being 24 years. Children as young as 6 years of age may be prescribed acne treatment. Acne medications are most often prescribed for those aged 12–14 years.

### Japanese Dermatological Association guidelines: guidelines for the treatment of acne vulgaris 2017 [^1153Zszz]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The Guidelines for the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris of the Japanese Dermatological Association was first published in Japanese in 2008 and revised in 2016 and 2017. These guidelines (GL) indicate the standard acne treatments in Japan and address pharmaceutical drugs and treatments applicable or in use in Japan. In these GL, the strength of the recommendation is based on clinical evidences as well as availability in Japanese medical institutions. In the 2016 and 2017 GL, some of the clinical questions were revised, and other questions were added in accordance with approval of topical medicines containing benzoyl peroxide (BPO). Rather than monotherapies of antibiotics, the 2017 GL more strongly recommend combination therapies, especially fixed-dose combination gels including BPO in the aspects of pharmacological actions and compliance in the acute inflammatory phase to achieve earlier and better improvements. The 2017 GL also indicate to limit the antimicrobial treatments for the acute inflammatory phase up to approximately 3 months and recommend BPO, adapalene, and a fixed-dose combination gel of 0.1% adapalene and 2.5% BPO for the maintenance phase to avoid the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant Propionibacterium acnes. The 2017 GL also discuss rosacea, which requires discrimination from acne and a different treatment plan.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^115SANvA]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris (hereafter referred to as acne) is extremely common, affecting over 90% of teenagers. Among people with acne, approximately 40%–60% have acne persisting into their twenties and it leads to some degree of scarring in approximately 20% of the population. Acne can cause significant distress, decreased self-confidence and increased rates of depression and suicidal thoughts, particularly among women and people identifying as non-white.

As well as limiting quality of life, acne makes a major contribution to antibiotic use among young people: long courses of oral antibiotics are common and acne accounts for the majority of antibiotic exposure among people aged 11–21 years in England. There is high-quality evidence supporting use of topical treatments for acne, which are recommended as first line treatment for mild-to-moderate acne. However, treatment adherence is low and barriers to effective self-management include people discontinuing treatment early due to skin irritation or not seeing early treatment effects, and not differentiating between effective topical treatments and ineffective cosmetic products. Healthcare professionals need to promote treatment adherence by advising about delayed onset of action and how to avoid skin irritation. Providing information to patients is therefore crucial and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) guideline provides a list of information that should be provided for people with acne (see table 1). This may be difficult to cover in brief consultations, highlighting the need for signposting patients towards evidence-based resources, such as those listed in box 1.

Key Points for Practice
- First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications including topical antibiotics.
- Tetracyclines are the preferred oral antibiotic, and doxycycline and minocycline have been shown to be more effective than tetracycline. First-line and Alternative Treatment Options First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications consisting of benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic, retinoid, or both. An alternative treatment would include the addition of a topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide if not already prescribed; a different retinoid; or topical dapsone.

First-line treatment for moderate acne vulgaris includes a combination of benzoyl peroxide and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both; benzoyl peroxide, an oral antibiotic, and topical retinoid; or benzoyl peroxide, oral and topical antibiotics, and a topical retinoid. Alternative treatments to be considered include a different combination of medications; changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or oral isotretinoin. First-line treatment for severe acne vulgaris includes an oral antibiotic, benzoyl peroxide, and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both. Oral isotretinoin can also be considered as a first-line option. Alternative treatment options to consider include changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or starting oral isotretinoin.

Because of the risk of developing bacterial resistance when erythromycin and clindamycin are used as monotherapy, if prescribed, they should be combined with benzoyl peroxide. A topical retinoid alone is recommended primarily for comedonal acne, and for persons with mixed or inflammatory acne, it also can be used in conjunction with a topical or oral antimicrobial. In the short term, adding an oral corticosteroid when initiating the usual acne therapy in persons with severe inflammatory acne can be beneficial. Low-dose oral corticosteroids are recommended for persons with adrenal hyperandrogenism. Available at: http: //www. jaad. org/article/S0190–962202614–6/pdf.

### Treatments for acne vulgaris based on severity… [^111HXBaj]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Topical retinoids include tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene. Tretinoin and adapalene reduce total lesions by more than 50 percent, with adapalene being less irritating to skin. One trial showed similar lesion reduction with tazarotene gel. Overall, retinoids reduce lesions by 40 to 70 percent. Topical antibiotics include clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. Benzoyl peroxide and azelaic acid also have antimicrobial activity. Original studies show that clindamycin and erythromycin reduce lesions to a similar degree as retinoids. Products that combine antibiotics with benzoyl peroxide are more effective than either product alone. Oral antibiotics used for the treatment of acne include tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, and erythromycin. Studies on oral antibiotics are few and in some instances are hampered by methodological flaws. However, these agents appear to work better than placebo.

Gastrointestinal side effects and photosensitivity are associated with tetracycline and doxycycline; minocycline also causes adverse side effects, including vertigo. Perhaps of most concern is the problem of antibiotic resistance, which affects more than one half of bacterial strains in Europe. Combination therapy and avoidance of long-term therapy are recommended. Hormonal treatments include oral contraceptives and androgen-receptor blockers. One trial showed a 50 percent reduction of lesions in patients treated with oral contraceptives, compared with 30 percent in those given placebo. In Europe, newer progesterone-estrogen combinations have been shown to be effective. Androgen-receptor blockers include spironolactone and flutamide. These agents must be used in high doses to be effective in the treatment of acne. All agents in this class also are effective when used in combination with an oral contraceptive. Isotretinoin is used for severe cases of acne.

One randomized controlled trial showed that doses of 0. 5 and 1 mg per kg per day resulted in an 80 percent or greater reduction in lesions. A single course of four to six months can be effective. Lower efficacy and higher rate of recurrence have been observed in patients treated with lower doses. In conclusion, the authors emphasize that treatment of acne should take into account fluctuations in severity and should be adjusted according to tolerance and response. In many cases, combination therapy is warranted.

### Current therapies for the management of acne… [^113T7S3y]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Isotretinoin, a natural metabolite of vitamin A, greatly reduces sebum production. A four-to five-month oral course of isotretinoin, 0. 1 to

1. 0 mg per kg, results in remission in most patients. Remission lasts longer in patients treated with higher doses. Topical agents, such as tretinoin, isotretinoin and salicylic acid, can be effective in slowing the desquamation of follicular epithelial cells. Tretinoin is available in several concentrations and can be used in combination with topical or systemic antibiotics. The gel formulation is preferred in hot and humid climates and the cream in cold and dry climates. Salicylic acid is weaker but is available over the counter. Azelaic acid is a recently approved agent with some activity against comedogenesis. Topical antibiotics, when applied once or twice daily, have a beneficial effect as well.

Various antibiotics may be used, including formulations of erythromycin, clindamycin, metronidazole, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and a combination of benzoyl peroxide and erythromycin or glycolic acid. Benzoyl peroxide suppresses the growth of. Propionibacterium acnes more effectively than clindamycin and erythromycin alone. However, it causes local irritation and allergic contact dermatitis more often than other topical antibiotics. Topical clindamycin is more effective than topical erythromycin in vivo, but their clinical efficacy is similar. The combination of benzoyl peroxide and erythromycin is probably the most effective topical therapy available. Systemic antibiotics for acne therapy include tetracycline, erythromycin, minocycline, doxycycline, clindamycin and trimethoprim-sul-famethoxazole. Doxycycline, minocycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are generally considered more effective and less potent than tetracycline and erythromycin.

The author concludes that patients with inflammatory acne are best treated with benzoyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide plus erythromycin, topical clindamycin, topical erythromycin and/or oral antibiotics. Patients with widespread nodular cystic lesions may respond to oral antibiotics but generally require therapy with systemic isotretinoin. Estrogens or antiandrogens are effective alternatives to systemic isotretinoin in women with persistent acne.
