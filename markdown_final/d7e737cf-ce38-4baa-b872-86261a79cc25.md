## Question

GLP 1 and kidney physiology

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how GLP-1 receptor agonists influence kidney physiology and whether they confer renoprotection, and if so, through what mechanisms and clinical evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baseline renal physiology and where GLP-1 receptors might be expressed in the kidney. Then, I should verify direct tubular effects, especially natriuresis and NHE3 modulation. Next, I will examine hemodynamic effects, including tubuloglomerular feedback and glomerular hemodynamics. After that, I need to assess indirect systemic effects via glycemia, blood pressure, and weight. I will then consider non-glycemic direct renal mechanisms like anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and oxidative stress pathways. I should review clinical evidence across eGFR strata, including FLOW and meta-analyses, and check safety and dose adjustment in CKD. Finally, I will synthesize the totality of evidence and reconcile mechanistic uncertainty with clinical outcomes to draw a cautious conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the renal context and receptor expression, because I need to ensure we're not over-asserting direct kidney effects without localization data. In health, renal hemodynamics balance afferent and efferent arteriolar tone, with the tubuloglomerular feedback system coupling sodium delivery to afferent tone; GLP-1 receptors have variably been detected in vascular smooth muscle cells of afferent and efferent arterioles, juxtaglomerular cells, and some reports place them in proximal tubular epithelium, though expression levels are low and study-dependent, so I should be careful not to overstate uniformity across nephron segments [^113K7ZGo] [^113YcTLK].

> Now, I will examine direct tubular effects, and natriuresis is the most reproducible signal. GLP-1 receptor agonists promote natriuresis and diuresis in animal models and humans, plausibly via cAMP/PKA-dependent phosphorylation and trafficking of NHE3 at the proximal tubule brush border, which reduces sodium, bicarbonate, and fluid reabsorption; initially I thought this was universally sustained with chronic therapy, but wait, let me verify — some data suggest the natriuretic effect wanes with prolonged exposure to long-acting agents, whereas intermittent short-acting therapy like lixisenatide may sustain natriuresis for weeks, so the durability appears heterogeneous and may depend on receptor desensitization and compensatory transport changes [^113K7ZGo] [^114mqJnY].

> Next, I should review hemodynamic effects and tubuloglomerular feedback, and here I need to double-check the directionality because reports conflict. The classic concept is that proximal natriuresis increases distal sodium delivery to the macula densa, triggering afferent vasoconstriction and reducing intraglomerular pressure; however, acute studies show that in healthy or obese individuals, GLP-1 or GLP-1 receptor agonists can increase GFR and effective renal plasma flow, likely via NO-mediated afferent vasodilation, while longer-term studies in T2D generally do not show consistent effects on eGFR slope or glomerular hemodynamics, suggesting the hemodynamic impact is context- and time-dependent rather than a uniform anti-hyperfiltration effect akin to SGLT2 inhibitors [^112ojH9U] [^116prk8b] [^113K7ZGo].

> I will now examine indirect systemic effects that could translate into renoprotection. GLP-1 receptor agonists improve glycemic control, reduce weight by 3–5 kg on average, and lower systolic blood pressure by roughly 3–4 mmHg; mediation analyses from CVOTs indicate that these conventional risk factor improvements account for only about 10–25% of the kidney outcome benefits, so a substantial portion of the effect appears independent of glycemia, weight, and blood pressure, which strengthens the case for additional direct renal mechanisms [^114SJ6NW] [^113K7ZGo] [^1168HpuJ].

> Hold on, I should verify direct non-glycemic renal mechanisms because mechanistic plausibility matters. Preclinical and translational data suggest anti-inflammatory actions, including downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and RAGE signaling, polarization of macrophages toward an M2 phenotype, reduced oxidative stress, and anti-fibrotic effects; these pathways align with attenuation of diabetic kidney disease progression beyond hemodynamic changes, and emerging single-cell transcriptomic work in mice supports cell-type–specific transcriptional reprogramming in kidney endothelium, tubules, podocytes, and macrophages with liraglutide [^1168HpuJ] [^113XcJKL].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence across kidney function strata, and I need to ensure I weigh hard endpoints appropriately. In the FLOW trial of semaglutide in T2D with CKD and albuminuria, there was a significant reduction in a composite kidney outcome (HR ~0.76), along with reductions in MACE and all-cause mortality; importantly, the effect size was consistent across baseline eGFR strata, including those with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and pooled analyses show about a 19% reduction in composite kidney outcomes and a 12–18% reduction in MACE with GLP-1 receptor agonists, with low risk of serious adverse events and consistent effects regardless of concomitant SGLT2 inhibitor use, which argues for complementary rather than redundant mechanisms [^116QwNrK] [^113uKnKJ] [^115x6X23] [^114esczR] [^111RRs3w].

> I should confirm safety and dosing in CKD because clinical implementation hinges on tolerability and pharmacokinetics. Most GLP-1 receptor agonists do not require dose adjustment across eGFR ranges, including advanced CKD, though exenatide has historical label cautions due to case reports of AKI and higher exposure at low GFR. The predominant adverse effects are gastrointestinal and can be mitigated by starting low and titrating slowly, with KDIGO recommending slow titration to improve tolerability in CKD [^116TfYi8] [^1168ybci] [^111CtQ8E] [^112N17ew].

> But wait, what about combination therapy and how to position GLP-1 receptor agonists relative to SGLT2 inhibitors. The cardiorenal benefits appear largely independent and mechanistically complementary, with SGLT2 inhibitors offering stronger heart failure benefits and GLP-1 receptor agonists offering stronger atherothrombotic and stroke risk reduction; meta-analytic data show consistent kidney and cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonists irrespective of background SGLT2 inhibitor use, supporting sequential or combined therapy in high-risk patients, though head-to-head outcome trials are limited and cost and tolerability should guide sequencing [^116tekip] [^111RRs3w] [^114ELFDR].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating certainty. GLP-1 receptor agonists exert clinically meaningful renoprotection in T2D with CKD, with benefits that are only modestly explained by improved glycemia, weight, or blood pressure, implying direct renal actions including natriuresis, anti-inflammatory signaling, and possibly favorable but inconsistent hemodynamic modulation. The FLOW trial and multiple meta-analyses provide convergent evidence for reduced kidney failure, slower eGFR decline, and lower albuminuria, and current guidelines endorse GLP-1 receptor agonists with proven kidney and cardiovascular benefits in T2D with CKD, while acknowledging that some mechanistic pathways remain incompletely defined [^113uKnKJ] [^114esczR] [^115YhUZN] [^114N1afG].

---

GLP-1 receptor agonists improve kidney outcomes through **direct natriuretic effects** (via NHE3 inhibition) [^113K7ZGo] and **anti-inflammatory/anti-fibrotic actions** that reduce albuminuria and slow eGFR decline [^1168HpuJ] [^113uKnKJ]. They also lower blood pressure, weight, and glucose, indirectly benefiting the kidney [^112uj7jv]. Clinically, GLP-1 RAs reduce kidney failure, MACE, and all-cause mortality in people with T2D and CKD [^115x6X23], with benefits independent of glycemic control [^114quag9]. They are safe across CKD stages without dose adjustment, though gastrointestinal side effects are common [^116TfYi8] [^112N17ew]. Guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs for T2D with CKD to reduce kidney disease progression and cardiovascular risk [^115YhUZN] [^113W2Xqd].

## Physiological mechanisms of GLP-1 in the kidney

GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the kidney, including vascular smooth muscle, proximal tubules, and juxtaglomerular cells, enabling direct renal effects [^113K7ZGo] [^113QoCJG].

---

### Direct renal effects

- **Natriuresis and diuresis**: GLP-1 inhibits NHE3 in the proximal tubule, increasing sodium and water excretion and reducing intraglomerular pressure via tubuloglomerular feedback [^113K7ZGo] [^116prk8b].

- **Anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects**: GLP-1 signaling reduces renal inflammation and fibrosis, slowing CKD progression [^1168HpuJ] [^113XcJKL].

- **Modulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)**: GLP-1 RAs reduce angiotensin II and renin, lowering blood pressure and intraglomerular pressure [^113K7ZGo] [^114quag9].

---

### Indirect renal effects

Indirect renal effects include **improved glycemic control**, which reduces hyperglycemia-induced kidney injury [^114NXAda], and **blood pressure and weight reduction**, which lower intraglomerular pressure and albuminuria [^113uKnKJ].

---

## Clinical evidence of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney outcomes

Multiple large RCTs and meta-analyses demonstrate **kidney benefits** with GLP-1 RAs:

| **Study** | **Population** | **Kidney outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| FLOW (semaglutide) | T2D with CKD and albuminuria | - Reduced kidney failure, sustained ≥ 50% eGFR decline, or kidney death by 24% <br/> - Slowed eGFR decline by 1.16 mL/min/1.73 m²/year [^notfound] |
| LEADER (liraglutide) | T2D with high CV risk | - Reduced new or worsening nephropathy by 22% <br/> - Reduced persistent albuminuria progression [^11441H9T] |
| REWIND (dulaglutide) | T2D with CV risk | Reduced composite kidney outcome (≥ 40% eGFR decline, kidney failure, or kidney death) by 15% [^notfound] |
| Meta-analyses | T2D with CKD | - Reduced composite kidney outcomes by 18–24% <br/> - Reduced kidney failure and slowed eGFR decline [^114esczR] [^113uKnKJ] |

---

These benefits are **partially independent of glycemic control**, indicating direct renal mechanisms [^113K7ZGo].

---

## Safety and tolerability in chronic kidney disease

GLP-1 RAs are **generally safe across CKD stages**, with no dose adjustment required for most agents [^116TfYi8]. Common gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) are usually mild and self-limited; rare acute kidney injury has been reported, often related to dehydration or gastrointestinal losses [^1179Vyeg] [^117NANig].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs for T2D with CKD to reduce kidney disease progression and cardiovascular risk:

- **ADA 2025**: Initiate GLP-1 RAs with proven kidney benefit in T2D with CKD [^115YhUZN].

- **KDIGO 2024**: Prioritize GLP-1 RAs with proven cardiovascular benefits in T2D with CKD [^114N1afG].

- **Canadian Diabetes 2025**: Use GLP-1 RAs in T2D with diabetic nephropathy to reduce proteinuria and kidney function decline [^116h1KvS].

---

## Comparison with other glucose-lowering medications

Compared with other glucose-lowering agents, GLP-1 RAs provide **superior kidney outcomes** versus DPP-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and insulin, and are comparable or complementary to SGLT2 inhibitors, with distinct mechanisms and additive benefits when combined [^113uKnKJ] [^116VxGi2].

---

## Limitations and future research directions

Key limitations include the need for more **long-term data in advanced CKD**, better understanding of mechanisms, and evaluation of combination therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors or MRAs [^114ELFDR]. Ongoing trials (e.g. FLOW-Kidney) will clarify the role of GLP-1 RAs in non-diabetic CKD and advanced kidney disease [^1146UAqE].

---

GLP-1 receptor agonists improve kidney outcomes in T2D with CKD through natriuretic, anti-inflammatory, and hemodynamic effects, with benefits partially independent of glycemia. They are **safe across CKD stages** and recommended by guidelines to reduce kidney disease progression and cardiovascular risk [^112TtxQw].

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: nonglycemic clinical effects in weight loss and beyond [^112NAah8]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes since they mimic the actions of native GLP-1 on pancreatic islet cells, stimulating insulin release, while inhibiting glucagon release, in a glucose-dependent manner. The observation of weight loss has led to exploration of their potential as antiobesity agents, with liraglutide 3.0 mg day⁻¹ approved for weight management in the US on December 23, 2014, and in the EU on March 23, 2015. This review examines the potential nonglycemic effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Methods

A literature search was conducted to identify preclinical and clinical evidence on nonglycemic effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Results

GLP-1 receptors are distributed widely in a number of tissues in humans, and their effects are not limited to the well-recognized effects on glycemia. Nonglycemic effects include weight loss, which is perhaps the most widely recognized nonglycemic effect. In addition, effects on the cardiovascular, neurologic, and renal systems and on taste perception may occur independently of weight loss.

Conclusions

GLP-1 receptor agonists may provide other nonglycemic clinical effects besides weight loss. Understanding these effects is important for prescribers in using GLP-1 receptor agonists for diabetic patients, but also if approved for chronic weight management.

Renal glomerular effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists

It has been proposed that the abovementioned tubular effects on sodium handling by GLP-1 receptor agonists could also change glomerular hemodynamics by effecting tubuloglomerular feedback (Figure 2). Blocking sodium uptake in the proximal tubule leads to more sodium delivery to the macula densa, which in turn activates tubuloglomerular feedback, resulting in afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and a reduction in GFR. This was suggested by a study by Gutzwiller and colleagues, where creatinine clearance was reduced in hyperfiltering obese individuals. In addition, in an open-label, uncontrolled study, liraglutide was associated with an acute reduction in eGFR (paralleled by a reduction in albuminuria) and subsequent stabilization over time, which was reversible after a 3-week washout of the drug, suggesting a renal hemodynamic effect. Together with several case reports relating GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment of acute kidney injury, the renal safety of GLP-1 RA treatment was doubted. –

In the following years, several studies of renal hemodynamics have been performed with GLP-1 and GLP-1 receptor agonists using state-of-the-art inulin and para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) clearance techniques to measure GFR and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), respectively. In healthy individuals, acute GLP-1 infusion did not alter GFR or ERPF, however, exenatide infusion increased GFR, ERPF and estimated glomerular hydraulic pressure in overweight, but otherwise healthy, men. This increment in GFR and ERPF seemed to be caused by a reduction in estimated afferent renal arteriolar resistance, which was, at least in part, dependent on nitric oxide (NO) availability.

The situation may be different in people with T2D. Although initial reports suggested reductions of eGFR in people with T2D treated with liraglutide in an open-label study, this could not be confirmed in carefully designed subsequent studies. In randomized clinical trials of 12–30 weeks' duration, GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment did not influence initial changes in or the slope of eGFR in people with T2DM withor without renal impairment.

Conclusions and future perspectives: moving from safety to renoprotection

After the introduction of GLP-1 receptor agonists, concerns were expressed regarding their renal safety, with proposed dangers of acute kidney injury. Now, more than a decade later, it seems fair to conclude that GLP-1 receptor agonists are safe to administer to people with T2D with or without DKD. Moreover, trials in people with T2D at high risk for CVD have consistently shown reductions in albuminuria. It is important to keep in mind that these effects were independent of improvements in renal risk factors such as hyperglycemia, body weight and blood pressure. Given the doubt whether the GLP-1 receptor is expressed in the kidney, and that no glomerular/renal hemodynamic effects were demonstrated for this drug class, it remains uncertain how GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce albuminuria. Proposed mechanisms include (a) a reduction of inflammation or oxidative stress; (b) improved insulin sensitivity; (c) augmented mitochondrial function; (d) beneficial effects of systemic molecules; and (e) direct effects of GLP-1 on the tubular cell, independent of a receptor-mediated mechanism. Note that all these proposed mechanisms, except for the direct effects on tubular cells, could support either an effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on glomerular permselectivity to albumin, or an effect on tubular reabsorption of albumin.

It is too early to speculate on what role GLP-1 receptor agonists will play in the future treatment of DKD. The cardiovascular safety trials with GLP-1 receptor agonists were not designed to show benefit on hard renal outcomes due to included study populations, as well as the exploratory aspect of the renal endpoints. The trials show that GLP-1 receptor agonists consistently reduce albuminuria without affecting hard renal outcome; however, one should be careful not to draw premature conclusions. Soon, the FLOW trial (Semaglutide on the Progression of Renal Impairment in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease) [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03819153] will be initiated. In this trial, the effects of semaglutide in patients with albuminuria and declined eGFR will be studied for 5 years. The primary endpoint is persistent eGFR decline of > 50%, reaching end-stage renal disease, death from kidney disease or death from cardiovascular disease. This trial will show whether GLP-1 receptor agonists can be a useful tool for treatment of DKD.

Table 1
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and their license limitation as per renal function

eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate

Preclinical studies demonstrated GLP-1 receptor expression in the proximal tubular cells, glomeruli and vascular smooth muscle cells of kidney. However, the mechanisms for any potential renoprotective effect of GLP-1RA have yet to be established. Proposed mechanisms include renal tubular effects, a renal haemodynamic effect and reduction in renal oxidative stress. The renal tubular effects of GLP-1 are thought to be due to its natriuretic and diuretic properties. In both animal and human studies involving healthy subjects, as well as subjects with T2DM, GLP-1 infusion was shown to promote natriuresis and diuresis by inhibition of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) localized at the brush border of the renal proximal tubule. Infusion of lixisenatide, exenatide and liraglutide in people with T2DM has been shown to reduce urinary sodium reabsorption and increase proximal urinary sodium excretion. Evidence concerning the glomerular haemodynamic effects of GLP-1 are conflicting. Zhou et al. demonstrated that infusion of the GLP-1 RA liraglutide improved sodium and water handling and increased GFR in rats. However, human studies with lixisenatide, exenatide and liraglutide showed no effect on renal haemodynamics (GFR or renal blood flow). GLP-1 is also thought to have antioxidant properties. GLP-1RA knockout mice showed higher levels of albuminuria and more advanced mesangial expansion. Liraglutide administration in these mice delayed progression of DKD by a reduction in mesangial expansion and reduced levels of glomerular superoxide along with increased levels of renal nitric oxide. Some studies suggested that the renoprotective effect of GLP-1 is mediated by metabolites of innate GLP-1 such as GLP-1 (9–37) and GLP-1 (28–37). In the animal studies, GLP-1 metabolites did not have an effect on glucose metabolism but were associated with lowered expression of renal tubular injury markers and less tubulointerstitial damage by decreasing accumulation of macrophages and T cells in kidneys.

### GLP1R expression and kidney disease progression… [^115H4tXQ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

These findings support a nephroprotective role of GLP-1RAs. Importance Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists may have nephroprotective properties beyond those related to weight loss and glycemic control. Objective To investigate the association of genetically proxied GLP-1RAs with kidney disease progression. Our study assessed the association between genetically determined GLP1R gene expression in human tissues and kidney disease progression, leveraging the extensive biobank and genetic resources of the US Department of Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program. Through a survival analysis, we examined the association of this genetic proxy for GLP-1RAs with kidney disease progression, performing sequential adjustments and subgroup analyses to estimate the influence of its metabolic effects. Our results may help the design and interpretation of contemporary GLP-1RA clinical trials.

GLP-1RAs improve glycemic control, reduce body weight, and protect against kidney disease progression. 7 Our genetic findings support the hypothesis that higher GLP1R expression may have nephroprotective effects beyond outcomes related to weight loss and glycemic control. We studied naturally occurring genetic variation associated with systemic GLP1R expression and tested whether the same variants were also associated with a difference in kidney disease progression when examined on a population-wide scale. Critical to the interpretation of these findings is recognizing our focus on common genetic variants with small effect sizes, which reflected subtle but potentially meaningful associations with kidney disease progression. Our study extends these findings by examining the nephroprotective potential of GLP-1RAs across a broad population.

We demonstrated that higher genetic GLP1R expression was consistently associated with reduced kidney disease progression after adjusting for BMI and diabetes status. Subgroup analyses demonstrated similar presence and direction of associations in subgroups with healthy weight and without diabetes, indicating that these therapies could benefit a broader range of patients than currently recognized. Although larger sample sizes would be needed to detect statistically significant effects in these subgroups, our findings warrant further investigation and support the potential for broader clinical applications of GLP-1RAs. This genetic association study demonstrated that higher genetic GLP1R expression was associated with a small reduction in risk of kidney disease progression and supported a nephroprotective role of GLP-1RAs. Dedicated clinical trials to further validate the utility of GLP-1RAs in broader contexts are needed. Accepted for Publication: August 23, 2024.

### The incretin pathway as a therapeutic target in diabetic kidney disease: a clinical focus on GLP-1 receptor agonists [^115VSHpE]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Which other developments potentially lie ahead? First, the opportunity to combine a GLP-1 receptor agonist with other (glucose lowering) drugs that may affect renal outcomes. What first comes to mind, is the combination with SGLT2 inhibitors. Since the potential renoprotective pathways are very likely dissimilar, combination therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors might result in additive or even synergistic beneficial effects on renal outcomes. This hypothesis deserves future study. Second, the impressive results of novel coagonists of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and GLP-1 on body weight and glucose control suggest that these agents and other coagonist formulations impacting on the gut–renal axis could have a beneficial renal outcome.

### Kidney outcomes with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists versus other glucose-lowering agents in people with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world data [^11374fAA]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials showed that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) reduce kidney risk in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), prominently in those with chronic kidney disease. It is unclear whether these findings may apply to broader populations of patients with T2D treated in real-world settings and compared to active controls. We summarised real-world data of adverse kidney outcomes among patients with T2D initiating GLP-1 RA versus other glucose-lowering agents.

Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed and Embase for observational cohort studies (April 2005-January 2025; PROSPERO CRD42023405356). Initiators of GLP-1 RA were compared to sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i), sulfonylureas, or basal insulin. Outcomes included risks of albuminuria progression, ≥ 40 or ≥ 50% eGFR reduction from baseline, acute kidney injury (AKI), kidney-related hospitalizations, and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), per data availability. We synthesised the data using inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic hazard ratios (HR)s in random-effect models.

Results

Thirty-one studies were eligible, encompassing 1,601,389 patients (mean age 49–78 years, 5%-64% women), with 21, 6, 5, and 1 of them using SGLT2i, DPP4i, basal insulin, and sulfonylureas as a comparator, respectively. Compared with SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA initiators had higher risks for AKI (HR [95% CI] 1.12 [1.05–1.20]), kidney-related hospitalizations (1.66 [1.01–2.73]), and ≥ 40% reduction in eGFR (1.40 [1.27–1.53]), without evidence for differences in risks of ≥ 50% eGFR reduction or ESKD. Compared to DPP4i, GLP-1 RA initiators had lower risks for experiencing ≥ 50% eGFR reduction (0.84 [0.76–0.92]), kidney-related hospitalizations (0.73 [0.65–0.83]), and ESKD (0.70 [0.63–0.78]). Similar benefits were observed when comparing GLP-1 RA to sulfonylureas. Compared to basal insulin, GLP-1 RA initiation was associated with a lower risk of albuminuria progression (0.89 [0.80–0.99]), with inconsistent data regarding possible benefits in reducing ESKD risk.

Conclusions

In patients with T2D, initiation of GLP-1 RA in real-world settings may be associated with improved kidney outcomes compared to DPP4i, sulfonylureas, and basal insulin, and worse kidney outcomes compared to SGLT2i.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: nonglycemic clinical effects in weight loss and beyond [^113WvgVN]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Potential pleiotropic effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists beyond glycemia and weight loss

GLP-1 receptors are widely expressed in many tissues beyond the pancreas, including the gastrointestinal system, cardiovascular system, central nervous system and kidneys. Therefore, it is logical to assume that GLP-1 receptor agonists mediate multiple physiological effects, independent of their actions of improving glycemic control and stimulating weight loss (Figure 1).

### Influence of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on renal parameters: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117Puqp8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Considering that human blood pressure is an important factor influencing eGFR, blood pressure by GLP- 1RAs may greatly influences eGFR. Mediated analysis results from the SUSTAIN 6 and LEADER datasets suggest that HBA1c and systolic blood pressure (SBP) may partially account for the influence of semaglutide and liraglutide on the kidney, associated with established renal disease endpoints. GLP-1 RAs decrease SBP in individuals with T2DM and sharply reduce the circulating concentration of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (Ang II). Liraglutide significantly upregulated MAS1 in the glomeruli. The protein MAS1 encodes a signal receptor for angiotensin 1–7 (Ang1–7), which obeys a counter-regulatory pathway within the RAS, opposite to the vasoconstricting peptide, angiotensin II. In a study on the effect of liraglutide on rat renal function, ACE2 was upregulated after the application of liraglutide, and ACE2 degraded AngI 1–9 and Ang II into Ang1–7, which plays a vasodilatory role by interacting with MAS receptors. Simultaneously, this was accompanied by the upregulation of glomerular MAS1, suggesting that liraglutide may affect renal hemodynamics by counteracting the effects of AngII. The regulation of urinary sodium and diuresis is also an important mechanism underlying the regulation of blood volume by GLP-1 RAs. GLP-1R-mediated natriuresis and diuresis may involve the inhibition of NHE3, which is located at the brush border of the renal proximal tubule. Pharmacological doses of GLP-1 or GLP-1R agonists increase the phosphorylation of NHE3 at the PKA consensus sites Ser552 and Ser605. Decreasing both NHE3 surface distribution and Na+/K + ATPase activity is known as pressure natriuresis. In addition to direct natriuretic effects, GLP-1 RAs regulate the GLP-1 RA-ANP axis to play an indirect natriuretic role. The effect of GLP-1RAs on renal function is multifaceted, and hemodynamic changes are not the only factors affecting eGFR, which still needs to be confirmed in large clinical trials and animal tests.

### Impact of GLP-1 receptor agonist-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with CKD [^111ZJp9f]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis evaluates the effects of GLP-1 RA-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with or without CKD. In this report, we demonstrate that GLP-1 RAs reduce the absolute risk of MACE and renal outcomes regardless of CKD status. Importantly, these therapies maintain their protective effects even in patients with an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. There is no significant interaction with renal function, and the benefits of GLP-1 RAs remain consistent irrespective of the timing of patient inclusion in the trials.

GLP-1 RAs are well-documented for their ability to lower glucose levels, induce modest weight loss, and reduce blood pressure. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that binds GLP-1 receptors, which are found in multiple organ systems, such as digestive, cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Glucose-lowering effects are mediated by the stimulation of insulin release and the suppression of glucagon secretion, with a low risk of hypoglycemia. Beyond their metabolic effects, GLP-1 RAs also modulate inflammation, an increasingly important factor in the pathophysiology of diabetes. GLP-1 receptor activation plays a protective role against oxidative injury, which is particularly relevant to its cardiovascular and kidney protective effects.

Looking to the future

With the growing number of therapeutic options for people with T2DM, there is a need to better understand the optimal combination of treatments. There is strong evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists also reduce the risk of a range of cardiovascular events. The types of events prevented with GLP-1 receptor agonists, and time frames over which benefits accrue, highlight that the mechanism of cardioprotection with these agents is likely to be distinct from SGLT2 inhibitors and mediated mainly through anti-atherothrombotic effects. In contrast, SGLT2 inhibitors have greater benefits on HF and kidney outcomes, underscoring their unique haemodynamic effects. Additionally, GLP-1 receptor agonists are permitted for use down to an eGFR of 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in some regions, presenting an important treatment option for patients with advanced CKD. The contrasting mechanisms and benefits of these two classes of drugs raise the possibility that combination therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors could provide additive cardiovascular and kidney benefits. Short-term trials of semaglutide and dulaglutide suggest that combination treatment reduces HbA1c and body weight to a greater extent than SGLT2 inhibition alone, without additional safety concerns. However, randomized evidence on patient-level cardiovascular and kidney outcomes is currently lacking and a trial designed to test these agents in combination would be very valuable. In lieu of such trials, the uptake of SGLT2 inhibitors in routine clinical practice will mean that future randomized studies, including of GLP-1 receptor agonists, may well include substantial numbers of participants receiving SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, and thus provide indirect evidence on the effects of these drug classes used in combination.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: nonglycemic clinical effects in weight loss and beyond [^113fy76S]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

GLP-1 receptors are located throughout the body, and thus are likely to mediate multiple physiological effects, beyond glycemic control and weight loss. There is increasing evidence from preclinical and clinical studies to suggest that these agents may have a spectrum of beneficial effects, some of which may occur independently of glycemic effects and weight loss. Conversely, there may be some unfavorable effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists, but prescribers should be able to manage these medications by monitoring their patients and by prescribing judiciously.

GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease through their effects on blood-pressure reduction and the prevention of atherosclerosis, and they may also have a cardioprotective role. The heart-rate elevation may not be an adverse prognostic indicator, but further study is needed to determine the underlying mechanism driving this phenomenon. Cardiovascular outcome trials will, in any event, be the ultimate determinant of overall cardiovascular benefit or risk. There is evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists may have neuroprotective and renoprotective effects, although consideration of the latter should be balanced with reports of potentially adverse effects in the kidney, especially with exenatide.

Given their potential benefits beyond glycemic control and weight loss, GLP-1 receptor agonists may enhance the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity in the future. However, additional clinical studies are needed to further and fully elucidate the pleiotropic effects and potential benefits of these agents. Finally, clinicians must prescribe carefully to avoid potentially harmful effects, while providing opportunity for health improvement in their patients with type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related morbidities.

### Effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney and cardiovascular disease outcomes: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114esczR]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and can also have kidney benefits. However, whether GLP-1 receptor agonists improve clinically important kidney outcomes remains uncertain. We aimed to comprehensively assess the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney and cardiovascular disease outcomes by performing a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Methods

For this meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials that included at least 500 participants with type 2 diabetes, compared a GLP-1 receptor agonist with placebo with at least 12 months of follow-up, and reported a primary clinical kidney or cardiovascular outcome, from database inception to March 26, 2024. Post hoc, we included the SELECT trial (NCT03574597), which enrolled participants with cardiovascular disease and a BMI of 27 kg/m² or more without diabetes. Study-level summary data were extracted independently by two authors for inclusion in this random-effects analysis. The main kidney outcome was a composite outcome, consisting of kidney failure (kidney replacement therapy or a persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 mL/min per 1·73 m²), a sustained reduction in eGFR by at least 50% or the nearest equivalent, or death from kidney failure. The main cardiovascular outcome was MACE, consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024528864.

Findings

Of the 5140 records identified through the literature search, 11 trials, involving 85373 participants (29386 female, 55987 male), were included in the meta-analysis. In participants with type 2 diabetes (67769), GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced the composite kidney outcome by 18% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·82, 95% CI 0·73–0·93; I² = 26·41%), kidney failure by 16% (HR 0·84, 0·72–0·99; I² = 0%), MACE by 13% (HR 0·87, 0·81–0·93; I² = 49·75%), and all-cause death by 12% (HR 0·88, 0·83–0·93; I² = 0%). The effect on the composite kidney outcome (HR 0·81, 95% CI 0·72–0·92; I² = 23·11%), kidney failure (HR 0·84, 0·72–0·98; I² = 0%), MACE (HR 0·86, 0·80–0·92; I² = 48·9%), and all-cause death (HR 0·87, 0·82–0·91; I² = 0%) was similar when the SELECT trial was included, with no evidence of heterogeneity between this trial and those including participants with type 2 diabetes (p heterogeneity > 0·05). There was no difference in the risk of serious adverse events, including acute pancreatitis and severe hypoglycaemia, between the GLP-1 receptor agonist and placebo groups (risk ratio [RR] 0·95, 95% CI 0·90–1·01; I² = 88·5%). However, treatment discontinuation due to adverse events occurred more frequently in the GLP-1 receptor agonist groups (RR 1·51, 95% CI 1·18–1·94; I² = 96·3%).

Interpretation

We found evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists significantly reduce clinically important kidney events, kidney failure, and cardiovascular events.

### GLP-1 and the kidney: from physiology to pharmacology and outcomes in diabetes [^111Aq3FK]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2017). Medium credibility.

The gastrointestinal tract - the largest endocrine network in human physiology - orchestrates signals from the external environment to maintain neural and hormonal control of homeostasis. Advances in understanding entero-endocrine cell biology in health and disease have important translational relevance. The gut-derived incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is secreted upon meal ingestion and controls glucose metabolism by modulating pancreatic islet cell function, food intake and gastrointestinal motility, amongst other effects. The observation that the insulinotropic actions of GLP-1 are reduced in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) led to the development of incretin-based therapies - GLP-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors - for the treatment of hyperglycaemia in these patients. Considerable interest exists in identifying effects of these drugs beyond glucose-lowering, possibly resulting in improved macrovascular and microvascular outcomes, including in diabetic kidney disease. As GLP-1 has been implicated as a mediator in the putative gut-renal axis (a rapid-acting feed-forward loop that regulates postprandial fluid and electrolyte homeostasis), direct actions on the kidney have been proposed. Here, we review the role of GLP-1 and the actions of associated therapies on glucose metabolism, the gut-renal axis, classical renal risk factors, and renal end points in randomized controlled trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with T2DM.

Renal tubular effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists

Through their salutary effects on many identified renal risk factors like hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia, GLP-1 receptor agonists could favorably affect renal outcomes in people with T2D. On top of this, GLP-1 may also directly affect renal tubular function. GLP-1 infusion was shown to increase natriuresis and diuresis in rats. This was confirmed in studies in healthy volunteers, insulin-resistant obese males, and people with T2DM.GLP-1 receptor agonists showed similar tubular effects as native GLP-1, on acute intravenous infusion of exenatide in healthy malesand subjects with T2D. In addition, a single subcutaneous injection of liraglutide in people with T2D, increased both absolute and fractional sodium excretion. Most studies were of very short duration and it seems that this natriuretic effect disappears after prolonged exposure. This loss of natriuretic effect is compatible with the GLP-1 receptor desensitization that has been observed for other regulatory systems after prolonged treatment with long-acting GPL-1 receptor agonists. Alternatively, compensation by other renal sodium transporters prevents further renal sodium loss. On the other hand, data from our group suggest sustained natriuretic effects, for up to 8 weeks of treatment, of the short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist lixisenatide in insulin–glargine-treated patients with T2D. This may reflect preserved efficacy caused by intermittent GLP-1 receptor stimulation.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease: a narrative review of the key evidence with practical considerations [^1116pqvn]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are incretin-mimetic agents that are effective adjuncts in the treatment of diabetes. This class of medications is also associated with promoting weight loss and a low risk of hypoglycemia, and some have been shown to be associated with a significant reduction of major cardiovascular events. Mounting evidence suggests that GLP-1 RAs have benefits beyond reducing blood glucose that include improving kidney function in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), a common microvascular complication of T2DM. Several large clinical studies, the majority of which are cardiovascular outcome trials, indicate that GLP-1 RA therapy is safe and tolerable for people living with T2DM and compromised renal function, and also suggest that GLP-1 RAs may have renoprotective properties. Although evidence from clinical trials has shown GLP-1 RAs to be safe and efficacious in people living with T2DM and renal impairment, their use is uncommon in this patient population. With continuing developments in the field of GLP-1 RA therapy, it is important for physicians to understand the benefits and practical use of GLP-1 RAs, as well as the clinical evidence, in order to achieve positive patient outcomes. Here, we review evidence on GLP-1 RA use in people living with T2DM and CKD and summarize renal outcomes from clinical studies. We provide practical considerations for GLP-1 RA use to provide an added benefit to guide treatment in this high-risk patient population.

### Cardiovascular, kidney, and safety outcomes with GLP-1 receptor agonists alone and in combination with SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111RRs3w]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists and SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors both improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on clinical outcomes with and without SGLT2 inhibitors.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and Embase databases from inception until July 12, 2024, for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outcome trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes that reported treatment effects by baseline use of SGLT2 inhibitors, with findings supplemented by unpublished data. We estimated treatment effects by baseline SGLT2 inhibitor use using inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. The main cardiovascular outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) and hospitalization for heart failure. Kidney outcomes included a composite of ≥ 50% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, kidney failure or death caused by kidney failure, and annualized rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate slope). Serious adverse events and severe hypoglycemia were also evaluated. This meta-analysis was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42024565765).

Results

We identified 3 trials with 1743 of 17072 (10.2%) participants with type 2 diabetes receiving an SGLT2 inhibitor at baseline. GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events by 21% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.71–0.87]), with consistent effects in those receiving and not receiving SGLT2 inhibitors at baseline (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.54–1.09] and HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.71–0.87], respectively; P -heterogeneity = 0.78). The effect on hospitalization for heart failure was similarly consistent regardless of SGLT2 inhibitor use (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.36–0.93] and HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.63–0.85]; P -heterogeneity = 0.26). Effects on the composite kidney outcome (risk ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66–0.95]) and estimated glomerular filtration rate slope (0.78 mL/min/1.73 m²/y [95% CI, 0.57–0.98]) also did not vary according to SGLT2 inhibitor use (P -heterogeneity = 0.53 and 0.94, respectively). Serious adverse effects and severe hypoglycemia were also similar regardless of SGLT2 inhibitor use (P -heterogeneity = 0.29 and 0.50, respectively).

Conclusions

In people with type 2 diabetes, the cardiovascular and kidney benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonists are consistent regardless of SGLT2 inhibitor use.

### The potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: from randomised trials to clinical practice [^115kyHPx]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Dual agonists activating the GLP-1 receptor and the receptor of the other major hormone of the incretin system, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), are also in clinical development. Such and other combination therapies that integrate a GLP-1 RA and additional relevant compounds may hold additional potential. Results from the SURPASS programme for tirzepatide have shown that this dulaglutide-based GLP-1/GIP dual agonist provide profound glycaemic and weight-related benefits, which may translate into corresponding kidney-protection. Furthermore, the combination of the once-weekly GLP-1 RA semaglutide and the amylin analogue, cagrilintide, has displayed similar promising efficacy results on body weight that seem to go beyond what is achievable with semaglutide alone. Amylin clearance predominantly happens via the renal route, suggesting the effects of amylin, whether beneficial or risk-associated, could be more pronounced in people with CKD.

The current KDIGO guideline recommends blockade of the RAAS and SGLT-2 inhibitors in people with DKD. In addition, the American Diabetes Association now recommends finerenone in case of SGLT-2 inhibitor intolerance or inadequacy. Further expanding the treatment options for people with DKD, GLP-1 RA treatment may provide additional benefits (Figure 1), including body weight reduction. Recent evidence supports the safe combined use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAsand that the benefits of finerenone are independent of GLP-1 RA treatment in people with DKD. Thus, combined appropriate use of these three drug classes may offer added or even synergistic benefits to people with DKD.

In conclusion, data from clinical trials and real-world evidence suggest a potential kidney-protective effect of GLP-1 RAs in DKD as reflected by the prioritisation of the drug class in current treatment guidelines. Confirmatory and mechanistic trials are ongoing, which will provide additional insights, potentially allowing for the approved use of GLP-1 RAs to address the profound current unmet medical need for kidney protection in diabetes, alone or in combination with other treatment options.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: nonglycemic clinical effects in weight loss and beyond [^115oeDjq]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

It is well established that obesity is a risk factor for a range of comorbid conditions, including type 2 diabetes and hypertension, both of which contribute to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the US, diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of CKD. Preclinical studies indicate that the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce risk factors of diabetic nephropathy, thereby offering renoprotection. Various diabetic rodent models have demonstrated that administration of GLP-1 receptor agonists inhibits the development of hypertension, reduces urine albumin levels, and leads to histological improvements in renal morphology.

Although some of these renoprotective benefits may have been the result of the improved glycemic control and/or weight loss, it is likely that GLP-1 receptor agonists also have direct effects on renal function. For example, GLP-1 appears to offer renoprotection through its actions on systemic blood pressure and kidney hemodynamics. One small clinical study demonstrated that a 3-h GLP-1 infusion decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 6% in obese, insulin-resistant men, but did not affect GFR in healthy men. The authors concluded that reduction of glomerular hyperfiltration was related, via tubuloglomerular feedback, to the direct effect of GLP-1 in promoting sodium excretion in the renal tubule. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are often associated with increased tubular sodium resorption, which may lead to hypertension. The findings of this study, together with data from rodent studies, suggest that the actions of GLP-1 and GLP-1 receptor agonists may be more prominent in individuals with obesity/diabetes than in healthy individuals, and protect the kidney damage from the effects of volume expansion, glomerular hyperfiltration, and systemic hypertension.

### Efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors with and without glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists: a SMART-C collaborative meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116VxGi2]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists both improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. We sought to evaluate whether the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are consistent in patients receiving and not receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Methods

We conducted a collaborative meta-analysis of trials included in the SGLT2 Inhibitor Meta-Analysis Cardio-Renal Trialists' Consortium, restricted to participants with diabetes. Treatment effects from individual trials were obtained from Cox regression models and pooled using inverse variance weighted meta-analysis. The two main cardiovascular outcomes assessed included major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death), and hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death. The main kidney outcomes assessed were chronic kidney disease progression (≥ 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], kidney failure [eGFR < 15 mL/min/1·73 m², chronic dialysis, or kidney transplantation], or death due to kidney failure), and the rate of change in eGFR over time. Safety outcomes were also assessed.

Findings

Across 12 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, 3065 (4·2%) of 73238 participants with diabetes were using GLP-1 receptor agonists at baseline. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in participants both receiving and not receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists (hazard ratio [HR] 0·81, 95% CI 0·63–1·03 vs 0·90, 0·86–0·94; p-heterogeneity = 0·31). Effects on hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death (0·76, 0·57–1·01 vs 0·78, 0·74–0·82; p-heterogeneity = 0·90) and chronic kidney disease progression (0·65, 0·46–0·94 vs 0·67, 0·62–0·72; p-heterogeneity = 0·81) were also consistent regardless of GLP-1 receptor agonist use, as was the effect on the chronic rate of change in eGFR over time (heterogeneity = 0·92). Fewer serious adverse events occurred with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with placebo, irrespective of GLP-1 receptor agonist use (relative risk 0·87, 95% CI 0·79–0·96 vs 0·91, 0·89–0·93; p-heterogeneity = 0·41).

Interpretation

The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes are consistent regardless of the background use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. These findings suggest independent effects of these evidence-based therapies and support clinical practice guidelines recommending the use of these agents in combination to improve cardiovascular and kidney metabolic outcomes.

### The potential for renoprotection with incretin-based drugs [^111bFx5J]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Incretin-based drugs, i.e., glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, are widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In addition to the primary role of incretins in stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, they have extra pancreatic functions beyond glycemic control. Indeed, recent studies highlight the potential beneficial effects of incretin-based therapy in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Experimental studies using various diabetic models suggest that incretins protect the vascular endothelium from injury by binding to GLP-1 receptors, thereby ameliorating oxidative stress and the local inflammatory response, which reduces albuminuria and inhibits glomerular sclerosis. In addition, there is some evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors mediate sodium excretion and diuresis to lower blood pressure. The pleiotropic actions of DPP-4 inhibitors are ascribed primarily to their effects on GLP-1 signaling, but other substrates of DPP-4, such as brain natriuretic peptide and stromal-derived factor-1α, may have roles. In this review, we summarize recent studies of the roles of incretin-based therapy in ameliorating DKD and its complications.

### Decision algorithm for prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists for diabetic kidney disease [^115irih6]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease and its comorbid conditions, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, diabetes, and obesity, are interconnected conditions that compound the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular mortality, and exponentiate health care costs. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) are novel diabetes medications that prevent cardiovascular events and kidney failure. Clinical trials exploring the cardiovascular and kidney outcomes of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA have fundamentally shifted the treatment paradigm of diabetes. Clinical guidelines for diabetes management recommend a more holistic approach beyond glycemic control and emphasize heart and kidney protection of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA. However, the adoption of prescribing SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA for patients with diabetes and high cardiovascular and kidney risk has been slow. In this review, we provide a decision-making tool to help clinicians determine when to consider SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA for heart and kidney protection. First, we discuss a comprehensive risk assessment for patients with diabetic kidney disease. We compare the effectiveness of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA for different risk categories. Then, we present a decision algorithm using cardiovascular and kidney failure risk stratification and the strength of current evidence for the use of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA. Lastly, we review the adverse effects of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA and propose mitigation strategies.

Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) decrease blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, reducing gastric emptying, reducing appetite and promoting satiety. Currently, there are six GLP-1RA injectables [exenatide (bid daily), exenatide (once weekly), lixisenatide (once daily), liraglutide (once daily), dulaglutide (once weekly) and semaglutide (once weekly)] approved in Europe and the USA and one GLP-1RA oral formulation (semaglutide) in the USA. A further one (albiglutide), has never been launched in the UK and was withdrawn from global use in 2018. Three GLP-1RAs are mainly eliminated by the kidneys and the remaining ones by peptidases and the kidneys. Therefore, all have license limitations based on the stages of CKD (Table 1).

### Impact of GLP-1 receptor agonist-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with CKD [^117RAtK4]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes has not been systematically reviewed across baseline kidney function groups. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (RAs) in patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

We performed a PubMed/Medline search of randomized, placebo-controlled, event-driven outcome trials of GLP-1 RAs versus placebo in patients with and without diabetes from inception to January 2025. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure, CKD progression, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The relative risk (RR) was estimated using a random-effects model.

Results

Nine RCTs were included with a total of 75,088 patients, including 17,568 with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. Use of an GLP-1 RA in patients with CKD was associated with a lower incidence of MACE (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.74–0.95; P 0.006) and of CKD progression (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.94; P 0.002), compared with placebo. There was no differential treatment effect of GLP-1 RA on these endpoints by CKD status at baseline.

Conclusions

GLP-1 RAs offer substantial cardiovascular and renal protection in patients with CKD. These findings support their use in CKD patients and confirms that these therapies may be continued as kidney function declines.

### Mechanisms and clinical applications of incretin therapies for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^113K7ZGo]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Characterization of GLP-1 receptors in the kidney has been technically challenging, so exact localization remains under investigation. To-date, GLP-1 receptor mRNA and protein have been detected in vascular smooth muscle cells of afferent arterioles, efferent arterioles, hilar interlobular and arcuate arteries, juxtaglomerular cells, and proximal tubular epithelial cells in human kidneys with variations observed in different studies. GLP-1 receptor agonists increase natriuresis and diuresis, as shown in experimental models of healthy human volunteers, and persons with obesity or diabetes. A proposed mechanism behind this effect is inhibition of sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3-mediated transport in the proximal tubule. Binding of GLP-1 or GLP-1 receptor agonists activates the cAMP/Protein kinase A signaling pathway with phosphorylation of sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 resulting in reduction in sodium, bicarbonate, and fluid reabsorption in the proximal tubule. As such, diuresis and resultant blood pressure lowering could contribute to benefits of these agents on the kidney and cardiovascular system. However, in a mediation analysis of kidney disease outcomes (macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 45 mL/min/1.73m 2, kidney failure) from cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) of liraglutide and semaglutide, lower glycemia or blood pressure only moderately mediated (10–25%) these effects, pointing to direct actions on the kidney as a predominant mechanism. Other GLP-1 effects may include endothelial-derived nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation in the kidney and decreased circulating renin and angiotensin II concentrations. In contrast, GIP receptors have not been detected in the kidney, suggesting that the kidney protective effects of GIP agonism are indirectly mediated.

Despite demonstrating benefits beyond blood glucose control, GLP-1 RAs are not yet commonly prescribed in people living with T2DM and CKD. The purpose of this review is to summarize the clinical evidence regarding the effect of GLP-1 RAs on renal outcomes in people living with T2DM and CKD and to provide an overview of the practical aspects of use of these compounds that include specific considerations for this high-risk patient population.

Moreover, acute administration of GLP-1, exenatideor liraglutide, or 12 weeks of liraglutide treatmentdid not affect fasting renal hemodynamics or estimated glomerular pressure in people with T2D and presumed single-nephron hyperfiltration (i.e. filtration fraction of ~25% in the setting of GFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m²). Also, 12 weeks of liraglutide versus placebo in albuminuric patients with T2D did not significantly affect GFR. Finally, 8 weeks of lixisenatide treatment versus insulin–glulisine, did not alter postprandial renal hemodynamics in people with T2D.

In conclusion, GLP-1 receptor agonists seem to induce glomerular hyperfiltration under physiological conditions by reducing afferent arteriolar resistance, but do not significantly alter renal hemodynamic function in people with T2D and normal kidney function, who may be more resistant to the direct, partly NO-mediated, vasodilator effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists. All in all, there is insufficient evidence to support GLP-1 receptor agonists ameliorating hyperfiltration, in analogy to SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor signaling modifies the extent of diabetic kidney disease through dampening the receptor for advanced glycation end products-induced inflammation [^113XcJKL]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone produced and released by cells of the gastrointestinal tract following meal ingestion. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) exhibit kidney-protective actions through poorly understood mechanisms. Here we interrogated whether the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) plays a role in mediating the actions of GLP-1 on inflammation and diabetic kidney disease. Mice with deletion of the GLP-1 receptor displayed an abnormal kidney phenotype that was accelerated by diabetes and improved with co-deletion of RAGE in vivo. Activation of the GLP-1 receptor pathway with liraglutide, an anti-diabetic treatment, downregulated kidney RAGE, reduced the expansion of bone marrow myeloid progenitors, promoted M2-like macrophage polarization and lessened markers of kidney damage in diabetic mice. Single cell transcriptomics revealed that liraglutide induced distinct transcriptional changes in kidney endothelial, proximal tubular, podocyte and macrophage cells, which were dominated by pathways involved in nutrient transport and utilization, redox sensing and the resolution of inflammation. The kidney-protective action of liraglutide was corroborated in a non-diabetic model of chronic kidney disease, the subtotal nephrectomised rat. Thus, our findings identify a novel glucose-independent kidney-protective action of GLP-1-based therapies in diabetic kidney disease and provide a valuable resource for exploring the cell-specific kidney transcriptional response ensuing from pharmacological GLP-1R agonism.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists' impact on cardio-renal outcomes and mortality in T2D with acute kidney disease [^112LxZMj]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The cardioprotective effects of GLP-1 RAs in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, alongside associated reductions in cardiovascular risk factors, such as glycated hemoglobin level and BMI are now further elucidated by our findings. Our study supports the efficacy of GLP-1 RAs in reducing cardiovascular events among individuals with concurrent type 2 diabetes and AKD, highlighting their role in the complex management of these comorbid conditions.

Several cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have also reported that GLP-1 RAs may be associated with mitigating kidney-related outcomes, including albuminuria, decline in eGFR and the risk of end-stage kidney disease, independent of their effects on glycemic control. The recent FLOW trial, focusing on individuals with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, suggests that GLP-1 RAs can slow CKD progression. Our study provides additional real-world evidence for the renoprotective effect of GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes and AKD. We further notice that GLP-1 RA users had a slower eGFR decline, implying a possible effect on kidney function. However, our findings don't directly confirm this, highlighting the necessity for further dedicated studies.

The mechanisms behind the renoprotective effects of GLP-1 RAs involve anti-albuminuric, anti-inflammatory, natriuresis, anti-atherogenic, and anti-oxidant effects through protein kinase A signaling, induction of natriuresis by inhibiting sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3, and a reduction in hyperfiltration. Noteworthily, we observed that long-acting GLP-1 RAs offer more pronounced benefits, potentially due to their sustained pharmacological action, suggesting a dependency on pharmacokinetic profiles for maximal therapeutic impact. In contrast, while short-acting GLP-1 RAs did not show significant effects on MAKE in our cohort, it is important to note that lixisenatide has shown kidney benefits in the ELIXA trial. This discrepancy underscores the complexity of translating clinical trial results into broader patient populations and suggests that the impact of short-acting GLP-1 RAs on kidney outcomes may vary depending on specific clinical contexts.

The GLP-1 RA drug class

GLP-1 is a hormone of the incretin system and is secreted from the L-cells of the intestines upon food intake. The biology of the hormone has been comprehensively reviewed by others. Briefly (Figure 1), GLP-1 receptors are present in many tissues; however, their current therapeutic use in diabetes primarily exploits the ability of GLP-1 to reduce blood glucose by potentiating insulin release and by reducing glucagon secretion, both in a blood glucose-dependent manner. Furthermore, because GLP-1 increases satiety via effects in the brain, the drug class has also been developed for weight management, that is, weight reduction and maintenance in people with obesity or overweight. The half-life of endogenous GLP-1 is short (1–2 min), mainly due to the rapid degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). The pharmacological use of GLP-1 has been made possible by the discovery of the exendin-4 peptide in the Gila monster; this peptide activates the human GLP-1 receptor but is resistant to DPP-IV-mediated degradation. In addition, human native GLP-1 has been modified using recombinant technologies to also resist DPP-IV degradation and, for example, to facilitate the formation of circulating albumin-bound depots for even longer durations of action following subcutaneous (s.c.) or oral administration.

Figure 1.
Potential kidney-protective and other effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Chronic kidney disease can have multiple causes, including those associated with diabetes, such as chronic hyperglycaemia, overweight or obesity, chronic inflammation and hypertension. GLP-1 RA treatment improves glycaemic control, and reduces, body weight, inflammation and hypertension. These effects are suggested to help prevent or attenuate progression of kidney disease. GLP-1 RA therapy may also address chronic kidney disease directly, and can also impact several other tissues and organs, including the heart and vasculature, as well as the brain, liver, pancreas and others. Dashed arrows indicate putative effects and actions; full-line arrows indicate well-established effects of GLP-1 RAs on key target organs and tissues.

### GLP-1 RAs and cardiovascular and kidney outcomes by body mass index in type 2 diabetes [^112SAJvY]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) associated with cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes, and do these associations differ by body mass index (BMI)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 97 156 adults with type 2 diabetes, use of GLP-1 RAs was associated with significantly lower risks of major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure among patients with BMI of 25 or greater. Kidney benefits associated with GLP-1 RAs were consistent across BMI categories.

Meaning

These findings suggest that cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1 RAs may be modified by BMI, while kidney benefits were consistent regardless of BMI, supporting individualized treatment decisions in type 2 diabetes care.

1 Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) worldwide. The risk for CKD onset and progression in patients with T2D remains high even under optimal evidence‐based treatment, which includes lifestyle modification, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and non‐steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs).

Emerging data support the role of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RA) in improving kidney outcomes in patients with T2D. The FLOW trial has demonstrated that semaglutide improves kidney outcomes in patients with T2D and CKD with albuminuria. Most trials that compared GLP‐1 RA and placebo in patients with T2D at high cardiovascular risk and mostly preserved kidney function found that GLP‐1 RAs improve cardiovascular outcomes and prevent the onset of new macroalbuminuria. Whether treatment with GLP‐1 RAs mitigates the loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in these populations was less certain – some studies, but not others, found a preservation of kidney function with GLP‐1 RA versus placebo. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these kidney effects can be extrapolated from randomized controlled trials (RCT)s to real‐world settings, often including patients with lower cardiovascular and kidney risk profiles. Furthermore, these studies assessed the treatment effects of GLP‐RA compared with placebo; it is unclear whether such kidney effects exist when compared with an active comparator.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis assessed the association between initiating GLP‐1 RA, versus other glucose‐lowering agents (GLAs), and adverse kidney outcomes, in patients with T2D treated in real‐world settings.

Liraglutide is fully degraded elsewhere in the body and the kidneys are not a major organ of elimination; in single dosing there is no effect on the area under the curve in subjects with stages 4 and 5 CKD, but the manufacturer recommends avoiding this medicine when GFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### Influence of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on renal parameters: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114NXAda]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes has become widespread, with approximately 463 million people diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) over recent years. By 2045, diabetes will affect at least 700 million people. Approximately 25–30% of patients with type 2 DM (T2DM) will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes is currently the primary cause of end-stage kidney disease requiring kidney replacement therapy. Patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) often have high rates of cardiovascular events, hospitalizations, infections, and mortality.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are the most commonly used drugs for treating diabetes. Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that clinical chronic renal events can be decreased by intensive glucose control, blood pressure decline, and the renin-angioten-sin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonized by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Even with recommended RAAS blockers, patients with DKD are at a substantial risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A previous study has reported that, the use of medications such as GLP-1RAs and SGLT2i delays or minimizes microvascular and macrovascular damage.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains the main cause for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) worldwide. Both CKD and ESKD lead to major increases in risk of cardiovascular disease and death in people with diabetes. Despite optimal management of lifestyle, glucose levels and hypertension, residual risk remains high, indicating that additional therapies to mitigate the burden of the disease are desired. In past decades, new treatment options for the management of diabetes have emerged, of which some have showed promising renoprotective potential. This review discusses current understanding of the renal effects of glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists and their potential use in prevention and treatment of DKD.

The most significant HbA1c decrease occurred within the first 4 months and stabilized after 8 months, while weight reduction persisted through 16 to 20 months. Patients treated with tirzepatide added to insulin had less eGFR decline10, 41 and proteinuria progression and fewer composite kidney end points compared with the insulin group. 10 These findings align with studies on selective GLP-1 agonists. 42 Notably, our study is the first, to our knowledge, to directly compare the association with kidney outcomes between tirzepatide and selective GLP-1 RAs.

Preclinical studies suggested that GIP may attenuate local adipose tissue inflammation and reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels, 43 which may act favorably on the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. 44 On the other hand, GLP-1 receptors are present on preglomerular vascular smooth muscle, glomerular. and tubular cells and, thus, may directly affect the kidney. 45, 46 Proposed mechanisms include afferent arteriole vasodilation, proximal tubular diuresis, and inhibition of glomerular hyperfiltration. 45, 47 Importantly, pharmacokinetic studies showed that tirzepatide exposure was not significantly. affected by kidney function impairment48 and represented a viable therapy for patients with stage 4 and 5 CKD, for whom few options existed. 49 Treatment with tirzepatide or a GLP-1 RA might pose a risk of AKI due to dehydration from gastrointestinal adverse effects.

50, 51 Although our analysis found a lower hazard of AKI in the tirzepatide group compared with the GLP-1 RA group, this result should be interpreted with caution since we could not identify the cause of these AKI events or their chronologic association with tirzepatide or GLP-1 RA use. Our findings also provide directions for future research in other target populations. The observational nature of our data precluded inference of causality, which might be confirmed in future research, such as in ongoing RCTs evaluating the efficacy of tirzepatide in improving cardiovascular and kidney outcomes compared with GL.

### Outcomes in new user cohorts of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^116P5gCb]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally. People with T2D have a high prevalence and incidence of CKD, which presents an increased risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and death. Cardiovascular complications are an especially relevant concern for individuals with both diabetes and CKD. The treatment approach for people with CKD is multidisciplinary, with the aim being primarily to slow the progression of disease to avoid dialysis or kidney transplantation and secondarily to reduce the cardiovascular risk that accompanies CKD. Currently available therapies with demonstrated benefits on cardiovascular events and kidney outcomes among patients with T2D include sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (ns-MRAs). Among the latter class, finerenone is the drug with more robust and well-documented evidence supporting cardiovascular and kidney benefits among patients with CKD and T2D; finerenone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2022 specifically to prevent CKD disease progression and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD associated with T2D.

The 2022 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines recommend SGLT2i as first-line therapy as part of a comprehensive management approach for people with T2D and CKD with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 20 ml/min per 1.73 m². A growing body of clinical trial evidence suggests a protective effect of GLP-1 RA on cardiorenal outcomes compared with placebo or with standard of care; indeed, the first GLP-1 RA was recently approved by the US FDA for reducing the risk of worsening kidney disease and cardiovascular death in patients with T2D and CKD. While KDIGO guidelines do not explicitly recommend the use of GLP-1 RA as first-line therapy for CKD in T2D, KDIGO's comprehensive risk reduction strategy includes GLP-1 RA as an additional therapy option for patients at risk of insufficient glycemic control. Systematic reviews and network meta-analyses of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i in patients with T2D concluded that both medication classes have cardiovascular and kidney benefits but with notable differences in benefits and harms.

### Combining GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a scoping review and expert insights for clinical practice utilizing the nominal group technique [^112JqVMB]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Benefits of Combining SGLT2 Inhibitors with GLP-1 Receptor Agonists on Metabolic Outcomes

The experts agreed that both medications operate through distinct mechanisms, resulting in a complementary pharmacodynamic effect related to insulin resistance, hemodynamic factors, and inflammatory pathways.

The data analysis from the scoping review indicates that the impact of combined use on glucose control is more pronounced than the effect on weight reduction. Additionally, sequential use of the medications, starting with GLP-1 receptor agonists, appears to lead to more significant weight loss.

Finally, summarizing the data on metabolic outcomes is challenging because of significant variability in effects. Nonetheless, the net effect from the meta-analysis supports the combined therapy, although it exhibits considerable heterogeneity and includes very few studies.

Benefits of Combining SGLT2 Inhibitors with GLP-1 Receptor Agonists on Cardiovascular Outcomes

The summarized information indicates that the evidence from primary prevention studies is less robust than that derived from secondary prevention studies. Additionally, the effects of combined therapy appear to differ between major cardiovascular events and heart failure-related outcomes.

The experts concurred that the differences in the action mechanisms may partially explain these results and could also help mitigate the undesirable cardiovascular physiological effects such as the increase of heart rate.

Finally, a discussion emerged regarding a specific population that may significantly benefit from combined therapy: individuals with obesity and T2D and high or very high cardiovascular risk or obesity.

Benefits of Combining SGLT2 Inhibitors with GLP-1 Receptor Agonists on Renal Outcomes

Experts believe that one of the main challenges surrounding kidney outcomes is the lack of consensus on the definition of composite outcomes used in different studies. Several competing risks may hinder the identification of positive results in kidney trials, particularly cardiovascular outcomes. Furthermore, the benefits observed in surrogate outcomes may stem from changes in glucose control, weight reduction, or alterations in blood pressure, complicating results analyses.

Despite the contradictory data regarding kidney outcomes, two surrogate outcomes benefit the most from combined therapy: the decline in eGFR slope and the reduction in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio.

### Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and cardiometabolic protection: historical development and future challenges [^117XxFLr]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Future directions for GLP-1RAs in CKD include understanding their potential direct effects on the kidney and immune system, independent of metabolic improvements such as weight loss and glycemic control. Mechanistic studies, such as those using single-cell transcriptomics and spatial metabolite localization, aim to map molecular changes after treatment and identify pathways activated or inhibited by GLP-1RAs. These findings may lead to more targeted and personalized therapies for CKD. In addition, expanding clinical trials to evaluate the long-term benefits of GLP-1RAs, including their use in non-diabetic CKD populations, will be critical. Given the global burden of CKD, translation of these findings into accessible and cost-effective public health strategies is essential. Multidisciplinary collaborations will play a key role in translating these advances into comprehensive care for CKD patients.

### Renoprotection in diabetic kidney disease: can incretin-based therapies deliver? [^1155nMmS]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Incretin-based therapies mimic or augment the gut-hormone glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and, due to their glucose-lowering potential and beneficial safety profile, as well as their cardiovascular safety and/or protection, are prescribed on a large scale to treat individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, whether the two drug-classes that belong to this category, respectively GLP-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, also reduce the risk of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is at present heavily debated. This review aims to discuss the current evidence.

Recent Findings

Evidence from land-mark cardiovascular safety trials, conducted in people with T2D at high-cardiovascular risk but with normal kidney function, suggest that both drug-classes have excellent renal safety profiles. In contrast to DPP-4 inhibitors, it seems that GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce albuminuria and possibly induce a reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate decline. However, the trials were not properly designed to test renal outcomes.

Summary

A dedicated renal trial involving a GLP-1 receptor agonist has recently commenced and will answer the question whether these drugs will be effective to reduce DKD. Moreover, ongoing mechanism-of-action studies are focusing on the renal physiological effects of GLP-1, as the effects on particularly albuminuria reduction remain currently unexplained.

### Cardiorenal protection with the newer antidiabetic agents in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115uKkyx]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health problem, resulting in significant cardiovascular and kidney adverse outcomes worldwide. Despite the widespread use of standard-of-care therapies for CKD with T2D over the past few decades, rates of progression to end-stage kidney disease remain high with no beneficial impact on its accompanying burden of cardiovascular disease. The advent of the newer classes of antihyperglycemic agents, including SGLT2 (sodium glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, has changed the landscape of therapeutic options for patients with CKD with T2D, with demonstration of significant reductions in cardiovascular adverse events and progression to end-stage kidney disease. Several potential mechanisms exist through which these beneficial effects are achieved in both drug classes, which may be independent of their antihyperglycemic effects. This scientific statement summarizes the current literature on the cardiorenal protective effects with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with CKD and T2D. It reviews potential mechanistic pathways that may drive these benefits and summarizes the literature on adverse effects in patients with CKD and T2D at risk for or with established cardiovascular disease. Last, it provides practical guidance on a proposed collaborative care model bridging cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, and primary care physicians to facilitate the prompt and appropriate integration of these therapeutic classes in the management of patients with T2D and CKD.

### Incretin drugs in diabetic kidney disease: biological mechanisms and clinical evidence [^1168HpuJ]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

As the prevalence of diabetes continues to climb, the number of individuals living with diabetic complications will reach an unprecedented magnitude. The emergence of new glucose-lowering agents - sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and incretin therapies - has markedly changed the treatment landscape of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition to effectively lowering glucose, incretin drugs, which include glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, can also reduce blood pressure, body weight, the risk of developing or worsening chronic kidney disease and/or atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, and the risk of death. Although kidney disease events have thus far been secondary outcomes in clinical trials, an ongoing phase III trial in patients with diabetic kidney disease will test the effect of a GLP1R agonist on a primary kidney disease outcome. Experimental data have identified the modulation of innate immunity and inflammation as plausible biological mechanisms underpinning the kidney-protective effects of incretin-based agents. These drugs block the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of kidney damage, including the activation of resident mononuclear phagocytes, tissue infiltration by non-resident inflammatory cells, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules. GLP1R agonists and DPP4 inhibitors might also attenuate oxidative stress, fibrosis and cellular apoptosis in the kidney.

### Outcomes in new user cohorts of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112g2Gnr]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this multinational, multidatabase study of patients with CKD and T2D, IRs of clinical outcomes were described in users of SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA — antidiabetic medications with cardiorenal protective effects — using data from 2012 to 2019 before these effects were widely recognized or the medications were approved for these indications. The study was not designed to compare medication effects across the two cohorts, and it was noted that across all data sources and at baseline, new users of GLP-1 RA had a different baseline clinical profile from that of new users of SGLT2i. Understanding the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes and kidney failure in patients receiving antidiabetic medications with cardiorenal protective effects is a first step in designing future studies to compare the incidence of these outcomes related to new and existing treatments for CKD.

### The potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: from randomised trials to clinical practice [^114quag9]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms of action

Currently, the mechanisms of action underlying the potential kidney-protective benefits of GLP-1 RAs in DKD are not fully elucidated (Figure 1). It has been speculated that the beneficial effects on CKD risk factors, such as blood glucose, systolic blood pressure and body weight indirectly improve kidney function, and mediation analyses using data from the LEADER, SUSTAIN 6 and REWIND CVOTs suggest that these effects partially, but only to a minor extent, explain the potential kidney benefits of GLP-1 RAs. Nevertheless, considering the importance of obesity/overweight in CKD, and that SGLT2 inhibitors only modestly reduce body weight, the weight-reducing benefit of GLP-1 RAs may arguably be of importance in the management of CKD. In AWARD-7, a clinical benefit on kidney function (attenuated eGFR decline) of dulaglutide was observed even though glycaemic equipoise was ensured using an active comparator (insulin glargine), indicating that the kidney benefit was not driven by improvements in glycaemic control.

Multiple direct actions have been suggested, including reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress and improved kidney oxygenation or perfusion; however, only a few smaller non-clinical and clinical studies have explored this. Furthermore, these studies have primarily focussed on the acute-phase response immediately after GLP-1 exposure in the setting of normal kidney function with or without diabetes.

While the effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs on oxidative stress have only been sparsely studied, accumulating evidence are available to suggest that GLP-1 RAs reduce systemic inflammation and that semaglutide specifically down-regulate the expression of several pro-inflammatory genes. – Additional studies are warranted to investigate whether the potential anti-inflammatory effects of GLP-1 receptor agonism may in fact play a role in the potential kidney-protective benefit of the GLP-1 RA drug class or certain of the specific compounds.

Changes in kidney haemodynamics induced by GLP-1 RAs might depend on baseline kidney function and these observations have not been consistent across studies. – In the acute phase, GLP-1 RA therapy has been shown to induce natriuresis, and the increased salt delivery in the distal nephron could reduce intraglomerular pressure via tubular glomerular feedback. Moreover, the compounds also suppress angiotensin II and renin, – thereby modulating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). The relevance of these findings is not fully established, however, and should be investigated in mechanistic clinical trials.

Despite these benefits, it remains unclear whether the protective effects on specific organs result from direct receptor activation or are indirectly driven by systemic health improvements, such as weight loss. For instance, GLP-1R is expressed at low levels in the heart and blood vessels. In the kidney, they are localized to a subset of vascular smooth muscle cells but are absent from glomerular epithelial or tubular cells. Similarly, in the liver, hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and stellate cells lack canonical GLP-1R expression. These gaps emphasize the need for targeted research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and unlock the full therapeutic potential of GLP-1RAs. Addressing these challenges will require a combination of preclinical and clinical studies to validate findings and ensure broad applicability.

Beyond their initial role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), GLP-1RAs have evolved into versatile therapies with benefits in conditions such as obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and metabolic liver disease. The interrelationship among these cardiometabolic conditions — where obesity and T2D often lead to renal and hepatic complications — highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach to evaluate the complex interplay and pleiotropic effects of GLP-1RAs. Based on current clinical evidence, the following sections explore the therapeutic applications of GLP-1RAs in T2D, obesity, CKD, and metabolic liver disease, emphasizing their role in addressing the interconnected cardiometabolic spectrum and the challenges that remain to better unlock their potential.

### Kidney and cardiovascular outcomes among patients with CKD receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^115x6X23]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists improve cardiac and kidney outcomes in patients with diabetes; however, their efficacy in individuals with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is uncertain. This study evaluated the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported through May 25, 2024.

Setting & Study Populations

Adult participants in RCTs with baseline eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73 m².

Selection Criteria For Studies

RCTs including adults (≥ 18 years old) with varying degrees of kidney function, including individuals with CKD characterized by a baseline eGFR of < 60mL/min/1.73 m², that compared GLP-1 receptor agonists with control treatments with respect to a composite kidney outcome, all-cause mortality, or a composite CV disease outcome. From among 212 screened studies, 12 trials involving that included participants with baseline eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2 were included.

Data Extraction

Two independent investigators extracted the data.

Analytical Approach

Pooled odds ratios (ORs) for composite kidney outcome, all-cause mortality, and composite CV outcome were estimated using random-effects models. Evidence certainty was assessed using the GRADE system.

Results

The analyses included 17,996 RCT participants with baseline eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73 m². GLP-1 receptor agonists were significantly associated with a reduced risk of the composite kidney outcome (OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.77–0.94]; P = 0.001) with low heterogeneity (I² < 0.01%). GLP-1 receptor agonists were also associated with a reduced the risk of a > 30% eGFR decline (OR, 0.78; P = 0.004), a > 40% decline (OR, 0.76; P = 0.01), and a > 50% decline (OR, 0.72; P < 0.001). Risk of all-cause mortality was also lower in the GLP-1 receptor agonist group (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.60–0.98], P = 0.03), though there was high heterogeneity (I² = 71.6%). Composite CV outcomes were also lower with the use of a GLP-1 receptor agonist (OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.74–0.99], P = 0.03; I² = 40.3%). Sensitivity analyses restricted to human GLP-1 backbone agents showed enhanced benefits.

Limitations

Inconsistent kidney outcome definitions, focus on diabetic populations in most studies, and potential publication bias.

Conclusions

GLP-1 receptor agonists improved kidney and CV outcomes, and survival in patients with CKD enrolled in an array of clinical trials.

Registration

Plain-Language Summary

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists reduce body weight and improve glycemic control. They also have been shown to protect the heart and kidney in people with diabetes. However, the extrapolation of these findings to those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncertain. This study meta-analyzed data from clinical trials focusing on patients with CKD and noted that GLP-1 receptor agonists may slow kidney disease progression and lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, and death. These findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists offer multiple kidney and cardiovascular benefits to people with CKD.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes [^112aCJRJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 40% of people with diabetes develop kidney failure and experience an accelerated risk of cardiovascular complications. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are glucose-lowering agents that manage glucose and weight control.

Objectives

We assessed the benefits and harms of GLP-1 receptor agonists in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched to 10 September 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled studies were eligible if participants with diabetes and CKD were randomly allocated to a GLP-1 receptor agonist, placebo, standard care or a second glucose-lowering agent. CKD included all stages (from 1 to 5).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the risk of bias assessment tool 2. Pooled analyses using summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and/or hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. The primary outcomes included death (all-cause and cardiovascular), 3- and 4-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), kidney failure, composite kidney outcome, and severe hypoglycaemia. The secondary outcomes included non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, non-fatal peripheral arterial events, heart failure, hospitalisation due to heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance, doubling of serum creatinine, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, albuminuria progression, vascular access outcomes, body weight, body mass index, fatigue, life participation, peritoneal dialysis infection, peritoneal dialysis failure, adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, HbA1c, sudden death, acute MI, ischaemic stroke, and coronary revascularisation. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Forty-two studies involving 48,148 participants were included. All studies were conducted on people with type 2 diabetes, and no studies were carried out on children. The median study age was 66 years. The median study follow-up was 26 weeks. Six studies were conducted in people with CKD stages 1–2, 11 studies in people with CKD stages 3–5, one study in people on dialysis, and the remaining studies included people with both CKD stages 1–2 and 3–5. Risks of bias in the included studies for all the primary outcomes in studies that compared GLP-1 receptor agonists to placebo were low in most methodological domains, except one study that was assessed at high risk of bias due to missing outcome data for death (all-cause and cardiovascular). The overall risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death in studies that reported the treatment effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were assessed as unclear or at high risk of bias due to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. For GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to insulin or another GLP-1 receptor agonist, the risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death was low or unclear. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced the risk of all-cause death (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; I² = 23%; 8 studies, 17,861 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.05; I² = 42%; 7 studies, 17,801 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably decreased 3-point MACE (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98; I² = 65%; 4 studies, 19,825 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and 4-point MACE compared to placebo (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.89; 1 study, 2,158 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Based on absolute risks of clinical outcomes, it is likely that GLP-1 receptor agonists prevent all-cause death in 52 people with CKD stages 1–2 and 116 in CKD stages 3–5, cardiovascular death in 34 people with CKD stages 1–2 and 71 in CKD stages 3–5, while 95 CKD stages 1–2 and 153 in CKD stages 3–5 might experience a major cardiovascular event for every 1000 people treated over 1 year. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably had little or no effect on kidney failure, defined as starting dialysis or kidney transplant (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.13; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 4,134 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or on composite kidney outcomes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 16,849 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.25; I² = 44%; 4 studies, 6,292 participants; low-certainty evidence). The effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care or other hypoglycaemic agents were uncertain. No studies evaluated treatment on risks of fatigue, life participation, amputation or fracture.

Authors' Conclusions

GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced all-cause death but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death in people with CKD and diabetes. GLP-1 receptor agonists probably lower major cardiovascular events, probably have little or no effect on kidney failure and composite kidney outcomes, and may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia in people with CKD and diabetes.

### Mechanisms and clinical applications of incretin therapies for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112uj7jv]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of kidney failure worldwide. Development of DKD increases risks for cardiovascular events and death. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist have demonstrated improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in large-scale clinical trials.

Recent Finding

GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/glucose-depending insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists have robust glucose-lowering efficacy with low risk of hypoglycemia even in advanced stages of DKD. Initially approved as antihyperglycemic therapies, these agents also reduce blood pressure and body weight. Cardiovascular outcome and glycemic lowering trials have reported decreased risks of development and progression of DKD and atherosclerotic cardiovascular events for GLP-1 receptor agonists. Kidney and cardiovascular protection is mediated partly, but not entirely, by lowering of glycemia, body weight, and blood pressure. Experimental data have identified modulation of the innate immune response as a biologically plausible mechanism underpinning kidney and cardiovascular effects.

Summary

An influx of incretin-based therapies has changed the landscape of DKD treatment. GLP-1 receptor agonist use is endorsed by all major guideline forming organizations. Ongoing clinical trials and mechanistic studies with GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists will further define the roles and pathways for these agents in the treatment of DKD.

### Physiology and pathophysiology of incretins in the kidney [^115UMJN1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Incretin-based therapy with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors is considered a promising therapeutic option for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cumulative evidence, mainly from preclinical animal studies, reveals that incretin-based therapies also may elicit beneficial effects on kidney function. This review gives an overview of the physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology of the renal incretin system.

Recent Findings

Activation of GLP-1R in the kidney leads to diuretic and natriuretic effects, possibly through direct actions on renal tubular cells and sodium transporters. Moreover, there is evidence that incretin-based therapy reduces albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in the kidney, partially through GLP-1R-independent pathways. Molecular mechanisms by which incretins exert their renal effects are understood incompletely, thus further studies are needed.

Summary

The GLP-1R and DPP-4 are expressed in the kidney in various species. The kidney plays an important role in the excretion of incretin metabolites and most GLP-1R agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors, thus special attention is required when applying incretin-based therapy in renal impairment. Preclinical observations suggest direct renoprotective effects of incretin-based therapies in the setting of hypertension and other disorders of sodium retention, as well as in diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathy. Clinical studies are needed in order to confirm translational relevance from preclinical findings for treatment options of renal diseases.

### KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^112jjvn8]. Kidney International (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, GLP-1 receptor agonists, KDIGO 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that the risk of hypoglycemia is generally low with GLP-1 receptor agonists when used alone, but the risk is increased when GLP-1 receptor agonists are used concomitantly with other medications, such as sulfonylureas or insulin. Consider reducing the doses of sulfonylurea and/or insulin.

### Beat it early: putative renoprotective haemodynamic effects of oral hypoglycaemic agents [^1145LBfc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

In animal studies GLP-1 receptor agonists improve cardiac and vascular function through both glucose-dependent and -independent pathways.

GLP-1 receptor agonists have also been shown to markedly reduce proximal tubule sodium reabsorption and reduce angiotensin II levels which may represent other potential renoprotective mechanisms. The GLP-1-mediated increase in ANP has not been observed in humans, and more studies will have to be carried out to establish these proposed experimental mechanisms.

### The effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^1123Q8v1]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

This review examines the available literature on the effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is an important cause of end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy, and diabetic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). GLP-1RAs are proven to be safe in terms of CVD, and some of them have been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The effect of GLP-1RAs on hard renal endpoints has yet to be established; to date, there have been no published GLP-1RA clinical trials with primary renal endpoints. In this review, we discuss the evidence for a renal protective role of GLP-1RAs, highlighting the secondary renal outcomes from recent cardiovascular outcome trials of this class of glucose-lowering therapies.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^114SJ6NW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonists — metabolic effects, kidney outcome mediation, tolerability, and implementation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are summarized as follows: These agents reduce blood pressure (BP) by approximately 3–4 mm Hg and produce a mean weight reduction of approximately 3 kg, and in mediation analyses lower glycemia, BP, and weight only modestly mediated (10%-25%) kidney outcomes including a decline in eGFR to < 45 mL/min/ 1.73 m². Gastrointestinal side effects are the most common dose-limiting side effect; starting at the lowest dose and titrating judiciously to achieve tolerability is prudent with counseling on eating behaviors to minimize intolerance. Use remains limited: 6.8% of patients with diabetes and CKD were prescribed a GLP1 receptor agonist in 2019–2020, persistent use for at least 90 days was 6.3%, and initiation was reported in 17% of commercially insured patients in 2020. CKM guidance from the AHA recommends GLP1 receptor agonists for patients with type 2 diabetes or obesity to reduce atherosclerotic CVD risk, weight, and glycemia, and liraglutide should be the first GLP1 receptor agonist to obtain generic status, possibly in 2024.

### A randomized phase 2b trial examined the effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon receptor agonist cotadutide on kidney outcomes in patients with diabetic kidney disease [^115rvgAc]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Cotadutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucagon receptor agonist that may improve kidney function in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this phase 2b study, patients with T2D and CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 20 or more and under 90 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] over 50 mg/g) were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to 26 weeks' treatment with standard of care plus subcutaneous cotadutide uptitrated to 100, 300, or 600 μg, or placebo daily (double-blind), or the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide 1 mg once weekly (open-label). The co-primary endpoints were absolute and percentage change versus placebo in UACR from baseline to the end of week 14. Among 248 randomized patients, mean age 67.1 years, 19% were female, mean eGFR was 55.3 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, geometric mean was UACR 205.5 mg/g (coefficient of variation 270.0), and 46.8% were receiving concomitant sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. Cotadutide dose-dependently reduced UACR from baseline to the end of week 14, reaching significance at 300 μg (-43.9% [95% confidence interval -54.7 to -30.6]) and 600 μg (-49.9% [-59.3 to -38.4]) versus placebo; with effects sustained at week 26. Serious adverse events were balanced across arms. Safety and tolerability of cotadutide 600 μg were comparable to semaglutide. Thus, our study shows that in patients with T2D and CKD, cotadutide significantly reduced UACR on top of standard of care with an acceptable tolerability profile, suggesting kidney protective benefits that need confirmation in a larger study.

### Emerging evidence for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists in slowing chronic kidney disease progression [^1146UAqE]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diabetic kidney disease continues to increase, and several novel therapeutic agents have been shown to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease in those with diabetes. This review summarizes more recent data on the role of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and kidney outcomes.

Recent Findings

Posthoc analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials, as well as several retrospective studies, demonstrate benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy for chronic kidney disease progression in diabetics. Although limited randomized clinical trials evidence assessing the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney outcomes in diabetic chronic kidney disease patients have been published, FLOW-CKD trial was halted based on interim data for efficacy, and results are awaited.

Summary

GLP-1 receptor agonism is a promising therapy for slowing the progression of diabetic chronic kidney disease. Recent studies support kidney benefits GLP-1 receptor agonists over insulin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4-inhibitors, and the FLOW-CKD trial would inform the potential benefits for reducing the need for dialysis and kidney-disease related mortality in those with kidney disease.

### The incretin pathway as a therapeutic target in diabetic kidney disease: a clinical focus on GLP-1 receptor agonists [^111pG8bz]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists

In the last decade, a novel group of glucose-lowering agents has been developed based on the gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).GLP-1 is a hormone secreted by the gastrointestinal L-cells upon food ingestion and its levels are acutely and transiently raised after a meal. GLP-1 enhances insulin secretion, while reducing glucagon release from the pancreatic islet cells with a reduction in postprandial glucose levels as the net result. On top of pancreatic effects, GLP-1 release slows down gastric emptying and small intestinal peristalsis, suppresses hepatic glucose production and induces satiety, resulting in lower food intake, all contributing to improved glycemic control and a reduction of body weight. In people with T2D, circulating levels of GLP-1 are similar to those in normoglycemic individuals, however, there is resistance to its effects. Interestingly, this may be overcome by raising GLP-1 to pharmacological levels, making GLP-1 an attractive target for glucose-lowering therapy. Because of the short half-life (2–3 min) of GLP-1 due to cleavage by the ubiquitous enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP)-4, DPP-4-resistant GLP-1 receptor agonists were developed for clinical application.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists: differentiating the new medications [^111gW8pr]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

The Physiologic Actions of Incretin Hormones

Both GIP and GLP-1 are secreted from gut endocrine cells in response to meals, and exert their actions by binding to structurally distinct receptors. The GIP receptor is predominantly expressed in pancreatic islet β-cells, whereas GLP-1 receptors are expressed in islet α- and β-cells, as well as in the central and peripheral nervous systems, heart, lung, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract.

Activation of the GIP and GLP-1 receptors on the β-cells results in insulin production and exocytosis in a glucose-dependent manner (ie, only during hyperglycemia), which minimizes risk of hypoglycemia. Sustained activation of these receptors results in enhanced levels of insulin biosynthesis, β-cell proliferation, resistance to β-cell apoptosis, and enhanced β-cell survival in both humans and rodents. Table 1 presents the glucose homeostatic actions of both GIP and GLP-1 in an euglycemic individual. Shortly after the incretin hormones are secreted, they are rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), leaving only 20% of the endogenously secreted GLP-1 to induce insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells.

GIP = gastric inhibitory polypeptide; GLP-1 = glucagon-like peptide-1; T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Exogenous GLP-1 administered drugs and DPP-4 inhibitors have distinct mechanistic actions. The physiologic and pharmacologic effects of GLP-1 are based on the concentration of GLP-1 or a GLP-1 receptor agonist, as well as the affinity of receptor binding and number of receptors bound; the more receptors that are bound and activated, the greater the glycemic and nonglycemic responses to a given class of medications. The DPP-4 inhibitors, however, do not bind to GLP-1 receptors; rather, they prolong the half-life of endogenous GLP-1, thereby increasing GLP-1 levels. Thus, GLP-1 agonists have greater effects on glycemic control, weight loss, and gastric emptying, compared with the DPP-4 inhibitors (ie, sitagliptin and saxagliptin), which are also commercially available.

### GLP-1 receptor agonist versus DPP-4 inhibitor and kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in clinical practice in type-2 diabetes [^116dCEBy]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

Whether glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) reduce detrimental kidney outcomes is uncertain. In secondary analyses, trials have shown consistent reductions in macroalbuminuria, but inconclusive results about kidney function decline. To help clarify this, we conducted a cohort study to compare kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals who started GLP1-RA or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) (reduces degradation of endogenous GLP1). The primary outcome was a composite of sustained doubling of creatinine, kidney failure or kidney death. The secondary outcomes were three-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and its individual components. Propensity score weighted Cox regression was used to balance 53 confounders. A total of 19,766 individuals were included, of whom 5,699 initiated GLP1-RA, and were followed for a median 2.9 years. Mean age was 63 years, 26.2% had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 16.0% had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) under 60 ml/min/1.73m 2. The adjusted hazard ratio for GLP1-RA vs. DPP4i was 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.53–0.98) for the composite kidney outcome and 0.85 (0.73–0.99) for MACE, with absolute five-year risk reductions of 0.8% (0.1%-1.5%) and 1.6% (0.2%-2.9%), respectively. Hazard ratios were 0.79 (0.60–1.05) for cardiovascular death, 0.86 (0.68–1.09) for myocardial infarction and 0.74 (0.59–0.93) for stroke. Results were consistent within subgroups, including age, sex, eGFR and baseline metformin use. Thus, in our analysis of patients from routine clinical practice, the use of GLP1-RA was associated with a lower risk of kidney outcomes compared with DPP4i. Reductions in both kidney outcomes and MACE were similar in magnitude to those reported in large cardiovascular outcome trials.

CURRENT GUIDANCE FOR INCRETIN THERAPIES IN TYPE 2 DIABETES AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

GLP-1 receptor agonists are recommended as part of GDMT by guideline forming organizations to improve glycemic control, promote weight loss, and reduce ASCVD-related risks in patients with T2D. Indeed, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends GLP-1 receptor agonists with evidence of ASCVD benefit as a first-line treatment option in patients with T2D at high risk or with established ASCVD. Use of a GLP-1 receptor agonist is further recommended in patients with T2D and CKD unable to use metformin or an SGLT2 inhibitor. Streamlining for ease of use in patients with T2D and CKD, several GLP-1 receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist tirzepatide do not require dose adjustment by eGFR level for glycemic control or weight loss (Table 1).

Table 1
Key administration and dosing information for currently available GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists

The most common dose-limiting side effect with GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea which typically resolve over time with continued use. To minimize gastrointestinal side effects it is recommended to start medications at low dose, with gradual increase every 2–4 weeks as tolerated. In the AWARD-7 trial which enrolled participants with moderate-to-severe CKD, these gastrointestinal side effects were reported in approximately 15–20% of patients. Use of long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide is not recommended in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2. Caution is additionally recommended in patients with history or risk factors for pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and/or gallbladder disease. While GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists are not associated with hypoglycemia when used alone or as add-on to metformin, dose reduction or discontinuation of background sulfonylurea and/or insulin therapy may be needed to avoid hypoglycemia (Table 2).

KIDNEY AND HEART PROTECTION WITH INCRETIN THERAPIES

Owing to the 2008 U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance to industry requiring new glucose-lowering medications to demonstrate cardiovascular safety, the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) benefits of agents within the GLP-1 receptor agonist class are now widely recognized. Several large clinical CVOTs included kidney disease as key secondary outcome measures. Most analyses have reported benefit of GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist therapy on reducing albuminuria and slowing the rate of eGFR decline in participants with T2D. Notably, the observed kidney benefits in the GLP-1 receptor agonist trials were greater in studies that enrolled participants with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2, suggesting meaningful clinical benefits for moderate-to-severe CKD. A recent meta-analysis of GLP-1 receptor agonist CVOTs showed a reduced risk of a composite outcome inclusive of development of macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, ≥ 40% decline in eGFR, progression to kidney replacement therapy, or death due to kidney disease (hazard ratio: 0.79; 95% confidence interval: 0.73–0.87; p < 0.0001). Importantly, the meta-analysis found no heterogeneity for the ASCVD benefit of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy when stratified by eGFR (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 vs. eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m 2; P interaction = 0.52). In addition, the robust glucose-lowering effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists are preserved as eGFR declines.

### The effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on renal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113uKnKJ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Hypothesis

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) are anti-hyperglycaemic agents, with cardioprotective effects, however renal protective effects remain unclear. We aimed to assess the effects of GLP1-RAs on renal outcomes in patients with or without diabetes.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Register searched to December 2024. The primary outcome was the composite of kidney failure (defined as eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73m2) or dialysis requirement, worsening of renal function and changes in proteinuria. Subgroup analysis was performed based on diabetic status, CKD and individual GLP1-RA drugs. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for individual trials were pooled using random effects models.

Results

We identified 19 trials including 90882 patients. Mean age was 60.8 years and mean follow-up was 25.9 months. GLP1-RAs were associated with a 19% reduction in the risk of primary renal outcome (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73–0.89), a 12% reduction in renal functional decline (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81–0.95) and a 0.45 ml/min/1.73m2 reduction in yearly loss (16 trials, MD 0.45, 95% CI 0.10–0.81). GLP1-RAs also reduced microalbuminuria by 24% (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.71–0.82), HbA1c (units: %) by 0.61 (MD -0.61, 95% CI -0.76- -0.49) and body weight by 5 kg (MD -5.24, 95% CI -7.46–3.02). Although there were no significant differences in progression to kidney failure (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71–1.05), GLP1-RAs reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 15% (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.81–0.90) and all-cause mortality by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.82–0.91). No significant differences were seen in severe adverse events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90–1.01). However, there were more gastroenterological side effects.

Conclusions

GLP1-RAs demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits. Further high-quality randomised trials assessing their effects in patients without diabetes, with or without proteinuria and/or CKD are needed.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA): long-term effect on kidney function in patients with type 2 diabetes [^115UEEyD]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

In a short-term study including 31 patients with type 2 diabetes, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) treatment was associated with a significant reversible decline in GFR. Twenty-three patients re-initiated GLP-1 RA treatment after the primary study, and the aim was to investigate the long-term effect on kidney function.

Methods

We included 30 patients in a one-year extension study, all initially treated with liraglutide for seven weeks. During follow-up 23 were treated with liraglutide and seven untreated. Primary outcome was change in GFR ((51)Cr-EDTA plasma clearance).

Results

Patients were 61.5 (10.0) years and HbA(1c) 60.1 (13.8) mmol/mol. Baseline GFR was 100.6 (24.9) mL/min/1.73 m² and was reduced by 11 (95% CI: 6.6–15.7, p < 0.001) mL/min/1.73 m², independent of change in 24-h systolic blood pressure (SBP), weight, UAER or HbA(1c) (p ≥ 0.33). Geometric mean (IQR) of UAER was 25.5 (9.9–50.9) mg/d and was reduced by 27 (95% CI: 5–44; p = 0.020)%, and 24-h SBP was reduced by 8.2 (p = 0.048) mmHg. No changes occurred in untreated patients.

Conclusions

Long-term treatment with liraglutide was associated with a reduction in measured GFR similar to the effect during short-term treatment, suggesting a metabolic or haemodynamic reversible effect and not structural changes. Moreover, UAER and 24-h SBP were reduced.

### The postprandial actions of GLP-1 receptor agonists: the missing link for cardiovascular and kidney protection in type 2 diabetes [^114eQF1j]. Cell Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent clinical trials in people with type 2 diabetes have demonstrated beneficial actions on heart and kidney outcomes following treatment with GLP-1RAs. In part, these actions are consistent with improved glucose control and significant weight loss. But GLP-1RAs may also have additive benefits by improving postprandial dysmetabolism. In diabetes, dysregulated postprandial nutrient excursions trigger inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, thrombogenicity, and endotoxemia; alter hormone levels; and modulate cardiac output and regional blood and lymphatic flow. In this perspective, we explore the actions of GLP-1RAs on the postprandial state and their potential role in end-organ benefits observed in recent trials.

Treatment with GLP-1 RA in People Living with T2DM and CKD

The GLP-1 RA class of medications are incretin-mimetics that have been available from 2005, of which exenatide was the first to receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since then, additional GLP-1 RAs have gained regulatory approval in both the USA and Europe. These medications have been demonstrated to be safe and effective in controlling glycemia through HbA1c reduction. The glucose-lowering effect is due to GLP-1 RA binding to the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor in the pancreas where insulin secretion is promoted while glucagon secretion is suppressed. Additional benefits include improved metabolic control and weight loss by acting on the gut, where they slow gastric emptying, and the central nervous system, where they suppress appetite. Target tissues for GLP-1 are highlighted in Fig. 3 and include the heart and kidney. The GLP-1 RAs have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes, with liraglutide, semaglutide, albiglutide, and dulaglutide demonstrating a reduction of major cardiovascular events in people with established cardiovascular disease. Dulaglutide has also demonstrated reduced cardiovascular outcomes in people without established cardiovascular disease. These agents act on the kidneys, with clinical evidence suggesting they promote renal protection. Direct renal benefits include decreased glomerular atherosclerosis, inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system, stimulation of proximal tubule natriuresis, and reduced fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress, while they indirectly reduce renal risk factors by reducing hypertension, decreasing weight, and improving glycemic control. The potential direct and indirect benefits mediated by GLP-1 RA are summarized in Fig. 4. For a more detailed overview on the potential mechanisms by which GLP-1 RA may exert these effects on the kidney, we refer readers to recent review articles. Importantly unlike many other glucose-lowering medications, including metformin, sulfonylureas, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs do not have a relative contraindication in people with renal impairment.

### GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2-is to lower glucose and reduce the risk of cardiovascular and diabetic kidney disease [^117RjMBF]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The landscape of diabetes management has changed, such that the goal of pharmacotherapy extends beyond glucose-lowering to prioritize risk reduction of cardiovascular disease and diabetic kidney disease. Two newer classes of medications, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-Is), have become first line therapies for many patients with type 2 diabetes to reduce cardiovascular and renal complications of type 2 diabetes. This review article will describe the mechanism of action, evidence for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, contraindications, adverse effects, and risk mitigation strategies for the GLP-1 RA and SGLT2-I drug classes. In addition, we will provide a practical approach for primary care clinicians to prescribe, adjust, and combine these medication classes, while considering patient preference, tolerability, comorbidities, cost, and availability.

### Combination therapy with kidney protective therapies: optimizing the benefits? [^114ELFDR]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent advances in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have led to the development of several new agents that are kidney protective, particularly in people with diabetes. These agents include sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2 inhibitors), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). This review summarizes the available data regarding the effects of using these therapies in combination.

Recent Findings

There is convincing evidence that SGLT-2 inhibitors and MRAs individually improve kidney function and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in people with CKD, especially diabetic CKD. There is some evidence that GLP-1RAs may be beneficial, but further studies are needed. The available data support an additive kidney and cardiovascular benefit using combination therapy with SGLT-2 inhibitors and MRAs, and possibly with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs, but more long-term data are needed. The currently available data suggest that combining these agents would likely be beneficial and may be an appropriate long-term strategy.

Summary

Several new agents are useful in slowing the progress of CKD. Further research to identify which combinations of agents work best together and which combinations are most effective for people with different characteristics, in order to personalize treatment and improve outcomes for people with CKD, should be a priority.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: nonglycemic clinical effects in weight loss and beyond [^113QoCJG]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Effects on kidney function and disease

GLP-1 receptor agonists exert several effects on kidney function, some of which are potentially renoprotective. GLP-1 receptors have been found in kidney tissue from several types of animal, including rodents, pigs and cattle. In rats and pigs, expression has been detected in the proximal tubular cells. GLP-1 receptors have also been detected in human and monkey kidney, although renal expression appears to be restricted to smooth muscle cells in the walls of arteries and arterioles.

Several studies have demonstrated that GLP-1 promotes natriuresis and diuresis in animal models and humans. Moreover, rodent studies have confirmed that GLP-1 receptor agonists also exert these effects. Sodium excretion is most likely mediated via the inhibition of the Na + /H + ion exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) in the proximal tubule, and may contribute to the antihypertensive effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

### The potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: from randomised trials to clinical practice [^116TfYi8]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The clearance of drug compounds often happens via the kidneys and may be lower when kidney function is impaired. In those cases, the blood concentration and half-life of the compound can be increased, resulting in an elevated risk of side effects. In persons with diabetes and impaired kidney function, many diabetes medications therefore need to be used with caution (e.g. at a reduced dose level) if at all. However, no reduction in dose is required for any of the GLP-1 RAs marketed today according to kidney function. Indeed, most of the agents can be used also in people with advanced CKD, while some are subject to restrictions due to lack of data.

In summary, safety and tolerability of the GLP-1 RAs have been thoroughly investigated in people with CKD and are well established.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^112VEpub]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists vs DPP-4 inhibitors and mortality in diabetes and advanced CKD… [^116Tg5VT]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Question Is use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists among patients with diabetes and advanced-stage chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease associated with better outcomes than use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Findings This cohort study comprising 27 279 participants with type 2 diabetes and advanced-stage chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease revealed that the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with lower all-cause mortality and lower sepsis- and infection-related mortality than was use of DPP-4 inhibitors. Meaning In this study, use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with better outcomes compared with use of DPP-4 inhibitors among patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced-stage chronic kidney disease. Importance. Chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease are contributors to the health burden and are associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular events.

1, 2 Type 2 diabetes is the most common cause of CKD, and both diabetes and CKD are associated with increased all-cause mortality and. The mirrored histogram of propensity score distribution showed substantial overlap of propensity scores between the 2 groups. For primary and second outcomes, the median follow-up duration was 3. 57 years in the DPP-4 inhibitor group and

1. 76 years in the GLP-1 receptor agonist group. The 2 major findings of this study can be summarized as follows: use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with diabetes and stage 5 CKD or EKSD was associated with lower all-cause mortality compared with use of DPP-4 inhibitors and use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with lower sepsis- and infection-related mortality compared with use of DPP-4 inhibitors.

A previous study reported that use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with lower all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, and kidney failure compared with placebo in the general population with diabetes. 7 In that study, use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was also associated with improved outcomes compared with several traditional antidiabetic agents, including sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, and thiazolidinedione.

Objective

To evaluate sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes at varying cardiovascular and renal risk.

Design

Network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL up to 11 August 2020.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists with placebo, standard care, or other glucose lowering treatment in adults with type 2 diabetes with follow up of 24 weeks or longer. Studies were screened independently by two reviewers for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias.

Main Outcome Measures

Frequentist random effects network meta-analysis was carried out and GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation) used to assess evidence certainty. Results included estimated absolute effects of treatment per 1000 patients treated for five years for patients at very low risk (no cardiovascular risk factors), low risk (three or more cardiovascular risk factors), moderate risk (cardiovascular disease), high risk (chronic kidney disease), and very high risk (cardiovascular disease and kidney disease). A guideline panel provided oversight of the systematic review.

Results

764 trials including 421346 patients proved eligible. All results refer to the addition of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists to existing diabetes treatment. Both classes of drugs lowered all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and kidney failure (high certainty evidence). Notable differences were found between the two agents: SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced admission to hospital for heart failure more than GLP-1 receptor agonists, and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced non-fatal stroke more than SGLT-2 inhibitors (which appeared to have no effect). SGLT-2 inhibitors caused genital infection (high certainty), whereas GLP-1 receptor agonists might cause severe gastrointestinal events (low certainty). Low certainty evidence suggested that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists might lower body weight. Little or no evidence was found for the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists on limb amputation, blindness, eye disease, neuropathic pain, or health related quality of life. The absolute benefits of these drugs vary substantially across patients from low to very high risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes (eg, SGLT-2 inhibitors resulted in 3 to 40 fewer deaths in 1000 patients over five years; see interactive decision support tool (https://magicevidence.org/match-it/200820dist/#!/) for all outcomes.

Conclusions

In patients with type 2 diabetes, SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced cardiovascular and renal outcomes, with some differences in benefits and harms. Absolute benefits are determined by individual risk profiles of patients, with clear implications for clinical practice, as reflected in the BMJ Rapid Recommendations directly informed by this systematic review.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112TtxQw]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are prioritized based on kidney and cardiovascular benefits: SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 and type 2 diabetes to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce heart failure risk independent of glucose management, while GLP-1 RAs are suggested for cardiovascular risk reduction if such risk is predominant. Selection of glucose-lowering medications should also consider an individual's cardiovascular and kidney risks, effects on weight, adverse effects, preferences, and cost, and both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs have shown cardiovascular and kidney protection.

Research insights

What is currently known about this topic?

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) affect cardiovascular (CV) outcomes via multiple mechanisms. GLP-1 RA therapies have been shown to have beneficial effects on CV disease, mortality, and kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.

What is the key research question?

To what degree do the observed changes in modifiable CV risk factors induced by once-weekly use of the GLP-1 RA exenatide explain observed differences in CV event rates between the drug and placebo arms of the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL)?

What is new?

Simulation and mediation analyses of EXSCEL both suggested observed changes in conventional CV risk factors induced by once-weekly exenatide explain only a modest proportion of the observed CV outcomes.

How might this study influence clinical practice?

The results of this study could be used to adjust risk estimates derived from prediction models in people with type 2 diabetes treated with GLP-1 RAs.

### The effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^116sX8Du]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are affected by diabetic kidney disease (DKD). In addition, DKD is the single most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). Patients with T2DM and DKD are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), and DKD itself is an independent risk factor for hypertension and premature death. Recent years have seen changes in diabetes management, moving away from a glucocentric approach to multifactorial risk factor modification with a consequent reduction in incidence of T2DM-related CV morbidity and mortality by > 50%. However, the incidence of T2DM-related ESRD decreased by only 29%.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the management of obesity in persons living with kidney diseases [^11441H9T]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

ASN Kidney Health Guidance — incretin mimetics (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1 RAs] and dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP] RAs) for weight management in kidney disease — notes regulatory status and kidney outcome data: As of August 16, 2024, three GLP-1 RAs are approved for weight loss (liraglutide, tirzepatide, semaglutide), and weight loss in this class often exceeds 5% of baseline body weight. In patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 25–75), semaglutide reduced the risk of major kidney disease outcomes by approximately 25%. In adults without preexisting cardiovascular disease and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m², semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneous weekly administration reduced a five-component kidney composite end point by 22%. A randomized trial with liraglutide (1.8 mg subcutaneous daily) demonstrated a 22% lower occurrence of a composite kidney outcome versus placebo, primarily driven by reduced new persistent microalbuminuria.
