## Question

Lowest dose of spironolactone for heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the lowest effective dose of spironolactone for heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the heart failure phenotype, because dosing differs for HFrEF versus HFpEF. Then, I should verify what the pivotal trials actually used and what the FDA labels say. Next, I will review guideline recommendations and reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I need to consider special populations like CKD and the elderly. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-aware recommendation and confirm the monitoring plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the "lowest effective dose" depends on whether we are treating HFrEF or HFpEF. In HFrEF, spironolactone has robust mortality benefit in RALES and is guideline-recommended, whereas in HFpEF, TOPCAT showed a modest reduction in HF hospitalizations but no clear mortality benefit, so the threshold for use and dosing is more conservative and individualized [^12303b2b] [^013850de] [^703f8a2f].

> Now, for HFrEF, I should verify the trial dosing that produced outcomes. In RALES, patients started at 25 mg daily, with down-titration to 25 mg every other day if hyperkalemia occurred, and optional up-titration to 50 mg daily after 8 weeks if tolerated; importantly, the mean achieved dose was about 26 mg daily, and the mortality benefit was observed at this exposure, suggesting that 25 mg daily is the effective dose for most patients [^12303b2b] [^1b2b8fc6] [^33a1a088].

> Wait, let me verify guideline alignment with this. Contemporary ACC/AHA/HFSA guidance recommends initiating spironolactone at 12.5–25 mg daily with a target of 25–50 mg daily, and it explicitly notes that many patients will not tolerate 50 mg, reinforcing that 25 mg is the practical effective dose for most. This aligns with the RALES experience and the observed flat dose–response for hard outcomes between 25 and 50 mg [^763b9e7d] [^ce831623] [^338f079f].

> Hold on, I should also check the FDA label, because it sometimes codifies a range. The FDA labeling for Aldactone advises starting at 25 mg daily, increasing to 50 mg if tolerated, and reducing to 25 mg every other day if hyperkalemia occurs, which mirrors RALES and supports 25 mg as the standard starting and often effective maintenance dose in HFrEF [^ffd8a3a9].

> For HFpEF, I need to be cautious. TOPCAT used 15–45 mg daily, and the signal for benefit was driven by reduced HF hospitalizations rather than mortality. Given higher hyperkalemia risk and modest effect size, many clinicians start at the low end of that range, often 15–25 mg daily, with careful selection and monitoring rather than pushing to higher doses [^013850de] [^378c6f25] [^703f8a2f].

> Next, I should review special populations, because the "lowest effective dose" may be lower in CKD or older adults. In eGFR 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m², guidelines advise halving the starting dose to 12.5–25 mg every other day or 25 mg every other day, and some labels suggest 25 mg every 48 hours. In stage 3b CKD without heart failure, a recent RCT of 25 mg daily showed no outcome benefit and high discontinuation rates, so I should avoid extrapolating that to HF patients, but it underscores the need for conservative dosing and vigilant monitoring in CKD [^ce831623] [^77cb4579] [^c8ac0cb5].

> I should double-check the practical bottom line. For HFrEF, the lowest effective dose supported by trials and guidelines is 25 mg daily, with 12.5–25 mg daily as an acceptable starting range when renal function is borderline or potassium is higher, and with down-titration to 25 mg every other day if hyperkalemia emerges. For HFpEF, given weaker efficacy, many clinicians start at 15–25 mg daily and individualize based on tolerance and risk, recognizing the HF hospitalization signal in appropriately selected patients [^763b9e7d] [^ffd8a3a9] [^013850de].

> But wait, what if someone cannot tolerate even 25 mg every other day? I need to ensure safety first: if potassium rises to 5.5 mEq/L or eGFR declines substantially, the drug should be held or discontinued, and potassium binders may be considered in select cases to maintain MRA therapy, though evidence for hard outcomes with binders is limited. This means that in some patients, the "lowest effective dose" may be no dose at all if risks outweigh benefits despite attempts to mitigate hyperkalemia [^ce831623] [^34836cdb].

> Finally, I should confirm the monitoring cadence, because safe use at low doses still requires surveillance. Check potassium and renal function within 3 days to 1 week, again at about 4 weeks, and then periodically, with more frequent checks after dose changes or if ACEi/ARB/MRA combinations are intensified. This is especially critical when starting at 25 mg daily in patients with eGFR 30–50 or baseline potassium near 4.5–5.0 mEq/L [^ce831623] [^a5b6b962].

The lowest effective dose of spironolactone for heart failure is **12.5–25 mg daily** [^763b9e7d], with 25 mg daily being the standard starting dose in most patients with preserved renal function and normal potassium [^ffd8a3a9]. In patients with eGFR 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher hyperkalemia risk, start at **12.5–25 mg every other day** or 25 mg every 48 hours [^77cb4579] and titrate cautiously [^ce831623]. For HFpEF, TOPCAT used 15–45 mg daily [^013850de], but many clinicians start at 12.5–25 mg daily and adjust based on tolerance and potassium [^notfound]. Always monitor potassium and renal function closely after initiation and dose changes [^ce831623].

## Evidence supporting low-dose spironolactone

- **RALES trial**: The pivotal RALES trial established spironolactone 25 mg daily as the standard dose for HFrEF, demonstrating significant reductions in mortality and heart failure hospitalizations [^12303b2b]. The mean dose achieved in the trial was 26 mg daily, indicating that 25 mg is effective for most patients [^1b2b8fc6].

- **EMPHASIS-HF trial**: Although this trial evaluated eplerenone, it reinforced the concept that low-dose MRAs (starting at 25 mg daily) are effective in HFrEF, with significant reductions in cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations [^1791deb6].

- **TOPCAT trial**: In HFpEF, spironolactone was initiated at 15 mg daily and titrated to a maximum of 45 mg daily. The trial showed a modest reduction in heart failure hospitalizations, suggesting that lower doses may be effective in this population [^013850de] [^5da29fc9].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) provide clear recommendations on spironolactone dosing:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended starting dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| HFrEF (normal renal function and potassium) | 25 mg daily | Increase to 50 mg daily if tolerated [^ce831623] |
| HFrEF (eGFR 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m² or potassium > 4.5 mEq/L) | 12.5–25 mg every other day or 25 mg every 48 hours | Titrate cautiously [^77cb4579] |
| HFpEF | 15–25 mg daily | Adjust based on tolerance and potassium [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety profile

Low-dose spironolactone (12.5–25 mg daily) has been associated with significant clinical benefits, including:

- **Reduced mortality**: RALES demonstrated a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality with spironolactone 25 mg daily [^12303b2b].

- **Reduced hospitalizations**: Significant reductions in heart failure hospitalizations were observed in RALES and EMPHASIS-HF [^12303b2b] [^1791deb6].

- **Improved symptoms**: Patients experienced improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and quality of life [^6ee13aab].

Regarding safety, low-dose spironolactone is **generally well tolerated**, though hyperkalemia and renal function deterioration are the primary concerns. Hyperkalemia occurs in approximately 2–5% of patients, with higher risk in those with impaired renal function or concomitant ACE inhibitor/ARB use [^ce831623]. Regular monitoring of potassium and renal function is essential, especially after initiation and dose adjustments [^ce831623].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dosing

Several patient-specific factors influence the selection of the lowest effective dose:

- **Renal function**: eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73 m² warrants cautious dosing, often starting at 12.5–25 mg every other day [^77cb4579].

- **Serum potassium**: Baseline potassium > 4.5 mEq/L necessitates lower starting doses and close monitoring [^ffd8a3a9].

- **Age**: Elderly patients are at higher risk of hyperkalemia and may require lower starting doses [^14e006f4].

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, liver disease, and concomitant medications (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs) increase hyperkalemia risk and may necessitate dose adjustments [^c5996106].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

Based on current evidence and guidelines, the following practical recommendations are suggested:

- **Standard starting dose**: 25 mg daily for most patients with HFrEF and preserved renal function [^ffd8a3a9].

- **Reduced starting dose**: 12.5–25 mg every other day or 25 mg every 48 hours for patients with eGFR 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m² or elevated potassium [^77cb4579].

- **HFpEF**: Start at 15–25 mg daily, titrating based on tolerance and potassium levels [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Check potassium and renal function within 3 days to 1 week, again at 4 weeks, and periodically thereafter [^a5b6b962].

---

## Conclusion

The lowest effective dose of spironolactone for heart failure is **12.5–25 mg daily**, with 25 mg daily being the standard starting dose for most patients with preserved renal function and normal potassium. Lower starting doses are recommended for patients with impaired renal function or elevated potassium levels, and dose adjustments should be guided by close monitoring of potassium and renal function.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Heart Failure: Initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily (2.2).
Hypertension: Initiate treatment at 25 to 100 mg daily in either single or divided doses (2.3).
Edema: Initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly. The recommended initial daily dose is 100 mg in single or divided doses (2.4).
Primary hyperaldosteronism: Initiate treatment at 100 to 400 mg in preparation for surgery. In patients unsuitable for surgery use the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient (2.5).

2.1	General Considerations

ALDACTONE can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2	Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily. Patients who tolerate 25 mg once daily may have their dosage increased to 50 mg once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 25 mg once daily may have their dosage reduced to 25 mg every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, consider initiating therapy at 25 mg every other day because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3	Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 25 to 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses is recommended. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses greater than 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4	Treatment of Edema

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. The recommended initial daily dosage is 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

2.5	Treatment of Primary Hyperaldosteronism

Administer ALDACTONE in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, ALDACTONE can be used as long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.

### Spironolactone dose in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: findings from TOPCAT [^5da29fc9]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Spironolactone up-titration may be limited by side effects that could be minimized at lower than target doses, but whether lower than target doses remain efficacious is unknown. In TOPCAT, spironolactone (or placebo) were started at 15mg/day, and increased up to a maximum of 45mg/day. The prognostic implications related to spironolactone dose are yet to be reported. We aimed to assess the average spironolactone/placebo doses provided during the trial, overall and within high-risk subgroups (e.g. elderly, renal dysfunction, high potassium); discontinuation rates; and the efficacy of lower than target doses in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Methods and Results

Overall, 1767 patients from 'TOPCAT-Americas' were included. Linear, logistic and Cox regressions were applied. Patients randomized to spironolactone received lower doses than placebo: 22.5 (15.0–27.5) mg/day vs. 27.5 (17.5–27.5) mg/day (P < 0.001). Patients aged ≥ 75years, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 60mL/min/1.73m 2, and with potassium levels > 4.5mmol/L, received lower spironolactone doses (median≈20mg/day). This pattern of dose differences was not observed in patients taking placebo, where the between-subgroup placebo doses were similar (spironolactone-placebo by subgroup P interaction < 0.05). Among patients taking spironolactone, 25.4% discontinued the drug during the first year, compared with 18.3% of the patients taking placebo (P < 0.001). Discontinuation rates in the aforementioned high-risk subgroups reached 30% during the first year. Spironolactone reduced the primary outcome of heart failure hospitalization/cardiovascular death without significant heterogeneity between the study subgroups (P interaction > 0.1). Spironolactone discontinuation was associated with a two to fourfold higher risk of subsequent events.

Conclusion

Spironolactone (but not placebo) was used at lower doses among the elderly, those with renal dysfunction and with higher potassium levels. The effect of spironolactone was homogeneous across these subgroups. In patients unable to tolerate target doses, a low-dose strategy should be preferred to stopping treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of spironolactone in acute heart failure: the ATHENA-HF randomized clinical trial [^37c8d408]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Persistent congestion is associated with worse outcomes in acute heart failure (AHF). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists administered at high doses may relieve congestion, overcome diuretic resistance, and mitigate the effects of adverse neurohormonal activation in AHF.

Objective

To assess the effect of high-dose spironolactone and usual care on N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels compared with usual care alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind and placebo (or low-dose)-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in 22 US acute care hospitals among patients with AHF who were previously receiving no or low-dose (12.5 mg or 25 mg daily) spironolactone and had NT-proBNP levels of 1000 pg/mL or more or B-type natriuretic peptide levels of 250 pg/mL or more, regardless of ejection fraction.

Interventions

High-dose spironolactone (100 mg) vs placebo or 25 mg spironolactone (usual care) daily for 96 hours.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the change in NT-proBNP levels from baseline to 96 hours. Secondary end points included the clinical congestion score, dyspnea assessment, net urine output, and net weight change. Safety end points included hyperkalemia and changes in renal function.

Results

A total of 360 patients were randomized, of whom the median age was 65 years, 129 (36%) were women, 200 (55.5%) were white, 151 (42%) were black, 8 (2%) were Hispanic or Latino, 9 (2.5%) were of other race/ethnicity, and the median left ventricular ejection fraction was 34%. Baseline median (interquartile range) NT-proBNP levels were 4601 (2697–9596) pg/mL among the group treated with high-dose spironolactone and 3753 (1968–7633) pg/mL among the group who received usual care. There was no significant difference in the log NT-proBNP reduction between the 2 groups (-0.55 [95% CI, -0.92 to -0.18] with high-dose spironolactone and -0.49 [95% CI, -0.98 to -0.14] with usual care, P = 0.57). None of the secondary end point or day-30 all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization rate differed between the 2 groups. The changes in serum potassium and estimated glomerular filtration rate at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. were similar between the 2 groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Adding treatment with high-dose spironolactone to usual care for patients with AHF for 96 hours was well tolerated but did not improve the primary or secondary efficacy end points.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^80278377]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Power calculations

We determined that a sample size of 1,511 participants per group (3,022 total) would be required at 80% power to detect a 20% relative risk reduction in death or cardiovascular events over 3 years of follow-up, accounting for an anticipated treatment withdrawal rate of 13%. We chose to power the trial conservatively on a 20% risk reduction because this proposed treatment effect was around half the risk reduction observed in a trial of the aldosterone receptor antagonist, eplerenone, in patients with mild heart failure.

Statistical analysis

We performed an intention-to-treat analysis, including all participants who had undergone randomization except for those who were found to be ineligible for participation postrandomization. For the primary outcome, we report the HR and 95% CI for the time to the first occurrence of a primary endpoint event using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for randomized treatment allocation. The safety analysis included all participants who had actually received the treatment versus the total number of people receiving usual care.

We report the frequency and percentage of the proportion of participants that reached the primary endpoint, the time at risk in days and the incidence rate per 100 years at risk. A Kaplan–Meier curve is used to compare the time to the first occurrence of a primary endpoint event between intervention groups. These analyses are repeated for each individual component of the primary endpoint (hospitalization, CVD and death).

### Spironolactone [^1b2b8fc6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Heart Failure

The Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study was a placebo controlled, double-blind study of the effect of spironolactone on mortality in patients with highly symptomatic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. To be eligible to participate patients had to have an ejection fraction of ≤ 35%, NYHA class III-IV symptoms, and a history of NYHA class IV symptoms within the last 6 months before enrollment. Patients with a baseline serum creatinine of > 2.5 mg/dL or a recent increase of 25% or with a baseline serum potassium of > 5.0 mEq/L were excluded.

Follow-up visits and laboratory measurements (including serum potassium and creatinine) were performed every four weeks for the first 12 weeks, then every 3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

The initial dose of spironolactone was 25 mg once daily. Patients who were intolerant of the initial dosage regimen had their dose decreased to one 25 mg tablet every other day at one to four weeks. Patients who were tolerant of one tablet daily at 8 weeks may have had their dose increased to 50 mg daily at the discretion of the investigator. The mean daily dose at study end for patients randomized to spironolactone was 26 mg.

### Spironolactone [^27f42eee]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Heart Failure

Spironolactone is indicated for treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure.

Spironolactone is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies.

1.2 Hypertension

Spironolactone is indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in patients who are not adequately controlled on other agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Potassium binders for patients with heart failure? The real enlightenment of the DIAMOND trial [^338f079f]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Higher doses of MRAs do not improve outcomes more than lower doses

The answer to this question depends on whether the DIAMOND-specified target doses of MRAs are truly needed to produce optimal decreases in mortality and mortality in HFrEF. In RALES, mortality was reduced using a mean of 26 mg/day of spironolactone, with no survival difference between 25 and 50 mg/day. Similarly, when tested in the post-infarction setting, eplerenone reduced cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure when patients were taking only 25 mg/day, with a magnitude of benefit similar to that seen with 50 mg/day. Finally, in EMPHASIS-HF, patients randomized to 25 or 50 mg/day of eplerenone had a similar reduction in the combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. Therefore, the totality of evidence suggests that the shape of the dose–response relationships for both spironolactone and eplerenone for the reduction of major heart failure events is flat between 25 and 50 mg/day. If true, the use of patiromer to facilitate the prescribing of spironolactone 50 mg/day (as opposed to lower doses) might not be expected to yield benefits on heart failure outcomes.

### Spironolactone [^419d745e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1663 patients were randomized 1:1 to spironolactone or placebo. 87% of patients were white, 7% black, 2% Asian. 73% were male and median age was 67. The median ejection fraction was 26%. 70% were NYHA class III and 29% class IV. The etiology of heart failure was ischemic in 55%, and non-ischemic in 45%. There was a history of myocardial infarction in 28%, of hypertension in 24%, and of diabetes in 22%. The median baseline serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL and the median baseline creatinine clearance was 57 mL/min.

At baseline 100% of patients were taking loop diuretic and 95% were taking an ACE inhibitor. Other medications used at any time during the study included digoxin (78%), anticoagulants (58%), aspirin (43%), and beta-blockers (15%).

The primary endpoint for Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study was time to all-cause mortality. Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study was terminated early because of significant mortality benefit demonstrated during a planned interim analysis. Compared to placebo, spironolactone reduced the risk of death by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 40%). Spironolactone also reduced the risk of hospitalization for cardiac causes (defined as worsening heart failure, angina, ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction) by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 41%).

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^a71d2537]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized PROBE trial, we found that low-dose spironolactone did not reduce the risk of a composite outcome of death, hospitalization for CVD or new cardiovascular events compared to usual care among a community cohort of people (mean age = 74.8 years) with moderate CKD and a high burden of cardiovascular comorbidity. We also found no reduction in risk in any component of the composite outcome nor in our prespecified subgroups of participants with coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes or uncontrolled hypertension at baseline. In the within-trial economic analysis, spironolactone was not effective compared to usual care. Although difficulties with recruitment left the study underpowered, based on the anticipated effect size, this is unlikely to have influenced the outcomes. The conditional power calculation suggests that there is an 11.8% probability that a statistically significant result would have been found if the trial had reached its recruited target and the observed event rate remained constant with the participants who were recruited. Spironolactone appeared to be poorly tolerated among the study population, and only a third of participants continued on treatment beyond 6 months post-randomization. Participants randomized to spironolactone did have a small but statistically significant greater deterioration in eGFR across follow-up. These participants were also more likely to have hyperkalemia and hypotension. Our results suggest that spironolactone should not be used in people with CKD without another specific indication, such as heart failure.

### A comparison of the aldosterone-blocking agents eplerenone and spironolactone [^3f5e772c]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Improved understanding of the adverse pharmacological properties of aldosterone has prompted investigation of the clinical benefits of blocking aldosterone at the receptor level. This article reviews the pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of the two available blocking agents, spironolactone and eplerenone. A Medline search identified clinical studies assessing spironolactone and eplerenone. Priority was given to large, well-controlled, clinical trials and comparative studies. Pharmacological differences between spironolactone and eplerenone include lower affinity of eplerenone for progesterone, androgen, and glucocorticoid receptors; more consistently demonstrated nongenomic properties for eplerenone; and the presence of long-acting metabolites for spironolactone. Both agents effectively treat hypertension and heart failure but comparisons are complicated by the deficiency of head-to-head trials and differences between patient populations. There are differences in the tolerability profiles; spironolactone is associated with dose-dependent sexual side effects. Both agents produce dose-dependent increases in potassium concentrations, although the effect with spironolactone appears to be greater when both agents are administered at recommended doses. Choice of a specific agent should be based on individual patient issues, such as the nature of heart failure and patient concerns about adverse events.

14.1 	Heart Failure

The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) was a placebo controlled, double-blind study of the effect of spironolactone on mortality in patients with highly symptomatic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. To be eligible to participate patients had to have an ejection fraction of ≤ 35%, NYHA class III–IV symptoms, and a history of NYHA class IV symptoms within the last 6 months before enrollment. Patients with a baseline serum creatinine of > 2.5 mg/dL or a recent increase of 25% or with a baseline serum potassium of > 5.0 mEq/L were excluded.

Follow-up visits and laboratory measurements (including serum potassium and creatinine) were performed every four weeks for the first 12 weeks, then every 3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

The initial dose of spironolactone was 25 mg once daily. Patients who were intolerant of the initial dosage regimen had their dose decreased to one 25 mg tablet every other day at one to four weeks. Patients who were tolerant of one tablet daily at 8 weeks may have had their dose increased to 50 mg daily at the discretion of the investigator. The mean daily dose at study end for patients randomized to spironolactone was 26 mg.

### Spironolactone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^013850de]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists improve the prognosis for patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. We evaluated the effects of spironolactone in patients with heart failure and a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 3445 patients with symptomatic heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% or more to receive either spironolactone (15 to 45 mg daily) or placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of heart failure.

Results

With a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, the primary outcome occurred in 320 of 1722 patients in the spironolactone group (18.6%) and 351 of 1723 patients in the placebo group (20.4%) (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.04; P = 0.14). Of the components of the primary outcome, only hospitalization for heart failure had a significantly lower incidence in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (206 patients [12.0%] vs. 245 patients [14.2%]; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99, P = 0.04). Neither total deaths nor hospitalizations for any reason were significantly reduced by spironolactone. Treatment with spironolactone was associated with increased serum creatinine levels and a doubling of the rate of hyperkalemia (18.7%, vs. 9.1% in the placebo group) but reduced hypokalemia. With frequent monitoring, there were no significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse events, a serum creatinine level of 3.0 mg per deciliter (265 μmol per liter) or higher, or dialysis.

Conclusions

In patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction, treatment with spironolactone did not significantly reduce the incidence of the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of heart failure.

### Spironolactone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^378c6f25]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The study TOPCAT was published by Pitt B and colleagues in 2014 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the TOPCAT study, the trial question was: what is the effect of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF? In the TOPCAT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TOPCAT study, the population was: 3445 patients (1775 female, 1670 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HFpEF. The key exclusion criteria were severe systemic illness with a life expectancy of < 3 years, severe renal dysfunction, and specific coexisting conditions, medications, or acute events. In the TOPCAT study, the interventions were: n = 1722 spironolactone (15–45 mg/day) n = 1723 placebo (matching placebo). In the TOPCAT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF (18.6% vs. 20.4%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.04). In the TOPCAT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalization for HF (12% vs. 14.2%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99) No significant difference in cardiovascular death (9.3% vs. 10.2%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12) No significant difference in aborted cardiac arrest (0.2% vs. 0.3%; HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.5). In the TOPCAT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, serum creatinine level ≥ 3.0 mmg/dL, or dialysis. significant difference in hyperkalemia (18.7% vs. 9.1%) and hypokalemia (16.2% vs. 22.9%). In the TOPCAT study, the conclusion was: in patients with HFpEF, spironolactone was not superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF.

### Complications of inappropriate use of spironolactone in heart failure: when an old medicine spirals out of new guidelines [^d972f77a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to investigate the appropriateness and complications of the use of spironolactone for heart failure (HF) in clinical practice.

Background

Spironolactone was reported by one prospective randomized trial to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV HF. With this report (Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study [RALES] trial), we noted a marked increase in widespread use of spironolactone in patients with HF. Long-term outcome data with respect to safety and utilization of this medication in HF are not available.

Methods

To investigate the use of spironolactone for HF in a clinical setting, we analyzed the application of the RALES trial protocol to the care of 104 patients, whom we identified as being started on spironolactone for HF after prerelease of the RALES trial.

Results

We found broader use, less intensive follow-up, and increased complications with spironolactone treatment compared with the RALES trial. Cardiologists provided more appropriate care than did primary care providers.

Conclusions

These data suggest that spironolactone is being used widely in HF without consideration of the NYHA class and ejection fraction, and without optimization of background treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. Clinical follow-up does not adhere to the RALES trial guidelines, resulting in higher complications. We conclude that long-term studies with further safety and efficacy data are needed.

### Patiromer use in patients with heart failure: lessons and clinical considerations from the DIAMOND trial [^c5b1b787]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

The choice of target doses of the intervention in the DIAMOND trial was based on what was believed to be the best evidence for spironolactone and eplerenone. 2,3 In the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) trial, patients were started on spironolactone 25 mg/day with an option to down‐titrate to 25 mg every other day if there was an increase in serum potassium, or to up‐titrate to 50 mg/day after 8 weeks, if there were signs of worsening heart failure without hyperkaalemia. While the average dose of spironolactone was 26 mg/day, 50 mg/day dose was thought to be more effective based on the finding of a lower atrial natriuretic hormone levels in the RALES dose‐finding study. EMPHASIS‐HF (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure) used a starting dose of 25 mg/day with the option to up‐titrate to 50 mg/day. While many patients did not achieve this dose, this dosing strategy was chosen in line with the pivotal trials and a judgment based on higher doses not being assessed in earlier trials precisely due to risk of hyperkalaemia despite better surrogate improvement at higher doses. Thus, while not guideline‐recommended, using best judgement based on totality of evidence may be an option when designing trials.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone antagonist trial evidence — spironolactone and eplerenone — shows that in a "large-scale, long-term trial", adding low-dose spironolactone "starting at 12.5 mg daily" to ACEI therapy for NYHA class IV or class III (recently hospitalized) heart failure reduced mortality "from 46% to 35% (30% relative risk reduction) over 2 years", with a "35% reduction in HF hospitalization"; trial creatinine entry limits were "below 2.0 mg per dL" (pilot) and "below 2.5 mg per dL" (main). In myocardial infarction patients with "LVEF less than or equal to 40%" and HF or diabetes "within 14 days of MI", eplerenone decreased mortality "from 13.6% to 11.8% at 1 year", while hyperkalemia occurred in "5.5%" vs "3.9%" overall and "up to 10.1% versus 4.6%" when creatinine clearance was "less than 50 mL per min".

### Serious adverse events experienced by patients with chronic heart failure taking spironolactone [^a033571d]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

In patients with chronic heart failure, spironolactone added to conventional treatment may lead to serious and, occasionally, fatal hyperkalaemia. In some cases this seems to happen because spironolactone causes diarrhoea. Four cases involving men with New York Heart Association functional class III heart failure are presented. As these cases revealed, close monitoring of blood chemistry is mandatory after starting spironolactone, and patients should be advised to stop spironolactone immediately if diarrhoea develops.

Although patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF) represent nearly half of the population with chronic heart failure, few evidence-based medical therapies are available. The neutral overall results of the TOPCAT trial of spironolactone in HF-PEF leave clinicians who treat heart failure with an ongoing clinical dilemma. In this review, we outline an approach to the clinical management of the patient with HF-PEF synthesizing data from available clinical trials and expert consensus.

### Spironolactone metabolite concentrations in decompensated heart failure: insights from the ATHENA-HF trial [^0b8981b6]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

In Aldosterone Targeted Neurohormonal Combined with Natriuresis Therapy in Heart Failure (ATHENA-HF), high-dose spironolactone (100mg daily) did not improve efficacy endpoints over usual care [placebo or continued low-dose spironolactone (25mg daily) in patients already receiving spironolactone] in the treatment of acute heart failure (HF). We hypothesized that low concentrations of the long-acting active metabolites of spironolactone [canrenone and 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS)] in the high-dose group could have contributed to these neutral results.

Methods and Results

In patients randomized to high-dose spironolactone not previously treated with spironolactone (high-dose-naïve, n = 112), concentrations of canrenone and 7α-TMS increased at 48 and 96h compared to baseline, and between 48 and 96h (all P < 0.005), indicating that steady-state concentrations had not been reached by 48h. In patients previously on low-dose, high-dose spironolactone (high-dose-previous, n = 37), concentrations of canrenone increased at 48 and 96h compared to baseline (both P < 0.0005), with a marginal increase between 48 and 96h (P = 0.0507). At 48h, both high-dose groups had higher concentrations of both metabolites than the low-dose spironolactone group (P < 0.0001). Moreover, concentrations of both metabolites were higher in high-dose-previous vs. high-dose-naïve patients (P < 0.01), indicating that previous spironolactone use was significant, and that steady-state has not been reached in high-dose-naïve patients at 48h. We found limited and inconsistent evidence of correlation between metabolite concentrations and endpoints.

Conclusions

Lower-than-anticipated concentrations of spironolactone active metabolites were observed for at least 48h in the high-dose spironolactone group and may have contributed to the absence of pharmacological effects of spironolactone in the ATHENA-HF trial.

The study RALES was published by Pitt B and colleagues in 1999 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the RALES study, the trial question was: what is the role of spironolactone in patients with severe HF and a LVEF < 35% who were being treated with ACEi? In the RALES study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the RALES study, the population was: 1663 patients (446 female, 1217 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe HF and an LVEF < 35% who were being treated with ACEi. The key exclusion criteria were congenital heart disease, unstable angina, primary hepatic failure, active cancer, or any life-threatening disease (other than HF), or heart transplantation. In the RALES study, the interventions were: n = 822 spironolactone (25 mg daily) n = 841 placebo (matching placebo daily). In the RALES study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death at 24 months (35% vs. 46%; RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.82). In the RALES study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in frequency of hospitalization for worsening HF (26% vs. 35%; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.77) Significant increase in gynecomastia or breast pain (10% vs. 1%; RR 10, 95% CI 4.07 to 15.93). In the RALES study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious hyperkalemia. significant differences in gynecomastia or breast pain (10% vs. 1%, p < 0.001). In the RALES study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe HF and an LVEF < 35% who were being treated with ACEi, spironolactone was superior to placebo with respect to death at 24 months.

### Effectiveness and safety of spironolactone for systolic heart failure [^f579225e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Aldosterone receptor antagonists have been shown in randomized trials to reduce morbidity and mortality in adults with symptomatic systolic heart failure. We studied the effectiveness and safety of spironolactone in adults with newly diagnosed systolic heart failure in clinical practice. We identified all adults with newly diagnosed heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction of < 40%, and no previous spironolactone use from 2006 to 2008 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We excluded patients with baseline serum creatinine level of > 2.5 mg/dl or a serum potassium level of > 5.0 mEq/L. We used Cox regression with time-varying covariates to evaluate the independent association between spironolactone use and death, hospitalization, severe hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury. Among 2,538 eligible patients with a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 521 patients (22%) initiated spironolactone, which was not associated with risk of hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.08) or death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.93, confidence interval 0.60 to 1.44). Crude rates of severe hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury during spironolactone use were similar to that seen in clinical trials. Spironolactone was independently associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk of hyperkalemia but not with acute kidney injury. Within a diverse community-based cohort with incident systolic heart failure, use of spironolactone was not independently associated with risks of hospitalization or death. Our findings suggest that the benefits of spironolactone in clinical practice may be reduced compared with other guideline-recommended medications.

### Potassium binders for patients with heart failure? The real enlightenment of the DIAMOND trial [^1791deb6]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The RALES and EMPHASIS-HF trials

The RALES trial studied patients with severe HFrEF not generally receiving beta-blockers, who were randomized to spironolactone 25 mg/day or placebo for a mean of 24 months. In a pilot trial, doses from 12.5 mg/day to 75 mg/day had produced meaningful decreases in natriuretic peptides, with minimal incremental effect but more hyperkalaemia at doses > 25 mg/day. Accordingly, 25 mg/day was designated as the target dose for spironolactone in RALES, and it is the target dose in clinical practice. In RALES, 50 mg/day could be prescribed if, after 8 weeks, patients experienced progression of heart failure without hyperkalaemia. However, up-titration did not occur in most patients; the mean dose was 26 mg/day. At this dose, spironolactone reduced all-cause mortality by 30% and hospitalizations for heart failure by 35%. A serum potassium concentration ≥ 5.5 mmol/L was seen in 5.5% of the placebo group, in 13.5% taking 25 mg/day, and in 41% taking 50 mg daily. Serious hyperkalaemia was observed in 1–2% of patients.

The EMPHASIS-HF trial enrolled patients with mild HFrEF treated with beta-blockers, who received eplerenone 25 mg/day or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by 50 mg/day for a mean of 21 months, if they had preserved renal function. The doses were halved in those with chronic kidney disease. There is a 2:1 to 4:1 ratio between pharmacodynamically equivalent doses of eplerenone and spironolactone. Eplerenone reduced all-cause mortality by 24% and hospitalizations for heart failure by 42%. A serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mmol/L was reported in 7.2% and 11.8% of the placebo and eplerenone groups, respectively. A serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L was noted in ∼2%.

### Influence of age on efficacy and safety of Spironolactone in heart Failure [^14e006f4]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The authors examined efficacy and safety of spironolactone by age in the Americas region (N = 1,767) of the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist) trial.

Background

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction disproportionately affects older adults who may exhibit changes in physiology and variable pharmacokinetics.

Methods

TOPCAT enrolled patients with heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45% who were age 50 or older with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and prior heart failure hospitalization or elevated natriuretic peptide levels. Participants were randomized to spironolactone or placebo with a mean follow-up duration of 3.3 years. We assessed treatment effect and safety by protocol-defined age categories (< 65, 65 to 74, and ≥ 75 years).

Results

The mean age was 72 ± 10 years (range 50 to 97 years) with 41% over the age of 75 years. Participants ≥ 75 years were more commonly women and white and had a lower body mass index and estimated glomerular filtration rate compared with the younger age categories. Spironolactone reduced the primary composite outcome compared with placebo across all age categories (p interaction = 0.42). However, spironolactone was associated with an increased risk of the safety endpoint (hazard ratio: 2.54; 95% confidence interval: 1.91 to 3.37; p < 0.001), particularly in older age groups (p interaction = 0.02). Findings in the whole TOPCAT cohort were consistent with results from the Americas region.

Conclusions

In this post hoc, exploratory analysis of the TOPCAT trial data from the Americas region, although there was no effect of age on efficacy, there were considerable effects of age on increased rates of adverse safety outcomes. These results should be weighed when considering spironolactone for older heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients.

### Race influences the safety and efficacy of spironolactone in severe heart failure [^8964708b]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of hyperkalemia caused by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists may vary by race, but whether race influences efficacy of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in heart failure (HF) is unknown.

Methods and Results

We assessed hyperkalemia and outcomes in African Americans (AAs; n = 120) and non-AAs (n = 1543; white 93%) with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV HF and left ventricular dysfunction who were randomized to spironolactone, titrated to 25 or 50 mg daily or placebo, in the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES). AA participants were significantly younger, less likely to have an ischemic HF pathogenesis, more likely to be NYHA functional class IV, and more likely to have a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate and heart rate, less hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or history of myocardial infarction compared with non-AA participants. Potassium increased with spironolactone in non-AAs (4.29 ± 0.5–4.55 ± 0.49 mmol/L) but not in AAs (4.32 ± 0.54–4.31 ± 0.49 mmol/L; race by treatment interaction, P = 0.03) during the first month and remained higher throughout the trial. Compared with AAs, non-AAs were more likely to attain maximal spironolactone dose (13.9% versus 5.8%; P = 0.04) and had higher rates of hyperkalemia (potassium > 5.5 mmol/L; 9.7% versus 4.2%; P < 0.046), as well as lower rates of hypokalemia (potassium < 3.5 mmol/L; 5.6% versus 17.9%; P < 0.001). After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics and achieved study drug dose, spironolactone reduced the combined end point of death or hospitalization for HF in non-AAs (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.55–0.73) but not in AAs (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.67–1.71; P value for interaction = 0.032).

Conclusions

AAs with HF exhibited less hyperkalemia and more hypokalemia with spironolactone compared with non-AAs and seemed to derive less clinical benefit. These hypothesis-generating findings suggest that safety and efficacy of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists may differ by race.

Heart failure — risks of aldosterone antagonists: The major risk of aldosterone antagonists is hyperkalemia due to inhibition of potassium excretion, with incidence reported to be as high as 24% in one series in which half of hyperkalemic subjects had potassium levels in excess of 6 mEq per liter; in contrast, the large trial reported 2% but a preceding pilot trial observed 13% with a 25-mg dose and 20% with a 50-mg dose. After publication of trial results, a population-based analysis in Ontario of more than 30 000 patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) after a hospitalization for heart failure found spironolactone prescriptions more than tripled, with hospitalization for hyperkalemia increasing from 2.4 to 11 patients per thousand and associated mortality increasing from 0.3 to 2 per thousand. These observations lead to a strong recommendation for caution in the selection and monitoring of patients to be given aldosterone antagonists.

Mineralocorticoid antagonists in HFpEF — MRAs significantly improve measures of diastolic function in individuals with HFpEF, and spironolactone may reduce the risk of hospitalizations for HF in specific subsets of individuals with HFpEF; however, appropriate monitoring of potassium and kidney function are warranted to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia and worsening kidney function. In TOPCAT, 3,445 individuals with HF and LVEF ≥ 45% were randomized to spironolactone (15–45 mg daily) or placebo; the initially published results did not show a significant benefit in the primary composite outcome (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.77–1.04), although there was a significant reduction in hospitalization for HF (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.69–0.99).

### Spironolactone (Aldactone) [^a6cd7b72]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1.1	Heart Failure

ALDACTONE is indicated for treatment of NYHA Class III–IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure.

ALDACTONE is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies.

1.2	Hypertension

ALDACTONE is indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in patients who are not adequately controlled on other agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Practical use of aldosterone antagonists — patient selection and renal function–based dosing — emphasizes that some who meet trial criteria "may need to be excluded" in practice for recent renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia, particularly with insulin-requiring diabetes. In the elderly, "estimated creatinine clearance less than 50 mL per min should trigger a reduction of the initial dose of spironolactone to 12.5 mg daily or of eplerenone to 25 mg daily", and "aldosterone antagonists should not be given when creatinine is less than 30 mL per minute". Patients "chronically requiring high doses of diuretics without potassium replacement should be evaluated closely".

Spironolactone use for heart failure (HF) has increased dramatically after the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study trial; yet, few studies have examined its real-world impact. We aimed to determine the population effect of spironolactone use on mortality in HF patients discharged from hospital.

Methods and Results

All patients discharged alive between October 1997 and December 2001 in Nova Scotia, Canada, with a primary diagnosis of HF were enrolled in the Improving Cardiovascular Outcomes Study. Two year, all-cause mortality was the primary end point. A total of 7816 patients were identified, of whom 644 (8%) were discharged home on spironolactone. After adjusting for differences in clinical covariates, spironolactone use did not emerge as an independent predictor of long-term survival (OR 0.97, P = 0.80). When only the subgroup of patients enrolled in a HF clinic were included (n = 990), spironolactone use was associated with reduced rates of all-cause mortality at 2 years (OR 0.52, P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Although spironolactone use was not associated with improved long-term survival in the general HF population, it was associated with improved long-term survival in patients enrolled in HF clinics. These data highlight the challenges of knowledge translation from a clinical trial into practice.

### Changes in frailty based on minimally important difference and the impact of spironolactone on frailty in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: insights from the TOPCAT trial [^5e00b82d]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Data from the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trialdemonstrated that spironolactone reduced HF hospitalisations in HFpEF patients, with no attenuation of benefit by baseline frailty status. However, it remains unknown whether longitudinal frailty progression independently predicts clinical outcomes in HFpEF and whether spironolactone can modify frailty progression trajectories. Therefore, in this study, we will analyse spironolactone's effect on frailty changes using MID-based thresholds. Our objectives are: (1) to establish the MID for FI changes in TOPCAT's Americas cohort; (2) to assess the association between 1-year FI changes and adverse outcomes; and (3) to determine if spironolactone affects frailty severity versus placebo.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: integrating evidence into clinical practice [^ff04d784]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) improve survival and reduce morbidity in patients with heart failure, reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF), and mild-to-severe symptoms, and in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. These clinical benefits are observed in addition to those of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers. The morbidity and mortality benefits of MRAs may be mediated by several proposed actions, including antifibrotic mechanisms that slow heart failure progression, prevent or reverse cardiac remodelling, or reduce arrhythmogenesis. Both eplerenone and spironolactone have demonstrated survival benefits in individual clinical trials. Pharmacologic differences exist between the drugs, which may be relevant for therapeutic decision making in individual patients. Although serious hyperkalaemia events were reported in the major MRA clinical trials, these risks can be mitigated through appropriate patient selection, dose selection, patient education, monitoring, and follow-up. When used appropriately, MRAs significantly improve outcomes across the spectrum of patients with HF-REF.

### Under-utilization of evidence-based drug treatment in patients with heart failure is only partially explained by dissimilarity to patients enrolled in landmark trials: a report from the euro heart survey on heart failure [^de1c35b7]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Surveys on heart failure management suggest under-utilization of life-saving evidence-based treatment. Evidence-based medicine and clinical guidelines are based on the results of randomized controlled trials. Therefore, we investigated how patients who fulfilled the enrolment criteria of randomized trials were treated in real life.

Methods and Results

We selected three large placebo-controlled trials of patients with chronic heart failure, in which ACE-inhibitors (ACE-Is), beta-blockers, and spironolactone proved to be safe and effective. The major enrolment criteria of trials were identified and applied to patients enrolled in the Euro Heart Survey on Heart Failure to identify the proportion of patients eligible for treatment and also treated appropriately. Of the 10 701 patients who were enrolled in the Euro Heart Survey on Heart Failure, only a small percentage (13%) would have qualified for participation in at least one of the selected trials. Patients who fulfilled enrolment criteria of the identified trials were more likely to be treated with ACE-Is (83% of SOLVD-eligible patients), beta-blockers (54% of MERIT-HF-eligible patients), and aldosterone antagonists (43% of RALES-eligible patients) than trial-ineligible patients. Almost half of SOLVD-eligible patients who were treated with ACE-Is received the target dose as recommended in the guidelines, but only < 10% of MERIT-HF eligible patients who were treated with beta-blockers received the target dose.

Conclusion

ACE-Is are widely utilized but given in lower doses than proven effective in clinical trials. beta-Blockers are underused and given in lower doses to patients who fulfil the enrolment criteria of relevant landmark trials.

Aldosterone antagonists — initiation and monitoring: Spironolactone should be initiated at a dose of 12.5 to 25 mg daily, or occasionally on alternate days, and eplerenone was used at 25 mg per day, increasing to 50 mg daily. Potassium supplementation is generally stopped after initiation, patients should be counseled to avoid high potassium-containing foods, and patients should be cautioned to avoid the addition of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors. Potassium levels and renal function should be rechecked within 3 days and again at 1 week after initiation; subsequent monitoring should occur at least monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter, with any addition or increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) triggering a new cycle of monitoring. In view of hyperkalemia risk, the Writing Committee recommends that the routine triple combination of ACEIs, ARBs, and an aldosterone antagonist be avoided. The development of potassium levels in excess of 5.5 mEq per liter should generally trigger discontinuation or dose reduction of the aldosterone antagonist, and patients should be instructed specifically to stop the aldosterone antagonist during an episode of diarrhea or while loop diuretic therapy is interrupted.

### Rationale and design of the ATHENA-HF trial: aldosterone targeted neurohormonal combined with natriuresis therapy in heart failure [^eb94d4dc]. JACC: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Although therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) is recommended for patients with chronic heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction and in post-infarction HF, it has not been studied well in acute HF (AHF) despite being commonly used in this setting. At high doses, MRA therapy in AHF may relieve congestion through its natriuretic properties and mitigate the effects of adverse neurohormonal activation associated with intravenous loop diuretics. The ATHENA-HF (Aldosterone Targeted Neurohormonal Combined with Natriuresis Therapy in Heart Failure) trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of 100 mg/day spironolactone versus placebo (or continued low-dose spironolactone use in participants who are already receiving spironolactone at baseline) in 360 patients hospitalized for AHF. Patients are randomized within 24 h of receiving the first dose of intravenous diuretics. The primary objective is to determine if high-dose spironolactone, compared with standard care, will lead to greater reductions in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels from randomization to 96 h. The secondary endpoints include changes in the clinical congestion score, dyspnea relief, urine output, weight change, loop diuretic dose, and in-hospital worsening HF. Index hospital length of stay and 30-day clinical outcomes will be assessed. Safety endpoints include risk of hyperkalemia and renal function. Differences among patients with reduced versus preserved ejection fraction will be determined.

### The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): rationale and design [^371a28ca]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

‐intervention, study visits and follow‐up

Patients are randomized 1:1 to open‐label MRA (either spironolactone or eplerenone) plus usual care versus usual care alone. Patients randomized to MRA receive a prescription to be filled and paid for out of pocket. (In both Sweden and the US, spironolactone can be obtained for approximately 10 US cents per day. In Sweden, patients pay out‐of‐pocket for prescription medications up to an annual maximum of approximately 250 Euro, after which additional medication costs are covered by the government). Spironolactone is more potent than eplerenone, but the initial dose in guidelines and clinical practice is generally 25 mg/day for both drugs and is the dose recommended in SPIRRIT‐HFpEF. A dose of 25 mg every other day or 25 mg, half tablet every day, may be prescribed at investigator discretion for patients judged to be at higher risk of hyperkalaemia or kidney dysfunction. Patients who at baseline are known not to tolerate spironolactone due to gynecomastia or who prefer eplerenone will be prescribed eplerenone. Eplerenone is relatively inexpensive, although more expensive than spironolactone. Spironolactone (or eplerenone) is recommended to be increased to a target dose of 50 mg daily if tolerated.

Most previous RRCTs in Sweden have involved one‐time interventions (i.e. not chronic therapy) without the need for monitoring during follow‐up. Spironolactone is familiar to all clinicians but is associated with a risk of hyperkalaemia and worsening kidney function. Therefore, there are no required in‐person follow‐up visits in the trial, but potassium and eGFR are measured for all patients in both groups at local laboratories at weeks 1, 4, 26, and 52 after randomization, at end of study, 7–14 days after any dose changes, and as needed at the discretion of the investigator. Local sites order blood tests, instruct patients to have blood drawn at their local clinic, and these laboratory results are then available to investigators in Sweden from regional electronic health records, and in the US laboratory data are acquired from site investigators from individual testing sites and/or the electronic medical record. After obtaining the laboratory result, the investigator or study coordinator has telephone contact with the patient and provides instruction on continued treatment and records any events, laboratory values, and treatment decisions in a separate case report form.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^26d39415]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Natriuresis and diuresis in chronic HF

The use of spironolactone to elicit increases in natriuresis have been well-described. Short-term spironolactone treatment increased urinary sodium excretion, resulting in decreases in net sodium balance, body weight, and neurohormonal activation in HF patients abstaining from diuretic use. Furthermore, in severe HF patients with diuretic resistance, evident from persistent congestion despite maximal tolerable doses of loop diuretics and ACE inhibition, the addition of spironolactone further increased sodium excretion and decreased body weight, collectively supporting diuretic and natriuretic properties of spironolactone. MR antagonists also cause reductions in natriuretic hormones (Table 1). A secondary analysis of the RALES trial demonstrated that spironolactone decreased BNP following 3 months of treatment. Further, both eplerenone and finerenone elicited comparable reductions in NT-proBNP following 3 months in HFrEF patients, while spironolactone decreased NT-proBNP following 9 months in HFpEF patients.

Synonymous to SGLT2 inhibitors, the rapid time to statistical benefit (20 days) in the composite endpoints in HFrEF patients prescribed MR antagonists suggests that the mechanisms responsible for cardioprotection are promptly activated following treatment initiation. While the fast-acting diuretic effects may intuitively represent an important mediator, it is important to recognize that MR antagonists also possess anti-hypertrophic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects that largely mediate the cardiovascular benefits noted in clinical trials. Importantly, there is evidence to support that these mechanisms represent the primary actions responsible for long-term cardiovascular benefit of MR antagonists, as opposed to the natriuretic and diuretic properties. For example, in a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial, patients treated with spironolactone required lower doses of furosemide and thiazide diuretics compared to placebo. However, reductions in HF hospitalization were not solely explained by indices of diuresis, suggesting that non-diuretic mechanisms were responsible for mediating the observed clinical benefit. Furthermore, spironolactone elicited improvements in mortality most clearly observed in patients with the lowest NT-proBNP. Therefore, steroidal MR antagonists may have natriuretic and diuretic effects but the contribution of these changes to the overall cardiovascular benefit noted in dedicated clinical trials is unclear.

### NCT06021860 | A phase IV, two-part, open-label study assessing… [^6e620b5f]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Overview This is a 2-part, 2 periods per part, open-label study with spironolactone oral suspension in pediatric patients with edema due to heart failure or hepatic cirrhosis. Both study parts will evaluate the safety, PK and PD of multiple doses of spironolactone. In Part 1 of the study, a single dose of spironolactone oral suspension will be administered. In Part 2 of the study, a low and a high dose of spironolactone oral suspension will be selected based on the results of Part 1, and will be administered to patients. For these patients the study will begin with a multiple-dose period, where patients will be administered a once-daily 1. 5 mg/kg dose of spironolactone oral suspension for a total of 10 days. There will then be a 30-day follow-up period.

Following the conclusion of Groups 1 though 3 in the multiple-dose period of Part 1 of the study, a Safety Review Committee will review all data from Groups 1 though 3 and determine whether and how the study should proceed. Nine patients in each group will be assigned a low dose of spironolactone oral suspension, and 9 patients will be assigned to a high dose. These patients will proceed as described in Part 1, with a multiple-dose period where spironolactone oral suspension is administered QD at either a low or high dose for a total of 10 days, followed by a 30-day follow-up period. Following the conclusion of Groups 1 through 3 in the multiple-dose period of Part 2, eighteen patients aged from birth to < 2 years of age will be enrolled into Group 4. Nine patients will be assigned to a low dose of spironolactone oral suspension, and 9 patients will be assigned to a high dose.

As described for Part 1, these patients will begin the study with a single-dose period during which they will be administered a single dose of spironolactone oral suspension and then followed for 7 days before being administered a QD dose, for a total of 10 days. There will then be a 30-day follow-up period. Drug: Spironolactone Oral Suspension

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^703f8a2f]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — spironolactone (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist): In TOPCAT, the composite of death, aborted cardiac death, and HF hospitalization showed a small, non-significant reduction (HR, 0.89), while HF hospitalization was reduced (HR, 0.83) and hyperkalemia and creatinine increases were more common; efficacy was observed in the Americas (HR 0.83) but not Russia-Georgia (HR 1.10). Analyses suggest potential benefit in appropriately selected symptomatic HFpEF patients meeting LVEF ≥ 45%, elevated BNP or HF admission within 1 year, eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, creatinine < 2.5 mg/dL, and potassium < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and follow-up; post hoc analysis suggested greater efficacy at the lower end of the LVEF spectrum.

### Usefulness of spironolactone in a specialized heart failure clinic [^4d0f8103]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Several case series published after the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) have focused on the adverse effects of spironolactone when prescribed to participants not in a trial and the appropriateness of these prescribing practices; however, there is a paucity of data on potential benefits in patients not in a trial. Therefore, we examined data from a prospective cohort study of 1,037 patients with heart failure seen at the University of Alberta Heart Function Clinic. Median age was 69 years, 66% were men, 75% had systolic dysfunction, and mean ejection fraction was 33%. Only 40% of the 136 patients prescribed spironolactone had New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms, and < 25% fulfilled all of the RALES eligibility criteria. Mean daily dose of spironolactone was 23.9 mg; 25% of patients had spironolactone withdrawn after initiation, mostly due to increases in potassium and/or creatinine (9%), gynecomastia (5%), or dehydration/hyponatremia (6%). Only 1 of our spironolactone-treated patients developed serum potassium > 6 mmol/L. Cox's proportional hazards analysis confirmed the association between use of spironolactone and increased survival rate (relative risk 0.09, 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.39), even though 78% of our patients did not fulfill the RALES eligibility criteria. Thus, although the complication rate was higher, the benefits of spironolactone seen in RALES extended to participants not in a trial who were treated with similar doses and followed closely in a clinic specializing in heart failure.

### Influence of ejection fraction on outcomes and efficacy of spironolactone in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^39c46f69]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

While mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have been shown to benefit patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), spironolactone did not reduce the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, or aborted cardiac arrest in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the TOPCAT trial, which enrolled patients with LVEF of 45% or greater. We utilized data from TOPCAT to assess the relationship between LVEF as well as outcomes and efficacy of spironolactone.

Methods and Results

We assessed differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes across LVEF categories in 3444 patients with HFpEF, and determined whether LVEF modified the treatment effect of spironolactone. Ejection fraction ranged from 44 to 85%. Patients with higher ejection fraction were older, more likely to be female, less likely to have a history of myocardial infarction, and more likely to have a history of hypertension and diabetes. The incidence of the primary endpoint and cardiovascular death was highest in patients at the lower end of the ejection fraction spectrum. Ejection fraction modified the spironolactone treatment effect, particularly in the patients enrolled in the Americas, for the primary outcome (P = 0.046) and for heart failure hospitalization (P = 0.039), with stronger estimated benefits of spironolactone at the lower end of the ejection fraction spectrum with respect to the primary endpoint (LVEF < 50%: HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.50, 1.05; LVEF ≥ 60%: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76, 1.23) and heart failure hospitalization (LVEF < 50%: HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.46, 1.27; LVEF ≥ 60%: HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.74, 1.30).

Conclusion

In patients with HFpEF enrolled in TOPCAT, patient characteristics and outcomes varied substantially by LVEF. The potential efficacy of spironolactone was greatest at the lower end of the LVEF spectrum.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what is the 'right' dose? [^55b063ec]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

It is also important to consider the actual dose in the treatment arms in the two larger trials – in ATLAS these were 4.5 versus 33.2 mg of lisinopril and in HEAAL 46 versus 129 mg of losartan. Here ATLAS is perhaps most striking in suggesting that even a small dose (one‐seventh of the higher dose) preserves much of the benefit of a larger dose of an ACE inhibitor. However, we still have the problem of knowing what dose of enalapril or candesartan 4.5 mg of lisinopril is equivalent to. There are no satisfactory comparisons of doses of lisinopril and enalapril, or doses of lisinopril and candesartan, in people with heart failure. However, the data that do exist, and comparisons in hypertension, suggest that the low dose of lisinopril used in ATLAS was probably equivalent to less than 10 mg of enalapril. Of interest, in both HEAAL and ATLAS, the proportion of patients who discontinued study drugs did not differ between the high and low‐dose groups. In both trials, hypotension, renal dysfunction and hyperkalaemia occurred more frequently in the higher dose group but there was no significant excess of discontinuation for any of these reasons in the higher dose group in either trial.

Although three trials comparing doses of beta‐blockers showed a greater increase in left ventricular ejection fraction with bigger doses, each was small and reported too few deaths and hospital admissions (or reported these incompletely) to draw any meaningful conclusion about a dose‐related effect on outcomes. Two of these trials compared carvedilol over a wide daily dose range (5 to 50 mg). The other trial compared 12.5, 50 and 200 mg bucindolol daily with placebo.

Similarly, there are no formal dose comparisons for MRAs that have examined clinical outcomes, although the stratified analysis of EMPHASIS‐HF is discussed above (Table 3). The choice of dose of spironolactone for the RALES trial was based on the reduction in N‐terminal pro atrial natriuretic peptide level (as a surrogate for efficacy) and increase in potassium (safety assessment).

Table 1
Key heart failure with preserved and mildly reduced ejection fraction randomized trials targeting the aldosterone–mineralocorticoid receptor pathway as of 2024

Thus, based on the mechanisms involved in HFpEF, the fact that MRAs target these mechanisms, their proven efficacy in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and the suggestive but inconclusive findings in TOPCAT post‐hoc analyses, there is a need for an outcome trial of MRAs in HFpEF and also in HFmrEF. Therefore, the first objective of Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (SPIRRIT‐HFpEF) is to assess whether the initiation of spironolactone or eplerenone plus standard care compared to standard care alone improves outcomes in patients with HFpEF.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone) to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II-IV symptoms if the eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L. Obtain careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and closely monitor thereafter to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency.

### Potassium binders for patients with heart failure? The real enlightenment of the DIAMOND trial [^1b99e1c5]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The terror of hyperkalaemia and the advent of new potassium binders

The results of these two trials established MRAs as foundational drugs for HFrEF. Yet, in clinical practice, only ∼15–30% of patients with heart failure receive an MRA, because of fears that serious hyperkalaemia is common and life-threatening. Juurlink et al. reported an excess of hyperkalaemia-associated hospitalizations and deaths following the publication of the RALES trial. This risk was attributed to the use of inappropriately high doses of spironolactone, the lack of serum potassium monitoring, and the use of potassium supplements in many patients. Trevisan et al.confirmed the risk of serious hyperkalaemia with spironolactone > 25 mg/day and reported that, at the first sign of hyperkalaemia, practitioners generally stopped spironolactone permanently — instead of reducing the dose, as was done in RALES and EMPHASIS-HF.

Potassium binders have been used to reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of potassium for decades, and agents with enhanced tolerability (e.g. patiromer) have been developed. Patiromer reduces the risk of hyperkalaemia in chronic kidney diseaseand, in the PEARL-HF trial, patients with HFrEF (enriched for the risk of hyperkalaemia) were randomized to patiromer or placebo to determine if treatment might enhance the tolerability of spironolactone 50 mg/day. After 4 weeks, patiromer-treated patients were more likely to be receiving 50 mg/day (91% vs. 74%), but the between-group difference was not striking. Nevertheless, the use of patiromer might allow more HFrEF patients to receive the highest doses of MRAs. If very high MRA doses are superior to lower doses in preventing major heart failure outcomes, patiromer might facilitate MRA-mediated decreases in death and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with prior hyperkalaemia.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and beta-blocker initiation — refractory heart failure (HF): treatment with either type of drug should not be initiated in patients who have systolic blood pressures less than 80 mm Hg or who have signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, and patients should not be started on a beta-blocker if they have significant fluid retention or if they recently required treatment with an intravenous positive inotropic agent. Treatment with an ACEI or beta-blocker should be initiated in very low doses, and patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of intolerance, and clinical trials suggest that even low doses may provide important benefits. For patients who cannot tolerate ACEIs or beta-blockers, a combination of nitrates and hydralazine has been reported to have favorable effects on survival in mild to moderate symptoms not taking an ACEI or beta-blocker. Spironolactone has been reported to prolong life and reduce HF hospitalization in advanced disease, but the evidence was derived in patients with preserved renal function, and the drug can produce dangerous hyperkalemia in impaired renal function. Although angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are frequently considered as alternatives to ACEIs because of the low incidence of cough and angioedema, it is not clear that ARBs are as effective as ACEIs, and they are as likely as ACEIs to produce hypotension or renal insufficiency.

### Routine spironolactone in acute myocardial infarction [^ca50cce6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study CLEAR (spironolactone) was published by Sanjit S Jolly and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the trial question was: what is the role of spironolactone in patients with myocardial infarction? In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the population was: 7062 patients (1438 female, 5624 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with myocardial infarction who had undergone PCI. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; pregnancy or lactation; SBP < 90 mmHg; active diarrhea; known allergy or contraindication to everolimus; unable to receive dual antiplatelet therapy; contraindication to spironolactone; cirrhosis or current severe hepatic disease. In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the interventions were: n = 3537 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg once daily) n = 3525 placebo (matching placebo). In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes or new or worsening HF (1.7/100 py vs. 2.1/100 py; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.21). In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in first occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, new or worsening HF, or death from cardiovascular causes (7.9% vs. 8.3%; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.81 to 1.13) No significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (3.2% vs. 3.3%; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.27) No significant difference in new or worsening HF (1.6% vs. 2.4%; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.16). In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death from renal causes, dialysis, renal transplantation, or a sustained drop of at least 40% in the eGFR. significant difference in gynecomastia (2.3% vs. 0.5%). In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the conclusion was: in patients with myocardial infarction who had undergone PCI, spironolactone was not superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes or new or worsening HF.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1066d0f7]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, an MRA (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and thereafter. In this population, MRA therapy provides high economic value. In patients taking MRA whose serum potassium cannot be maintained at < 5.5 mEq/L, MRA should be discontinued to avoid life-threatening hyperkalemia. MRAs show consistent improvement in all-cause mortality, HF hospitalizations, and SCD in HFrEF, and eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L are contraindications to MRA initiation.

Aspirations and findings of the DIAMOND trial

The DIAMOND trial (published in this issue of the European Heart Journal) was designed to test this hypothesis. Patients with HFrEF and a serum potassium concentration > 5.0 mmol/L or who had had a reduction in the dose or discontinuation of a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor or MRA because of hyperkalaemia within 12 months entered a run-in period, during which they received (i) spironolactone 50 mg/day or eplerenone 50 mg/day while taking other renin–angiotensin system inhibitors at ≥ 50% of target dose; and (ii) patiromer (8.4–25.2 g/day). The doses of eplerenone and spironolactone did not follow the expected 2:1 to 4:1 ratio. If patients had a serum potassium ≥ 4.0 and ≤ 5.0 mmol/L at the end of the run-in period, they were randomized to continue patiromer or be switched to placebo (double-blind) and be followed for the trial's duration. If hyperkalaemia was subsequently observed, investigators were asked (whenever possible) to reduce the dose of (while maintaining treatment with) the MRA, as was done in the RALES and EMPHASIS-HF trials. The original primary endpoint was cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, with a plan to treat 2388 patients for ∼2.5 years. When faced with slow event accrual, the investigators heroically salvaged the trial by refocusing it on changes in serum potassium concentration in 878 patients who had been followed for a median of 27 weeks.

### Association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^362a613b]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist randomized clinical trial of spironolactone for patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction of 50% or greater, β-blocker use was associated with a higher risk of heart failure hospitalizations compared with patients not taking β-blockers. This association was not present among patients with an ejection fraction between 45% and 49%.

Meaning

Prospective studies of the role β-blockers play in heart failure among patients with a preserved ejection fraction appears to be warranted to clarify the effectiveness of these drugs for patients with an ejection fraction of 50% or greater.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and potential for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major and growing public health concern with limited treatment options. HFpEF is defined as HF with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%.HF with a reduced ejection fraction has previously been defined as LVEF < 40% and more recently ≤ 40%. Trials in HFpEF have generally included HFpEF but also patients with HF with mid‐range or mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), defined as LVEF 40–49% and more recently 41–49%.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is thought to be characterized in part by comorbidity‐driven systemic inflammation, microvascular endothelial dysfunction, and fibrosis, leading to increased cardiomyocyte, interstitial and vascular stiffness, resulting in the HF syndrome despite a preserved or normal ejection fraction. Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors reduce these maladaptive processes, but five HFpEF randomized controlled trials (RCTs) targeting the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system did not meet their primary endpoints. As of 2024, only sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 and 1 inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of HF hospitalizations or cardiovascular (CV) death in HFpEF.

In the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial, enrolling patients with signs and symptoms of HF, an LVEF ≥ 45%, and either recent HF hospitalization or elevated natriuretic peptides (NPs), spironolactone did not significantly reduce the composite of death from CV causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF. However, post‐hoc analyses of patients randomized in North and South Americaand of patients included based on NPssuggested that spironolactone may be effective in reducing the composite of HF hospitalization and CV death. Nevertheless, conclusive evidence to recommend mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in HFpEF is still lacking. A trial with the non‐steroidal MRA finerenone in HFpEF and HFmrEF is currently ongoing. A summary of key completed and ongoing trials in HFpEF/HFmrEF targeting the aldosterone–mineralocorticoid receptor pathway is shown in Table 1.

### Spironolactone and outcomes in older patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^24283c42]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists or aldosterone antagonists in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is well known. Less is known about their effectiveness in real-world older patients with HFrEF.

Methods

Of the 8206 patients with heart failure and ejection fraction ≤ 35% without prior spironolactone use in the Medicare-linked OPTIMIZE-HF registry, 6986 were eligible for spironolactone therapy based on serum creatinine criteria (men ≤ 2.5 mg/dL, women ≤ 2.0 mg/dL) and 865 received a discharge prescription for spironolactone. Using propensity scores for spironolactone use, we assembled a matched cohort of 1724 (862 pairs) patients receiving and not receiving spironolactone, balanced on 58 baseline characteristics (Creatinine Cohort: mean age, 75 years, 42% women, 17% African American). We repeated the above process to assemble a secondary matched cohort of 1638 (819 pairs) patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (eGFR Cohort: mean age, 75 years, 42% women, 17% African American).

Results

In the matched Creatinine Cohort, spironolactone-associated hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for all-cause mortality, heart failure readmission, and combined endpoint of heart failure readmission or all-cause mortality were 0.92 (0.81–1.03), 0.87 (0.77–0.99), and 0.87 (0.79–0.97), respectively. Respective hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) in the matched eGFR Cohort were 0.87 (0.77–0.98), 0.92 (0.80–1.05), and 0.91 (0.82–1.02).

Conclusions

These findings provide evidence of consistent, albeit modest, clinical effectiveness of spironolactone in older patients with HFrEF regardless of renal eligibility criteria used. Additional strategies are needed to improve the effectiveness of aldosterone antagonists in clinical practice.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^70fefb10]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important cause of increased mortality and morbidity through increased cardiovascular events and progression to kidney failure, despite current therapies –. It is a major and under-recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Indeed, people with CKD are at higher risk of death from CVD than they are from kidney failure. Although the risks of myocardial infarction and other manifestations of coronary artery disease are increased in CKD, the pattern of CVD is atypical, with a much greater incidence of heart failure and sudden cardiac death than seen in the wider population with CVD.

The severity of CKD can be defined based on reductions in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), from stages 1 to 5, with stage 5 being the most severe. CKD can separately be categorized based on the presence of albumin in the urine and a raised albumin creatinine ratio (ACR). There is a graded inverse relationship between cardiovascular risk and deteriorating kidney function independent of age, sex and other risk factors, whether measured by raised serum creatinine, the eGFR or ACR –. While the cardiovascular risk of end-stage CKD is extreme, in public health terms, the burden resides in early-stage (CKD stages 1–3) disease, which is more prevalent. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported the prevalence of CKD stages 1–3 was 15% and the prevalence of CKD stages 4 and 5 was 0.5%. Stage 3 CKD is subcategorized into stages 3a (eGFR = 45–59 mL min −1 1.73 m − 2) and stage 3b (eGFR = 30–44 mL min −1 1.73 m − 2), partly because of the recognition that people with stage 3b CKD are at increased risk of cardiovascular events compared to those with Stage 3a.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^c8ac0cb5]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a substantial risk of progression to end-stage renal disease and vascular events. The nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), finerenone, offers cardiorenal protection for people with CKD and diabetes, but there is uncertainty if the steroidal MRA, spironolactone, provides the same protection. In this prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint trial, we assessed the effectiveness of 25mg spironolactone in addition to usual care or usual care alone for reducing cardiovascular outcomes in stage 3b CKD among an older community cohort (mean age = 74.8years and s.d. = 8.1). We recruited 1,434 adults from English primary care, of whom 1,372 (96%) were included in the primary analysis. The primary outcome was time from randomization until the first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease, stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack or peripheral arterial disease, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline. Across 3years of follow-up, the primary endpoint occurred in 113 of 677 participants randomized to spironolactone (16.7%) and 111 of 695 participants randomized to usual care (16.0%) with no significant difference between groups (hazard ratio = 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.81–1.37). Two-thirds of participants randomized to spironolactone stopped treatment within 6months, predominantly because they met prespecified safety stop criteria. The most common reason for stopping spironolactone was a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate that met prespecified stop criteria (n = 239, 35.4%), followed by participants being withdrawn due to treatment side effects (n = 128, 18.9%) and hyperkalemia (n = 54, 8.0%). In conclusion, we found that spironolactone was frequently discontinued due to safety concerns, with no evidence that it reduced cardiovascular outcomes in people with stage 3b CKD. Spironolactone should not be used for people with stage 3b CKD without another explicit treatment indication. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: ISRCTN44522369.

Efficacy endpoints

There was no significant interaction between the subgroups with HF and without HF (P = 0.8085) for the primary endpoint. In the HF subgroup, 68.1% of patients receiving placebo remained on spironolactone at week 12 (Figure 1), compared with 84.1% of patients receiving patiromer [between‐group absolute difference 16.0%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8–30.2; P = 0.0504]. Among patients without HF, 64.6% of patients in the placebo group remained on spironolactone at week 12, compared with 86.9% of patients in the patiromer group (between‐group absolute difference 22.4%, 95% CI 9.6–35.1; P = 0.0006). The Kaplan–Meier estimates of the time to early discontinuation of spironolactone are shown in Figure 2.

In the HF group, 59% in the placebo group and 76% in the patiromer group were receiving the 50 mg once daily dose of spironolactone at week 12 (44% and 64% in the subgroup without HF, respectively). Median (Q1, Q3) daily doses of patiromer were 8.5 (8.4, 16.0) g/day and 11.9 (8.4, 16.0) g/day in patients with and without HF, respectively.

Resurrection of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

Summary of key clinical trials in cardiac diseases

Despite preclinical data on BP lowering and cardiorenal protection, it was not until 1999 that the first seminal trial with spironolactone in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was published. Results of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES; N = 1663) showed that spironolactone (∼25 mg/day) reduced the risk of death by 30% vs. placebo [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60–0.82; P < 0.001) in patients with HFrEF New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III–IV [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 35%). The effects were so robust that the trial was stopped prematurely for efficacy. Incidences of progressive HF and sudden death were reduced; HR for hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) was 0.65; and NYHA class improved. However, rates of breast pain and gynaecomastia increased (10% with spironolactone vs. 1% with placebo).

The major limitation of aldosterone blockade with spironolactone was hyperkalaemia. In 2004, a pharmacoepidemiological study noted an increased incidence of hyperkalaemia after the RALES publication; this also correlated with an increase in prescription of spironolactone. The increased incidence of hyperkalaemia was likely related to spironolactone use in patients who would have been excluded from RALES [i.e. those with low estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR)], and to the use of higher spironolactone doses than that used in RALES. A more judicious use of spironolactone and closer patient monitoring may reduce the occurrence of hyperkalaemia.

Eplerenone was subsequently developed as a more selective version of spironolactone, with another seminal trial to test its effects among myocardial infarction (MI) patients with an LVEF ≤ 40% and symptomatic HF. Results of the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS; N = 6642) showed that eplerenone was associated with a 15% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo and a 13% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular (CV) mortality or hospitalization due to CV causes compared with placebo.

### Spironolactone (Aldactone) [^33a1a088]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1663 patients were randomized 1:1 to spironolactone or placebo. 87% of patients were white, 7% black, 2% Asian. 73% were male and median age was 67. The median ejection fraction was 26%. 70% were NYHA class III and 29% class IV. The etiology of heart failure was ischemic in 55%, and non-ischemic in 45%. There was a history of myocardial infarction in 28%, of hypertension in 24%, and of diabetes in 22%. The median baseline serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL and the median baseline creatinine clearance was 57 mL/min.

At baseline 100% of patients were taking loop diuretic and 95% were taking an ACE inhibitor. Other medications used at any time during the study included digoxin (78%), anticoagulants (58%), aspirin (43%), and beta-blockers (15%).

The primary endpoint for RALES was time to all-cause mortality. RALES was terminated early because of significant mortality benefit demonstrated during a planned interim analysis. Compared to placebo, spironolactone reduced the risk of death by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 40%). Spironolactone also reduced the risk of hospitalization for cardiac causes (defined as worsening heart failure, angina, ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction) by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 41%).

The survival curves by treatment group are shown in Figure 1.

Mortality hazard ratios for some subgroups are shown in Figure 2. The favorable effect of spironolactone on mortality appeared similar for both genders and all age groups except patients younger than 55. There were too few non-whites in RALES to evaluate if the effects differ by race. Spironolactone's benefit appeared greater in patients with low baseline serum potassium levels and less in patients with ejection fractions < 0.2. These subgroup analyses must be interpreted cautiously.

### Spironolactone and resistant hypertension in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^7e72f1e8]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recent evidence suggests that the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone should be the preferred fourth-line antihypertensive treatment in resistant hypertension (RHTN). Whether spironolactone improves blood pressure (BP) control in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and RHTN is unknown.

Methods

We identified patients with RHTN, defined as baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 140 and 160 mm Hg on 3 or more medications, in the Americas cohort of the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist trial, in which patients with HFpEF were randomized to spironolactone vs. placebo. We evaluated the effects of spironolactone vs. placebo on BP reduction in this group and related this to the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for heart failure.

Results

We identified 403 participants in the Americas with RHTN. Compared to people without RHTN, those with RHTN were more frequently women, non-White, diabetics, with a higher left ventricular ejection fraction and body mass index, and a lower hemoglobin concentration. In the RHTN group, spironolactone resulted in a decrease of SBP: -6.1 (-8.9, -3.3); P < 0.001 and diastolic BP: -2.9 (-4.6, -1.2); P = 0.001 mm Hg during the first 8 months. BP became controlled after 4 weeks in 63% of patients receiving spironolactone vs. 46% receiving placebo (P = 0.003), with similar responses at 8 weeks, 4 and 8 months. Patients with RHTN derived similar overall benefit from spironolactone on the primary outcomes as those without.

Conclusions

In HFpEF patients with RHTN, spironolactone lowered BP substantially and was associated with similar benefit as those without RHTN.

In addition, the recruiting physician could discontinue a participant from the study treatment at any time if it was considered necessary for any reason, including the following general rules:
Ineligibility (either arising during the study or retrospectively having been overlooked at screening).
Significant protocol deviation as judged by the trial physician.
Significant noncompliance with treatment regimen or study requirements.
An adverse event that requires discontinuation of the study medication or results in the inability to continue to comply with study procedures.
Disease progression that requires discontinuation of the study medication or results in the inability to continue to comply with study procedures.
Lost to follow-up.

Each participant also had the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the time from randomization until the first occurrence of any of the following events: death, hospitalization for heart disease (coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, sudden death or failed sudden death, defined as a cardiac arrest where the participant was successfully resuscitated), stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack or PAD, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline.

Prespecified secondary outcomes included changes in blood pressure, natriuretic peptides, ACR and eGFR recorded in the primary care record across follow-up, as well as rates of adverse events, including hyperkalemia and hypotension. Hyperkalemia was considered serum potassium of 5.5 mmol l −1 or greater, subcategorized as 5.5–5.9 mmol l −1, 6.0–6.4 mmol l −1 and ≥ 6.5 mmol l −1. Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or a drop in the systolic pressure of > 20 mm Hg on standing. Progression of kidney disease was defined as a ≥ 30% increase in creatinine from baseline, a drop of ≥ 25% in eGFR from baseline or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR from the previous result.

An independent panel of three senior clinicians adjudicated each of the endpoints, using all the available clinical information independently of each other, with discussion determining the endpoint where there was initial disagreement.

### Sex differences in outcomes and responses to spironolactone in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of TOPCAT trial [^0f736d3b]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to investigate sex differences in outcomes and responses to spironolactone in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Background

HFpEF affects women more frequently than men. Sex differences in responses to effects of mineralocorticoid antagonists have not been reported.

Methods

This was an exploratory, post hoc, non-pre-specified analysis of the TOPCAT (Aldosterone Antagonist Therapy for Adults With Heart Failure and Preserved Systolic Function) trial. Subjects with symptomatic HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45% were randomized to spironolactone or placebo therapy. Subjects enrolled from the Americas were analyzed. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular (CV) death, cardiac arrest, or HF hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, CV, and non-CV mortality and CV, HF, and non-CV hospitalization. Sex differences in outcomes and treatment effects were determined using time-to-event analysis.

Results

In total, 882 of 1,767 subjects (49.9%) were women. Women were older with fewer comorbidities but worse patient-reported outcomes. There were no sex differences in outcomes in the placebo arm or in response to spironolactone for the primary outcome or its components. Spironolactone therapy was associated with reduced all-cause mortality in women (hazard ratio: 0.66; p = 0.01) but not in men (p interaction = 0.02).

Conclusions

In TOPCAT, women and men presented with different clinical profiles and similar clinical outcomes. The interaction between spironolactone and sex in TOPCAT overall and in the present analysis was nonsignificant for the primary outcome, but there was a reduction in all-cause mortality associated with spironolactone therapy in women, with a significant interaction between sex and treatment arm. Prospective evaluation is needed to determine whether spironolactone therapy may be effective for treatment of HFpEF in women.

### Incidence, predictors, and outcomes related to hypo-and hyperkalemia in patients with severe heart failure treated with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist [^6052acb2]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure but can cause hyperkalemia, which contributes to reduced use of these drugs. Hypokalemia also leads to worse outcomes in patients with heart failure and may be attenuated by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Methods and Results

We assessed incidence and predictors of hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) and hypokalemia (potassium < 3.5 mmol/L) and the relationship to outcomes in 1663 patients with class III or IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% randomized to treatment with spironolactone 25 mg or placebo in the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) trial. All-cause mortality rates and the influence of potassium levels on the effectiveness of spironolactone were assessed in a landmark analysis and in relation to time-varying potassium levels. After 1 month, mean potassium levels increased in the spironolactone group but not in the placebo group (4.54 ± 0.49 versus 4.28 ± 0.50 mmol/L; P < 0.001) and remained elevated during the trial. Although the extremes of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia at 4 weeks were associated with increased risk of mortality in both treatment arms, participants in the spironolactone arm had lower mortality rates at all potassium levels throughout the duration of the trial. The treatment benefit of spironolactone was maintained at least until potassium exceeded 5.5 mmol/L.

Conclusions

With appropriate surveillance of potassium and creatinine, the use of spironolactone was associated with less hypokalemia and improved survival in patients with severe heart failure even in the setting of moderate hyperkalemia.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, blood pressure, and outcomes in heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction [^a8bfbf91]. JACC: Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

As in other HFrEF trials examining the effect of different heart failure medications on SBP, patients in RALES and EMPHASIS-HF with the lowest baseline SBP experienced an increase in SBP after randomization in both treatment groups, although the increase was smaller in the MRA group. In contrast, patients with higher SBP experienced a decrease in SBP after randomization, although more so with MRA treatment than with placebo. This likely reflects the phenomenon of "regression to the mean".

It is also of interest to compare the present findings in patients with HFrEF with those with spironolactone in HF with preserved EF (HFpEF), where patients often have a hypertensive background and usually have a higher SBP than individuals with HFrEF. In patients from North and South America enrolled in the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist) trial, baseline SBP was 129 mm Hg. At 4 months, the change from baseline was +0.94 ± SE 0.6) mm Hg in the placebo group and −2.75 ± SE 0.6, giving a difference of −3.69 ± SE 0.86 mm Hg (p < 0.001).

In the present study, patients in the lowest SBP group had a similar relative risk reduction in all outcomes of interest with MRA treatment, as patients with a higher SBP. This is relevant because many physicians are concerned about prescribing drugs with a hypotensive effect to heart failure patients with low blood pressure, potentially depriving them of the mortality benefit of these treatments. Indeed, applying the overall relative risk reduction of 27% in all-cause mortality with MRA treatment, patients in the lowest SBP category would have the greatest absolute mortality benefit because they had the highest absolute mortality rate. Specifically, treatment would lead to approximately 11 fewer deaths per 100 patients treated with an MRA drug in the SBP group of ≤ 105 mm Hg, compared with 6 fewer deaths per 100 patients in the SBP group of > 135 mm Hg.

### Spironolactone reduces the risk of death in veterans with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^5b042868]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone is a potassium‐sparing diuretic and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, which has been used to treat a wide range of conditions including cirrhosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, and hypertension. As demonstrated by the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) trial, spironolactone is an effective treatment for HF with reduced ejection fraction. Given the success in HF with reduced ejection fraction and that spironolactone decreases the interstitial fibrotic process that is common in HFpEF, multiple clinical trials have investigated whether spironolactone also effectively treats HFpEF, with only a few that evaluated death and all‐cause hospitalization outcomes. Though findings varied across studies, and many lacked significant results, meta‐analysis pooling data suggest that spironolactone improves diastolic function and reduces blood pressure in HFpEF but had minimal effect on death and hospitalization outcomes. The largest trial thus far, the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial), also did not show a benefit on the primary composite outcome, although spironolactone did significantly reduce HF hospitalizations. Furthermore, wide regional variations may have contributed to the lack of a significant effect on the primary composite outcome in TOPCAT, because stratification by region demonstrated significant outcome improvements in the Americas but not in Russia and Georgiaand potential issues with adherence in Russia and Georgia. Additional trials, SPIRRIT‐HFPEF (Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) and SPIRIT‐HF (Spironolactone in the Treatment of Heart Failure), are currently underway to further assess the efficacy of spironolactone in HFpEF.

Based on the results of the TOPCAT trial, current guidelines include a IIb level of evidence recommendation for spironolactone in HFpEF. We conducted the current study to further investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone on death and hospitalization outcomes in a real‐world setting using national electronic health record data, to generate real‐world evidence for the effectiveness of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism in HFpEF.

The favorable effect of spironolactone on mortality appeared similar for both genders and all age groups except patients younger than 55. There were too few non-whites in Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study to evaluate if the effects differ by race. Spironolactone's benefit appeared greater in patients with low baseline serum potassium levels and less in patients with ejection fractions < 0.2. These subgroup analyses must be interpreted cautiously.

14.2 Hypertension

The dose response of spironolactone for hypertension has not been well characterized. In patients with hypertension, decreases in systolic blood pressure have been observed at doses ranging from 25 to 100 mg/day. Doses greater than 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Methods

Details of trials included

The design, baseline findings, and primary results of the 2 trials have been reported previously in detail. Participants in each trial provided written informed consent. Briefly, the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) was an event-driven, double-blind, placebo-controlled mortality trial. Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes III-IV heart failure with a ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 35% were randomly assigned to receive placebo or spironolactone therapy. The starting dosage of the study drug was 25 mg of spironolactone once daily or matching placebo. After 8 weeks, the dosage could be increased to 50 mg daily if the patient still had symptoms of heart failure but did not have hyperkalemia.

The EMPHASIS-HF (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure) trial was an event-driven, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a composite morbidity-mortality outcome (cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization). Patients with NYHA functional class II heart failure with an LVEF of ≤ 35% were randomly assigned to placebo or eplerenone therapy. The starting dosage for the study drug was eplerenone 25 mg once daily or matching placebo. After 4 weeks, the dosage was increased to 50 mg once daily, unless there was hyperkalemia (or another intolerance).

Importantly, neither trial had a lower blood pressure exclusion criterion. The median follow-up in RALES was 24 months and 21 months in EMPHASIS-HF. In order to have an adequate number of patients (and events) in each baseline blood pressure category of interest (see below) and to cover the full spectrum of symptom severity (NYHA functional class II to IV), the RALES and EMPHASIS-HF databases were merged for analyses.

Baseline blood pressure categories and serial blood pressure assessments

Patients were divided into 5 baseline SBP categories: ≤ 105, > 105 to ≤ 115, > 115 to ≤ 125, > 125 to ≤ 135, and > 135 mm Hg, to ensure equally sized groups across the spectrum of blood pressure values. In RALES, SBP was measured at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 months and at 1, 5, and 9 months in EMPHASIS-HF. For the purpose of this analysis, the 5- and 6-month measurements were considered to have occurred at 6 months.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — key medication recommendations: In patients with HFrEF with current or previous symptoms, use of one of the three mortality-proven beta blockers (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations; in patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if estimated glomerular filtration rate is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and thereafter; and in patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF, SGLT2i are recommended to reduce hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular mortality irrespective of the presence of type 2 diabetes.

### Spironolactone reduces the risk of death in veterans with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^ec177a09]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large observational study using real‐world electronic health record data in a well‐curated national patient cohort with HFpEF, we demonstrate a significantly reduced mortality rate in HFpEF treated with spironolactone and extend the results of the TOPCAT study demonstrating benefit in a real‐world population.

Real‐world data can confirm the benefits observed in a clinical trial on a larger scale. For example, the largest meta‐analyses assessing death and hospitalization outcomes included no more than 3 trials and 2000 spironolactone users, while our study had 3690 HFpEF spironolactone users. However, generating real‐world evidence from real‐world data requires surmounting many confounders and selection biases that are less prevalent in a randomized clinical trial; we addressed these issues using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights and performing multiple sensitivity analyses with varied censoring times. To account for the lag period between initiation of spironolactone and beneficial effects observed in TOPCAT and RALES, we did not attribute events to either treatment group during the 1‐year adherence period. Similarly, given that over half of spironolactone users stopped use before the end of follow‐up and to minimize misclassification of treatment effects after discontinuation of spironolactone, we performed multiple sensitivity analyses extending the follow‐up period beyond discontinuation for varying lengths and demonstrated a gradual decline in effect with increased follow‐up time. Additionally, analyses distinguishing spironolactone initiation before and after diagnosis demonstrated minimal difference in effect and hence justified combining prevalent and new users. The significant improvement in survival seen in our study at variance with past trials and meta‐analyses, could be due to the sicker population, higher mortality rate, and longer follow‐up period in our real‐world study compared with prior trials. Cumulatively, our analyses using orthogonal approaches to reduce confounding indicated a benefit of spironolactone in a real‐world HFpEF population.

Table 2
Association of Spironolactone Use With Death and Hospitalizations, Censoring 60 Days After the End of the Last Prescription

Spironolactone users were followed for a median of 2.9 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1.5–5.4) and nonusers for 3.3 years (IQR, 1.6–5.9). Without censoring, crude results showed similar proportions of deaths in both treatment groups, with 1968 (53%) deaths among spironolactone users and 26 571 (54%) among nonusers. Only 639 spironolactone users (17%) died while still taking the medication. Among the 1329 spironolactone users (36%) who stopped spironolactone use, the median time to death after cessation of treatment was 0.9 years (IQR, 0.2–2.6). Chart review (Data S2) showed that patients who stopped taking spironolactone before death did so for a range of reasons, including hyperkalemia, breast pain, interaction with other medications, or low blood pressure.

Sensitivity analyses, censoring users at 30‐day intervals following the end of their last spironolactone prescription showed results similar to the primary models. The largest relative reduction in event rates was observed when censoring at the end of the last prescription, with magnitude of effect decreasing as time to censoring after the last prescription increased (Table 3). Results from the crude, age‐adjusted, and parsimonious models for all 3 outcomes censoring at 30‐day increments after the end of the last spironolactone prescription follow a similar trend (Tables S1–S3). Analyses with the 3‐category exposure showed minimal difference in effects of spironolactone initiated before or after HFpEF diagnosis relative to nonusers for both outcomes (Figures S3–S5).

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone antagonist therapy — hyperkalemia risk minimization: Impaired renal function is a risk factor for hyperkalemia during treatment with aldosterone antagonists, and risk increases when serum creatinine exceeds 1.6 mg per dL; in patients in whom creatinine may not reflect filtration, determination that glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance exceeds 30 mL per min is recommended. Aldosterone antagonists should not be administered to patients with baseline serum potassium in excess of 5.0 mEq per liter. An initial dose of spironolactone 12.5 mg or eplerenone 25 mg is recommended, with possible increase to spironolactone 25 mg or eplerenone 50 mg as appropriate. The risk of hyperkalemia is increased with concomitant higher doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (captopril greater than or equal to 75 mg daily; enalapril or lisinopril greater than or equal to 10 mg daily); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors should be avoided, and potassium supplements should be discontinued or reduced. Close monitoring is required: potassium levels and renal function should be checked in 3 days and at 1 week after initiation of therapy and at least monthly for the first 3 months, and diarrhea or other causes of dehydration should be addressed emergently. Although trial entry allowed creatinine greater than 2.5 mg per dL, in 1 trial 95% of patients had creatinine less than or equal to 1.7 mg per dL, indicating most studied patients had better renal function than the entry limit.

### Systolic blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: an analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^4fc20b94]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Recent guidelines have advocated for stricter systolic blood pressure (SBP) control in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), though data regarding the optimal SBP in HFpEF are sparse.

Methods and Results

We analysed participants from the Americas from the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) study with available baseline and 8-week visit SBP data (n = 1645). We related baseline SBP to several efficacy and safety outcomes. To determine whether blood pressure lowering was responsible for the potential beneficial effects of spironolactone observed in the Americas, we assessed the randomized treatment adjusting for baseline and change in 8-week SBP. The average age was 71.7 ± 9.7years, 50% were women, and 79% were White. Patients in the lowest baseline SBP quartile were less often female, more often White, had lower body mass index, lower baseline diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, and more often had atrial fibrillation. After multivariable adjustment, there was no relationship observed between baseline SBP quartiles and any outcome. Spironolactone reduced SBP by 4.4 ± 0.6mmHg compared with placebo (and consistently across baseline SBP quartiles). There was minimal change in the treatment effect for all outcomes after adjusting for baseline SBP and 8-week change in SBP.

Conclusion

No relationship was observed between baseline SBP quartiles and outcomes in TOPCAT. The anti-hypertensive effects of spironolactone did not account for the potential benefit in cardiovascular outcomes in the Americas.

### Association of spironolactone use with all-cause mortality in heart failure: a propensity scored cohort study [^8266c2d5]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In 3 randomized controlled trials in heart failure (HF), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduced mortality. The net benefit from randomized controlled trials may not be generalizable, and eplerenone was, but spironolactone was not, studied in mild HF. We tested the hypothesis that spironolactone is associated with reduced mortality also in a broad unselected contemporary population with HF and reduced ejection fraction, in particular New York Heart Association (NYHA) I-II.

Methods and Results

We prospectively studied 18 852 patients (age 71 ± 12 years; 28% women) with NYHA I-IV and ejection fraction < 40% who were registered in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry between 2000 and 2012 and who were (n = 6551) or were not (n = 12 301) treated with spironolactone. We derived propensity scores for spironolactone treatment based on 41 covariates. We assessed survival by Cox regression with adjustment for propensity scores and with matching based on propensity score. We performed sensitivity and residual confounding analyses and analyzed the NYHA I-II and III-IV subgroups separately. One-year survival was 83% versus 84% in treated versus untreated patients (log rank P < 0.001). After adjustment for propensity scores, the hazard ratio for spironolactone was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.11; P = 0.054). Spironolactone interacted with NYHA (P < 0.001). In the NYHA I-II subgroup, after adjustment for propensity scores, the hazard ratio for spironolactone was 1.11 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.21; P = 0.019).

Conclusions

In an unselected contemporary population of HF with reduced ejection fraction, spironolactone was not associated with reduced mortality. The net benefits of spironolactone may be lower outside the clinical trial setting and in milder HF.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^c9cd024e]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

In conclusion, among participants with stage 3b CKD, treatment with low-dose spironolactone was not associated with a reduction in mortality or cardiovascular events compared to usual care. Discontinuation from the study due to safety concerns was more common among participants randomized to spironolactone. This suggests that low-dose spironolactone should not generally be used in people with stage 3b CKD unless there is another explicit indication for the treatment.

### Spironolactone for people age 70 years and older with osteoarthritic knee pain: a proof-of-concept trial [^84228e80]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Possibly the 25‐mg dose of spironolactone was insufficient. However this dose was used in our previous trial, which significantly improved quality of life (using the same EQ‐5D 3L tool) 6, and the same dose is used to prolong life in heart failure 12; the 25‐mg dose in heart failure has been shown to both increase cortisol levels 13 and reduce markers of collagen turnover 14. A larger dose would have increased the likelihood of adverse effects, including raised potassium and creatinine levels, and of gynecomastia in men. The 12‐week duration of treatment was selected for practical and pragmatic reasons. A longer duration of therapy may have been necessary, but the lack of any signal of efficacy in the current study does not lend support to this idea. Furthermore, in our original trial a signal of change in EQ‐5D 3L score was evident after 10 weeks of spironolactone, when the between‐group difference in change from baseline was 0.04 (−0.03 to 1.11; P = 0.22) 6. The major difference between the 2 study populations was self‐reported physical disability in the former study, and specific selection for symptomatic OA of the knee in this study. Study populations in both trials were similar in terms of baseline age, sex, weight, social deprivation, EQ‐5D utility score, and EQ‐5D VAS score.

The study has a number of strengths. Recruitment strategies were efficient, with the target number of 86 participants randomized in the preplanned target 12‐month period. Adherence was exemplary, the dropout rate was low, and treatment was well tolerated. This study confirms the safety of 25 mg spironolactone daily in this specific older population with OA. The mean age of participants was 77 years, and there was no upper age limit; this lack of a limit contrasts with around 25% of OA‐related trials, which did impose upper age limits 15, a practice that is increasingly untenable. As most older people are multimorbid, the prospect of a safe, established medication with pleiotropic therapeutic effects is an attractive one. Spironolactone improves outcomes in heart failure and has effects on many cell types, independent of its binding to mineralocorticoid receptors. One drug that could safely treat more than one condition would be a major advance in reducing treatment burden. This proof‐of‐concept study found no evidence to support the further evaluation of spironolactone for older people with knee pain due to OA.

14.1 Heart failure

The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) was a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the effect of spironolactone on mortality in patients with highly symptomatic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. To be eligible to participate, patients had to have an ejection fraction of ≤ 35%, NYHA Class III-IV symptoms, and a history of NYHA class IV symptoms within the last 6 months before enrollment. Patients with a baseline serum creatinine of > 2.5 mg/dL or a recent increase of 25% or with a baseline serum potassium of > 5.0 mEq/L were excluded.

Follow-up visits and laboratory measurements (including serum potassium and creatinine) were performed every four weeks for the first 12 weeks, then every 3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

The RALES study was conducted with a formulation of spironolactone that is not therapeutically equivalent to CAROSPIR [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The initial dose of spironolactone was 25 mg once daily. Patients who were intolerant of the initial dosage regimen had their dose decreased to one 25 mg tablet every other day at one to four weeks. Patients who were tolerant of one tablet daily at 8 weeks could have had their dose increased 50 mg daily at the discretion of the investigator. The mean daily dose at study end for the patients randomized to spironolactone was 26 mg.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^277e9a4b]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Hyper‐ and hypokalemia occurrence among patients in most important large randomized trials with potassium sparing agents in heart failure

Although ATHENA‐HF was also an MRA trial, its design was different and focused on an evaluation of the standard therapy with spironolactone of 25 mg, or a higher dose of 100 mg, vs placebo. 46 There were only one event of high potassium level in the standard treatment arm and no hyperkalemia event in the group with a high spironolactone dose. The other study, PARADIGM‐HF, was conducted to compare two disease‐modifying drugs, sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril; since both of them contribute to hyperkalemia, serum potassium levels > 5.5 mmol/L were registered in both groups. Nevertheless, a trend for higher potassium level (≥ 6.0 mmol/L) was identified in the enalapril arm (4.3% vs 5.6%; Р = .007). 15

Hypokalemia was frequently identified among patients in the placebo group in the RALES, EMPHASIS‐HF, and EPHESUS trials, and was associated with increased mortality, especially when the serum potassium level was < 3.5 mmol/L. 30, 31, 32, 42 The TOPCAT trial compared spironolactone and placebo in patients with HFpEF, found an increase in potassium levels in the treatment arm and a significant decrease in the placebo arm. 47 There were no serious adverse effects in either group. 47 Notably, a potassium level above 4.8 mmol/L has been related with increased mortality on clinical trials with HF patients and thus has been recommended by some researchers as the upper normal limit on HF. 28

### Mineralocorticoid receptors and pathophysiological roles for aldosterone in the cardiovascular system [^d9b056cc]. Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

For almost 40 years since its discovery in 1953, the mineralocorticoid hormone, aldosterone, was considered to affect blood volume, and thus blood pressure, by its action to retain sodium at epithelial tissues. Over the past decade, direct effects of aldosterone on the heart and blood vessels, and on the cerebral control of blood pressure, have been established in experimental animals. Simultaneously, the incidence of primary aldosteronism in essential hypertension is now acknowledged to be 10–20%, rather than ≤ 1%, underscoring a previously unrecognized role for aldosterone in hypertension. The 30% improvement in mortality (and 35% in morbidity) seen in the RALES trial with the addition of low-dose spironolactone to best practice therapy in moderate to severe heart failure, similarly points to an unrecognized role for aldosterone in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Currently, both experimental and clinical studies are directed towards establishing the mechanisms involved in these pathophysiological effects of aldosterone in the cardiovascular system, and of the role of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in offsetting or blocking such effects. A brief account of the current state of these mechanisms in at a cellular and tissue level forms the basis of this review.

### Spironolactone reduces the risk of death in veterans with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^7f04f99e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

All study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System. Informed consent was not required because this was a retrospective cohort analysis.

Cohort Selection

We previously identified a cohort of 80 248 patients with HFpEF from within the national Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system database using an algorithm that included natural language processing to capture all recorded left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) and was validated by blinded chart review. Patients were selected on the basis of incident HF diagnosis code (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD‐9] 428.x) between 2002 and 2012, diuretic use or measurement of natriuretic peptide levels, and all recorded LVEF values ≥ 50%. We excluded patients who had liver disease or took any dose of spironolactone > 50 mg, which we considered a surrogate marker for liver disease by indication and confirmed by chart review (Data S1). We also excluded patients who took formulations of spironolactone combined with other medications or only had inpatient prescriptions.

Exposure

We used stringent criteria to define spironolactone users to ensure that we captured patients who took spironolactone for prolonged periods of time similar to that observed in a clinical trial to generate real‐world evidence from real‐world data. Spironolactone prescription data were obtained from both the VA health care system database and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. We required users to have enough medication dispensed to allow for at least 80% adherence over a 1‐year period, either following the initiation of spironolactone (if initiated after documented HF diagnosis) or after incident HFpEF diagnosis (if spironolactone was initiated before documentation of diagnosis). Patients were censored during this 1‐year adherence period, and follow‐up began at the end of this period. Spironolactone nonusers had no prior prescriptions for spironolactone and had to have survived at least 1 year after their HFpEF diagnosis date. Patients could cross over from the nonuser to user group if they initiated spironolactone at least 1 year after HFpEF diagnosis and met adherence requirements. In case of crossover, patients accrued nonuser person‐time from 1 year after HFpEF diagnosis until initiation of spironolactone and user person‐time following the 1‐year adherence window. The dynamic entry of participants into the study as spironolactone users and nonusers is illustrated in Figure S1.

### Inappropriate use of spironolactone in heart failure… [^c78501c9]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

In the Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study, spironolactone was shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure. Patients enrolled in this trial were those with New York Heart Association Class III and IV heart failure, normal serum potassium levels, and normal or only slightly elevated serum creatinine levels. The dosage used in this study was substantially less than the dosage normally used in the treatment of cirrhosis or hypertension. Spironolactone is easier to start and titrate than the standard heart failure treatment of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers. Because long-term outcome data are not available, Bozkurt and associates studied the appropriateness and complications of the use of spironolactone in the treatment of heart failure in clinical practices.

Of the patients who were started on spironolactone, only about 26 percent had documented NYHA class III and IV heart failure and met the RALES criteria. Sixty-five percent of the study group had no documentation of their NYHA class. Most patients were receiving ACE inhibitor or angiotensinreceptor blocker therapy. The mean daily dosages of ACE inhibitors and spironolactone in the study population were higher than in the RALES trial. Less than 40 percent of the study population had appropriate laboratory and clinical follow-up. Twenty-four percent of the patients developed hyperkalemia, with 12 percent developing severe hyperkalemia. Three percent of the patients required temporary pacemaker insertion. The authors conclude that spironolactone is being used to treat heart failure without consideration of the NYHA class or other appropriate criteria for initiating therapy.

They add that clinical follow-up did not adhere to the RALES trial guidelines, resulting in a higher incidence of complications. The goal of therapy should be to maximize the use of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers in the treatment of heart failure.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^ce831623]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) spans trials enrolling patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, ≤ 40%, and ≤ 30%. For spironolactone and eplerenone, the starting dose is 25 mg orally daily, increased to 50 mg daily orally after a month; for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 31 to 49 mL/min/1.73 m2, dosing should be reduced by half, and regular checks of serum potassium and renal function are advised approximately 1 week, then 4 weeks, then every 6 months after initiating or intensifying MRA, with more frequent testing for clinical instability. Safety concerns include when eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and when MRA is initiated at serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L and continued ≥ 5.5 mEq/L; in trials, clinically significant hyperkalemia events were < 10% in EPHESUS and EMPHASIS-HF. Coadministration of MRA with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) mildly increases hyperkalemia risk, hyperkalemia risk was lower with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in chronic heart failure but not different in decompensated heart failure when compared with ACEi, diarrhea causing dehydration or loop diuretic therapy interruption should be a consideration for temporarily holding the MRA, and the efficacy of potassium binders (for example, patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to facilitate continuation of MRA is uncertain.

### Changes in frailty based on minimally important difference and the impact of spironolactone on frailty in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: insights from the TOPCAT trial [^30606d5d]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The minimally important difference (MID) for frailty variation associated with adverse outcomes remains unknown in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and whether spironolactone can ameliorate frailty progression in this population remains unclear.

Methods

We analysed data from 1767 participants in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist trial. The MID for frailty was calculated using an anchor-based approach, with the EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) as the anchor. Frailty index (FI), defined as a 35-item cumulative deficit score, and EQ-VAS were assessed at baseline and 1-year follow-up. The primary composite outcome (cardiovascular death, aborted cardiac arrest or heart failure hospitalisation) was assessed from the 1-year follow-up visit. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models evaluated the link between FI changes (ΔFI ≥ MID) and the primary outcome. Longitudinal FI changes were analysed using linear mixed-effects models to evaluate spironolactone's effect.

Results

The MID for the FI was 0.03 points. An FI reduction ≥ MID was associated with a lower risk of the primary composite outcome (aHR, 0.63; 95%CI 0.48 to 0.82), all-cause mortality (aHR, 0.57; 95%CI 0.42 to 0.76) and heart failure hospitalisation (aHR, 0.55; 95%CI 0.40 to 0.75) after adjusting for baseline FI, age, sex, New York Heart Association class, smoking status and treatment assignment. No between-group difference in FI change was observed with spironolactone versus placebo (aOR, 0.85; 95%CI 0.67 to 1.09).

Conclusions

Frailty improvement exceeding the 0.03 FI threshold predicts better prognosis in HFpEF, underscoring the value of routine assessment. Spironolactone use was associated with neutral effects on frailty progression in our analysis, suggesting potential safety in this vulnerable population.

### 2023 ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension the task force for the management of arterial hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension: endorsed by the international society of hypertension (ISH) and the European renal association (ERA) [^ae86e6b7]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with HF, preserved ejection fraction, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone) regardless of diagnosed resistant HTN, particularly in lower HFpEF spectrum.

### The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): rationale and design [^9ffdf836]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in heart failure with preserved and mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF/HFmrEF) have not been established. Conventional randomized controlled trials are complex and expensive. The Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (SPIRRIT‐HFpEF) is a unique pragmatic registry‐based randomized controlled trial.

Methods

SPIRRIT‐HFpEF is a multicentre, prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded endpoint trial conducted on platforms in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SwedeHF) and the United States (US) Trial Innovation Network. Patients with HFpEF/HFmrEF are randomized 1:1 to spironolactone (or eplerenone) in addition to usual care, versus usual care alone. The primary outcome is total number of cardiovascular deaths and hospitalizations for heart failure. Outcomes are collected from Swedish administrative complete coverage registries and a US call centre and subsequently adjudicated. Simple eligibility criteria were based on data available in SwedeHF: heart failure as outpatient or at discharge from hospital, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40%, N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide > 300 ng/L (in sinus rhythm) or > 750 ng/L (in atrial fibrillation), with pre‐specified adjustment for elevated body mass index, and chronic loop diuretic use. Power and sample size assessments were based on an event‐driven design allowing enrolment over approximately 6 years, and application of hazard ratios from the TOPCAT trial, Americas subset. The final sample size is expected to be approximately 2400 patients.

Conclusion

SPIRRIT‐HFpEF will be informative on the effectiveness of generic MRAs in HFpEF and HFmrEF, and on the feasibility of conducting pragmatic and registry‐based trials in heart failure and other chronic conditions.

### Spironolactone reduces the risk of death in veterans with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^9fd16f86]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex syndrome increasing in prevalence and affecting millions worldwide but with limited evidence‐based therapies. Results from explanatory clinical trials suggest that spironolactone may help to improve outcomes in patients with HFpEF. We sought to investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone in reducing death and hospitalization outcomes for patients with HFpEF in a real‐world setting.

Methods and Results

We used electronic health records from the US Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system between 2002 and 2012 to identify patients with HFpEF who were followed longitudinally through 2014 using a validated algorithm. Among our HFpEF cohort that is 96% men, 85% White individuals, and aged 74 ± 11 years, 3690 spironolactone users and 49 191 nonusers were identified and followed for a median of 2.9 (interquartile range [IQR], 1.5–2.4) and 3.3 (IQR, 1.6–5.9) years, respectively. We evaluated the effect of spironolactone use on all‐cause death and number of days hospitalized per year for heart failure or for any cause by fitting generalized estimating equation–based Poisson and negative binomial models. Crude rates of 10.3 versus 13.5 deaths and 394.0 versus 485.9 days hospitalized were observed per 100 person‐years for spironolactone users versus nonusers, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, there was a 21% reduction (95% CI, 13–29; P < 0.0001) in rate of all‐cause death among spironolactone users compared with nonusers and no statistically significant difference in days hospitalized for all causes or heart failure.

Conclusions

In a real‐world national cohort of patients with HFpEF, spironolactone use reduced all‐cause death and demonstrated a favorable trend in reducing the burden of hospitalizations.

### Prognostic importance of changes in cardiac structure and function in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and the impact of spironolactone [^c611298a]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Limited data exist regarding the impact of aldosterone antagonist therapy on cardiac structure and function in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and on the prognostic relevance of changes in cardiac structure and function in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Methods and Results

Cardiac structure and function were assessed by quantitative echocardiography at baseline and at 12- to 18-month follow-up in 239 patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (left ventricular [LV] ejection fraction [LVEF] ≥ 45%) enrolled in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial. The impact of spironolactone therapy on measures of cardiac structure and function was assessed in the study population overall, and change in echocardiographic measures was associated with the subsequent occurrence of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, or aborted cardiac arrest. Spironolactone was not associated with alterations in cardiac structure and function compared with placebo. Decrease in left atrial volume at follow-up was associated with a lower risk of subsequent occurrence of the primary outcome.

Conclusions

Twelve to 18 months of spironolactone therapy was not associated with alterations in cardiac structure or function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Reduction in left atrial volume at follow-up was associated with a lower risk of subsequent occurrence of the primary composite outcome.
