If steroid indication chrons

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when steroids are indicated in Crohn's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and disease severity stratification. Then, I should verify the distinction between induction and maintenance therapy. Next, I will examine conventional systemic corticosteroids versus budesonide by disease phenotype. After that, I need to check special populations and perioperative considerations. Finally, I will integrate safety, steroid-sparing strategies, and a practical decision framework with monitoring and tapering plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity framework, because indications hinge on both. Moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease typically presents with moderate to severe abdominal pain and diarrhea with objective inflammation, whereas mild-to-moderate disease has less severe symptoms and often ileocecal involvement; extraintestinal manifestations and complications further shape risk and therapy choices, and guidelines emphasize objective confirmation of inflammation and treat-to-target strategies with reassessment at 4–12 weeks [^da6d6c41] [^40d8b754].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using steroids for everything; I need to separate induction from maintenance. Corticosteroids are indicated for short-term induction of remission in active disease, but they are not effective for maintenance and should be avoided chronically due to substantial toxicity, so every induction course must be paired with a plan to taper and transition to steroid-sparing maintenance therapy [^4bfebf96] [^e778caf4] [^b66a58eb].

> For moderate-to-severe active luminal Crohn's disease, I should confirm that systemic corticosteroids are recommended for induction. Multiple high-credibility guidelines endorse oral prednisone or equivalent 40–60 mg daily for short courses, typically not exceeding 8 weeks, with a mandatory taper and early introduction of immunomodulators or biologics to prevent dependency; this is a strong recommendation despite low-to-moderate quality evidence, reflecting long-standing clinical experience and the balance of benefits and harms [^4bfebf96] [^374f62ff] [^2ce7b539] [^d645a13c].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of steroid-related risks so I counsel accurately. Prolonged corticosteroid exposure is associated with increased mortality, higher infection risk, metabolic and bone complications, and a markedly elevated risk of venous thromboembolism; population data show roughly 50% higher mortality with current steroid use, and steroid dependency occurs in about 21% of patients within a year, reinforcing the need to minimize exposure and escalate to steroid-sparing agents promptly [^3239e3a0] [^4bfebf96] [^8cc7a525].

> For mild-to-moderate ileocecal disease, I should consider budesonide rather than systemic steroids. Controlled ileal-release budesonide 9 mg daily induces remission with fewer systemic adverse effects than conventional steroids, though it is less effective in severe disease or extensive colonic involvement; importantly, budesonide is not effective for maintenance beyond 3 months and should not be used for that purpose, so I need to ensure a maintenance plan is in place before completing the budesonide course [^1ac0811f] [^d62f6951] [^e61561ed] [^0ed1517e] [^f1964bfd].

> I should double-check the maintenance strategy after steroid-induced remission. Thiopurines and methotrexate are appropriate steroid-sparing options, with thiopurines supported for maintenance after corticosteroid induction and methotrexate 25 mg weekly intramuscular or subcutaneous as an alternative, particularly in steroid-dependent disease; TPMT testing is recommended before thiopurines to mitigate myelotoxicity risk, and treat-to-target reassessment should confirm clinical and endoscopic response within 12–16 weeks [^e75f80e1] [^34b8dd19] [^feee99e5] [^da6d6c41].

> But wait, what if the patient is steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent. In those scenarios, I need to escalate promptly to anti-TNF therapy or other advanced agents rather than persisting with steroids, because anti-TNFs both induce and maintain remission and have robust steroid-sparing effects; contemporary guidelines also support early advanced therapy in high-risk patients to prevent bowel damage, and meta-analytic data show no added benefit from continuing steroids during anti-TNF induction, reinforcing early steroid weaning in refractory cases [^7f6d1049] [^25a0cd33] [^4c1de89b] [^744915cb].

> Next, I should review special populations and settings. In pediatrics, exclusive enteral nutrition is preferred for induction when feasible; if not, corticosteroids can be considered for active luminal disease, with the same principle of minimizing steroid exposure and transitioning to maintenance therapy. In pregnancy, systemic corticosteroids are generally considered safe when clinically indicated, though budesonide may be preferred when appropriate due to lower systemic activity. In the perioperative setting, steroids should be weaned to below 20 mg daily whenever possible to reduce infectious complications, and immunomodulators can usually be continued [^1de2ff92] [^d7960d4d] [^ce4d5107] [^c93d58e6].

> I need to ensure I address disease phenotypes that alter steroid choice. For isolated ileocecal or right-colon disease, budesonide is reasonable first-line for mild-to-moderate activity; for extensive colonic or severe disease, conventional systemic steroids are preferred given superior efficacy, albeit with greater adverse effects. For stricturing disease with an inflammatory component, medical therapy including steroids may be appropriate initially, but fibrostenotic strictures ultimately require endoscopic or surgical intervention rather than prolonged steroids [^1ac0811f] [^e61561ed] [^37d1f2a2].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and verify it aligns with guidelines. First, confirm active disease objectively and stratify severity. Second, choose induction: conventional steroids for moderate-to-severe disease, budesonide for mild-to-moderate ileocecal disease, and consider early advanced therapy in high-risk or refractory cases. Third, set a hard stop: do not exceed 8 weeks of systemic steroids without a taper and a steroid-sparing plan. Fourth, implement maintenance with thiopurines or methotrexate, or escalate to biologics if steroid-dependent or refractory. Fifth, monitor response at 4–12 weeks and adjust therapy to achieve deep remission, while proactively managing adverse effects and comorbidities [^da6d6c41] [^4bfebf96] [^25a0cd33].

> I should confirm tapering and safety monitoring details so there is no ambiguity. A typical prednisone taper reduces by about 10 mg every 1–2 weeks depending on response, with closer monitoring if withdrawal symptoms emerge; during therapy, screen for infections, hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, bone loss, and VTE risk, and after prolonged use, assess adrenal function if clinically indicated; these precautions are especially critical in patients with repeated steroid exposures or dependency patterns [^4bfebf96] [^d7960d4d].

> In summary, steroids are indicated for short-term induction of remission in active Crohn's disease, with conventional systemic corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe disease and budesonide for mild-to-moderate ileocecal disease; they are not indicated for maintenance, and every induction course must be paired with a taper and transition to steroid-sparing maintenance to mitigate substantial toxicity and dependency risks [^4bfebf96] [^1ac0811f] [^e778caf4].

Steroids are indicated for **short-term induction of remission** in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease [^4bfebf96] [^a4e00c6f], with prednisone 40–60 mg/day for ≤ 8 weeks and a mandatory taper to avoid dependency [^2ce7b539] [^4bfebf96]. They are **not indicated for maintenance** because of high risks of adverse effects and dependency [^e778caf4] [^b66a58eb]; instead, transition to immunomodulators or biologics is required [^e75f80e1] [^7f6d1049]. Budesonide is preferred for mild-to-moderate ileocecal disease due to fewer systemic effects [^1ac0811f] [^e61561ed], but is also not for maintenance [^0ed1517e] [^911ad3b6]. Steroids are contraindicated for maintenance and should be minimized to reduce serious complications [^db8cd7e5] [^d7960d4d].

## Indications for steroid use in Crohn's disease

Steroids are **primarily indicated for induction of remission** in active Crohn's disease, particularly in moderate-to-severe cases [^4bfebf96] [^a4e00c6f]. They are not recommended for maintenance of remission due to their significant adverse effects and lack of efficacy in preventing relapse [^e778caf4] [^b66a58eb].

---

## Clinical scenarios for steroid use

| **Clinical scenario** | **Steroid indication** | **Recommended steroid** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Moderate-to-severe active Crohn's disease | Induction of remission | Prednisone 40–60 mg/day | ≤ 8 weeks with taper [^2ce7b539] [^4bfebf96] |
| Mild-to-moderate ileocecal Crohn's disease | Induction of remission | Budesonide 9 mg/day | ≤ 8 weeks with taper [^1ac0811f] [^c87540c8] |
| Severe or fulminant Crohn's disease | Induction of remission | Intravenous corticosteroids (e.g. methylprednisolone) | Short-term until stabilization, then transition to oral steroids [^d4572542] |

---

## Limitations and risks of steroid therapy

While steroids are effective for short-term symptom control, they carry **significant risks and limitations**:

- **Steroid dependency**: Approximately 21% of patients become steroid-dependent, requiring ongoing steroid therapy to maintain remission [^8cc7a525] [^4bfebf96].
- **Adverse effects**: Long-term steroid use is associated with numerous adverse effects, including osteoporosis, infections, diabetes, hypertension, and psychiatric effects [^db8cd7e5] [^d7960d4d].
- **Increased mortality**: Prolonged steroid use has been associated with increased mortality in Crohn's disease patients [^3239e3a0] [^db8cd7e5].

---

## Alternative therapies and steroid-sparing strategies

Given the risks associated with steroid therapy, **alternative medications and steroid-sparing strategies** are recommended:

- **Immunomodulators**: Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate are recommended for maintenance of remission and as steroid-sparing agents [^e75f80e1] [^34b8dd19].
- **Biologic therapies**: Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab), vedolizumab, and ustekinumab are effective for induction and maintenance of remission, particularly in steroid-dependent or refractory cases [^7f6d1049] [^510070f7].
- **Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN)**: Particularly effective in pediatric patients, EEN is a non-pharmacologic alternative for induction of remission [^1de2ff92].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following principles regarding steroid use in Crohn's disease:

- **Short-term use**: Steroids should be used for short-term induction only, typically not exceeding 8 weeks, with a gradual taper to prevent withdrawal symptoms and relapse [^2ce7b539] [^4bfebf96].
- **Avoidance of maintenance therapy**: Steroids are not recommended for maintenance of remission due to their adverse effects and lack of efficacy in preventing relapse [^e778caf4] [^b66a58eb].
- **Transition to steroid-sparing agents**: Patients requiring steroids should be transitioned to immunomodulators or biologics to maintain remission and minimize steroid exposure [^e75f80e1] [^7f6d1049].

---

## Conclusion

Steroids are indicated for **short-term induction of remission** in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, but are not recommended for maintenance due to significant adverse effects and risks of dependency. Current clinical guidelines emphasize the need for careful monitoring, gradual tapering, and transition to steroid-sparing agents to minimize risks and maintain long-term remission [^4bfebf96] [^e75f80e1].

Moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease — corticosteroids: We recommend oral corticosteroids for short-term induction of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Prednisone-equivalent dosing for active disease ranges from 40 to 60 mg/d, and the use of corticosteroids should not exceed 3 continuous months without attempting to introduce corticosteroid-sparing agents. Even short-term use may be accompanied by adverse events including venous thromboembolic events (5-fold increased risk). Despite effectiveness for symptom control, nearly 1 in 4 patients will have prolonged exposure to corticosteroids (greater than 6 months) with approximately 15% of patients becoming steroid-dependent.

### Corticosteroids in Crohn's disease [^2aa22007]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is a lifelong illness characterized by chronic recurrent flares. The precise etiology of Crohn's disease is unknown. However, it appears to involve an enhanced systemic immune response and intensified local intestinal mucosal inflammatory activity, mediated through various inflammatory cells and an array of proinflammatory cytokines. Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment of Crohn's disease. The controlled trials of the National Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study and the European Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study established that corticosteroids were effective for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease for the duration of the studies (6–17 wk). However, corticosteroids have not been shown to have an impact on the maintenance of long term remission in patients with Crohn's disease. In addition, they are associated with a high potential for dependence and serious toxic side effects. Alternative classes of medical therapy for Crohn's disease, including modified corticosteroids and a group of new biological therapies, have proven to be efficacious in the management of active and/or quiescent Crohn's disease.

### Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with corticosteroids [^8de02caa]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are a mainstay in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Administered topically, orally, or intravenously corticosteroids rapidly and consistently improve moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, although they are ineffective in the maintenance of remission in either illness. The beneficial effects of corticosteroid therapy are counterbalanced by their many side effects. A better understanding of the mechanism of steroid action and toxicity has led to the development of novel corticosteroids that offer the promise of continued efficacy with minimal toxicity. This article reviews the role of conventional and novel corticosteroids in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.

Background

The efficacy of corticosteroids in the setting of maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease has never been clearly demonstrated. It would be important to determine, based upon the currently available data from controlled trials, if the use of chronic corticosteroid therapy is of benefit in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease or if there is an identifiable subgroup of Crohn's disease patients, such as those in whom therapy cannot be successfully tapered, who might benefit from such treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of conventional systemic corticosteroid therapy in maintaining clinical remission in Crohn's disease.

Search Strategy

A computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic database MEDLINE of studies published in English, French, Spanish, Italian and German between 1966 and July, 2003. Manual searches of the reference lists from the potentially relevant studies were performed in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed using the computer-assisted search strategy. Proceedings from major gastrointestinal meetings were also manually searched from 1985 to 2003 in order to identify unpublished studies. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Review Group Specialized Trials Register were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving patients of any age with Crohn's disease in clinical remission as defined by a CDAI < 150 or by the presence of no symptoms or only mild symptoms at the time of entry into the trial. The experimental treatment consisted of oral conventional corticosteroid therapy (excluding budesonide, fluticasone, etc). Clinical disease relapse was used as the outcome measure of interest.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eligible studies were selected by 4 reviewers and data were extracted onto standardized data extraction forms. Disagreements in eligibility or data extraction were resolved by consensus. Data were converted into individual 2x2 tables for each study. The presence of significant heterogeneity among studies was tested using the chi-square test. The 2x2 tables were synthesized into a summary test statistic using the pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals as described by Cochran and Mantel and Haenszel (the 'odds ratio' in MetaView). A fixed effects model was used for the pooling of data.

Main Results

Four studies were initially judged as being eligible for inclusion. After obtaining additional information on one of the studies it was excluded because it was not double-blind. The total number of subjects included in the analysis at the time points of 6, 12 and 24 months were 142, 131 and 95 for the corticosteroid group and 161, 138 and 87 for the control group. The odds ratios for relapse on active treatment and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were 0.71 (0.39, 1.31), 0.82 (0.47, 1.43) and 0.72 (0.38, 1.35) at 6, 12 and 24 months.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The use of conventional systemic corticosteroids in patients with clinically quiescent Crohn's disease does not appear to reduce the risk of relapse over a 24 month period of follow-up. This review updates the existing review of corticosteroids for maintaining remission of Crohn's disease which was published in the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2003).

### Traditional corticosteroids for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^6c66875d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Historically, corticosteroids have been the most commonly used class of medication for induction of remission in Crohn's disease (CD). Corticosteroids down regulate production of inflammatory cytokines and interfere with NF-kappaB production, thereby blunting inflammatory response.

Objectives

The primary objective was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of traditional corticosteroids (given orally or intravenously) for induction of remission in CD.

Search Strategy

The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders (IBD/FBD) Group Specialized Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. No language restrictions were applied. Reference lists of trials and review articles, as well as recent proceedings from major gastroenterology meetings were manually searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, controlled clinical trials of traditional, systemic corticosteroids for the induction of remission of active CD were included in this review. Control groups included patients receiving either placebo or 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA). The study population included patients of any age with active CD (as defined by the study authors or validated clinical activity indices), receiving any formulation of systemically available corticosteroid by any oral or parenteral methods of delivery. The primary outcome was induction of remission of CD. Secondary outcomes included clinical response, change in mean CDAI, adverse events and the proportion of patients withdrawing due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using Jadad's criteria. A random or fixed effects model was chosen based on an assessment of heterogeneity, and studies were weighted using the DerSimonian & Laird or the Mantel-Haenszel method accordingly. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 4.2.10 software.

Main Results

Two studies compared corticosteroids to placebo and six studies compared corticosteroids to 5-ASA. Corticosteroids were found to be significantly more effective than placebo at inducing remission in CD (RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.51 to 2.64; P < 0.00001). Corticosteroids were found to be more effective than 5-ASA at inducing remission in studies with long follow-up duration (i.e. > 15 weeks; RR 1.65; 95% CI 1.33 to 2.03; P < 0.00001). Corticosteroids induced adverse events in a higher proportion of patients than placebo (RR 4.89; 95% CI 1.98 to 12.07; P = 0.0006), or low-dose 5-ASA (RR 2.38; 95% CI 1.34 to 4.25; P = 0.003). No difference existed in the proportion of patients experiencing adverse events when steroids were compared to high-dose 5-ASA. Steroids did not induce more study withdrawals due to adverse events than either placebo or 5-ASA.

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission in patients with CD, particularly when used for more than 15 weeks. Although corticosteroids cause more adverse events than either placebo or low-dose 5-ASA, these adverse events did not lead to increased study withdrawal in the included studies. Further information is required to determine the optimal duration of treatment and tapering protocol to maximize the efficacy of treatment with corticosteroids. Additionally, further study is required to determine whether corticosteroids are more effective in patients with certain phenotypes or when administered intravenously.

### Evidence-based efficacy of methotrexate in adult Crohn's disease in different intestinal and extraintestinal indications [^c5049f2c]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review describes the evidences available to support the use of MTX in specific clinical scenarios of CD, with the aim to critically discuss the current indications described by the most recent guidelines, as well as its clinical off-label use, which is increasingly proposed as rescue therapy or optimization strategy in different clinical settings.

Our review shows that, despite more than one hundred published studies, there are very few evidences on the efficacy of MTX derived from RCTs. Moreover, several studies are limited by some methodological biases or were performed many years ago, according to different criteria of patient selection and treatment efficacy.

The latest guidelines recommend the use of MTX in patients with active CD as immunomodulator in the scenarios of steroid-dependency, steroid-failure, intolerance to thiopurines or in association with anti-TNFα treatment as combination therapy. – In our review, we show that steroid-dependency is the only scenario supported by RCT so far.

On the contrary, the other 'classic' indications for MTX, indicated in previous guidelines and deleted or conditionally granted in more recent editions, –, do not find support from high level of evidence: steroid-refractoriness, failure to thiopurines and combination therapy with anti-TNFα drugs, although described in single uncontrolled case series, do not find an unequivocal favourable opinion from numerous, but heterogeneous, studies. Not surprisingly, the meta-analyses published to date describe the extreme heterogeneity of study populations, treatment regimens and outcome definitions. –, One seemingly redundant point, however, appears to be the better performance of the higher parenteral doses (25 mg per week) compared with the low oral doses, the first and only ones to be associated with a benefit over placebo in induction RCTs. –

Moderately to severely active Crohn's disease — steroids and thiopurines for induction: We recommend oral corticosteroids for short-term induction of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). We recommend against azathioprine (at doses of 1.5–2.5 mg/kg/d) and 6-mercaptopurine (at doses of 0.75–1.5 mg/kg/d) for induction of remission in moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence).

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the surgical management of Crohn's disease [^d4572542]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — operative indications for medically refractory disease state that patients who demonstrate an inadequate response to, develop complications from, or are nonadherent with medical therapy "should typically be considered for surgery," with "Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C." The goals of medical treatment of CD are to achieve remission with endoscopic mucosal healing and avoid relapse; with glucocorticoids, clinical improvement is usually evident "within days of initiation of intravenous therapy and within 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with oral glucocorticoids," whereas with immunomodulators used as monotherapy a plateau in symptom improvement is often demonstrated "within 12 to 16 weeks."

### A review of the therapeutic management of Crohn's disease [^daf4e21b]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory, relapsing-remitting, and progressive gastrointestinal disorder with an often-negative impact on the physical, emotional, and psychological well-being. Over the past two decades, the medical compendium for the treatment of Crohn's disease has increased significantly, enabling treatment beyond symptoms. Indeed, early and timely use of effective medical therapy has been reflected by improved outcomes with reduction in surgery and ability to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission, reduce corticosteroid dependance, and prevent long-term complications in more patients. In this review, we discuss the key milestones in the medical management of Crohn's disease.

### Methotrexate for induction of remission in refractory Crohn's disease [^fab27d2f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant adverse effects. The success of methotrexate as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis led to its evaluation in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Methotrexate has been studied for induction of remission of refractory Crohn's disease and has become the principal alternative to azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy. This systematic review is an update of previously published Cochrane reviews.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease in the presence or absence of concomitant steroid therapy.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialized register from inception to June 9, 2014 for relevant studies. Conference proceedings and reference lists were also searched to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of methotrexate compared to placebo or an active comparator for treatment of active refractory Crohn's disease in adult patients (> 17 years) were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome was failure to enter remission and withdraw from steroids. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, serious adverse events and quality of life. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality of included studies. The GRADE approach was used to assess the overall quality of evidence supporting the primary outcome.

Main Results

Seven studies (495 patients) were included. Four studies were rated as low risk of bias. Three studies were rated as high risk of bias due to open label or single-blind designs. The seven studies differed with respect to participants, intervention, and outcomes to the extent that meta-analysis was considered to be inappropriate. GRADE analyses indicated that the quality of evidence was very low to low for most outcomes due to sparse data and inadequate blinding. Three small studies which employed low dose oral methotrexate showed no statistically significant difference in failure to induce remission between methotrexate and placebo or between methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine. For the study using 15 mg/week of oral methotrexate 33% (5/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 11% (2/18) of placebo patients (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 13.31). For the study using 12.5 mg/week of oral methotrexate 81% (21/26) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 77% (20/26) of placebo patients (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.39). This study also had an active comparator arm, 81% (21/26) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 59% (19/32) of 6-mercaptopurine patients (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.92). For the active comparator study using 15 mg/week oral methotrexate, 20% (3/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 6% of 6-mercaptopurine patients (RR 3.20, 95% CI 0.37 to 27.49). This study also had a 5-ASA arm and found that methotrexate patients were significantly more likely to enter remission than 5-ASA patients. Twenty per cent (3/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 86% (6/7) of 5-ASA patients (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.67). One small study which used a higher dose of intravenous or oral methotrexate (25 mg/week) showed no statistically significant difference between methotrexate and azathioprine. Forty-four per cent (12/27) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 37% of azathioprine patients (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.29). Two studies found no statistically significant difference in failure to enter remission between the combination of infliximab and methotrexate and infliximab monotherapy. One small study utilized intravenous methotrexate (20 mg/week) for 5 weeks and then switched to oral (20 mg/week). Forty-five per cent (5/11) of patients in the combination group failed to enter remission compared to 62% of infliximab patients (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.69). The other study assessing combination therapy utilized subcutaneous methotrexate (maximum dose 25 mg/week). Twenty-four per cent (15/63) of patients in the combination group failed to enter remission compared to 22% (14/63) of infliximab patients (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.03). A large placebo-controlled study which employed a high dose of methotrexate intramuscularly showed a statistically significant benefit relative to placebo. Sixty-one per cent of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 81% of placebo patients (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; number needed to treat, NNT = 5). Withdrawals due to adverse events were significantly more common in methotrexate patients than placebo in this study. Seventeen per cent of methotrexate patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to 2% of placebo patients (RR 8.00, 95% CI 1.09 to 58.51). The incidence of adverse events was significantly more common in methotrexate patients (63%, 17/27) than azathioprine patients (26%, 7/27) in one small study (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.89). No other statistically significant differences in adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events were reported in any of the other placebo-controlled or active comparator studies. Common adverse events included nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence from a single large randomized trial which suggests that intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg/week) provides a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any significant benefit relative to placebo or active comparator. However, these trials were small and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Comparative studies of methotrexate to drugs such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine would require the randomization of large numbers of patients. The addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infliximab monotherapy. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies.

### Evidence-based efficacy of methotrexate in adult Crohn's disease in different intestinal and extraintestinal indications [^b4fdee34]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Methotrexate (MTX) is included in the therapeutic armamentarium of Crohn's disease (CD), although its positioning is currently uncertain in an era in which many effective biological drugs are available. No systematic reviews or meta-analysis have stratified the clinical outcomes of MTX according to the specific clinical scenarios of its use.

Methods:

Medline, PubMed and Scopus were used to extract eligible studies, from database inception to May 2021. A total of 163 studies were included. A systematic review was performed by stratifying the outcomes of MTX according to formulation, clinical indication and criteria of efficacy.

Results:

The use of MTX is supported by randomized clinical trials only in steroid-dependent CD, with similar outcomes to thiopurines. The use of MTX in patients with steroid-refractoriness, failure of thiopurines or in combination with biologics is not supported by high levels of evidence. Combination therapy with biologics can optimize the immunogenic profile of the biological drug, but the impact on long-term clinical outcomes is described only in small series with anti-TNFα. Other off-label uses, such as fistulizing disease, mucosal healing, postoperative prevention and extraintestinal manifestations, are described in small uncontrolled series. The best performance in most indications was shown by parenteral MTX, favouring higher doses (25 mg/week) in the induction phase.

Discussion:

Evidence from high-quality studies in favour of MTX is scarce and limited to the steroid-dependent disease, in which other drugs are the leading players today. Many limitations on study design have been found, such as the prevalence of retrospective underpowered studies and the lack of stratification of outcomes according to specific types of patients and formulations of MTX.

Conclusion:

MTX is a valid option as steroid-sparing agent in steroid-dependent CD. Numerous other clinical scenarios require well-designed clinical studies in terms of patient profile, drug formulation and dosage, and criteria of efficacy.

### An international consensus on appropriate management of corticosteroids in clinical trials in inflammatory bowel disease [^278f1a3a]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Approval of new therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) requires rigorously designed and well-executed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Corticosteroids remain a cornerstone of IBD induction therapy and many patients in trials are enrolled while taking corticosteroids. Despite this, approaches to corticosteroid management in RCTs have been highly heterogeneous, often differing from clinical practice. This negatively impacts patients' willingness to participate due to prolonged corticosteroid exposure and may potentially bias outcomes in the clinical trial. Our aim is to provide comprehensive standardized recommendations on key aspects of corticosteroid use in IBD clinical trials through a multi-phase, international expert consensus, with a goal to help inform and standardize practice in future RCTs.

Methods

The consensus was informed by a systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, which determined the corticosteroid management rules used in placebo-controlled trials of advanced therapies in IBD. International expert consensus recommendations for all aspects of corticosteroid management in RCTs were then developed using a modified Delphi process with two rounds of survey questions and a ratification meeting.

Results

These recommendations propose management of corticosteroids during screening, induction, and maintenance phases of pharmacologic trials in IBD, and define corticosteroid-related endpoints. We emphasize the need for minimizing corticosteroid exposure through expedited tapering and shorter fixed-dosing periods that more closely reflect clinical care, and provide recommendations for standardized definitions of corticosteroid-free remission.

Conclusions

These recommendations will serve to optimize trial design and facilitate appropriate, acceptable, and standardized RCT corticosteroid handling practices.

### Approach to corticosteroid-dependent and corticosteroid-refractory Crohn's disease [^0e79945c]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are considered a drug of choice for the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic recurrent flares of disease activity. However, among patients receiving corticosteroid therapy for induction of remission, 20% have corticosteroid-refractory disease and 36% of those with an initial response develop corticosteroid dependency within 1 year. Chronic corticosteroid exposure in patients who are corticosteroid dependent increases the risk for serious drug-related adverse effects. Withdrawal or reduction of corticosteroid therapy without exacerbation of symptoms is therefore recognized as an important goal of treatment. Therapies that have been shown to facilitate "steroid sparing' include the immunomodulators azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate and the antitumor necrosis factor-alpha monoclonal antibody infliximab. In corticosteroid-dependent patients, budesonide may be substituted for conventional corticosteroid therapy without loss of response and with less risk for toxicity, but its long-term efficacy requires further evaluation. A preliminary controlled study suggests that the investigational anti-TNF monoclonal antibody CDP-571 may also be clinically beneficial as a corticosteroid-sparing agent. This review summarizes the clinical evidence that supports consideration of these agents as alternatives in patients with CD who are dependent on, refractory to, or intolerant of conventional corticosteroid therapy.

### Steroid use and misuse: a key performance indicator in the management of IBD [^7598825e]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids remain an important tool for inducing remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but they have no role in maintenance of remission. The significant adverse side effect profile of these drugs means their use should be avoided where possible or measures taken to reduce their risk. Despite an expanding array of alternative therapies, corticosteroid dependency and excess remain common. Appropriate steroid use is now regarded a key performance indicator in the management of IBD. This article aims to outline indications for corticosteroid use in IBD, their risks and strategies to reduce their use and misuse.

### Managing steroid-dependent Crohn's disease… [^30458022]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with steroid-dependent Crohn's disease are those who respond to steroid therapy but cannot taper the treatment. Steroid-refractive patients are those who fail to respond to adequate treatment dosages of up to 1 mg per kg of prednisone within four weeks. Steroid dependency is common in patients with Crohn's disease who respond to prednisone treatment. Contributing factors associated with steroid dependency include cigarette smoking, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Management strategies for steroid-dependent patients include surgery and immunomodulator therapy. Surgery potentially can restore health to a severely ill patient. Immunomodulator therapy with azathioprine or 6-mercapto-purine has been studied most frequently in combination with prednisone. Although combination therapy has some therapeutic advantage, the efficacy of these agents in steroid-dependent patients is unclear.

Methotrexate and infliximab appear to be more successful in weaning patients from steroid dependence. Other agents such as mesalamine appear to have no use in tapering steroid-dependent patients. The author concludes that patients with steroid-dependent Crohn's disease are best helped by reassessing the causes of the symptoms, eliminating potential exacerbating factors, employing surgery in select patients with localized disease, and using azathioprine or mercaptopurine. With the latter therapy, once patients are weaned from steroids, the purine antimetabolite is continued for an indefinite period while the physician monitors white blood cell count and liver enzymes. If purine metabolites cannot be used, methotrexate or infliximab can be tried. Patients who are refractory to steroids and immunomodulators and patients in whom steroids are contraindicated should be given infliximab for an indefinite period. editor's note: Guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology.

Patients with moderate to severe disease can be treated with prednisone in a dosage of 40 to 60 mg daily until symptoms resolve and weight gain resumes. Infliximab is a useful adjunct or alternative to corticosteroid therapy when the latter cannot be used or is ineffective. Because of the negative effects of chronic steroid use, an alternative agent should be used to maintain long-term remission. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine can be helpful after remission has been achieved with steroid therapy. In patients who have had ileocolonic resection, mesalamine, azathioprine, or mercaptopurine may help decrease the incidence of recurrence. — R. S.

### Is top-down therapy a more effective alternative to conventional step-up therapy for Crohn's disease? [^49f481c2]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease remains a challenge for practitioners to treat, and top-down therapy will be a continued area of research in the coming years. As advances are made in the field of monoclonal antibodies, the development of newer biologic immunosuppressing drugs will continue. However, given the costs and potential side-effects of the long-term use of immunosuppression, care should be taken in designing trials to ensure that well-designed treatment regimens with appropriate disease stratification and objective outcome measures can provide good evidence for future treatment.

In its current state, nevertheless, the mainstay of therapy continues to be based largely on imprecise treatment using either "step-up" or newly proposed "top-down" approaches. Research and evidence supporting top-down therapy remain limited. Combined therapy showed promising results over both early biologic and early immunomodulatory treatment and may be a recommended area for further study. Drug combinations, timing, and dosage are all areas that should be addressed. Considering this, we recommend that the most desirable treatment for a newly diagnosed Crohn's disease patient should be a personalized and tailored approach and that the disease should be stratified for each patient, taking into consideration the location, extent, previous disease course and severity of their Crohn's disease, as well as their comorbidities and the patient's personal preferences. Combined ("top-down") therapy should be considered for patients with complicated disease, with poor prognostic factors (e.g. diagnosis as pediatric patient, recurrent flare-up, steroid dependent, multiple failed steroid treatments), and extensive disease suggestive of an aggressive disease course (e.g. perianal disease, evidence of severe bowel damage and/or need for surgical intervention). Patients undergoing top-down therapy must be place under close monitoring to ensure their safety prior to their intensive treatment. Further research will need to focus on investigation into the genetics and pathophysiology of Crohn's disease. Only with proper understanding of the nature of Crohn's disease can one truly develop precision therapy that targets relevant pathologic pathways. If precise medications can be identified to achieve specific outcomes, a more personalized and targeted treatment may be possible.

### A review of the therapeutic management of Crohn's disease [^140580cc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory, relapsing-remitting, and progressive gastrointestinal disorder with an often-negative impact on the physical, emotional, and psychological well-being. Over the past two decades, the medical compendium for the treatment of Crohn's disease has increased significantly, enabling treatment beyond symptoms. Indeed, early and timely use of effective medical therapy has been reflected by improved outcomes with reduction in surgery and ability to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission, reduce corticosteroid dependance, and prevent long-term complications in more patients. In this review, we discuss the key milestones in the medical management of Crohn's disease.

### Budesonide for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^e61561ed]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are commonly used for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. However, traditional corticosteroids can cause significant adverse events. Budesonide is an alternative glucocorticoid with limited systemic bioavailability.

Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease.

Search Methods

The following electronic databases were searched up to June 2014: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists of articles, as well as conference proceedings were manually searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing budesonide to a placebo or active comparator were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3.5 software. The primary outcome was induction of remission (defined by a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) < 150) by week 8 to 16 of treatment. Secondary outcomes included: time to remission, mean change in CDAI, clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement, improvement in quality of life, adverse events and early withdrawal. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each dichotomous outcome and the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI for each continuous outcome. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. A random-effects model was used for the pooled analyses. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcomes and selected secondary outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Fourteen studies (1805 patients) were included: Nine (779 patients) compared budesonide to conventional corticosteroids, three (535 patients) were placebo-controlled, and two (491 patients) compared budesonide to mesalamine. Ten studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. Three studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to open label design. One study was judged to be at high risk of bias due to selective reporting. After eight weeks of treatment, 9 mg budesonide was significantly more effective than placebo for induction of clinical remission. Forty-seven per cent (115/246) of budesonide patients achieved remission at 8 weeks compared to 22% (29/133) of placebo patients (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.73; 3 studies, 379 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (144 events). Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission at eight weeks. Fifty-two per cent of budesonide patients achieved remission at week 8 compared to 61% of patients who received conventional steroids (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97; 8 studies, 750 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to risk of bias. Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids among patients with severe disease (CDAI > 300) (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95). Studies comparing budesonide to mesalamine were not pooled due to heterogeneity (I(2) = 81%). One study (n = 182) found budesonide to be superior to mesalamine for induction of remission at 8 weeks. Sixty-eight per cent (63/93) of budesonide patients were in remission at 8 weeks compared to 42% (37/89) of mesalamine patients (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.16). The other study found no statistically significant difference in remission rates at eight weeks. Sixty-nine per cent (107/154) of budesonide patients were in remission at 8 weeks compared to 62% (132/242) of mesalamine patients (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.32). Fewer adverse events occurred in those treated with budesonide compared to conventional steroids (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.76) and budesonide was better than conventional steroids in preserving adrenal function (RR for abnormal ACTH test 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78).

Authors' Conclusions

Budesonide is more effective than placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Although short-term efficacy with budesonide is less than with conventional steroids, particularly in those with severe disease or more extensive colonic involvement, the likelihood of adverse events and adrenal suppression with budesonide is lower. The current evidence does not allow for a firm conclusion on the relative efficacy of budesonide compared to 5-ASA products.

### Budesonide for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^6f3174b0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids continue to play a central role in induction of remission in active Crohn's disease. However, their use comes at a price of significant adverse effects when used repeatedly or for extended periods. Newer corticosteroid agents with limited systemic bioavailability offer a tantalizing option, if they can be shown to be efficacious and safer than conventional corticosteroids. Budesonide is the main alternative corticosteroid currently available in an enteric formulation.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of oral budesonide for the treatment of acute flares of Crohn's disease. A secondary but important endpoint was to evaluate the adverse effect profile.

Search Strategy

The following sources were used to search the literature for potentially relevant papers and trials. 1. A computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic database MEDLINE from 1986 onwards. 2. Hand searching the reference lists of trials and review articles identified by means of the computer- assisted search. 3. Proceedings from major gastrointestinal meetings were manually searched from 1990 onwards. 4. Contact with the relevant pharmaceutical companies that have been involved in the development of budesonide.

Selection Criteria

Potentially relevant articles were reviewed in an independent unblinded fashion by two authors to determine if they met the criteria specified below: 1) STUDY POPULATION: Patients of any age with acutely active Crohn's disease, as defined by a CDAI > 150. 2) METHODOLOGY: Randomized double blind controlled trials comparing budesonide to a control treatment. Patients in the control arm may have received placebo, conventional corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid or sulfasalazine. 3) OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical remission was the outcome measure of interest. The definition of remission was usually a CDAI < 150 by 8 to 16 weeks of therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eligible articles were reviewed in duplicate and the results of the primary research trials were abstracted onto specially designed data extraction forms. The proportion of patients achieving remission in the active treatment and control groups of each study were derived from the data provided in the original research papers. Where possible, data were broken down based on site of disease or other strata used by the individual trials.

Statistical Analysis

Data extracted from the original research articles were converted, where necessary, into individual 2 x 2 tables (remission versus no remission x budesonide versus control) for each of the individual studies. Where available, individual 2 x 2 tables for strata within studies were also used. The presence of significant heterogeneity among studies was tested for using the chi-square test. Because this is a relatively insensitive test for the presence of heterogeneity, a p-value of 0.10 was regarded as statistically significant. Where p < 0.10 the data from the individual studies were still combined but the pooled results were interpreted with caution. The 2 x 2 tables were synthesized into a summary test statistic using the pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals as described by Cochran and Mantel and Haenszel. A fixed effects model was used for the pooling of data. The analysis was performed initially by combining data from all trials to estimate the response rate to budesonide therapy. The analysis was also performed by combining only studies with comparable control groups.

Main Results

Eight studies were deemed eligible for review.

Efficacy

Budesonide was superior to placebo for induction of remission with a pooled odds ratio for the two placebo-controlled trials of 2.85 (95% CI 1.67–4.87). A single trial comparing budesonide with mesalamine demonstrated an odds ratio of 2.80 (95% CI 1.50–5.20) in favour of budesonide over mesalamine for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease. However, budesonide was inferior to conventional corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) for induction of remission with a pooled odds ratio for the five trials of 0.69 (95% CI 0.51–0.95).

Safety

The two trials comparing budesonide versus placebo (Greenberg 1994; Tremaine 2002) showed no difference between study groups for proportion of reported corticosteroid-related adverse effects with the pooled odds ratio for both trials of 0.98 (95% CI 0.58–1.67). Five trials comparing budesonide versus prednisone showed the budesonide study group had fewer reported corticosteroid-related adverse effects than the prednisone study group (pooled odds ratio was 0.38 (95% CI 0.28–0.53).

Authors' Conclusions

With disease in the ileum or ascending colon, budesonide offers an effective therapy which is somewhat less efficacious but with fewer adverse effects than conventional corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone, prednisolone, or 6-methylprednisolone).

### Methotrexate for induction of remission in refractory Crohn's disease [^788d88a7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Although corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, approximately 20% of patients who respond relapse when steroids are withdrawn and become steroid dependent (Binder 1985). Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant adverse effects. The success of methotrexate as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis led to its evaluation in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Methotrexate has been studied for induction of remission of refractory Crohn's disease and has become the principal alternative to azathioprine/6MP therapy. The evidence for its effectiveness has not been subjected to a systematic review.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review of the evidence for effectiveness of methotrexate for induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease in the presence and absence of concomitant steroid therapy.

Search Strategy

A computer-assisted search of MEDLINE and EMBASE for relevant studies published in English, French, Spanish, Italian and German between 1966 and July 2004. Manual searches of reference lists from potentially relevant papers were performed to identify additional studies. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the IBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials involving patients of age > 17 years with refractory Crohn's disease defined by conventional clinical, radiological and endoscopic criteria, which was categorized as being active (Crohn's disease activity index > 150).

Outcome Measures

The outcome measure was the rate of induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids in the treatment and control groups after > 16 weeks of treatment. A secondary outcome was induction of remission with reduction in steroid dose of at least 50%. Selection of trials: The results of the searches above were reviewed independently by two observers and relevant studies selected according to the predefined selection criteria. Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus. The same two reviewers assessed the methodological quality of each trial (details of randomization method, including whether intention-to-treat analysis was possible from the published data, number of patients lost to follow-up, and if a blinded outcome assessment was used). A standard data extraction form was used. Appropriateness of combining results: Trials were first reviewed to assess the clinical comparability of trial protocols and study populations.

Main Results

Five randomized trials were identified. The five studies differed with respect to participants, intervention, and outcomes to the extent that it was considered to be inappropriate to combine the data statistically. Three small studies which employed low doses of methotrexate orally showed no statistically significant difference between methotrexate and placebo/control medication treated patients. One small study which used a higher dose of intravenous/oral methotrexate showed no statistically significant difference between methotrexate and azathioprine. A larger study which employed a higher dose of methotrexate intramuscularly showed substantial benefit (number needed to treat, NNT = 5). Adverse effects were more common with high dose intramuscular methotrexate therapy than with placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence from a single large randomized trial on which to recommend the use of methotrexate 25 mg intramuscularly weekly for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Although adverse effects were more common than with placebo, they were not severe. There is no evidence on which to base a recommendation for use of lower dose oral methotrexate.

Preoperative considerations — glucocorticoids and immunomodulators in Crohn's disease (CD) surgery — Preoperative high-dose glucocorticoids increase the risk of postoperative infectious complications and attempts should typically be made to wean glucocorticoids before surgical intervention, while immunomodulators are not associated with increased risk of postoperative infectious complications and do not typically need to be held before surgery (Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence). Glucocorticoids are a known risk factor for increased 30-day postoperative infectious complications after bowel surgery, with some studies suggesting that this risk is increased with daily doses > 20 mg, and for risk reduction purposes attempts should typically be made to wean patients' glucocorticoids at least to a daily dose < 20 mg before surgical intervention, if possible; immunomodulators can typically be safely continued in the perioperative period.

### Glucocorticosteroid therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^e78acb3f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The use of glucocorticosteroids to treat both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is widespread, but no systematic review and meta-analysis has examined the issue of efficacy of these agents in its entirety.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched (through December 2010). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults with active or quiescent CD comparing standard glucocorticosteroids or budesonide with placebo or each other, or comparing standard glucocorticosteroids with placebo in active UC, were eligible. Dichotomous data were extracted to obtain relative risk (RR) of failure to achieve remission in active disease, and RR of relapse of activity in quiescent disease, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Adverse events data were extracted where reported.

Results

The search identified 3,061 citations, and 20 trials were eligible. Only one trial was at low risk of bias. Standard glucocorticosteroids were superior to placebo for UC remission (RR of no remission = 0.65; 95% CI 0.45–0.93). Both trials of standard glucocorticosteroids in CD remission reported a statistically significant effect, but because of heterogeneity between studies, the overall effect was not significant (RR = 0.46; 95% CI 0.17–1.28). Budesonide was superior to placebo for CD remission (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.63–0.84), but not in preventing CD relapse (RR = 0.93; 95% CI 0.83–1.04). Standard glucocorticosteroids were superior to budesonide for CD remission (RR = 0.82; 95% CI 0.68–0.98), but glucocorticosteroid-related adverse events were commoner (RR = 1.64; 95% CI 1.34–2.00).

Conclusions

Standard glucocorticosteroids are probably effective in inducing remission in UC, and may be of benefit in CD. Budesonide induces remission in active CD, but is less effective than standard glucocorticosteroids, and is of no benefit in preventing CD relapse.

### Infliximab in the treatment of Crohn's disease: a user's guide for clinicians [^00646e8d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Induction therapy with infliximab is indicated for treatment of signs and symptoms, and induction and maintenance of remission in patients with moderate to severely active inflammatory Crohn's disease with an inadequate response to conventional therapy, and for reduction in the number of draining fistulas in patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease. Emerging indications for infliximab therapy in patients with Crohn's disease include maintenance of fistula improvement (reduction in the number of draining perianal or enterocutaneous fistulas) and complete fistula response (no draining fistulas) in patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease, steroid sparing in steroid-treated patients, early use in hospitalized patients who have not failed conventional medical therapy where there is either a severe clinical presentation or a rapid onset of action is desired, and in a variety of unusual and extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease. An infliximab dose of 5 mg/kg is recommended initally, but some patients who require maintenance dosing may benefit from increasing the infliximab dose over a range of 5–10 mg/kg. An induction regimen of 3 doses at 0, 2, and 6 weeks is the preferred dosing strategy for inducing remission. The optimal dosing interval for patients who require retreatment appears to be every 8 weeks for most patients. Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate may result in improved outcomes due to a reduction in the frequency of human anti-chimeric antibody formation, acute infusion reactions, and a reduced risk of delayed hypersensitivity-like reactions and formation of antinuclear antibodies. Pretreatment with diphenhydramine (and in selected cases of acetaminophen and, rarely, corticosteroids) is recommended in patients with a history of infusion reactions and patients at risk for delayed hypersensitivity-like reactions. Patients with evidence of active infection should not receive infliximab until the infection is adequately treated, and all patients should be screened for tuberculosis prior to initiating infliximab therapy.

### Conventional therapies for Crohn's disease [^c841f497]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease is a chronic and progressive immune-mediated disease with increasing incidence worldwide. There are no curative therapies. The primary agents used in the treatment of Crohn's disease are aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics. Each agent has different roles in the induction and maintenance of remission of disease. The biologics available include anti-TNF agents, anti-integrins, and anti-interleukins. The choice of initial biologic therapy should be determined through shared decision-making between the patient and provider.

### Effect of concomitant therapy with steroids and tumor necrosis factor antagonists for induction of remission in patients with Crohn's disease: a systematic review and pooled meta-analysis [^744915cb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

It is not clear whether concomitant therapy with corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents is more effective at inducing remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) than anti-TNF monotherapy. We aimed to determine whether patients with active CD receiving corticosteroids during induction therapy with anti-TNF agents had higher rates of clinical improvement than patients not receiving corticosteroids during induction therapy.

Methods

We systematically searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases, through January 20, 2016, for randomized trials of anti-TNF agents approved for treatment of CD and identified 14 trials (5 of adalimumab, 5 of certolizumab, and 4 of infliximab). We conducted a pooled meta-analysis of individual patient and aggregated data from these trials. We compared data from participants who continued oral corticosteroids during induction with anti-TNF therapy to those treated with anti-TNF agents alone. The endpoints were clinical remission (CD activity index [CDAI] scores < 150) and clinical response (a decrease in CDAI of 100 points) at the end of induction (weeks 4–14 of treatment).

Results

We included 4354 patients who received induction therapy with anti-TNF agents, including 1653 [38.0%] who were receiving corticosteroids. The combination of corticosteroids and an anti-TNF agent induced clinical remission in 32.0% of patients, whereas anti-TNF monotherapy induced clinical remission in 35.5% of patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.74–1.17). The combination of corticosteroids and an anti-TNF agent induced a clinical response in 42.7% of patients, whereas anti-TNF monotherapy induced a clinical response in 46.8% (OR 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96). These findings did not change with adjustment for baseline CDAI scores and concurrent use of immunomodulators.

Conclusions

Based on a meta-analysis of data from randomized trials of anti-TNF therapies in patients with active CD, patients receiving corticosteroids during induction therapy with anti-TNF agents did not have higher rates of clinical improvement compared with patients not receiving corticosteroids during induction therapy. Given these findings and the risks of corticosteroid use, clinicians should consider early weaning of corticosteroids during induction therapy with anti-TNF agents for patients with corticosteroid-refractory CD.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^da6d6c41]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — general management principles and objective assessment — are based on disease location, severity, disease-associated complications including extraintestinal manifestations, and factors affecting future prognosis, and the goal is to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission without significant adverse effects; objective evaluation by endoscopic, sonographic, or cross-sectional imaging is recommended, with improvement evident within 4–12 weeks and maximal treatment effect by 12–16 weeks, after which patients achieving response or remission are transitioned to steroid-sparing maintenance therapy; for continued active symptoms despite optimized therapy, evaluation with an objective study is recommended, and if symptoms or inflammation persist, assessment for medication optimization, addition of other agents, or transition to a different medical or surgical strategy is warranted; biomarkers such as CRP and FC can be assessed but should not exclusively serve as a treatment endpoint, and mimickers such as C. difficile, cytomegalovirus infection, and medication-related adverse effects should be excluded, noting that risks of C. difficile infection may be up to 5-fold higher among patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

### 6-mercaptopurine is effective in Crohn's disease without concomitant steroids [^23bc3356]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) has shown efficacy in the treatment of Crohn's disease when used in conjunction with corticosteroids. Sparse literature to date suggests that 6-MP is effective when used without steroids. We therefore studied the efficacy of 6-MP in corticosteroid-naive Crohn's patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of 24 patients who were treated with 6-MP but had never received any form of steroid treatment at any time. 6-MP efficacy was assessed with serial modified Harvey-Bradshaw scores. In addition to overall response, data were also analyzed according to the indication for treating with 6-MP (disease activity, fistulae, or both). The time to relapse and the treatments required were also analyzed.

Results

Overall, remission or significant improvement was seen in 20 patients (83% of original group). Seven patients (29%) achieved complete remission; another 13 patients (54%) demonstrated significant clinical improvement. By indication, 89% of patients treated for activity, 50% of patients treated for activity and fistula, and 100% of patients treated for fistula alone showed response. Drug effect required a median of 5.7 months to occur (for all patients: range, 1.7–37.9 months). Thirteen of the twenty patients who improved or remitted on 6-MP eventually relapsed, usually due to stopping 6-MP, at a median of 13.8 months (range, 0.9–57.8). Relapse was less frequent if patients continued 6-MP. Treatment of relapses required only antibiotics, and/or restarting 6-MP (or increasing the dose) in most patients.

Conclusions

6-MP is an effective medication for use in steroid-naive patients and is likely to be effective in patients who have received steroids in the past but are not currently receiving them. Relapses occur despite continued therapy, but are often easily treated, and do not require initiating steroids.

### Management of Crohn's disease – a practical approach [^d946f577]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that affects up to 480,000 persons in the United States. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, malaise, and arthralgias, and cause considerable morbidity. Speculation about genetic, environmental, dietary, infectious, and immunologic etiologies has led to treatment modalities directed at each theoretic cause, but therapy guidelines are determined by the severity of disease. Use of salicylates and/or antibiotics can be effective in mild to moderate disease, while steroids are the accepted therapy for more severe active disease. Azathioprine and other immunosuppresant drugs can be used as adjunctive therapy for active Crohn's disease and may help to maintain remission. Infliximab, an antibody to human tumor necrosis factor alpha, has proved successful in the treatment of severe refractory disease and generally causes only mild side effects. Therapy for Crohn's disease must involve treating comorbid conditions to improve the quality of life of patients.

### Budesonide for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^49d2a21e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids play a key role in the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. However, corticosteroids can cause significant adverse events. Budesonide is an alternate enteral glucocorticoid with limited systemic bioavailability.

Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease.

Search Strategy

The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists of articles, as well as conference proceedings were manually searched. Pharmaceutical companies were also contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing budesonide to a control treatment were included. The study population included patients of any age with active Crohn's disease (CDAI > 150). The primary outcome was induction of remission (CDAI < 150) by week 8 to 16 of treatment. Secondary outcomes included: time to remission, mean change in CDAI, clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement, improvement in quality of life, adverse events and early withdrawal.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality. A random effects model was used and studies were weighted using the DerSimonian & Laird method. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 4.2.10 software.

Main Results

Twelve studies were included: 9 compared budesonide with conventional corticosteroids, 2 were placebo-controlled, and 1 compared budesonide with mesalamine. After 8 weeks of treatment, budesonide was significantly more effective than placebo (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.23) or mesalamine (RR 1.63; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.16) for induction of remission. Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.98), particularly among patients with severe disease (CDAI > 300) (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95). Fewer adverse events occurred in those treated with budesonide compared to conventional steroids (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.76) and budesonide was better able to preserve adrenal function (RR for abnormal ACTH test 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78).

Authors' Conclusions

Budesonide is more effective than placebo or mesalamine for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Although short-term efficacy with budesonide is less than with conventional steroids, particularly in those with severe disease or more extensive colonic involvement, the likelihood of adverse events and adrenal suppression is lower.

### Thiopurines and the natural course of Crohn's disease: did we finally find the right therapeutic target? [^69d00a0e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The disease course of Crohn's disease (CD) can be highly heterogeneous, leading to stricturing or perforating complications and surgery in the majority of patients. Evidence is accumulating about the lack of efficacy of azathioprine (AZA) started early in the disease course for achieving steroid-free remission. Novel information, however, indicates that long-term treatment targets addressing structural damage, such as delay of disease progression or avoidance of surgery, can be achieved by early and prolonged use of AZA with or without anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. It is hence worth reconsidering the treat-to-target strategy of immunosuppressant and immunomodulatory therapy in CD.

### Budesonide for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^911ad3b6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are effective for induction, but not maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Significant concerns exist regarding the risk for adverse events, particularly when corticosteroids are used for long treatment courses. Budesonide is a glucocorticoid with limited systemic bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and is effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.

Search Methods

The following databases were searched from inception to 12 June 2014: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists of articles, as well as conference proceedings were manually searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing budesonide to a control treatment, or comparing two doses of budesonide, were included. The study population included patients of any age with quiescent Crohn's disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was maintenance of remission at various reported follow-up times during the study. Secondary outcomes included: time to relapse, mean change in CDAI, clinical, histological, improvement in quality of life, adverse events and study withdrawal. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The Chi(2) and I(2) statistics were used to assess heterogeneity. Random-effects models were used to allow for expected clinical and statistical heterogeneity. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Twelve studies (n = 1273 patients) were included in the review: eight studies compared budesonide to placebo, one compared budesonide to 5-aminosalicylates, one compared budesonide to traditional systemic corticosteroids, one compared budesonide to azathioprine, and one compared two doses of budesonide. Nine studies used a controlled ileal release form of budesonide, while three used a pH-modified release formulation. Nine studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. Three studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to blinding and one of these studies also had inadequate allocation concealment. Budesonide 6 mg daily was no more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission at 3 months, 6 months or 12 months. At three months 64% of budesonide 6 mg patients remained in remission compared to 52% of placebo patients (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.58; 6 studies, 540 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was low due to moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 56%) and sparse data (315 events). At six months 61% of budesonide 6 mg patients remained in remission compared to 52% of placebo patients (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.39; 5 studies, 420 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (238 events). At 12 months 55% of budesonide 6 mg patients remained in remission compared to 48% of placebo patients (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.35; 5 studies, 420 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (215 events). Similarly, there was no significant benefit for budesonide 3 mg compared to placebo at 6 and 12 months. There was no statistically significant difference in continued remission at 12 months between budesonide and weaning doses of prednisolone (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.13; 1 study, 90 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to sparse data (51 events) and high risk of bias (no blinding). Budesonide 6 mg was better than mesalamine 3 g/day at 12 months (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.03 to 6.12; 1 study, 57 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to very sparse data (18 events) and high risk of bias (no blinding). There was no statistically significant difference in continued remission at 12 months between budesonide and azathioprine (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.08; 1 study 77 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to sparse data (55 events) and high risk of bias (single-blind and no allocation concealment). The use of budesonide 6 mg resulted in slight improvements in CDAI scores when assessed at 6 months (MD -24.30, 95% CI -46.31 to -2.29) and 12 months (MD -23.49, 95% CI -46.65 to -0.32) and mean time to relapse of disease (MD 59.93 days, 95% CI 19.02 to 100.84). Mean time to relapse was significantly shorter for patients receiving budesonide than for those receiving azathioprine (MD -58.00, 95% CI -96.68 to -19.32). Adverse events were not more common in patients treated with budesonide compared to placebo (6 mg: RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.52; 3 mg: RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.24). These events were relatively minor and did not result in increased rates of study withdrawal. Commonly reported treatment-related adverse effects included acne, moon facies, hirsutism, mood swings, insomnia, weight gain, striae, and hair loss. Abnormal adrenocorticoid stimulation tests were seen more frequently in patients receiving both 6 mg (RR 2.88, 95% CI 1.72 to 4.82) and 3 mg daily (RR 2.73, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.57) compared to placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

These data suggest budesonide is not effective for maintenance of remission in CD, particularly when used beyond three months following induction of remission. Budesonide does have minor benefits in terms of lower CDAI scores and longer time to relapse of disease. However, these benefits are offset by higher treatment-related adverse event rates and more frequent adrenocorticoid suppression in patients receiving budesonide.

The two main forms of intestinal bowel disease, namely ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are not curable but can be controlled by various medical therapies. The Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IG-IBD) has prepared clinical practice guidelines to help physicians prescribe corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs for these patients. The guidelines consider therapies that induce remission in patients with active disease as well as treatment regimens that maintain remission. These guidelines complement already existing guidelines from IG-IBD on the use of biological drugs in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.

### Evidence-based efficacy of methotrexate in adult Crohn's disease in different intestinal and extraintestinal indications [^3fdf3086]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Efficacy in intestinal indications

In 1989, Kozarek et al. were the first authors to describe the use of MTX in the induction of a clinical response in active CD. This was an open-label, pilot study, with 14 patients refractory to various therapies at that time (steroids, salazopyrin and metronidazole), which were treated with intramuscular MTX at a dose of 25 mg/week for 12 weeks, then switched to an oral maintenance dose of 15 mg/week in case of initial response; an unspecified proportion of these patients had also failed immunosuppressants. In total, 79% of patients reported a clinical response defined by the reduction in clinical activity index and significant reduction in steroid dose, but the steroid-free remission dropped to 50% at 12 weeks.

Several subsequent studies have described the use of MTX in other patients series (Tables 1–5), which are very heterogeneous in terms of disease behaviour (steroid-dependent or -refractory disease, intolerance or refractoriness to thiopurines, previous or concomitant biologic therapy), treatment regimen (formulation, dose and duration of therapy) and outcomes analyzed (response versus remission), thus providing some confusion in the generalization of results. Controlled studies are even few (Table 1), and published meta-analyses suffer from the limitations of the included studies, without focusing on the specific indication for treatment. – Therefore, we report the available evidence sorted, where possible, by type of patient and indication for MTX use.

### Crohn's disease evaluation and treatment: clinical decision tool [^40d8b754]. Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease evaluation and treatment — clinical symptoms correlate poorly with the underlying inflammation, and the combination of symptom remission and endoscopic remission has been dubbed deep remission; instituting a change in therapy in symptomatic patients with objective evidence of inflammation and then reassessing the patient within 6 months to ensure that deep remission has occurred has been dubbed treat to target where the target is deep remission. Therapeutic drug monitoring is applied to help guide decision making in patients treated with biologic agents who lose response. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute clinical support tool, "Identification, Assessment, And Initial Medical Treatment in Crohn's Disease," weaves these concepts together into a practical algorithm to help clinicians assess patients for active inflammation and the presence of complications and co-morbid conditions, risk stratify their patients, apply the therapies shown to be effective in the AGA Institute document, and ensure that patients' underlying inflammation is sufficiently treated. Both the AGA Institute and the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America have developed quality indicators for inflammatory bowel disease, and initial versions are focused on things that can be easily measured (eg, vaccinations, measuring bone density, and administering steroid sparing medications) and on demonstrating that it is possible to reduce practice variation. One could reasonably argue that these quality indicators need to be refocused on treating the underlying inflammation to resolution.

### Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline for the management of luminal Crohn's disease [^510070f7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Crohn's disease (CD) is a lifelong illness with substantial morbidity, although new therapies and treatment paradigms have been developed. We provide guidance for treatment of ambulatory patients with mild to severe active luminal CD.

Methods

We performed a systematic review to identify published studies of the management of CD. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on by a group of specialists.

Results

The consensus includes 41 statements focused on 6 main drug classes: antibiotics, 5-aminosalicylate, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologic therapies, and other therapies. The group suggested against the use of antibiotics or 5-aminosalicylate as induction or maintenance therapies. Corticosteroid therapies (including budesonide) can be used as induction, but not maintenance therapies. Among immunosuppressants, thiopurines should not be used for induction, but can be used for maintenance therapy for selected low-risk patients. Parenteral methotrexate was proposed for induction and maintenance therapy in patients with corticosteroid-dependent CD. Biologic agents, including tumor necrosis factor antagonists, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab, were recommended for patients failed by conventional induction therapies and as maintenance therapy. The consensus group was unable to clearly define the role of concomitant immunosuppressant therapies in initiation of treatment with a biologic agent.

Conclusions

Optimal management of CD requires careful patient assessment, acknowledgement of patient preferences, evidence-based use of existing therapies, and thorough assessment to define treatment success.

### Management of active Crohn disease [^0e81ee2f]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Treatment of Crohn disease is rapidly evolving, with the induction of novel biologic therapies and newer, often more intensive treatment approaches. Knowing how to treat individual patients in this quickly changing milieu can be a challenge.

Objective

To review the diagnosis and management of moderate to severe Crohn disease, with a focus on newer treatments and goals of care.

Evidence Review

MEDLINE was searched from 2000 to 2011. Additional citations were procured from references of select research and review articles. Evidence was graded using the American Heart Association level-of-evidence guidelines.

Results

Although mesalamines are still often used to treat Crohn disease, the evidence for their efficacy is lacking. Corticosteroids can be effectively used to induce remission in moderate to severe Crohn disease, but they do not maintain remission. The mainstays of treatment are immunomodulators and biologics, particularly anti-tumor necrosis factor.

Conclusion and Relevance

Immunomodulators and biologics are now the preferred treatment options for Crohn disease.

### Corticosteroid-sparing treatments in patients with Crohn's disease [^f09d199a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Conventional corticosteroid therapy effectively induces remission of Crohn's disease (CD) across a range of disease severity. However, alternative treatments are needed for patients with disease unresponsive to corticosteroids, patients requiring maintenance therapy (for which corticosteroids are ineffective), corticosteroid-dependent patients, and patients with corticosteroid-related toxicities. Thus, corticosteroid-sparing effects are an important clinical endpoint for treatments of CD. Budesonide offers comparable efficacy with less short-term toxicity than conventional corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone); this agent has also demonstrated short-term remission maintenance efficacy, while potentially enabling withdrawal of more toxic corticosteroids in corticosteroid-dependent patients. However, budesonide has not shown long-term maintenance benefit in clinical studies, and the risk for and implications of budesonide dependency need further evaluation. The immunomodulators, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, are most effective for maintenance of remission in quiescent disease, but may be useful in conjunction with other therapies in inducing remission in active CD; methotrexate may be considered an alternative because of its efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission. In clinical trials, treatment with azathioprine/6-methotrexate has enabled corticosteroid withdrawal in 55% of patients, and methotrexate, in 39% of patients with corticosteroid-dependent CD, while maintaining clinical response. Monitoring for infrequent hematological or hepatic toxicity is recommended during use of these immunomodulators. Infliximab is effective for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with refractory CD participating in randomized placebo-controlled studies and, in open-label experience, has enabled corticosteroid withdrawal in approximately three quarters of patients. This biological agent is generally well tolerated. Infusion reactions are the most commonly occurring side effects; such reactions may require adjustment of infusion rate and/or treatment with an antihistamine or acetaminophen. The investigational biological agent CDP-571 has also shown corticosteroid-sparing efficacy in patients with CD. In conclusion, recent research has helped identify corticosteroid-sparing treatments that can provide benefit in patients with corticosteroid-dependent and/or corticosteroid-refractory CD or patients at risk for corticosteroid-induced toxicities.

Surgical considerations in medically refractory or intolerant Crohn's disease — Surgical intervention may be warranted in patients who are unable to tolerate medical therapy because of side effects, are nonadherent to medical therapy, or have medically refractory disease activity due to primary or secondary loss of response; surgery may also be considered in patients who are steroid dependent regardless of disease severity because of the deleterious effects of chronic glucocorticoid use, and a randomized, controlled trial proposed laparoscopic resection as a reasonable option rather than initiating monoclonal antibody therapy in relatively limited disease (eg, short-length < 40 cm, inflammatory, nonstricturing, ileocolic disease).

### Budesonide for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^b62c5ecb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids have been shown to be effective for induction, but not maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. However, significant concerns exist regarding their risk for adverse events, particularly when used for long treatment courses. Budesonide is a glucocorticoid with limited systemic bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Budesonide has been shown to be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.

Search Strategy

The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists of articles, as well as conference proceedings were manually searched. Study authors, study sponsors and pharmaceutical companies were also contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing budesonide to a control treatment, or comparing two doses of budesonide, were included. The study population included patients of any age with Crohn's disease in remission. The primary outcome was maintenance of remission at various reported follow-up times during the study, up to 12 months following enrollment. Secondary outcomes included: time to relapse, mean change in CDAI, clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement, improvement in quality of life, adverse events and study withdrawal.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using Jadad's criteria. A random or fixed effects model was chosen based on an assessment of heterogeneity, and studies were weighted using the DerSimonian & Laird or the Mantel-Haenszel method accordingly. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 4.2.10 software.

Main Results

Eleven studies were included in the review: 8 studies compared budesonide with placebo, one compared budesonide to 5-aminosalicylates, one compared budesonide to traditional systemic corticosteroids, and one compared two doses of budesonide with no control group. Eight studies used a controlled ileal release form of budesonide, while three used a pH-modified release formulation. Budesonide 6 mg daily was no more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission at 3 months (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.58; P = 0.05), 6 months (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.39; P = 0.14), or 12 months (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.35; P = 0.19). Budesonide was not more effective than weaning doses of prednisolone for maintenance of remission at 12 months (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.13; P = 0.20), but was better than mesalamine 3 grams per day (RR of remission 2.51; 95% CI 1.03 to 6.12; P = 0.04). Budesonide 3 mg daily was more effective than placebo at 3 months (RR 1.31; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.67; P = 0.03). This benefit was not sustained at 6 months (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.50; P = 0.53), or 12 months (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.30; P = 0.70). No differences in efficacy were detected based on the different formulations of budesonide, methods used to induce remission, or budesonide dose. The use of budesonide 6 mg resulted in slight improvements in CDAI scores when assessed at 6 months (WMD -24.3; 95% CI -46.31 to -2.29; P = 0.03) and 12 months (WMD -23.49; 95% CI -46.65 to -0.32; P = 0.05) and mean time to relapse of disease (WMD 59.93 days; 95% CI 19.02 to 100.84; P = 0.004). Adverse events were more frequent in patients treated with 6 mg of budesonide compared with placebo (RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.19; P = 0.05), but not in patients using lower doses of budesonide. These events were relatively minor and did not result in increased rates of study withdrawal. Abnormal adrenocorticoid stimulation tests were seen more frequently in patients receiving both 6 mg daily (RR 2.88; 95% CI 1.72 to 4.82; P < 0.0001) and 3 mg daily (RR 2.73; 95% CI 1.34 to 5.57; P = 0.006) compared with placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

Budesonide is not more effective than placebo or weaning prednisolone for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Some modest benefits are noted in patients receiving budesonide compared with placebo in terms of lower CDAI scores and longer time to relapse of disease. However, these benefits are offset by higher treatment-related adverse event rates and more frequent adrenocorticoid suppression in patients receiving budesonide. Therefore, budesonide is not recommended for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.

### Early use of immunosuppressives or TNF antagonists for the treatment of Crohn's disease: time for a change [^182e84df]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that follows a progressive and destructive course. Ultimately, uncontrolled inflammation leads to bowel damage from disease-related complications such as strictures, fistulas and abscesses and surgical resection. Conventional 'step-care', whereby corticosteroids and immunosuppressives are prescribed sequentially, is an incremental approach to treatment that does not prevent disease progression and conveys an important risk of adverse events from repeated courses of corticosteroids. Although the immunosuppressives azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate are corticosteroid-sparing, they are not highly effective for inducing mucosal healing or preventing disease progression. Tumour necrosis factor antagonists induce and maintain mucosal healing and reduce surgery and hospitalisation rates. This holds out the possibility that long-term use of these agents may prevent bowel damage. Combination therapy with immunosuppressives and tumour necrosis factor antagonists is likely the best strategy for achieving optimal outcomes in patients at high risk of disease progression. However, accurate prognostic markers must be identified to guide patient selection. Long-term prospective studies with robust outcomes are still needed to establish definitively the efficacy and safety of early combination therapy to prevent bowel damage, loss of gastrointestinal tract function and permanent disability.

### Clinical experience with infliximab therapy in 100 patients with Crohn's disease [^a3dc0c8b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess our clinical experience with infliximab, a monoclonal antitumor necrosis factor antibody, following its approval for treatment of refractory Crohn's disease (CD).

Methods

We followed 100 consecutive patients with CD (53 women and 47 men; mean age, 41 yr) who received a total of 233 infliximab (5 mg/kg) infusions. Adverse events were noted and clinical response assessed every 2 wk for 6 months after each infusion using the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) for active disease, the Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI) for fistulous disease, and steroid withdrawal rates for steroid-sparing efficacy.

Results

Indications for therapy were active disease (n = 57), perianal fistulous disease (n = 33), and steroid dependency (n = 10). Significant infusion reactions occurred in 16 patients (6.9% of infusions) including anaphylactic shock in one patient. Fourteen patients experienced infectious adverse events, 13 of whom were on concurrent steroids. Sixty percent of patients with active disease experienced ≥ 50% HBI reduction at 2 wk; mean duration of response, 8.2 wk. Three of 26 first-time nonresponders with active disease (12%) responded to a second infusion. Sixty-nine percent of patients with fistulous disease experienced > 50% reduction in their PDAI at 2 wk; mean duration of response, 10.9 wk. Four of 10 steroid-dependent patients (40%) discontinued steroid therapy, one of whom recommenced steroid therapy at 24 wk.

Conclusions

Our clinical response rates mirror the efficacy reported in the controlled trials for active and fistulous disease. Steroid-sparing efficacy was seen in 40% of steroid-dependent patients. Concurrent steroids did not reduce the risk of significant infusion reactions (6.9%), but did increase the risk of infections.

Profile of newly diagnosed patients with moderate CD who are candidates for biologic therapy

Selection of appropriate patients for early introduction of biological agents depends on clinical characteristics, patient phenotype and previous response to conventional therapy. Clinical trials have shown that timely applied biological therapy may induce rapid and sustained clinical remission and mucosal healing and prevent complications at least in the short term. It was therefore agreed that initiating biological agents early could increase the likelihood of achieving these treatment goals. Panelists agreed that they would recommend biologic therapy for steroid-dependent and steroid-refractory patients as well as in patients who have relapsed following optimal conventional treatment (Clinical statement 2).

Clinical statement 2
Profile of newly diagnosed patients with moderate Crohn's disease who are candidates for biologic therapy

Early introduction of biological therapy in patients with steroid-refractory moderate CD

The SONIC trial has demonstrated superiority of IFX-based strategies (monotherapy or combined with AZA) over AZA monotherapy in moderate-to-severe CD patients naïve both to thiopurines and biological agents. The London position statement of the 2009 World Congress of Gastroenterology also suggested that early introduction of biologic therapy may benefit patients with moderately active CD when steroids cannot be tolerated. Based on these treatment recommendations, the panel strongly agreed (100% agreement) that steroid-refractory and immunosuppressive-naïve patients should start biologic agents early with or without immunosuppressives (Table 5).

The review focuses on the appropriate use, route of administration and duration for the use of corticosteroids. Additionally, this review summarizes the side effects, use of steroids in special populations (e.g. geriatrics, pregnancy, underrepresented minorities), and their use in the peri-operative setting.

### Tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^7f6d1049]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease may be refractory to conventional treatments including corticosteroids and immunosuppressives. Recent studies suggest TNF-alpha blocking agents may be effective in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review of the evidence for the effectiveness of TNF-alpha blocking agents in the maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched for relevant studies published between 1966–2007. Manual searches of references from potentially relevant papers were performed to identify additional studies. Experts in the field and study authors were contacted to identify unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials involving patients > 18 years with Crohn's disease who had a clinical response or clinical remission with a TNF-alpha blocking agent, or patients with Crohn's disease in remission but unable to wean corticosteroids, who were then randomized to maintenance of remission with a TNF-alpha blocking agent or placebo

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent authors performed data extraction and assessment of the methodological quality of each trial. Outcome measures reported in the primary studies included clinical remission, clinical response, and steroid-sparing effects.

Main Results

Nine studies met all inclusion criteria. Four different anti-TNF-alpha agents were evaluated (infliximab in 3 studies, CDP571 in 3 studies, adalimumab in 2 studies, and certolizumab in 1 study). There is evidence from three randomized controlled trials that infliximab maintains clinical remission (RR 2.50; 95% CI 1.64 to 3.80), maintains clinical response (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.76), has corticosteroid-sparing effects (RR 3.13; 95% CI 1.25 to 7.81), and maintains fistula healing (RR 1.87; 95% CI 1.15 to 3.04) in patients with Crohn's disease with a response to infliximab induction therapy. There were no significant differences in remission rates between infliximab doses of 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg. There is evidence from two randomized controlled trials that adalimumab maintains clinical remission (RR 2.86; 95% CI 2.01 to 4.02), maintains clinical response (RR 2.69; 95% CI 1.88 to 3.86), and has corticosteroid-sparing effects (RR 2.81, 95% CI 1.46 to 5.43) in patients with Crohn's disease who have responded or entered remission with adalimumab induction therapy. There were no significant differences in remission rates between adalimumab 40 mg weekly or every other week. There is evidence from one randomized controlled trial that certolizumab pegol maintains clinical remission (RR 1.68; 95% CI 1.30 to 2.16) and maintains clinical response (RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.41 to 2.13) in patients who have responded to certolizumab induction therapy. There is no evidence to support the use of CDP571 for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Infliximab 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, given every 8 weeks, is effective for the maintenance of remission and maintenance of fistula healing in patients who have responded to infliximab induction therapy. Adalimumab 40 mg weekly or every other week is effective for the maintenance of remission in patients who have responded to adalimumab induction therapy. Certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks is effective for the maintenance of remission in patients who have responded to certolizumab induction therapy. No comparative trials have evaluated the relative efficacy of these agents. Adverse events are similar in the infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab groups compared with placebo, but study size and duration generally are insufficient to allow an adequate assessment of serious adverse events associated with long-term use.

### Clinical profiles of moderate and severe Crohn's disease patients and use of anti-tumor necrosis factor agents: Greek expert consensus guidelines [^29e5c346]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Management of relapse under optimal therapy with immunosuppressives

The appropriate choice of treatment of a particular flare of CD is influenced by previous response to this treatment. This is especially true when patients relapse on optimal therapy to which patients strictly adhere. The panelists strongly endorsed the concept that biological agents should be initiated when there is relapse of CD in patients who adhere to optimal therapy with conventional immunosuppressives (100% agreement). The expert panel recommended that patients who have a severe relapse of CD within 6 months after a course of steroids should be considered for biologic therapy, because early administration of anti-TNF-α therapy is more effective than AZA monotherapy. However, it was also recommended that if a patient experiences a relapse of moderate severity, after long-term remission on immunosuppressives, restarting steroids may be appropriate; the response should be further assessed and, if the patient relapses again, initiation of biologic therapy should be considered (Clinical statement 3).

Clinical statement 3
Indications for early administration of biological therapy in newly diagnosed patients with moderate Crohn's disease

For patients either refractory to or intolerant of thiopurines, available options are to switch to MTX or biologic therapy. The panel reached consensus (100% agreement) regarding the initiation of biologic agents in patients who fail to respond to or are intolerant of or have contraindications to thiopurines. In this case, biological agents may be considered as a treatment option and MTX may be an alternative. Adding MTX to the biologic agent was also recommended to minimize immunogenicity.

The panel agreed that ECCO's working definition of severe CD as indicated by a CDAI score higher than 450 and persistent symptoms despite treatment with steroids is valid although again it is difficult to apply CDAI in routine clinical practice.

There was general agreement among panelists that the main difference between patients with newly diagnosed moderate or severe CD is that the later have more pronounced symptoms and require immediate hospitalization and more aggressive treatment whereas the former can be treated as outpatients. The panelists also agreed that outpatients recently diagnosed with moderate CD who have symptoms refractory to treatment with adequate doses of oral steroids should also be treated as patients with severe CD (Clinical statement 4).

### Glucocorticosteroids in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and approaches to minimizing systemic activity [^a2beee69]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a group of inflammatory conditions characterized by chronic, uncontrolled inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Reported prevalence is high in the United States and northern Europe, while the incidence varies greatly across the rest of Europe. Glucocorticosteroids are the standard treatment for IBD, but due to adverse events their use can be limited. However, new formulations of glucocorticosteroids have been developed to reduce systemic activation. The aim of this review was to assess and summarize the efficacy and safety of new formulations of glucocorticosteroids. A MEDLINE search identified publications focused on new formulations of nonsystemic steroid-based drugs for IBD and benefits and limitations of each of the new glucocorticosteroid formulations were identified. Budesonide has good efficacy and is an established treatment for Crohn's disease; it has been shown to be beneficial for the induction of remission in these patients, although it is not recommended for the maintenance of induced remission. Glucocorticosteroids are not recommended for the maintenance of remission in patients with IBD. However, a recent study suggested that beclomethasone dipropionate may be effective for prolonged treatment in patients in the postacute phase of Crohn's disease who were treated with a short course of systemic steroids. The efficacy of fluticasone propionate and prednisolone metasulphobenzoate in IBD is not well established given the small number of patients enrolled in the few published clinical trials. While the tolerability of these glucocorticosteroids is favourable, more research comparing these new agents with traditional systemic glucocorticosteroids is warranted.

Durability is limited: "repeat endoscopic dilation is required in 41% to 73% of patients followed for up to 5 years," with "recurrence rates… higher at anastomotic sites in comparison to nonanastomotic sites." Candidates with "strictures < 5 cm in length… have been associated with the best long-term outcome," and "Steroid injection of the stricture during dilation is typically not helpful." Long-term need for surgery persists: "Within 2 to 5 years after endoscopic dilation of primary or anastomotic strictures, surgical intervention is required in about one-third of patients."

### Budesonide in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: the first year of experience in clinical practice [^0260a68a]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Delayed release budesonide was approved by the FDA for the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease involving the ileum and ascending colon. Controlled trials have demonstrated that budesonide is effective in inducing remission and for maintenance of remission, with less frequent steroid side effects than conventional steroids. We sought to determine the benefit of this medication in clinical practice and to identify any non-FDA-approved uses that may warrant further study.

Methods

Patients in whom oral budesonide was prescribed between November 1, 2001 and October 31, 2002, were identified and medical records were reviewed. Patients were categorized by indication for therapy: ileocolonic Crohn's disease (group 1), Crohn's disease elsewhere (group 2), and other conditions (group 3).

Results

A total of 225 patients were identified (108 in group 1, 62 in group 2, and 55 in group 3). Group 3 included patients with microscopic colitis (n = 28), pouchitis (n = 13), ulcerative colitis (n = 12), and celiac disease (n = 2). A favorable outcome occurred in 61% of group 1 patients but only 24% of patients in group 2. In group 3, only microscopic colitis patients and pouchitis patients experienced response rates > 50% (77% and 60%, respectively).

Conclusion

Budesonide is effective in a majority of patients with ileocolonic Crohn's disease and microscopic colitis, which is consistent with results reported from clinical trials. A majority of patients with pouchitis also benefit from budesonide therapy, but prospective controlled trials are necessary to clarify the benefit in this group.

### Is top-down therapy a more effective alternative to conventional step-up therapy for Crohn's disease? [^73cef2f9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks and future implications

Results from the 19 clinical trials showed both benefits and disadvantages in the application of top-down therapy. Combined immunosuppression showed possible positive results in achieving remission if administered from week 0. Furthermore, while remission benefits were not shown in the large REACT trial, a reduction in complications was appreciated. On the other hand, early biologic treatment did not have a clear benefit over step-up therapy, but the analysis of this result was limited by the number and types of studies. The argument for early immunomodulatory therapy is also unclear; while surgery rates were seemingly improved by early administration, it was difficult to attribute the benefit to the early therapy because of the long time intervals used to define top-down regimens. Remission was easier to assess, but again early immunomodulatory therapy did not appear to be more effective than step-up therapy, even though a steroid sparing effect and a lower number of relapses were seen in the early immunomodulatory group. In pediatric patients, clinical outcomes in larger studies appeared to show a positive effect, whereas smaller studies failed to find a strong case for top-down therapy. The number and types of studies carried out in pediatric populations presented an obstacle to reviewing the efficacy of top-down therapy.

Mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease (CD) recommendations — We recommend against the use of oral mesalamine for induction or maintenance in patients with mildly to moderately active CD (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). We recommend controlled ileal release budesonide at a dose of 9 mg daily for induction of symptomatic remission in patients with mildly to moderately active ileocecal CD (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). We recommend against the use of ileal release budesonide for maintenance of remission in patients with mildly to moderately active ileocecal CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence).

Moderately to severely active Crohn's disease — immunomodulator maintenance and testing: We suggest azathioprine (at doses of 1.5–2.5 mg/kg/d) and 6-mercaptopurine (at doses of 0.75–1.5 mg/kg/d) for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who had induction of remission with corticosteroids (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). We recommend thiopurine methyltransferase testing before initial use of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to treat patients with CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). We suggest methotrexate (up to 25 mg once weekly intramuscular or subcutaneous) for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who had induction of remission with corticosteroids (conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence).

### Corticosteroid-free remission vs overall remission in clinical trials of moderate-severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease [^6d05d7d7]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

We summarized the protocol-specified corticosteroid tapering regimens in clinical trials of moderate-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and calculated differences in rates of clinical remission vs corticosteroid-free clinical remission (CSF-CR).

Methods

Through a systematic literature review through February 28, 2019, we identified 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of biologics or small molecules in patients with moderate-severe UC or CD who reported CSF-CR as an outcome. We estimated the relative risk and 95% confidence interval of achieving CSF-CR vs overall clinical remission in patients treated with active intervention or placebo through random-effects meta-analysis.

Results

Across trials of UC (11 trials) and CD (5 trials), a median of 53% and 49% of participants were on corticosteroids at the time of trial entry, respectively. Participants were allowed to enter trials at a median corticosteroid dose (range) of 35 (20–40) mg/d. Doses were kept stable for a median (range) of 8 (5–10) weeks during induction therapy, after which a mandatory and structured taper was implemented, albeit with the investigators' discretion depending on clinical status. Pooled rates of CSF-CR in patients with UC and CD treated with placebo were 9.7% and 19.1%, respectively. In UC and CD trials, the rate of CSF-CR was 24% and 18% lower than the rate of overall clinical remission, respectively.

Conclusions

Protocol-specified corticosteroid tapering regimens vary across trials. These findings will help to inform the design and interpretation of future clinical trials and highlight the need for standardization.

### The Italian Society of Gastroenterology (SIGE) and the Italian group for the study of inflammatory bowel disease (IG-IBD) clinical practice guidelines: the use of tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonist therapy in inflammatory bowel disease [^c6e22fea]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Biological therapies are an important step in the management of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. In consideration of high cost and safety issues there is the need to have clear recommendations for their use. Despite the American Gastroenterological Association and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation have published exhaustive Inflammatory Bowel Disease guidelines, national guidelines may be necessary as cultural values, economical and legal issues may differ between countries. For these reasons the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Group for the study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease have decided to elaborate the Italian guidelines on the use of biologics in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The following items have been chosen: definitions of active, inactive, steroid dependent and resistant disease; measures of activity; anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy use in active steroid dependent and refractory luminal Crohn's Disease, in fistulising Crohn's Disease, in steroid dependent and resistant active Ulcerative Colitis; risk of cancer; risk of infections during anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy; special situations. These guidelines are based on evidence from relevant medical literature and clinical experience of a national working group.

### Methotrexate for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^29acbabc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Safe and effective long-term treatments that reduce the need for corticosteroids are needed for Crohn's disease. Although purine antimetabolites are moderately effective for maintenance of remission patients often relapse despite treatment with these agents. Methotrexate may provide a safe and effective alternative to more expensive maintenance treatment with TNF-α antagonists. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review of randomized trials examining the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PUBMED, EMBASE, and the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialized Trials Register were searched from inception to June 9, 2014. Study references and review papers were also searched for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared methotrexate to placebo or any other active intervention for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients maintaining clinical remission as defined by the studies and expressed as a percentage of the total number of patients randomized (intention-to-treat analysis). We calculated the pooled risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Five studies (n = 333 patients) were included in the review. Three studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. Two studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to blinding. Intramuscular methotrexate was superior to placebo for maintenance of remission at 40 weeks follow-up. Sixty-five per cent of patients in the intramuscular methotrexate group maintained remission compared to 39% of placebo patients (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.67; 76 patients). The number needed to treat to prevent one relapse was four. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (40 events). There was no statistically significant difference in maintenance of remission at 36 weeks follow-up between oral methotrexate (12.5 mg/week) and placebo. Ninety per cent of patients in the oral methotrexate group maintained remission compared to 67% of placebo patients (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.67; 22 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (17 events). A pooled analysis of two small studies (n = 50) showed no statistically significant difference in continued remission between oral methotrexate (12.5 mg to 15 mg/week) and 6-mercaptopurine (1 mg/kg/day) for maintenance of remission. Seventy-seven per cent of methotrexate patients maintained remission compared to 57% of 6-mercaptopurine patients (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.00). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to high risk of bias in one study (no blinding) and very sparse data (33 events). One small (13 patients) poor quality study found no difference in continued remission between methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylic acid (RR 2.62, 95% CI 0.23 to 29.79). A pooled analysis of two studies (n = 145) including one high quality trial (n = 126) found no statistically significant difference in maintenance of remission at 36 to 48 weeks between combination therapy (methotrexate and infliximab) and infliximab monotherapy. Fifty-four percent of patients in the combination therapy group maintained remission compared to 53% of monotherapy patients (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.38, P = 0.95). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to high risk of bias in one study (no blinding) and sparse data (78 events). Adverse events were generally mild in nature and resolved upon discontinuation or with folic acid supplementation. Common adverse events included nausea and vomiting, symptoms of a cold, abdominal pain, headache, joint pain or arthralgia, and fatigue.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate quality evidence indicates that intramuscular methotrexate at a dose of 15 mg/week is superior to placebo for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Intramuscular methotrexate appears to be safe. Low dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) does not appear to be effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Combination therapy (methotrexate and infliximab) does not appear to be any more effective for maintenance of remission than infliximab monotherapy. The results for efficacy outcomes between methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylic acid were uncertain. Large-scale studies of methotrexate given orally at higher doses for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease may provide stronger evidence for the use of methotrexate in this manner.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids… [^af48c402]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Unresolved acute pain or subacute pain can evolve into chronic pain. Chronic pain typically lasts > 3 months and can be the result of an underlying medical disease or condition, injury, medical treatment, inflammation, or unknown cause. Opioids can be essential medications for the management of pain; however, they carry considerable potential risk. A systematic review published in 2014 by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found insufficient evidence to demonstrate long-term benefits of prescription opioid treatment for chronic pain, and long-term prescription opioid use was found to be associated with increased risk for overdose and opioid misuse, among other risks, and many insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, and pharmacies have enacted similar policies. At least 17 states have passed laws requiring or recommending the coprescription of naloxone in the presence of overdose risk factors, such as high dosages of opioids or concomitant opioid pain medications and benzodiazepines. 86) as those for which evidence-based clinical practice guidelines would help inform prescribing practices, with the greatest potential effect on public health. This update includes content on management of subacute painful conditions, when duration falls between that typically considered acute and chronic.

The durations used to define acute, subacute, and chronic pain might imply more specificity than is found in real-life patient experience, when pain often gradually transitions from acute to chronic. These time-bound definitions are not meant to be absolute but rather to be approximate guides to facilitate the consideration and practical use of the recommendations by clinicians and patients. The AHRQ review of opioids for chronic pain updated and expanded the evidence for the 2016 CDC review; studies were included on short-term, intermediate-term and long-term outcomes of therapy involving opioids, effects of opioid plus nonopioid combination therapy, effects of tramadol, effects of naloxone coprescription, risks of coprescribed benzodiazepines, risks of coprescribed gabapentinoids, and effects of concurrent use of cannabis.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^3239e3a0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — mortality: Overall mortality in CD is slightly increased, with a standardized mortality ratio of 1.4 times that of the general population, and meta-analyses report a pooled standardized mortality ratio of 1.5 and, in 2013, 1.46 and 1.38 when restricted to population-based and inception studies; studies have demonstrated an association between current use of corticosteroids and increased mortality, with population data showing relative mortality roughly 50% higher than the general population in a large Danish study and 25% higher than expected in Olmsted County, largely driven by those diagnosed before 1980.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^feee99e5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease — immunomodulator recommendations: We recommend against azathioprine (at doses of 1.5–2.5 mg/kg/d) and 6-mercaptopurine (at doses of 0.75–1.5 mg/kg/d) for induction of remission in moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). For maintenance after corticosteroid-induced remission, we suggest azathioprine (1.5–2.5 mg/kg/d) and 6-mercaptopurine (0.75–1.5 mg/kg/d) for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who had induction of remission with corticosteroids (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence), and we suggest methotrexate (up to 25 mg once weekly intramuscular or subcutaneous) for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who had induction of remission with corticosteroids (conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence). We recommend TPMT testing before initial use of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to treat patients with CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). In combination therapy contexts, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate may be used in treatment of active CD as adjunctive therapy for reducing immunogenicity associated with anti-TNF therapy.

### Crohn's disease management: translating STRIDE-II for UK clinical practice [^cd9aed18]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
STRIDE-II treat-to-target recommendations for patients with CD.

Importantly, STRIDE-II accommodates individualisation according to safety profiles by careful consideration of the benefit-to-risk ratio of the selected treatment targets. Intensive treatment choices for patients with a low risk of disease progression may incur risks that overshadow the associated treatment benefits. Furthermore, data from the Crohn's Therapy, Resource, Evaluation, and Assessment Tool (TREAT) registry have shown that infliximab and prednisone use were significant independent predictors of serious infection (both p ≤ 0.049), and prednisone use was a significant independent predictor of mortality (p < 0.001). Determining an appropriate T2T approach using the recommended STRIDE-II target must, therefore, consider individual patient profiles, including medical history and comorbidity.

The 2019 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for managing CD in the United Kingdom recommend initial corticosteroid monotherapy for the induction of remission or budesonide for distal ileal, ileocaecal or right-sided colonic disease where conventional systemic corticosteroids are contraindicated, or in cases where the patient refuses therapy or is corticosteroid intolerant. The current UK clinical practice is also informed by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for IBD which do not explicitly define T2T targets. Systemic corticosteroids are recommended for moderate-to-severe CD, and early biologic therapy is recommended for aggressive CD or patients with poor prognostic features (e.g. stricturing).

In a 2022 educational article, the BSG recommended the adoption of the STRIDE-II principles and targets of T2T clinical management. The 2020 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines similarly recommend systemic corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe CD and biologics for those who do not respond to conventional therapy. However, despite recommendations for steroids as a starting point for therapy, we recommend close monitoring following their initiation to ensure that patients who do not achieve pre-defined targets are transitioned to potentially more effective or advanced therapy options on time. Consequently, an increased awareness of T2T strategies is required to ensure effective implementation in UK clinical practice.

4.3 Initial treatment of moderate to severe ileocolonic Crohn's disease

4.3.1 Corticosteroids

Statement 37. We recommend that moderate to severely active uncomplicated luminal Crohn's disease should be treated initially with systemic corticosteroids (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence), but we suggest that those with extensive disease or other poor prognostic features should be considered for early introduction of biological therapy (GRADE: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 86.7%).

Systemic corticosteroids are still an effective initial therapy for moderate to severely active Crohn's disease, regardless of disease location, but every effort should be made to limit exposure. For less severe symptoms in those with ileocaecal disease location, ileal-release budesonide may be tried initially, but if ineffective, prednisolone may be required. For teenagers, particularly where growth has not completed, and for patients with diabetes or steroid intolerance, alternatives can be considered, including EEN.

4.3.2 Early use of biological therapy

In patients with an aggressive disease course or 'high-risk' poor prognostic factors, the early introduction of biologics may be considered. High-risk features include: complex (stricturing or penetrating) disease at presentation; perianal fistulising disease; age under 40 years at diagnosis; and need for steroids to control the index flare. The predictive power of these features is limited. There is great interest in biomarkers that identify a Crohn's disease subgroup at high risk of an aggressive disease course. A gene expression signature from peripheral CD8 T cells in active untreated IBD has been identified, and is now being tested using a whole blood assay in randomised controlled trials of a 'top-down' versus accelerated 'step-up' therapy.

The decision to start biological therapy should also consider factors such as stage of life, work absence and availability of other treatment options. Discussion in a multidisciplinary team meeting can be helpful. As well as anti-TNF therapy, vedolizumab and ustekinumab can be considered as first-line biologics.

### Outcome measures for clinical trials in paediatric IBD: an evidence-based, expert-driven practical statement paper of the paediatric ECCO committee [^21e61bb3]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Although paediatric-onset IBD is becoming more common, few medications have a registered paediatric indication. There are multiple hurdles to performing clinical trials in children, emphasising the importance of choosing an appropriate outcome measure, which can facilitate enrolment, and thereby also drug approval. The aim of this consensus statement is to highlight paediatric specific issues and key factors critical for the optimal conduct of paediatric IBD trials.

Design

The Paediatric European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) committee has established an international expert panel to determine the best outcome measures in paediatric IBD, following a literature search and a modified Delphi process. All recommendations were endorsed by at least 80% agreement.

Results

Recognising the importance of mucosal healing (MH), the panel defined steroid-free MH as primary outcome measure for all drugs of new category with one or two postintervention endoscopies per trial (at 8–12 weeks and/or 54weeks). Since endoscopic evaluation is a barrier for recruitment in children, trials with medications already shown to induce MH in children or adults, could use paediatric-specific disease activity scores as primary outcome, including a modified Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index in Crohn's disease and the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index in UC. Secondary outcomes should include safety issues, MR enterography-based damage and inflammatory scores (in Crohn's disease), faecal calprotectin, quality of life scales, and a patient-reported outcome.

Conclusions

It is crucial to perform paediatric trials early in the development of new drugs in order to reduce off-label use of IBD medication in children. The thoughtful choice of feasible and standardised outcome measures can help move us towards this goal.

5.2.8.1 Overuse of corticosteroids

Statement 98. We recommend that prolonged corticosteroid therapy is harmful and should be minimised by specialist intervention and involvement with the multidisciplinary team to explore other treatment options (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Corticosteroids are effective agents at inducing clinical remission, but do not have a role in preventing relapse. Steroid dependency is generally defined as an inability to wean below 10 mg of prednisolone or 3 mg of budesonide within 3 months of starting, or disease flare within 3 months of stopping steroids; steroid refractory disease is active disease despite taking up to 1 mg/kg/day of prednisolone for 4 weeks. Steroid excess is considered to be two or more courses of steroid over 1 year. A recent audit found that 14.9% of IBD patients had steroid dependency or excess in the UK, more commonly in UC than Crohn's disease. Prolonged steroid use (often defined as continuous therapy for more than 3 months) is associated with numerous side effects including increased infection risk, osteoporosis, suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, diabetes, weight gain and cardiovascular disease. There is evidence of increased mortality in IBD patients on long-term steroids, with a study in USA Medicare and Medicaid patients showing that prolonged steroid use (more than 3000 mg prednisolone equivalent in 1 year) carries greater mortality (significant for Crohn's, non-significant for UC) compared with patients starting anti-TNF therapy, with data from the TREAT registry also showing that prednisolone use was an independent risk factor for mortality. In an audit excessive steroid use was avoidable in nearly half of patients, was more likely to be avoided if patients attended a dedicated IBD clinic, and if there was a local multidisciplinary IBD team. Steroid use in the previous year is an important disutility included in the ICHOM dataset, and documenting assessment of alternative therapies and discussion with the patient is important for all patients on long-term steroids.

### A review of the therapeutic management of Crohn's disease [^ec3c9805]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In 1994, a newer glucocorticoid formulation, budesonide, was shown to have equal efficacy to prednisolone, with a 15 times greater affinity for glucocorticoid receptors, such that 5 mg of budesonide is equivalent to 12 mg of prednisolone. Budesonide has an added advantage of a high first pass liver metabolism and rapid elimination, resulting in minimal systemic absorption and thereby reducing the risk of steroid-induced side effects. While budesonide 9 mg once daily has been shown to be superior than placebo in inducing remission for patients with mild to moderate ileocaecal CD (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.52–5.39), budesonide was inferior to prednisolone for the induction of clinical remission in severe ileocaecal CD or in colonic CD (relative risk (RR): 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28–0.95).

Corticosteroids remained the mainstay for induction therapy until the late 1990swhen evidence began showing that they only induce complete clinical remission in 48% and partial clinical remission in 32% of patients with active CD. However, 20% of patients were found to be resistant from the onset, and at 1-year follow-up, 45% of the patients who responded initially became steroid-dependent with only 32% of patients maintaining a prolonged clinical response. It became rapidly apparent that corticosteroids were ineffective at maintaining remission, reducing flares, or disease recurrence.– The French GETAID study provided further proof that corticosteroids were not disease-modifying agents with limited evidence in their ability to achieve endoscopic mucosal healing or preventing endoscopic relapse. In this study, patients were given prednisolone 1 mg/kg for 7 weeks, and only 29% achieved endoscopic and clinical remission, with 71% showing active endoscopic lesions. In fact, 9% of patients had worsening endoscopic lesions despite symptomatic improvement. All of the above limitations associated with prolonged corticosteroid use make a compelling case for using newer safer therapies that maintain remission without exposing patients to unwanted side effects.
