## Question

linear IgA Dermatosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining LABD and its epidemiology. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and antigenic targets. Next, I will review clinical phenotypes in children versus adults and key differentials. After that, I need to confirm the diagnostic criteria and testing strategy. Then, I will examine triggers and associations, including drugs, IBD, and malignancy. Finally, I will appraise treatment options by evidence quality, including first-line, second-line, and biologic strategies, and close with special populations and a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check any claims against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology. LABD is a rare, acquired, autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease characterized by linear IgA deposition at the basement membrane zone, with an incidence around 0.5–2.3 per million per year and two peaks: childhood (often 2–7 years) and adulthood (often > 60 years), with pediatric cases comprising a meaningful fraction of autoimmune bullous disease in children, though frequencies vary by region and cohort [^63aed605] [^15d32622] [^aac88a15].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. The core mechanism is IgA autoantibodies targeting components of the basement membrane zone, most consistently the 120 kDa extracellular domain of BP180 (type XVII collagen), with additional reports of 97 kDa fragments and other antigens; neutrophil recruitment and papillary microabscesses drive subepidermal cleavage and blistering, which explains the histology and the rapid response to agents that inhibit neutrophil function [^8883c489] [^63aed605] [^8e628108].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical features without distinguishing age groups. In children, the classic presentation is the "string of pearls" or "crown of jewels" arrangement of annular or polycyclic plaques with tense vesicles and bullae, often on the lower trunk, buttocks, groin, and extremities, with mucosal involvement in roughly half of cases; in adults, morphology is more variable, with vesiculobullous eruptions that may be annular or non-annular, and mucosal disease is less common but still possible, so I should confirm mucosal status on exam and history [^15d32622] [^fa8a80d6] [^84fb0cce].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria before proposing tests. The triad includes: (1) clinical vesicles or bullae, sometimes mucosal; (2) histopathology showing subepidermal vesicles with neutrophilic infiltrate; and (3) direct immunofluorescence (DIF) demonstrating linear IgA along the basement membrane, ideally with minimal or absent IgG/IgM/C3, which distinguishes LABD from bullous pemphigoid (linear IgG/C3) and dermatitis herpetiformis (granular IgA in papillae). Indirect immunofluorescence can be added to detect circulating IgA anti-BMZ antibodies, and salt-split skin can help localize binding to the lamina lucida versus sublamina densa when needed [^8883c489] [^58f40036] [^9f08cf3c].

> I should double-check triggers and associations because they change management. Drug-induced LABD is well documented, with vancomycin the most frequent culprit, but also beta-lactams, NSAIDs, anticonvulsants, and others; importantly, vancomycin-induced LABD can be severe and even TEN-like, and rechallenge may be unsafe in many cases, though rare successful rechallenges are reported, so I need to ensure meticulous medication reconciliation and avoid re-exposure when risk is high [^60ab749f] [^8391e7b9] [^28b53c78]. IBD, particularly ulcerative colitis, is overrepresented in LABD cohorts, and LABD can precede or follow IBD; malignancy associations, including solid tumors and lymphoproliferative disorders, are reported but remain controversial, so age-appropriate screening is reasonable in adults with persistent or atypical disease [^efe7dd7e] [^5880b721] [^3a226397].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy and confirm dosing and monitoring. Dapsone remains the cornerstone, with pediatric dosing typically 0.5–2 mg/kg/day and adult dosing 50–150 mg/day, titrated to clinical response while monitoring for hemolysis, methemoglobinemia, and agranulocytosis; G6PD testing is mandatory before initiation, and I should remember that dapsone can uncommonly precipitate methemoglobinemia even at therapeutic doses, necessitating prompt recognition and methylene blue when indicated [^27c6ccaa] [^4661053f] [^a4f8733b]. Let me verify alternatives when dapsone is contraindicated: sulfapyridine or sulfasalazine are reasonable substitutes, with pediatric sulfapyridine dosing around 15–60 mg/kg/day and adult dosing 1–1.5 g/day, again with hematologic monitoring; case-based evidence supports efficacy, though data are limited [^27c6ccaa] [^dd275710] [^0f272c9e].

> I will now examine second-line and adjunctive options, and I need to be careful about evidence quality. Systemic corticosteroids are often used as bridging therapy or for flares, but long-term use carries substantial toxicity; tetracycline-class antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline) with or without niacinamide have anti-neutrophil effects and can be considered in milder disease or when standard agents are contraindicated, though evidence is largely anecdotal; IVIG has case-level support in refractory cases, particularly with mucosal involvement or severe flares [^5880b721] [^66172241] [^67996d1b]. Hold on, I should verify the biologic data before overstating it: rituximab has multiple case reports and small series demonstrating benefit in recalcitrant LABD, including pediatric and drug-induced cases, but responses can be delayed and repeated infusions may be needed; omalizumab has intriguing case-level evidence in patients with eosinophilic features or urticarial overlap, and dupilumab has emerging pediatric case reports showing steroid-sparing control, though mechanisms remain speculative and data are very limited [^63aed605] [^39881971] [^efdacf98] [^d11758c9] [^15d32622].

> But wait, what if the patient is a neonate or has G6PD deficiency. In neonatal LABD, I should confirm the diagnosis rapidly with DIF and consider maternal breast milk as a source of pathogenic IgA; management centers on supportive care, wound care, and systemic corticosteroids, with dapsone generally avoided in neonates due to safety concerns, and breastfeeding interruption may be necessary in severe cases with mucosal involvement or respiratory compromise [^c63e7af0] [^249ca24c] [^ad04ac29]. In G6PD deficiency, dapsone is contraindicated, so I should pivot to sulfapyridine/sulfasalazine, consider macrolides such as erythromycin in select cases, or explore biologics like dupilumab in refractory pediatric disease, recognizing the evidence base is sparse and decisions should be individualized [^c98a9057] [^d11758c9] [^15d32622].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency. First, confirm the diagnosis with appropriate biopsy and DIF, screen for G6PD, and perform a meticulous medication review with discontinuation of suspected culprits. Second, initiate dapsone when safe and titrate to response with laboratory monitoring, or use sulfapyridine/sulfasalazine if dapsone is contraindicated. Third, add systemic corticosteroids for rapid control or severe mucosal disease, then taper. Fourth, for refractory disease, consider tetracycline-based regimens, IVIG, or biologics such as rituximab, omalizumab, or dupilumab in selected cases, ideally in coordination with dermatology and, when relevant, gastroenterology or oncology. Finally, address associated conditions such as IBD or malignancy when clinically indicated, and counsel on prognosis, which is generally favorable in children but can be chronic or relapsing in adults [^9f08cf3c] [^5880b721] [^fa8a80d6].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit and evidence-aligned. LABD is defined by linear IgA at the BMZ with neutrophil-rich subepidermal blisters, diagnosed by clinical morphology plus DIF, and managed first-line with dapsone or sulfapyridine/sulfasalazine when dapsone is unsafe; systemic steroids bridge flares, and biologics are reserved for refractory cases; triggers such as vancomycin and IBD should be actively screened, and special populations like neonates and G6PD-deficient patients require tailored, safety-first strategies [^8883c489] [^27c6ccaa] [^60ab749f] [^efe7dd7e] [^c63e7af0].

Linear IgA dermatosis (LAD) is a rare, autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease defined by **linear IgA deposition at the basement membrane zone** [^a60098c0]. It presents with pruritic, tense vesicles and bullae in annular or "string of pearls" patterns, often involving mucosa, and is diagnosed by **direct immunofluorescence showing linear IgA** [^8883c489]. First-line treatment is **dapsone**, with alternatives such as sulfapyridine, corticosteroids, or rituximab for refractory cases [^27c6ccaa] [^63aed605]. Prognosis is generally favorable, but relapses are common and drug-induced cases resolve with withdrawal of the culprit agent [^fa8a80d6] [^aa2ee137].

---

## Clinical presentation

LAD has a bimodal age distribution, with a **childhood peak (2–7 years)** and an **adult peak (> 60 years)** [^fa8a80d6]. Clinical features include:

- **Skin lesions**: Pruritic, tense vesicles and bullae on an erythematous or urticarial base, often in annular or "string of pearls" configurations [^53226afa].
- **Mucosal involvement**: Common in children (up to 64%), less frequent in adults (about 20%) [^15d32622].
- **Distribution**: Extremities, trunk, and perioral/perigenital areas are commonly affected [^15d32622].
- **Drug-induced LAD**: Often severe, with extensive mucosal involvement and rapid onset after drug exposure [^0d5d06ff].

---

## Pathogenesis

LAD is characterized by **IgA autoantibodies** targeting basement membrane zone proteins, most commonly the 120 kDa extracellular domain of BP180 (type XVII collagen) [^8883c489]. Neutrophil recruitment and activation lead to subepidermal blister formation [^8e628108].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis relies on **clinical, histopathological, and immunofluorescence findings**:

| **Diagnostic modality** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Clinical examination | - Tense vesicles/bullae <br/> - Annular or "string of pearls" pattern <br/> - Mucosal involvement [^53226afa] |
| Histopathology | - Subepidermal vesicles <br/> - Neutrophilic infiltrate <br/> - Papillary microabscesses [^8e628108] |
| Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) | Linear IgA deposition along the basement membrane zone (gold standard) [^8883c489] |
| Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) | Circulating IgA anti-basement membrane antibodies (optional) [^notfound] |

---

## Differential diagnosis

LAD must be distinguished from other autoimmune bullous diseases, including:

- **Bullous pemphigoid**: Linear IgG/C3 deposition, eosinophil-rich infiltrate [^58f40036].
- **Dermatitis herpetiformis**: Granular IgA deposits in dermal papillae, association with celiac disease [^58f40036].
- **Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita**: IgA antibodies against type VII collagen [^bdfcf9d1].

---

## Treatment

First-line therapy is **dapsone**, with response typically within days to weeks [^f005f458]. Alternatives include sulfapyridine, systemic corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive agents (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) [^5880b721]. Rituximab is effective for refractory cases [^63aed605]. Drug-induced LAD requires withdrawal of the offending agent [^f005f458].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is generally favorable, especially in children, with **spontaneous remission** occurring in many cases [^fa8a80d6]. Relapses are common, particularly in adults, and long-term maintenance therapy may be necessary [^fa8a80d6]. Drug-induced LAD typically resolves after discontinuation of the culprit medication [^aa2ee137].

---

Linear IgA dermatosis is a rare autoimmune blistering disease with **distinctive clinical and immunopathological features**. Early recognition and appropriate treatment, particularly with dapsone, lead to favorable outcomes, though relapses are common and management may require long-term therapy [^a60098c0].

### Successful treatment of linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis with dupilumab in a pediatric patient [^15d32622]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) bullous dermatosis (LABD) of childhood is a rare, autoimmune, subepidermal blistering disorder, caused by IgA autoantibodies targeting the basement membrane zone. Affecting mostly children around 4.5 years of age, it has a 1.6:1 female/male ratio and an incidence of 0.69–2.3 cases per-million/year. LABD features pruritic, tense bullae in a "string of pearls" or "crown of jewels" pattern, commonly on the genitalia, face, trunk, and extremities, with a 64% mucosal involvement.

Treating LABD is challenging, as no Food and Drug Administration approved treatments exist, and off-label options such as systemic dapsone are not the ideal choice for those at risk of hemolytic anemia.

### Treatment of linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood with flucloxacillin [^3482226a]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood is a rare autoimmune bullous disease that mainly affects preschool-aged children. Dapsone is considered the first-line therapy with prompt response from most patients. However, it may be contraindicated in certain conditions such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

Objective

We sought to assess the efficacy of flucloxacillin in the treatment of linear IgA bullous dermatosis.

Methods

This is an observational study in which all confirmed cases of linear IgA bullous dermatosis (by both histological and immunofluorescence studies) will be treated with flucloxacillin. Flucloxacillin will be continued according to the response or otherwise will be discontinued after 8 weeks in the case of resistance.

Results

We describe 7 patients with linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood treated with flucloxacillin. In 4 cases, it induced complete remission within 3 to 4 months of starting therapy with no relapses. In the other 3 cases, it successfully controlled the disease but with prompt relapse on discontinuation of the treatment.

Limitations

This is a case series study with a small number of patients.

Conclusion

Flucloxacillin may be considered among the first alternative therapies for linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood. Further evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the long-term use is required.

### Linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis [^a60098c0]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) bullous dermatosis, also known as linear IgA disease, is an autoimmune mucocutaneous disorder characterized by subepithelial bullae, with IgA autoantibodies directed against several different antigens in the basement membrane zone. Its immunopathologic characteristic resides in the presence of a continuous linear IgA deposit along the basement membrane zone, which is clearly visible on direct immunofluorescence. This disorder shows different clinical features and distribution when adult-onset of linear IgA disease is compared with childhood-onset. Diagnosis is achieved via clinical, histopathologic, and immunopathologic examinations. Two common therapies are dapsone and sulfapyridine, which reduce the inflammatory response and achieve disease remission in a variable period of time.

### Linear IgA bullous dermatosis successfully treated with omalizumab: a case report [^53226afa]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a rare autoimmune bullous disease characterized by linear deposition of IgA along the cutaneous basement membrane. Clinically, LABD has a variable presentation characterized by tense vesiculobullous lesions on the trunk and extremities that often appear in a herpetiform arrangement or at the center of annular erythematous plaques. Omalizumab (Xolair; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) is a monoclonal anti–immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody that has been approved for chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). To date, omalizumab has not been reported to be of benefit in the treatment of LABD. However, omalizumab has been reported to improve control of other bullous dermatoses, particularly bullous pemphigoid.

### Linear IgA bullous dermatosis treated with rituximab [^63aed605]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a rare autoimmune blistering disease with an incidence of 0.5 cases per million inhabitants per year. Pathogenic IgA autoantibodies mostly bind to a 97-kDa or 120-kDa proteolytic fragment of BP-180 extracellular domain. Most cases of LABD involve children and usually heal with dapsone within a few months. Drug-induced LABD also have a favorable course in most cases after stopping the culprit drug.

However, some idiopathic LABD occurring in adult patients may be recalcitrant to dapsone and require systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs. To the best of our knowledge, only 1 case of severe LABD and 1 case of dermatitis herpetiformis successfully treated with rituximab have been published to date. Despite the fact that dermatitis herpetiformis is a different disease from LABD, both diseases are mediated by IgA deposits. We report 2 patients with severe and recalcitrant LABD successfully treated with rituximab.

Discussion

Linear IgA dermatosis has been reported in association with drugs, malignancy, infections, connective tissue diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with UC being the most commonly reported systemic disorder linked to its development. The pathogenesis of LAD in the setting of IBD remains uncertain but may involve a humoral immune response to antigens crossing inflamed bowel mucosa, leading to the production of cross-reactive IgA autoantibodies against cutaneous antigens. Drug-associated LAD typically presents similarly to the idiopathic form, with analogous lesion morphology and distribution. Most reported cases occur within 1 month of drug initiation and typically dissipate within 3 weeks of drug cessation. Re-exposure to the offending drug often results in recurrence of the blistering eruption, which may be more severe with a shorter latency period and a longer time to clearance. Given the temporal relation between initiating infliximab therapy and the development of the patient's eruption and diagnostic findings, along with the reappearance of lesions immediately after re-exposure, we assert that LAD was a consequence of exposure to infliximab. This case supports the suggestion made by Hoffman et aland Sundlass et althat infliximab may be a new drug implicated in the development of LAD, with the added evidence of rechallenge with the drug precipitating a second LAD eruption. We also documented sustained remission of both LAD and UC in this patient while undergoing treatment with adalimumab, another TNF inhibitor. This finding suggests that infliximab in particular, and not necessarily the TNF inhibitor class in general, has a causal role in LAD pathogenesis. This TNF inhibitor intraclass dissociation is an important finding, as many patients with refractory IBD depend on these biologic agents to treat their disease and often have limited or no alternative options. Furthermore, there are reports of other autoimmune bullous skin diseases occurring in patients undergoing treatment with infliximab, namely, bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus foliaceus. The formation of a secondary autoimmune condition in patients undergoing treatment with TNF inhibitors has been described as a "paradoxical" reaction in which the biologic agent can both treat and induce the disease. The favored hypothesis to explain the development of these paradoxical adverse events involves a disequilibrium in cytokine balance created by TNF inhibition. Interestingly, Yamada et alhas also published a case report of dramatic symptom improvement after infliximab therapy in UC-associated LAD. Whether this shows a direct therapeutic benefit of infliximab on LAD or, alternatively, an indirect effect mediated by a reduction in UC disease severity remains unclear. We present this case to show an unusual reaction to a class of medication that is increasingly used to treat a growing number of autoimmune diseases. The role of TNF inhibitors in the development of autoimmune skin diseases is unquestionably complex and multifactorial. Nevertheless, emerging evidence strongly implicates these biologic agents as occasional causes of immunobullous disease.

### Treatment of linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood with mycophenolate mofetil… [^8883c489]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen of a skin lesion revealed a subepidermal bulla containing neutrophils, supporting the clinical diagnosis of LABD of childhood. Direct immunofluorescence confirmed the diagnosis, revealing linear immunoglobulin deposition, primarily IgA, at the dermoepidermal junction. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood, also known as chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood, is a rare, acquired, self-limited autoimmune subepidermal bullous disease. Skin manifestations include large tense bullae as seen in bullous pemphigoid and/or vesiclular lesions characteristic of dermatitis herpetiformis. The target antigen of the IgA autoantibodies in LABD is a 120-kd secreted portion of the BP180 antigen. 3 However, there have been reports of cases where other antigens are recognized, including antigens with molecular weights of 285, 230, 180, 145, 100, and 97 kd. 4–10.

Diagnosis of LABD requires 3 criteria: 11 a vesicular or bullous eruption, usually confined to the skin and occasionally involving the mucous membranes; a subepidermal vesicle with a predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate on histologic examination; and basement membrane zone–specific IgA antibody deposited in a linear pattern in the absence of other immunoglobulins under direct immunofluorescence examination of perilesional skin. Although these criteria are required to meet the strict definition of LABD, in the research setting there have been several cases of LABD with IgG antibody deposits in a linear fashion at the basement membrane zone in addition to the IgA antibodies. 12 Pathologically, these cases represent an overlap of LABD and bullous pemphigoid. Clinically, however, the patient is usually treated in accordance with which antibody response predominates.

Our patient responded rapidly and quite well to the regimen of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with dapsone, experiencing only 1 episode of mild blistering over the course of 8 months. Prior to this, the patient required on average 1 steroid burst per month for disease control. Under our treatment, her laboratory parameters were consistently stable, and her overall status improved with gains in her energy level and catch-up in development.

### Linear IgA bullous dermatosis successfully treated with omalizumab: a case report [^e0751964]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Because the urticarial lesions of the patient were typical and lasted less than 4 to 5 hours, they were not biopsied. It is, however, not impossible that the urticaria in this patient could actually represent urticarial bullous pemphigoid and that the patient could have progressed from LABD to the overlap condition of LABD and bullous pemphigoid, commonly named linear IgA and IgG bullous dermatosis.

Omalizumab is a monoclonal IgE antibody approved for the treatment of CIU. It is typically administered subcutaneously once a month for a period of 6 months. The role of omalizumab in linear IgA bullous dermatosis is not fully understood, but we hypothesize that IgE immunoglobulins are either directly or indirectly implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease. Omalizumab prevents free circulating IgE from interacting with receptors on mast cells and basophils, thus preventing their activation. These cells produce cytokines such as interleukin 3, interleukin 5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating-factor, which are essential for eosinophil development. In LABD biopsy specimens, neutrophils predominate but have variable amounts of eosinophils. The presence of peripheral blood eosinophilia and significant eosinophils in histology might be a sign of a patient who may respond to omalizumab. Considering its safety profile and tolerability, omalizumab could become a potential therapeutic alternative in refractory cases of LABD.

In our case, both clinical and temporal correlations exist between initiation of omalizumab therapy and remission of LABD lesions. The lack of iatrogenic or systemic etiologies, LABD recurrence after treatment cessation, and resolution with reintroduction of treatment support our hypothesis of a causal association between the LABD clinical improvement and the use of omalizumab. Further studies are needed to corroborate these finding.

### Treatment of subepidermal immunobullous diseases [^0fc1f4a0]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The subepidermal immunobullous diseases are a group of autoimmune blistering disorders of the skin and mucous membranes that share the common features of autoantibody deposition and blister formation at the dermal-epidermal junction or basement membrane. This group includes bullous pemphigoid, linear IgA disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, among others. Although these disorders share some common features, each disease is unique in its clinical presentation, histopathology, and immunofluorescence patterns, which allows for accurate diagnosis and disease-specific treatment strategy. Treatment of these disorders is complex and requires expert knowledge of disease pathogenesis. We review common treatment approaches for each of these disorders.

### Combined dapsone and sulfapyridine for the treatment of therapy-resistant linear IgA bullous dermatosis: two case reports [^27c6ccaa]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

LABD is a rare vesiculobullous skin disease characterized by the linear deposition of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction. LABD often has an abrupt onset, with new blister formation, with an annular appearance resembling rosettes. The gold-standard diagnostic method is skin biopsy including direct immunofluorescence, revealing the linear IgA deposits (Fig 2, E).

The evidence for the current treatment of LABD is limited and based on case reports and case series, and larger controlled trials are lacking. Dapsone is generally well tolerated and is often used as a first-line therapy. The dose range for the treatment of LABD in adults is 50 to 150 mg/day, while the dose range for children has been reported at 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day. Hematologic parameters should be monitored, since hemolysis (especially in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency), methemoglobinemia, and agranulocytosis are potential adverse effects. Sulfonamides have been reported as an effective treatment for LABD. However, the availability of these agents is limited in some countries. The sulfapyridine dose for the treatment of LABD in adults is 1000 to 1500 mg/day, while the dose range for children has been reported at 15 to 60 mg/kg/day. Adverse effects, including agranulocytosis, hemolysis, and elevated liver enzymes, may occur but are generally well tolerated. Recommendations for the treatment of therapy-resistant LABD are lacking, although various options, including intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, omalizumab, and a combination therapy of dapsone and sulfapyridine, have been suggested.

We present 2 cases with histologically verified LABD. In both cases, initial monotherapy with dapsone or sulfapyridine was not sufficient to treat the skin lesions. However, the combination of dapsone and sulfapyridine effectively resulted in full, lasting remission in both patients.

In conclusion, in LABD cases where both dapsone and sulfapyridine monotherapy have been attempted, combination therapy with dapsone and sulfapyridine should be considered.

### Previously misdiagnosed linear IgA dermatosis resolved with dapsone [^87b05956]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

This is the case of a 25-year-old African American woman with a 3-week history of itching with burning, blistering lesions on her torso and extremities. Medical history was unremarkable. Medical treatments included three visits to urgent care, where she was treated with antivirals, oral and topical steroids, antibiotics and antifungals unsuccessfully. We performed a skin biopsy, and immunoflorescent studies revealed a linear deposition of IgA antigen at the basement membrane. The clinical diagnosis of linear IgA dermatosis (LAD) was established, with no eliciting cause, other than potential occupational exposure to Chlamydophila psittaci via her employment in a pet store. This is the first case to our knowledge to report such an association. However, confirmation of the exposure would only establish correlation, not causality. Resolution of symptoms and blisters was achieved with dapsone treatment. Accordingly, we highlight the crucial importance of reviewing exposures, along with the potential aetiology of LAD.

### Combined dapsone and sulfapyridine for the treatment of therapy-resistant linear IgA bullous dermatosis: two case reports [^4e640ff9]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a rare autoimmune vesiculobullous disease causing blistering lesions of the skin and mucosa.LABD typically presents in either early childhood or adulthood.

The pathogenesis is characterized by a linear deposition of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction.LABD can be idiopathic or drug-induced (typically by vancomycin, β-lactam antibiotics, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Children frequently present with widespread annular blisters, with predilection of the lower portion of the abdomen, genital areas, and thighs. In adults, the clinical presentation varies and annular lesions are less common. The reported incidence of LABD varies from < 0.5 to 2.3 cases per 1 million population/year.

Dapsone is often reported the most effective drug of choice and is frequently used as first-line therapy. Other treatment options include sulfonamide drugs, such as sulfapyridine/sulfamethoxypyridazine, corticosteroids, colchicine, and other immunosuppressive agents.,

Herein, we present 2 case reports of patients with LABD successfully treated with a combination of dapsone and sulfapyridine.

### Linear IgA dermatosis of the childhood-report of an amoxicillin-induced case [^02334890]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Linear IgA dermatosis (LAD) is a rare autoimmune disorder in children. A 9-year-old boy was presented with blisters on the intact skin (face, body, arms, hands, soles, perigenital and perianal area) after amoxicillin treatment. Systemic corticosteroids and dapsone treatment for 6weeks was successful. Clinical and immunofluorescence examinations are most important for differentiation of LAD and other drug-induced bullous dermatoses. They enable an early introduction of proper therapy.

### Linear IgA disease: successful treatment with erythromycin [^66172241]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Conventional first-line treatments for linear IgA disease (and the related chronic immunobullous disease of childhood) include topical steroids and dapsone, both of which may be associated with potentially serious side-effects. Alternative anti-inflammatory therapies such as tetracycline and macrolide antibiotics, have been used to treat other immunobullous disorders and we now report an adult case of linear IgA disease and a paediatric case of mixed immunobullous disease of childhood that both responded to the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin. The mode of action is speculative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms are unclear. Nevertheless, from a clinical perspective, erythromycin may have a role in the treatment of linear IgA disease and could be considered ahead of many other, perhaps potentially more toxic, therapies.

### Development of cyclosporine-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis despite concurrent use of dapsone [^f005f458]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a rare subepidermal-blistering disease caused by antibasement membrane IgA antibodies. The exact pathogenesis of LABD remains unknown. In adults, LABD is typically caused by antibiotics, such as vancomycin, penicillins, cephalosporins, and sulfonamides. Antihypertensives, antiepileptics, analgesics, and immunosuppressive medications, such as cyclosporine, have also been implicated. The first step in management is withdrawal of the causative agent. The first-line therapeutic agent is dapsone, and improvement is often seen within days of starting treatment. We present the case of a 27-year-old woman who developed LABD while taking dapsone, the treatment of choice for the disease.

Introduction

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is characterized by linear deposition of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction. It is associated with medications, malignancies, and vaccinations. Here, we present a case of a patient with LABD treated with nemvaleukin alfa, a novel, engineered interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor therapy currently in phase 2 investigation for treatment of advanced melanoma.

### Unusual clinical manifestation of linear IgA dermatosis: a report of two cases [^67996d1b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Linear IgA dermatosis is a rare autoimmune bullous skin disease with subepidermal blister formation and linear IgA deposits along the basement membrane zone. We describe two female patients showing erythematous annular plaques with scaling at the margin, strictly localized to the palms in one patient, and also found on the soles and buttocks in the second patient. Histology showed numerous neutrophils in the dermis with an admixture of eosinophils, some subepidermal clefting, and occasional papillary microabscesses. Direct immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy revealed in vivo IgA deposition along the basement membrane zone. One patient cleared after treatment with dapsone. The second patient did not respond to dapsone alone and various immunosuppressive treatment regimens. Considerable improvement was achieved with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy combined with corticosteroid and dapsone.

### Linear IgA bullous dermatosis preceding a diagnosis of Crohn's disease [^5d0b3364]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite existing treatment algorithms, LABD remains difficult to treat and this patient's disease course presented distinct challenges of managing this disease, particularly given the association with CD. This patient's LABD was recalcitrant even after using multiple steroid-sparing agents and thus required creative approaches to treatment. Dapsone is regarded as the first line of therapy, with 82 percent of patients achieving remission on this drug, and it typically generates favorable therapeutic responses at doses of 100 to 200 mg. All but one reported case of LABD in CD achieved remission of skin lesions with dapsone (Table I). Despite being on supramaximal doses of dapsone, our patient faced recurrent flares of LABD and was unable to tolerate a taper off prednisone.

In this patient, several medications were initiated to treat the CD and LABD in tandem. To date our patient has seen skin clearance on low dose prednisone with excellent control of his CD using azathioprine 50 mg twice daily for 8 months and vedolizumab infusions. Ultimately, the care team continues to optimize this patient's azathioprine dosing with a goal of sustaining his remission and reducing his steroid dependence.

### Neonatal linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis: a critical case recovering after prompt recognition, intensive management, and breastfeeding interruption – A case report [^c63e7af0]. Neonatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) bullous dermatosis (NLABD) is a rare, life-threatening, mucocutaneous bullous disorder. The pathogenesis and optimal treatment remain poorly defined and raise critical clinical challenges.

Case Presentation

We present a case of a full-term female infant with severe cutaneous and respiratory symptoms due to NLABD. Diagnosis was confirmed by immunofluorescence on the infant's skin biopsy, while IgAs directed against the basement membrane of the skin and mucosa were identified in the mother's milk. The infant fully recovered after nearly 8 weeks of intensive multidisciplinary care, including non-invasive ventilation, nutritional support, wound care, systemic corticoid treatment, and breastfeeding discontinuation.

Conclusion

This case underscores the importance of timely adequate diagnosis and management of this rare and serious condition. Moreover, it adds novel evidence documenting the presence of pathogenic IgAs in breastmilk.

### Management of linear IgA disease [^fa8a80d6]. Dermatologic Clinics (2011). Low credibility.

Linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) disease is an acquired autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes that runs a chronic course over 3 to 6 years before remitting. It typically presents with papulovesicles and blisters configured in an arcuate pattern on an urticated base, with 2 peaks of onset. The first peak is in young prepubescent children, called chronic bullous disease of childhood, and the second peak affects patients older than 60 years of age. In this article, the management of linear IgA in adults is considered.

Case 2

A 55-year-old man presented to our clinic with a highly itchy rash located on the abdomen, neck, back, and extremities (Fig 2, A and B). The lesions were annular, with a characteristic rosette-like pattern. The patient reported earlier bullae formations. The patient's comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Regular medications were thoroughly reviewed, and no new medication had been initiated within the 6 months prior to the disease presentation.

E, Histopathology of skin lesion (right thigh) with immunofluorescence confirming the linear deposition of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction (fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-IgA stain; original magnification: ×200).

Histopathologic investigations revealed bullae formation and infiltration by neutrophils, and immunofluorescence revealed linear IgA deposits at the dermoepidermal junction compatible with LABD (Fig 2, E).

Treatment with dapsone (50 mg/day) was started, in combination with topical steroids and potassium permanganate baths. Initially, the patient experienced a partial response. However, after 1 month, progression occurred, and the dapsone dose was increased to 100 mg/day. After 3 months, the patient developed several new bullae, and the dapsone dose was further increased (150 mg/day), together with a prednisone course (40 mg/day for 2 weeks and then tapered off).

In the following 2.5 years, the disease control was maintained by dapsone treatment and a few courses of prednisone. However, the patient then experienced moderate-to-severe progression, especially involving the hands (Fig 2, C) and buttocks, and the treatment regimen was changed from dapsone to sulfapyridine (1000 mg/day, increasing to 1500 mg/day). After a couple of weeks, the patient experienced severe progression, and dapsone (150 mg/day) was reintroduced. On this treatment combination, the patient quickly recovered (Fig 2, D), and the skin lesions completely cleared, with only postinflammatory hyperpigmentation remaining. To date, no relapse has occurred on the treatment combination.

Linear IgA disease is one of the rarer subepidermal blistering diseases. Linear IgA disease is a chronic, acquired, autoimmune blistering disease that is characterized by subepidermal blistering and linear deposition of IgA basement membrane antibodies. The disease affects both children and adults and, although there are some differences in their clinical presentations, there is considerable overlap with shared immunopathology and immunogenetics.

### Blistering disorders: diagnosis and treatment [^c6e4e0f8]. Dermatologic Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Blistering diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that can affect either skin and mucous membrane, or both, varying in presentation, clinical course, pathohistology, immunopathology and treatment. Not infrequently the diagnosis is delayed. This can result in severe, and sometimes fatal consequences. Although these diseases are rare, it is very important to make an accurate diagnosis based on a combination of clinical profile and laboratory observations. A brief review is presented of the following bullous diseases: pemphigus, paraneoplastic pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, cicatricial pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA bullous disease, porphyria cutanea tarda, and subcorneal pustular dermatitis. Their clinical, pathohistologic and immunopathologic features and recommendations for therapy are discussed.

### Evaluation and comparison of clinical and iLaboratory characteristics of patients with IgA epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, and IgG epidermolysis bullosa acquisita [^bdfcf9d1]. JAMA Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is an autoimmune skin blistering disease with IgA autoantibodies directed against type VII collagen. There is debate whether it should be considered part of the clinical spectrum of linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) or a separate disease entity.

Objective

This cohort study aimed to define the clinical features and treatment responses of IgA EBA and anti-BP180-driven LABD, and to compare the prevalences of IgA EBA anti-BP180 LABD and classic IgG-mediated EBA in an autoimmune diagnostic laboratory database.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study and case series study included demographic, immunopathologic, and serologic data from 300 patients diagnosed with IgA EBA, IgG EBA, or LABD. Furthermore, clinical features and treatment responses of IgA EBA were analyzed in a case series including 4 patients with IgA EBA. All patients from the database of the autoimmune diagnostic laboratory at the Department of Dermatology, University of Lübeck, Germany, who were diagnosed with IgA EBA, LABD, or IgG EBA between October 2010 and July 2019 were included. Four patients diagnosed with IgA EBA between October 2015 and January 2018 are described in detail.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The clinical course of IgA EBA was observed before and during different treatments.

Results

The database search yielded 21 cases of IgA EBA (12 females [57%]/9 males [43%]), 222 cases of LABD (111 females [51%]/106 males [49]), and 57 cases of IgG EBA (29 females [50%]/28 males [48%]). The median (range) age of each cohort was 64 (4–81) years for IgA EBA, 56 (3–92) years for IgG EBA, and significantly older compared with IgG EBA (P = 0.002) for those with LAPD (median [range], 70 [1–94] years). The patients with IgA EBA exhibited heterogeneous clinical presentations that significantly differed from those of anti-BP180 LABD. All 4 patients with IgA EBA described in detail were first treated with dapsone, but only 1 responded to this treatment. The others required treatment with high-dose dexamethasone, rituximab, and/or intravenous immunoglobulins to achieve partial clinical remission.

Conclusions and Relevance

Overall, the findings of this cohort study and small case series suggest that IgA EBA may be more common than expected and may require more intensive systemic treatment than LABD, suggesting it should be considered a separate disease entity.

### Combined dapsone and sulfapyridine for the treatment of therapy-resistant linear IgA bullous dermatosis: two case reports [^702b6531]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case series

Case 1

A 2-year-old, otherwise healthy girl presented with vesiculobullous lesions on the extremities, neck, abdomen (Fig 1, A) and, especially, the vulva and buttocks. Complaints of itching and sleep deprivation were reported. The lesions were on an erythematous base and with a rosette-like pattern. Before onset, the patient had diaper dermatitis, treated with oral amoxicillin. Microbiologic test results were negative for herpes and bacteria. Histopathology (including immunofluorescence) confirmed the diagnosis of LABD, revealing a linear IgA deposit at the epidermal basal membrane zone as well as a dermal infiltration of neutrophils.

Fig 1
A, Vesiculobullous lesions at the back at presentation. B, Disease progression during monotherapy with dapsone. C, Remission of skin lesions achieved with combined therapy of dapsone and sulfapyridine.

Treatment with 10 mg/day of oral dapsone was initiated (1 mg/kg/day), and the patient initially responded well. However, after a few weeks of treatment, the disease progressed, with the development of new vesiculobullous lesions in the same regions (Fig 1, B). The lesions were painful and pruritic. The treatment was supplemented with 10 mg/day of prednisone as well as a topical steroid treatment and potassium permanganate baths. During the following 6 months, the dapsone dose was slowly increased to 20 mg/day, with varying prednisone dosing, but the disease was never fully controlled by this regimen.

Sulfapyridine (250 mg/day; 23 mg/kg/day) in combination with prednisone was then attempted and later increased to 500 mg/day (44 mg/kg/day). This treatment regimen led to temporary prednisone-related growth suppression and excessive hair growth, and the patient again developed several new bullae. Eventually, a combination of dapsone (10 mg/day) and sulfapyridine (500 mg/day) was initiated. After a few weeks, the patient responded significantly to the treatment combination (Fig 1, C). Over the next 6 weeks, the prednisone was tapered off, and no new vesicles or bullae occurred after the introduction of the combination therapy.

### Blistering diseases in the mature patient [^25e3c959]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Autoimmune blistering diseases (AIBD) are a group of chronic diseases affecting the skin and mucous membranes, with different presentation, clinical course, histologic and immunopathologic findings, and different therapeutic approach. Blisters develop as a result of autoantibodies directed against distinct adhesion structures within desmosomes or within the basement membrane zone. The most common AIBD that develops in the elderly is bullous pemphigoid (previously also named "pemphigoid senilis"), but mature patients can also present with other AIBD as mucous membrane pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, paraneoplastic pemphigus, pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, linear IgA dermatosis, and dermatitis herpetiformis. There are no differences in treatment approach to mature patients with AIBD, but due to more common comorbidities, systemic therapy should be given with more caution and control, and due to distorted skin integrity in the aged skin, the safety concerns are increased with the long-term use of any topical medication.

### Immunologic overlap in a case of linear IgG / IgA bullous dermatosis responsive to rituximab [^4661053f]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment starts with a review of medications to identify and discontinue drugs potentially inducing the disease. Age-appropriate screening for malignancy may be appropriate. Systemic and topical corticosteroids are first-line treatment; however, significant side effects are common. Dapsone treatment is an effective option in LAGBD, limiting systemic immunosuppression. Dapsone inhibits neutrophil adhesion and release of tissue-damaging oxidants and proteases. Side effects include hemolytic anemia, methemoglobinemia, neutropenia, neuropathy, and hepatitis. It is contraindicated for patients with anemia (as in our case), liver disease, or low glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme levels.

Steroid-sparing adjunctive therapies include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, intravenous immunoglobulin, and targeted therapies such as rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. Rituximab is Food and Drug Administration-approved for the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris. Case reports describe rituximab use for both BP and LABD with higher efficacy observed in IgG-dominant disease. In BP, rituximab has a reported complete response rate of 85%, a recurrence rate of 29%, and an adverse effects rate of 24%. Side effects include infections, anemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, drug fever, acute pruritus, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, and tachycardia. Rituximab is an important treatment option for patients with multiple medical co-morbidities and severe disease as presented in this case report.

The case presented here highlights the importance of distinguishing between BP, LABD, and LAGBD (Table I). The young age of the patient, mucosal involvement, and bullae in an annular configuration were not typical for classic BP. Only by further evaluation with indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were IgA antibodies identified. The LAGBD diagnosis allows treatment with dapsone (not readily used for BP) or rituximab in severe cases. Due to distinct clinical features, immunologic findings, and treatment modalities, it is important for LAGBD to be recognized as a subtype of subepidermal blistering disease.

### Topical imiquimod-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis [^9361cc55]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 68-year-old woman was referred to the unit of dermatology for a large basal cell carcinoma on the chin. She was treated with imiquimod cream 5%, and 4 weeks after she developed isolated and grouped tense serum-filled vesicles and bullae on lips, nose, scalp, ankles and lumbar area, and then expanded to the whole body. Histological examination was consistent with a subepidermal bullous dermatosis. Moreover, direct immunofluorescence showed linear deposition of IgA at the basement membrane zone supporting the diagnosis of linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD). Dapsone 50mg/day was administered, and the lesions gradually improved within some weeks, and no new lesions appeared. The temporal relationship between the application of the drug and the development of the disease indicates a role of this topical agent in triggering LABD.

Fig 3

Although the patient responded appropriately to dapsone for the first 3 years of treatment, the response eventually became suboptimal despite dose optimization (300 mg daily). The patient experienced multiple adverse effects secondary to the high-dose dapsone therapy. Complications included methemoglobinemia, which resulted in functional anemia and subsequent shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient was then treated with a 2-year course of sulfapyridine (up to 6 g daily divided into 3 doses), during which time she showed little improvement. She did not respond to a subsequent trial of gluten-free diet. Cutaneous biopsy specimens with direct immunofluorescence repeated 6 years after the initial diagnosis remained consistent with the diagnosis of LABD. However, the second biopsy specimen contained fewer eosinophils than the first one. Direct immunofluorescence again showed linear IgA deposition along the basement membrane (IgG, IgM, C3, and fibrinogen were again negative).

Dapsone at a lower dosage (150 mg daily) was reinitiated along with tetracycline (at a dosage of 500 mg twice daily) to optimize management of the disease while minimizing adverse effects. The patient showed mild improvement of skin lesions with this combination therapy. Throughout the course of the disease, she was also treated with a strong topical corticosteroid as needed (clobetasol propionate 0.05%).

Ten years after the initial diagnosis of LABD, the patient developed chronic spontaneous urticaria that became incapacitating despite up to 4 times the standard dose of second-generation antihistamines (cetirizine 20 mg twice daily). The patient presented mild peripheral blood eosinophilia throughout her 10-year LABD history, which did not worsen with the CIU diagnosis (Table I). She was started on omalizumab 300 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks.

Table I
Patient's peripheral eosinophil count throughout the course of the disease

Within 3 weeks of starting treatment with omalizumab, the patient had complete resolution of both her chronic urticaria and her LABD. Dapsone and tetracycline were tapered over the course of the following 3 months, and the patient did not present any signs of relapse during the 6-month treatment with omalizumab. However, LABD lesions recurred within a month of omalizumab cessation and completely disappeared when omalizumab was reintroduced 2 months later.

### Letter in reply: linear IgA bullous dermatosis treated with dupilumab in a pediatric patient with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [^eab9c95a]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig 1
Before dupilumab therapy, the patient had (A) vesicles and eroded papules on the bilateral cheeks and (B) bullae in a "crown of jewels" distribution on the legs. After 6 months of therapy with dupilumab, there was clearing of lesions on (C) the cheeks and (D) lower extremities, with residual postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.

Fig 2
A, Hematoxylin-eosin–stained biopsy of the lower portion of the leg demonstrated epidermal degenerative changes with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils and eosinophils. B, Direct immunofluorescence revealed linear, homogenous IgA deposition along the dermoepidermal junction.

LABD is a rare bullous dermatosis with an estimated incidence of 0.2 to 2.3 cases per million annually. Dapsone is the first-line treatment and may be used in conjunction with oral corticosteroids. However, dapsone may induce hemolytic anemia and is thus avoided in patients with risk factors, including G6PD deficiency. In the case presented by Almuhanna et al, the patient had anemia, which precluded the use of dapsone. Similarly, our patient had a low G6PD level, which put him at a high risk of hemolytic anemia. In both cases, dupilumab was started in conjunction with a systemic corticosteroid taper. Corticosteroids were tapered off, and dupilumab monotherapy resulted in excellent disease control. Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds interleukin 4 receptor alpha, leading to the inhibition of interleukins 4 and 13. The mechanism by which dupilumab works in the treatment of LABD is unknown, but it may be due to the downregulation of the type 2 helper T-cell pathway and associated inflammatory cytokines. Further study is warranted to fully understand the role of dupilumab in the treatment of LABD, but it shows promise as an appropriate treatment option in patients for whom dapsone may not be tolerated.

### A case of linear IgA bullous dermatosis in a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient child successfully treated with oral erythromycin and topical tacrolimus [^c98a9057]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune blistering diseases (AIBDs) are a group of rare disorders affecting either the skin or mucous membrane or both that rarely affect the pediatric age group. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is the most common among the AIBDs in children which gives rise to the development of subepidermal bullae due to the linear IgA deposition over the basement membrane zone. Clinically, it presents as tense blisters arranged in a polycyclic or annular pattern traditionally referred to as "clusters of jewels" or "string of pearls".

Despite the good prognosis of this condition, treatment is often instituted to shorten the disease duration by controlling and reducing the severity of the blister formation. Conventional first-line treatments for LABD include dapsone or sulfapyridine; however, these may pose potentially serious side effects, and thus, require regular blood-test monitoring.

We report a case of a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase–deficient 11-year-old child diagnosed with LABD wherein dapsone was contraindicated. The patient was treated with oral erythromycin, which provided marked improvement and complete disease remission.

Case report

We report a case of a 55-year-old woman with no pertinent past medical history who received a diagnosis of chronic LABD more 10 years earlier. She had initially presented with pruritic vesiculobullous lesions, classically described as "cluster of jewels" and "string of pearls", located mainly on the trunk, neck, and arms (Fig 1). She did not have any systemic symptoms, mucosal involvement, or lymphadenopathy on examination. Her medications included progesterone, estradiol, vitamin D, escitalopram, diphenhydramine, and cetirizine, as needed.

Laboratory testing showed mild leukocytosis with eosinophilia. Liver function test results, renal function, thyroid hormones, and antinuclear antibodies were all within normal ranges.

Cutaneous biopsies were performed for both histopathology and direct immunofluorescence. Histology showed subepidermal bullae, epidermal acanthosis and papillomatosis, perivascular inflammation with predominant neutrophils, and occasional eosinophils in the superficial dermis (Fig 2). Direct immunofluorescence showed linear IgA deposition along the basement membrane (Fig 3), which was consistent with the diagnosis of LABD.

### Linear IgA dermatosis after infliximab infusion for ulcerative colitis [^8e628108]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Linear IgA dermatosis (LAD) is an idiopathic or drug-induced autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease characterized by linear deposition of IgA antibodies along the dermoepidermal junction. The pathogenesis, although incompletely understood, involves the formation of dermal papillary microabscesses that lead to subepidermal clefts and blistering. The tissue injury likely results in part from the release of proteolytic enzymes by neutrophils composing the abscess.LAD can occur in both children and adults, with lesions classically described as round or oval vesicles or bullae on normal, erythematous, or urticarial skin. Definitive diagnosis requires the use of direct immunofluorescence to show the distinctive band of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction. In most cases of LAD, the inciting factor is unknown, although several reports implicate various medications in the development of the disease. Vancomycin is the most frequently reported medication in drug-induced LAD, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, penicillins, cephalosporins, and captopril also commonly cited. Herein, we present an uncommon case of LAD after the administration of the anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibody, infliximab.

### Neonatal linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis: a critical case recovering after prompt recognition, intensive management, and breastfeeding interruption – A case report [^249ca24c]. Neonatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Therefore, a prompt skin biopsy is crucial to reveal typical subepidermal blistering and dermal inflammation. Direct immunofluorescence allows identification of pathogenic IgAs deposited along the dermo-epidermal junction, as well as immunoreactants such as C3.

There is currently no consensus on optimal management of NALBD. However, discontinuation of breastfeeding is recommended, despite acknowledged benefits of breastmilk. Dapsone is classically proposed in first-line treatment for LABD. However, in the neonatal period, hydrocortisone needs to be considered to avoid dapsone's potential concerning side effects.

Treatment duration should be adapted based on clinical response, with progressive tapering. Besides appropriate respiratory support, feeding requires special attention, additionally to local wound care. Most cases reported in the literature had severe respiratory and gastrointestinal tract sequelae, which fortunately could be avoided in this patient.

### Immunologic overlap in a case of linear IgG / IgA bullous dermatosis responsive to rituximab [^b31c8b98]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune subepidermal blistering diseases are caused by immunological loss of tolerance to components of hemidesmosomes, triggering humoral and cellular responses.C3 and IgG deposition along the basement membrane zone is characteristic of bullous pemphigoid (BP). Alternately, IgA deposition at the basement membrane zone is consistent with linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD). An immunological overlap spanning the clinical and immunologic spectrum between BP and LABD has been reported and referred to as linear IgA/IgG bullous dermatosis (LAGBD). LAGBD has a unique clinical presentation, immunologic properties, and distinct therapeutic options, including rituximab.

### Linear IgA bullous dermatosis induced by interferon-alpha 2a [^deb61218]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Linear Ig A bullous dermatosis (LABD) is an acquired autoimmune subepidermal blistering disorder with linear deposits of IgA along the basement membrane zone. Its cause is unclear, although it appears to have an immune-mediated basis. Idiopathic, systemic disorder-related, and rarely drug-induced forms of LABD have been described. We describe a case of LABD associated with interferon-alpha 2A used for the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma.

### Successful treatment of a case of idiopathic linear IgA bullous dermatosis with oral sulfasalazine [^dd275710]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a rare acquired autoimmune chronic vesiculobullous dermatosis affecting primarily young children and older adults. We report a 17-year-old Chinese boy with a 2-month history of intense itching erythema or tense vesicles on healthy skin or on an erythematous base, with parts of lesions arising a characteristic "cluster of jewels" pattern. With the characteristics of vesicles or blisters on the skin, subepidermal blisters with neutrophilic infiltrate on histology, and linear IgA deposits on the basement membrane zone and absence of other immunoglobulins on direct immunofluorescence, LABD was dignosized. Sulfapyridine has also been reported as one of the best options of systemic therapy for LABD. Our patient successfully treated with only oral sulfasalazine (alternative medicine of sulfasalazine), which is safe and effective.

### Linear IgA bullous dermatosis preceding the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis: a case report [^5c263fa5]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder seen in the pediatric and adult populations that is often linked to a medication, infection, or underlying gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, or autoimmune disease. In this study, we describe the case of a 23-year-old white man whose presentation and diagnosis of LABD ultimately led to the discovery of underlying primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and ulcerative colitis (UC). His dermatitis resolved with topical steroids and dapsone, and he is undergoing systemic treatment for his UC and PSC. This exceptional case further validates the association between LABD with UC, strengthens that with PSC, and underscores the importance of alerting clinicians to consider conducting a systemic workup in addition to thorough medication history on making the diagnosis of LABD.

### Linear immunoglobulin A dermatosis mimicking toxic epidermal necrolysis: a case report of etanercept treatment [^067f3b78]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

A 65-year-old pluripathological woman attended our hospital with a cutaneous eruption of sudden appearance after vancomycin treatment. She presented targetoid lesions affecting approximately 25–30% of her body surface, large erosions with mucosal lesions and positive Nikolsky sign. Under the initial clinical suspicion of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and considering the recent literature of successful use of etanercept in these cases, she was treated with a single dose of this antitumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agent. Subsequently, the exanthema progression stopped and resolution of the lesions happened in a few days. Later on, histopathology revealed a subepidermal blister with dense neutrophilic infiltrate and linear deposits of immunoglobulin A (IgA) on the dermoepidermal junction, allowing us to establish the diagnosis of drug-induced linear IgA dermatosis mimicking TEN. Linear IgA dermatosis can have severe clinical manifestations, even mimicking TEN, and can have high mortality, especially in drug-induced cases. We have not found any other report of linear IgA dermatosis treated with etanercept in the English literature. Anti-TNF medications could represent useful therapeutic alternatives in this dermatosis.

### A morbilliform variant of vancomycin-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis… [^3cc0793c]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Direct immunofluorescence revealed IgA deposited in a linear pattern at the dermoepidermal junction. In both patients, the results of indirect immunofluorescence using both IgG and IgA were negative. Conclusions. These cases highlight the existence of a new form of linear IgA bullous dermatosis presenting as a morbilliform drug eruption. Both patients were following extensive medication regimens, including use of multiple antibiotics. The diagnosis of linear IgA bullous dermatosis allowed us to target vancomycin as the likely allergen and begin treatment. In light of these findings, direct immunofluorescence may be a useful diagnostic adjunct in determining the cause of drug eruptions. is generally confirmed by finding linear deposition of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction on direct immunofluorescence. 1 Weak deposition of C3 and IgG at the DEJ has been observed less frequently. 1 Histopathologic findings are frequently characterized by subepidermal.

Biopsy specimens from the right side of the abdomen and the right thigh revealed lichenoid interface dermatitis. Direct immunofluorescence revealed continuous strong linear deposition of IgA along the DEJ. The results of indirect immunofluorescence were negative for IgG or IgA at the DEJ, and the results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing for antibodies against bullous pemphigoid antigens 1 and 2 were negative. A biopsy specimen obtained from involved skin of the left side of her back revealed vacuolar interface dermatitis and mixed dermal inflammation with occasional eosinophils. Direct immunofluorescence revealed continuous strong linear IgA deposition along the DEJ without evidence of deposition of other immunoglobulins.

The results of indirect immunofluorescence were negative for IgG or IgA at the DEJ, and the results of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies against bullous pemphigoid antigens 1 and 2 were negative. The condition of patient 2 improved with only topical corticosteroids, whereas patient 1 was treated with systemic immunosuppressive agents after vancomycin therapy was withdrawn. Both patients also had strong linear IgA deposition at the DEJ on direct immunofluorescence.

### Successful treatment of linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis with dupilumab in a pediatric patient [^dc9014fa]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 7-year-old boy was referred as a case of refractory atopic dermatitis not responding to topical treatments. He had no relevant medical history, and no family history of consanguinity, atopy, bullous dermatoses, or genetic syndromes.

Examination revealed scattered, excoriated, erythematous plaques with overlying hemorrhagic crust involving the scalp, trunk, extremities, and perioral areas with a body surface area of > 10% (Fig 1, A). Tense bullae were also noted on the extremities. There was no mucosal involvement. He had a parent-proxy Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score of 10.

Fig 1
Before dupilumab (A): Scattered hemorrhagic crusted and erosive plaques on the bilateral lower extremities. After dupilumab (B): Scattered hypopigmented and hyperpigmented macules and patches on the bilateral lower extremities. No bullae were noted.

Biopsy revealed a subepidermal split with focal spongiosis and a superficial dermal perivascular infiltrate, and interstitial mixed infiltrate of eosinophils and neutrophils (Fig 2). Direct immunofluorescence showed a linear IgA and C3 deposition along the basement membrane and was negative for immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, and fibrin. Thus, confirming the diagnosis of LABD.

### Linear IgA bullous dermatosis preceding a diagnosis of Crohn's disease [^87c0ede6]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a rare, autoimmune blistering skin disorder that involves the deposition of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction. This disease presents with widespread tense vesicles and bullae, clustered into rosettes. LABD can occur spontaneously or following drug exposure, and it can be seen in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly ulcerative colitis. We report an interesting case of extensive LABD in a healthy patient who subsequently developed Crohn's disease (CD), and whose skin disease cleared on prednisone and azathioprine.

### Childhood linear IgA bullous dermatosis in Tunisia [^d2bf426e]. Pediatric Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine the demographic characteristics, the clinical features, the immuno-histological findings and response to treatment of childhood linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) in Tunisia. We collected all the cases of auto-immune bullous diseases of childhood, diagnosed from January 1987 to December 2006. Based on clinical, histological, and immunofluorescent features, we identified 25 cases of LABD. Sixteen male and nine female children with a mean age of 7.5 years were identified. Clinical manifestations were characterized by a vesiculo-bullous eruption in all cases associated with mucous membrane involvement in two cases. Dapsone was the main therapy in 19 cases, associated with systemic corticosteroids in eight cases. Exclusive antibiotic therapy was successful in five cases. Sixteen of those patients had resolution of disease after a mean period of 15 months and eight patients had severe clinical presentation and required a prolonged follow-up. Childhood LABD is the most frequent bullous dermatosis in Tunisia. The majority of our patients responded rapidly to dapsone treatment and were stabilized for long time. Our cases were characterized by a minimal mucosal involvement and favorable outcome. Treatment with antibiotherapy was interesting. Erythromycin and oxacillin may be considered as an alternative therapy.

### A successful challenge in a patient with vancomycin-induced linear IgA dermatosis [^28b53c78]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD), a subepidermal, blistering skin disease, is generally believed to be idiopathic. It has been reported in association with multiple medications, including vancomycin. In each case, complete clearance of the skin lesions occurred with discontinued use of the drug. A subsequent rechallenge reproduced the eruption within hours to days.

Objective

To present a patient with vancomycin-associated LABD who underwent a successful challenge with the antibiotic 4 years after the initial reaction.

Methods

The patient developed blistering lesions over her trunk and extremities 10 days after the initiation of vancomycin for sepsis. A biopsy specimen of a skin eruption was consistent with linear IgA dermatosis. Following discontinued use of the drug, her skin lesions resolved. Four years later, she required vancomycin for osteomyelitis.

Results

The patient underwent a vancomycin-graded challenge of 5 doses over 5 days. On day 1, she received 10 mg, and this was increased in a semilog fashion to 1,000 mg on day 5. She had no recurrence of her skin lesions.

Conclusions

This is the first case, to our knowledge, to show a successful rechallenge in a patient with drug-associated LABD. Since the patient did not have a reaction to the challenge, it is possible that the IgA antibodies responsible for drug-induced LABD are only present transiently and diminish over time.

5.3 Immune checkpoint inhibitors

Immunotherapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that target programmed cell death 1 (PD‐1), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‐L1), and cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte‐associated protein 4 (CTLA‐4) have emerged as highly effective treatments for an increasing number of malignancies. Because the PD‐1 and CTLA‐4 pathways play important roles in regulating immune responses, their blockade leads to both generalized and organ‐specific inflammation called immune‐related adverse events (irAEs). The skin is a major target of irAE, presenting with nonspecific itchy maculopapular rashes, lichenoid reactions, psoriasis, acneiform rashes, vitiligo‐like lesions, autoimmune skin diseases (e.g. dermatomyositis, alopecia areata), sarcoidosis, or nail and oral mucosal changes.BP is a well‐known skin irAEs whose frequency is reported to range from 0.3% to 0.8% among patients under ICI treatment, which far exceeds the incidence of BP in the general population (0.0012%–0.0076%). Siegel et al.reported seven cases of BP associated with ICI therapy (ICI‐BP) as well as a case of bullous lichenoid dermatitis and a case of linear IgA bullous dermatosis, and they showed that the time from therapy initiation to rash was variable, with a mean latency of 6.25 months and a range of 2 weeks to 20 months. All nine patients had either an initial positive tumor response or stable disease, although six eventually developed disease progression. In all cases, ICIs were discontinued or interrupted. Eight of the nine patients required systemic steroids for the treatment of rash. Apalla et al. summarized 13 cases of ICI‐BP and showed that ICI was unaltered in seven, temporarily interrupted in two, and permanently discontinued in four, and seven patients who continued ICI remained free of BP with an average prednisolone dose of 2.5–5 mg/day. The authors proposed that grade‐1 or grade‐2 eruptions can be managed with low doses (0.3–0.5 mg/kg/day) of prednisolone and potent topical steroids, without impeding the administration of ICI. In more severe cases, treatment starts with a low dose of prednisolone without altering the ICI, and if there is no response, BP can be controlled by increasing the prednisolone to 0.7 mg/kg/day while withholding one or tw doses of the ICI. Juzot et al.reported 85 ICI‐BP cases. In those cases, the first‐line therapy for BP was topical steroids (the whole‐body application of topical clobetasol) in 84% (n = 71), systemic corticosteroids in 5%, topical and systemic corticosteroids in 8%, and topical steroids and doxycycline in 2%. The ICI was permanently discontinued for 40 patients. Seventy‐one patients were treated with topical steroids as monotherapy, and 31 patients discontinued the ICI while 39 continued it. Of note, among those who discontinued the ICI, 17 (55%) had their BP controlled, whereas among those who continued the ICI, 29 (74%) had their BP controlled. These results show that high‐potency topical steroids may be sufficient to control BP even with continuing ICIs in some cases.

### IgA pemphigus as an immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated skin manifestation [^2a367d9c]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here, we report a rare case of IgA pemphigus following pembrolizumab treatment. While most cutaneous irAEs associated with antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 checkpoint inhibitors are classified as low-grade, bullous eruptions tend to lead to a higher patient symptom burden and possible discontinuation of therapy. While bullous pemphigoid is the most common type of immunobullous dermatosis, other types such as lichen planus pemphigoid, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis are scarcely reported.

IgA pemphigus is a rare autoimmune bullous disorder characterized by painful and pruritic pustular or vesiculobullous skin eruptions that result from epidermal IgA deposition. Circulating IgA antibodies attack (non)desmosomal keratinocyte cell surface components responsible for cell-to-cell adherence and induce an inflammatory reaction, resulting in neutrophilic infiltration and accumulation in the epidermis with subsequent blistering and pustule formation. IgA pemphigus is usually divided into 2 distinct subtypes: subcorneal pustular dermatosis type with IgA limited to the upper dermis (targeting desmosomal protein desmocollin-1) and intraepidermal neutrophilic dermatosis type with widespread distribution of IgA throughout the epidermis (usually targeting desmoglein-1 or desmoglein-3). The clinical presentation may overlap between the 2 subtypes, generally showing flaccid vesicles and pustules that rupture to form annular or circinate confluent erythematous plaques with crusts and are predominantly distributed on the trunk, extremities, and intertriginous areas. Mucosal or palmoplantar involvement is rarely observed. Generalized pruritus is reported in most cases (> 60%), while systemic symptoms, such as fever, vomiting, or malaise, are typically absent.

### Successful treatment of amoxicillin-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood with rituximab: a case report and review of the literature [^43063b80]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite several days of IV corticosteroids 1–2 mg/kg/day, she continued to form new blisters (Fig 1, D - F). She was then started on dapsone 0.5 mg/kg/day after confirming normal G6PD levels, while continuing IV corticosteroids. However, additional blisters erupted including labial involvement. A decision was made to treat with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg and 3 days of pulsed IV corticosteroids 10–30 mg/kg/day. Concurrently, dapsone was uptitrated to 1 mg/kg/day. While this halted blister progression for a few days, she flared soon after decreasing the IV corticosteroid dose to 1–2 mg/kg/day. Given the refractory and progressive nature of her disease, rituximab therapy was started based on a positive treatment response to anti-CD20 therapy in treating both adult and pediatric LABD. She received one dose of rituximab 375 mg/m², 3 days of pulsed IV corticosteroids 10 mg/kg/day, and continued dapsone. Immediately following first administration of rituximab, blister progression halted and existing blisters improved (Fig 3, A - C). She remained admitted for another week without new blister formation and discharged on oral steroids and dapsone. She developed 3–4 tiny new vesicles 10 days after the first dose of rituximab. A second dose was administered 2 weeks after the first, as per dosing protocol. Over the next month, she developed 1–2 tiny vesicles per week, which were controlled with topical steroids. Prednisone was carefully tapered off with the assistance of endocrinology and dapsone was continued. During the subsequent 8 months, she experienced 1–2 tiny new vesicles every few weeks, also controlled with topical steroids. Considering her previous significant flares despite high doses of dapsone and prednisone, along with her rapid, substantial, and sustained improvement after adding rituximab which allowed for significant prednisone tapering, her near-remission was attributed to rituximab. Despite a lasting clinical response, IgA antibodies remained detectable on IIF 3 months after rituximab administration.

Fig 3

1.5 weeks after the first dose of rituximab, the patient showed significant improvement, with hypopigmented polycyclic and annular patches appearing at the sites of previous lesions on the trunk and extremities (A-C).

### Linear IgA bullous dermatosis in a patient with renal cell carcinoma [^9245454c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is an autoimmune subepidermal bullous disease with heterogeneous clinical manifestations, characterized by linear deposition of IgA along the epidermal basement membrane zone. We report a patient with a metastasized renal cell carcinoma who developed an extensive blistering eruption. The lesions showed immunopathological findings characteristic of LABD. The patient showed a fair response to prednisolone and dapsone. Treatment to control the LABD was no longer required when interferon-alfa was started as palliative therapy for the metastasized renal cell carcinoma. The association of LABD and malignancies has been documented before and is not due to mere chance alone.

### Mucosal linear IgA disease with esophageal involvement responsive to ustekinumab [^2e9364d6]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Dapsone and topical therapies are considered first-line agents for treating linear IgA disease; various second-line agents are used for refractory disease. Patients with LABD successfully treated with infliximab and rituximab have been reported; however, the use of biologics has been sparsely documented. The patient presented herein experienced remarkable improvement in her symptoms within 2 months of beginning ustekinumab therapy, and although she has not achieved complete disease remission, her symptoms have remained mild and tolerable with successful reduction of prednisone dosage. Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the p40 subunit of interleukin 12/23. Ustekinumab has been approved for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis, and it has been used for the treatment of multiple autoimmune and autoinflammatory skin disorders, including 1 reported case of a patient with bullous pemphigoid. Although this patient's disease was not drug-induced, consideration should be given to drugs associated with new-onset LABD, including in a report of a patient with psoriasis taking ustekinumab.

This patient with mucosal linear IgA disease responded to ustekinumab therapy when multiple other therapies were ineffective. With the recognition that responsiveness may be related to the distinctive presentation in this patient with comorbid conditions, the finding prompts consideration for investigating its use in trials, especially in the setting of Crohn's disease unresponsive to other treatments.

### Successful treatment of amoxicillin-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood with rituximab: a case report and review of the literature [^d7e17c8a]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case highlights a refractory presentation of pediatric drug-associated LABD in a 20-month-old female. Though usually idiopathic, pediatric LABD has rarely been reported to be drug induced. While there are several documented cases of amoxicillin-induced LABD in adults, there are only 4 other reported pediatric cases. Prior to this case, the youngest child reported was 3 years old. A summary of these previously reported cases is presented in Table I. In brief, the female to male ratio was 1:1 with patients ranging from 2.5 to 9 years of age. The rash appeared on average 12.3 days after starting amoxicillin and lasted an average of 3.5 months. The eruptions were self-limited and resolved with either drug cessation alone or in concert with additional therapy, encompassing dapsone, macrolides, cephalosporins, IVIG, oral steroids, IV steroids, and topical steroids.

Table I
Amoxicillin-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood

There are currently no Food and Drug Administration approved medications for the treatment of LABD, but dapsone and corticosteroids are first-line treatments. Unlike previously reported pediatric amoxicillin-induced LABD cases, our case was refractory to high dose corticosteroids, dapsone, and IVIG, ultimately requiring treatment with rituximab, which was successful. This case represents both the youngest reported case as well as the only case of drug-induced LABD treated with rituximab. This treatment approach, while novel, draws on experience from other cases of refractory LABD managed with rituximab, though those cases were idiopathic rather than drug induced. Agarwal et al described a 5-year-old girl with idiopathic LABD successfully treated with rituximab after failing multiple therapies, including corticosteroids, dapsone, azathioprine, and IVIG. Mitra et al reported a 2-year-old boy with a similar presentation also successfully treated with rituximab (Table I).

### Linear IgA bullous dermatosis treated with rituximab [^39881971]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These case reports suggest the efficacy of rituximab in these 2 severe and recalcitrant cases of LABD. In addition to dapsone, rituximab was associated with MMF in both cases, which might question the efficacy of rituximab. It is likely that rituximab was effective in these patients, as both of them had an LABD that was evolving for many years without disease control despite the prolonged use of corticosteroids, dapsone, and various conventional immunosuppressants. However, their condition greatly improved after a first infusion of rituximab and then resolved after repeated infusions of rituximab, which allowed to decrease or stop immunomodulants/immunosuppressants in both cases. Some recalcitrant cases of LABD, in particular sublamina densa-type LABD as in our first observation, have been described and may be difficult to differentiate from IgA epidermolysis bullous acquisita. Interestingly, in our 2 observations, the delay of efficacy of rituximab was much longer than that in pemphigus, as long-lasting remission of LABD was obtained 14 and 20 months after the initial infusion of rituximab, respectively, and repeated infusions of the drug were needed. Indeed, only an improvement of LABD lesions, but not a complete remission, occurred in the first patient after the initial infusion of rituximab. He achieved complete remission 9 months after a second infusion of rituximab administered at month 6. The second patient also needed 2 additional infusions of 1 g of rituximab and finally achieve remission 12 months after the second cycle of rituximab. Such a long delay of action of rituximab was previously reported in a patient with dermatitis herpetiformis whose disease was not controlled by gluten-free diet, dapsone, and conventional immunosuppressive agents. Indeed, complete resolution of pruritus and skin symptoms occurred 13 months after the initial infusion of rituximab. The persistence of IgA deposits along the dermoepidermal junction, although IgG deposits disappeared after rituximab treatment, was recently reported in a patient with IgG- and IgA-mediated mucous membrane pemphigoid. In this patient, a persistent population of IgA-secreting plasmablasts/plasma cells could still be observed after rituximab despite the depletion of CD20 + B cells.

Overall, these observations suggest considering the use of rituximab in patients with severe cases of LABD that are recalcitrant to conventional immunosuppressants.

### Linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis induced by gemcitabine [^5798ecda]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of linear immunoglobulin (Ig) A bullous dermatosis (LABD) induced by gemcitabine.

Case Summary

A 59-year-old man was diagnosed with squamous-cell carcinoma of the lung in T4N2M0 stage and treated with cisplatin, vinorelbine, and gemcitabine. Twenty-four hours after the administration of gemcitabine, a symmetric, bullous, herpetiform eruption appeared on his trunk and upper limbs. Histopathologic examination and direct immunofluorescence test were consistent with IgA bullous dermatosis. Cutaneous lesions resolved two weeks after the drug was withdrawn and topical steroid treatment was instituted.

Discussion

Drug-induced LABD is a variant of classic or idiopathic LABD. Vancomycin is the most frequently implicated drug, but other agents have been reported to cause LABD. According to the Naranjo probability scale, the relationship of gemcitabine treatment with cutaneous eruption in our patient is possible.

Conclusions

We report the first case of gemcitabine-induced LABD. Clinicians should monitor patients receiving this drug for signs of LABD.

### Letter in reply: linear IgA bullous dermatosis treated with dupilumab in a pediatric patient with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [^57bc56ef]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: In the recently published article "Successful treatment of linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis with dupilumab in a pediatric patient", Almuhanna et aldescribed the first reported case to date of linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) successfully treated with dupilumab in a 7-year-old patient.

We would like to report the second case of childhood LABD successfully treated with dupilumab. A 14-month-old male child with a history of atopic dermatitis presented with a 2-week history of vesicles that started on the bilateral cheeks. He had been treated with topical mupirocin and oral cephalexin for presumed impetigo without improvement. At presentation, there were scattered erythematous, eroded plaques, and tense bullae in a "crown of jewels" arrangement on the cheeks, trunk, and bilateral upper and lower extremities (Fig 1, A, B). The lesions were pruritic. The patient was afebrile and otherwise well-appearing. A lesional punch biopsy was obtained from the patient's thigh for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and a perilesional biopsy was taken for direct immunofluorescence (DIF). H&E stain revealed epidermal degeneration with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including neutrophils and eosinophils. DIF demonstrated linear, homogenous IgA deposition along the dermoepidermal junction without IgG or C3, consistent with chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood (Fig 2). Laboratory testing revealed a significantly reduced glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) level of 1.8 U/g Hb (reference: 9.9–16.6 U/g Hb). Because dapsone was contraindicated owing to G6PD deficiency, he started receiving prednisolone 1 mg/kg/d and dupilumab 200 mg every 4 weeks. Three months after starting dupilumab, the patient was successfully tapered off prednisolone. He has continued receiving dupilumab monotherapy for 3 months with complete clearance of disease.

### A case of successful management of adult-onset linear IgA bullous disease with sulfasalazine during the COVID-19 pandemic [^0f272c9e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Linear IgA bullous disease (LABD) is a rare, acquired, autoimmune, pruritic, and blistering skin condition. Dapsone is a first line treatment option, however, there are limited options if this fails, or if contraindicated. We present a case of successful management of LABD with sulfasalazine. A 46-year-old Caucasian female with LABD was commenced on high dose corticosteroids. She failed to wean, and dapsone was contraindicated due to a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis and risk of hepatitis. Following the failure of mycophenolate mofetil, sulfasalazine was trialed and successfully controlled both this patient&rsquo; s LABD and ulcerative colitis. There is little literature on the use of sulfasalazine in dermatological conditions. We present sulfasalazine as an option for patients who are unable to use classically used treatments for LABD, or in those who have a dual diagnosis, as in this case, allowing for one agent to manage both conditions. Furthermore, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance mentions sulfasalazine as one of the few drugs that can be continued during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its use spared this patient from the significant immunosuppression associated with other treatment modalities.J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(12): doi:10.36849/JDD.6717.

### UV light-induced linear IgA dermatosis [^0709290f]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Various exogenous factors (eg, drugs, dietary antigens, trauma, infections, radiographs, and UV radiation) are known to induce or aggravate skin diseases. UV radiation in particular is known to induce or aggravate the autoimmune bullous diseases of pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus vulgaris, and bullous pemphigoid. Its role in linear IgA dermatosis, however, is not well recognized. We report the second case of linear IgA dermatosis induced by intense sun exposure in which blistering was induced by UVA radiation. Furthermore, a review of the literature on photoinduced autoimmune bullous diseases and the wavelengths responsible for the induction of blistering is presented and several proposed mechanisms of action for the blister induction, including release or unmasking of antigens, promotion of antibody fixation by UV radiation, and launching of an inflammatory process, are discussed. We conclude that linear IgA dermatosis should be added to the list of autoimmune bullous diseases induced and/or aggravated by UV radiation.

### Drug-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis [^aba847c0]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 69-year-old Japanese woman with multiple blistering lesions covering almost her whole body. Linear IgA and C3 depositions were seen at the basement membrane zone on direct immunofluorescence (IF). Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is one of the autoimmune diseases resulting in subepidermal blisters. It is clinically similar to bullous pemphigoid and IF is required to distinguish the two diseases. In this case, the blistering lesions appeared after vancomycin treatment. This drug was strongly suspected as a cause of LABD in light of the clinical course of the patient even though a drug-lymphocyte stimulating test was negative. Among the various implicated causative drugs, vancomycin is the most commonly associated with LABD.

### Vancomycin-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis mimicking Stevens-Johnson syndrome associated with anticancer therapy [^61536f55]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD), also known as linear IgA disease, is a subepidermal blistering disorder presenting with linear deposits of IgA along the basement membrane zone. Although LABD is commonly idiopathic, it can also rarely be triggered by certain drugs, including vancomycin. Herein, we document the rare case of a 41-year-old woman with a history of invasive ductal breast carcinoma, receiving an anticancer regimen of pembrolizumab, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, who developed erythema, tense bullae, and extensive sloughing of skin after vancomycin therapy. Initially, the patient was suspected to have drug-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrosis; however, biopsies of the right thigh revealed subepidermal bullous dermatosis with neutrophils and necrotic keratinocytes. Direct immunofluorescence revealed 3+/3+ anti-IgA and 1+/3+ anti-C3 deposits that were linear at the dermal-epidermal junction. The clinical and histopathologic findings confirmed the diagnosis of vancomycin-induced LABD. This report examines the complicated relationship between immunobullous disease, neoplasms, and oncologic treatment. Presented is a rare case of vancomycin-induced LABD in a patient receiving concurrent chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Clinician awareness of the increased susceptibility of vancomycin-induced LABD in this population subset can improve clinical outcomes and decrease morbidity/mortality.

### Autoimmune blistering diseases in the elderly [^4d037723]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Autoimmune blistering diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population. Given the advancing age of the population, the incidence of these disorders, particularly bullous pemphigoid, is expected to rise. This contribution reviews autoimmune immunobullous disorders of particular relevance in the elderly population. These include bullous pemphigoid, cicatricial pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, pemphigus, paraneoplastic pemphigus, and linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis. Because therapy and management of individual immunobullous dermatoses differ, establishing the diagnosis is often critically important. An overall approach to bullous diseases in the elderly, as well as key clinical features, appropriate diagnostic tests, microscopic findings, immunofluorescence microscopy patterns, and molecular targets for select disorders are reviewed. Elucidation of antigenic targets at the molecular level has allowed for development of serum enzyme-linked immunofluorescence assays, which have enhanced diagnostic accuracy for several autoimmune blistering disorders. Given the relative rarity of these diseases, large randomized trials evaluating efficacy of various treatments are few, and therapy for most immunobullous disorders in the elderly has not been standardized. Despite this, appropriate therapeutic considerations for each condition are presented and the evidence for them is reviewed.

### Amlodipine-induced linear IgA disease [^41f40e60]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

A 58-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of a pruritic rash, which had started a week after commencing treatment with amlodipine. On physical examination, large, well-demarcated erythematous plaques, surrounded by small clusters of clear vesicles, were seen on the patient's torso. Subepidermal blisters with neutrophils and eosinophils were seen in a skin biopsy, and direct immunofluorescence showed deposition of IgA along the basement membrane, in keeping with a diagnosis of linear IgA dermatosis (LAD). Amlodipine was discontinued, and the patient was started on prednisolone 30 mg, supplemented shortly afterwards by dapsone, which resulted in prompt resolution of the rash. Only a few cases of drug-induced LAD have been reported, mostly in association with vancomycin. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case precipitated by amlodipine.

### Linear IgA bullous dermatosis induced by atorvastatin [^faf56858]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is an autoimmune blistering skin disease characterized by circulating IgA antibodies binding the basement membrane zone. In most cases the origin is not clear, but in a minority of cases LABD is drug induced. We describe a patient in whom linear IgA disease developed shortly after beginning therapy with atorvastatin. In Western blotting analysis we detected IgA and IgG class antibodies targeting a 97-kd protein. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of atorvastatin-induced LABD.

### Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: a comprehensive review [^89699b85]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is a rare autoimmune blistering disease which results in vesicle and bullae formation on the skin and erosions on the mucous membranes. EBA is mediated by autoantibodies to collagen VII. Clinically, it can present with numerous phenotypes, though the most common are the mechanobullous and inflammatory variants. Patients with mechanobullous EBA develop non-inflammatory bullae and erosions at sites of trauma while patients with the non-mechanobullous type develop inflammatory lesions which often mimic other blistering conditions including bullous pemphigoid, linear IgA bullous disease, and mucous membrane pemphigoid. Diagnosis is established by having a consistent clinical presentation, DIF, and autoantibodies against collagen VII. In apparent "seronegative" patients, the diagnosis is challenging due to the need for confirmatory tests which are often not routinely accessible outside of the specialized center. In light of EBA's rarity, and lack of any randomized controlled trials, treatment guidelines rely on the small case series presented in the literature. There has been variable success utilizing the arsenal of immunosuppressants and biologics. Development of experimental murine models has facilitated a deeper understanding of EBA's pathogenesis and allows for preclinical testing of numerous novel drug targets predominantly targeting inhibition of neutrophil activation. We herein review the presentation, diagnosis, treatments, and future avenues of research in EBA.

### Development of cyclosporine-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis despite concurrent use of dapsone [^90894f16]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Symptoms of LABD typically begin within 1 month of drug administration, but cases have been reported with a latency period of up to 780 days. Most frequently observed in children, lesions may appear as a "crown of jewels" or "string of pearls" with a central lesion surrounded by vesicles. Biopsy showing subepidermal vesiculation with neutrophils and direct immunofluorescence with linear IgA is diagnostic. These findings paired with negative serologies for anticollagen VII, anti-BPAG1, and anti-BPAG2 antibodies help differentiate the condition from other bullous disorders, such as epidermolysis bullous acquisita and bullous pemphgoid.

This patient's characteristic "crown of jewels" rash in combination with linear IgA deposition on direct immunofluorescence strongly suggests LABD, which is unusual because of development of the disease while taking dapsone, the agent of choice to treat LABD. Additionally of interest, cyclosporine could represent an iatrogenic trigger in this patient as she began taking both medications the same month and cyclosporine has been previously implicated in the development of LABD.

Due to the established rapid response of LABD to dapsone, it is possible that the patient had developed LABD-associated antibodies during the course of cyclosporine, and her disease was masked by concurrent dapsone use. Dapsone is known to have a half-life of 10 to 50 hours with an average of 30 hours. Our suspicion is that when the patient missed > 48 hours of dapsone treatment, her skin disease became clinically evident. This patient's history of autoimmune disease, including drug-induced lupus and primary aplastic anemia, suggests that they may have increased risk of developing LABD. Interestingly, although most patients with drug-induced LABD require withdrawal of the offending agent to achieve lesions resolution, this patient's lesions resolved with resuming dapsone and the addition of topical corticosteroids. Of note, Petit et aldescribes a case of LABD suspected to be triggered by cyclosporine, which was continued through treatment. Instead of cyclosporine discontinuation, the medication dosage was decreased, and the patient was started on dapsone and oral steroids with disease improvement.

This patient's case highlights an atypical presentation of LABD with exquisite responsiveness to dapsone and emphasizes the importance of a high index of suspicion for the development of additional autoimmune disorders in patients with known autoimmune disease.

### Vancomycin-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis… [^8391e7b9]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Linear IgA bullous dermatosis is an idiopathic vesiculobullous disease with a nondiagnostic clinical appearance. It is best characterized pathologically by subepidermal bullous formation with homogeneous linear IgA deposition at the blister base. 1–4 Although LABD is most often idiopathic, drug-induced disease may occur rarely. 5, 6 We describe a patient with vancomycin-induced LABD in whom the eruption was documented clinically, histopathologically, and immunologically on rechallenge. Report of a Case. — A 68-year-old man with coronary artery disease was admitted to the New England Deaconess Hospital for a coronary artery bypass graft. On admission, his medications included atenolol, diltiazem hydrochloride, tolazamide nitropaste, intravenous heparin, digoxin, and prazosin hydrochloride. There was no history of drug allergy.

On hospital day 2, the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, which was complicated by cardiogenic shock and acute tubular necrosis. An intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing was needed. Intravenously administered Baden LA, Apovian C, Imber MJ, Dover JS. Vancomycin-Induced Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis.

### Paraneoplastic pemphigus and autoimmune blistering diseases associated with neoplasm: characteristics, diagnosis, associated neoplasms, proposed pathogenesis, treatment [^3a226397]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Autoimmune paraneoplastic and neoplasm-associated skin syndromes are characterized by autoimmune-mediated cutaneous lesions in the presence of a neoplasm. The identification of these syndromes provides information about the underlying tumor, systemic symptoms, and debilitating complications. The recognition of these syndromes is particularly helpful in cases of skin lesions presenting as the first sign of the malignancy, and the underlying malignancy can be treated in a timely manner. Autoimmune paraneoplastic and neoplasm-associated bullous skin syndromes are characterized by blister formation due to an autoimmune response to components of the epidermis or basement membrane in the context of a neoplasm. The clinical manifestations, histopathology and immunopathology findings, target antigens, associated neoplasm, current diagnostic criteria, current understanding of pathogenesis, and treatment options for a selection of four diseases are reviewed. Paraneoplastic pemphigus manifests with clinically distinct painful mucosal erosions and polymorphic cutaneous lesions, and is often associated with lymphoproliferative neoplasm. In contrast, bullous pemphigoid associated with neoplasm presents with large tense subepidermal bullae of the skin, and mild mucosal involvement, but without unique clinical features. Mucous membrane pemphigoid associated with neoplasm is a disorder of chronic subepithelial blisters that evolve into erosions and ulcerations that heal with scarring, and involves stratified squamous mucosal surfaces. Linear IgA dermatosis associated with neoplasm is characterized by annularly grouped pruritic papules, vesicles, and bullae along the extensor surfaces of elbows, knees, and buttocks. Physicians should be aware that these autoimmune paraneoplastic and neoplasm-associated syndromes can manifest distinct or similar clinical features as compared with the non-neoplastic counterparts.

Introduction

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a rare disorder characterized by tense bullae arranged annularly on the trunk and extremities. LABD is usually idiopathic or associated with medications, classically vancomycin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Rarely, LABD has been reported in association with lymphoproliferative disorders, sarcomas, and carcinomas of solid organs, although it is controversial whether this is a causative association.

### Linear IgA bullous dermatosis responsive to a gluten-free diet [^0ea81181]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with a gluten-sensitive enteropathy in > 85% of cases. Both the skin lesions and the enteropathy respond to gluten restriction. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis has a much lower prevalence of histological small bowel abnormalities, and lesions are not known to respond to gluten restriction. We report a patient with linear IgA bullous dermatosis and gluten-sensitive enteropathy. This report addresses the issue of whether linear IgA bullous dermatosis can be associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. We evaluated the response to gluten restriction and normal diet by following the status of the patient's jejunal biopsies and skin lesions. The patient responded to gluten restriction, as shown by resolution of jejunal abnormalities and skin lesions and subsequently by recurrence of jejunal abnormalities and skin lesions with reinstitution of a gluten-containing diet. This report demonstrates that linear IgA bullous dermatosis can respond to gluten restriction if an underlying gluten-sensitive enteropathy is present.

### Spectrum of autoimmune bullous diseases among children in Kuwait [^aac88a15]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBD) are rare among children. The data describing the overall spectrum and prognosis of pediatric AIBD (pAIBD) are scarce, and there are no established treatment guidelines.

Objectives

The present study examined the spectrum, clinical characteristics, and long-term prognosis of pAIBD in a tertiary care pediatric dermatology unit.

Methods

Retrospective records of all pAIBD cases (< 18 years) registered over a span of 28 years were analyzed.

Results

Records of 23 cases of pAIBD, including 16 boys and 7 girls, were reviewed. They constituted 8.5% of total AIBD patients from all age groups. Ninety-one percent of patients were of Arab ethnicity. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis was the most prevalent AIBD followed by bullous pemphigoid, bullous lupus erythematosus, and pemphigus variants (pyostomatitis-pyodermatitis vegetans and neonatal pemphigus). The mean age of onset and diagnosis was 6.4 and 7.7 years, respectively. Systemic treatments, including systemic corticosteroids and dapsone, were required in most cases. Intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) was also utilized as second-line therapy. The mean follow-up period was 76 months with 90% of the patients in complete remission.

Conclusions

AIBD pose a great challenge among children both in diagnosis and treatment. This study highlights the ethnic variability and underscores the need for additional similar, international studies to achieve a better understanding of the burden related to pAIBD and help establish treatment guidelines.

### Neonatal linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis: a critical case recovering after prompt recognition, intensive management, and breastfeeding interruption – A case report [^2b01ba8c]. Neonatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) bullous dermatosis is a blistering disease that affects both children and adults, with rare onset during the neonatal period; so far less than 20 cases of neonatal linear IgA bullous dermatosis (NLABD) have been reported. NLABD manifests in the first days of life with cutaneous vesicles and bullae, organized in a circular "string of pearls" pattern, combined with erosions and crusted lesions. Mucosal involvement of the upper aerodigestive tract is the most serious complication, which leads to feeding difficulties and life-threatening respiratory failure. Respiratory support and tube feeding are indicated in most cases. Ophthalmologic manifestations are occasionally reported. The mechanism of IgA transmission is not fully elucidated yet, but the presence of auto-IgAs in breastmilk suggested that mother's milk could be the main transmission source.

### Palmar petechiae in a patient with diabetes mellitus [^58f40036]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What would direct immunofluorescence (DIF) microscopy most likely show?
A. Linear deposition of IgA along the basement membrane of perilesional skin
B. Granular deposition of IgA within the dermal papillae of perilesional skin
C. Linear deposition of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane of perilesional skin
D. Linear and granular deposition of IgG along the basement membrane of perilesional skin
E. Intercellular IgG within the epidermis of perilesional skin

Answers:
A. Linear deposition of IgA along the basement membrane of perilesional skin – Incorrect. While also characterized by a neutrophilic infiltrate in the papillary dermis, DIF shows linear deposition of IgA along the basement membrane in all cases of linear IgA bullous dermatosis. Uncommonly, DH may demonstrate linear deposition of IgA, but granular deposition is much more typical.
B. Granular deposition of IgA within the dermal papillae of perilesional skin – Correct. DIF microscopy of DH classically demonstrates granular deposition of IgA within the dermal papillae of perilesional skin. Granular deposits may also be detected at the basement membrane, and C3 often co-migrates with IgA. Granular IgA deposition at the basement membrane can overlap with findings of linear IgA bullous dermatosis, but serologic testing can be utilized to confirm the correct diagnosis. Granular deposition of IgA in the dermal papillae, however, is pathognomonic for DH. While pharmacologic treatment does not clear the deposition of granular IgA deposits in the dermal papillae, a gluten-free diet results in resolution of these deposits. In this patient, DIF demonstrated granular deposition of IgA at the basement membrane zone and within the dermal papillae.
C. Linear deposition of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane of perilesional skin – Incorrect. This pattern describes bullous pemphigoid. In bullous pemphigoid, the predominant inflammatory infiltrate is made up by eosinophils, which can be seen in the papillary dermis, in subepidermal blisters, and as eosinophilic spongiosis. DIF reveals linear IgG and C3 deposition along the basement membrane.
D. Linear and granular deposition of IgG along the basement membrane of perilesional skin – Incorrect. This pattern may be observed in bullous systemic lupus erythematosus. While bullous systemic lupus erythematosus also has neutrophilic infiltrate, DIF shows deposition of IgG, sometimes along with IgA and/or IgM, in a linear and granular pattern along the basement membrane.
E. Intercellular IgG within the epidermis of perilesional skin – Incorrect. This pattern describes the most common pemphigus subtypes, pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus. Pemphigus vulgaris typically has intercellular deposition of IgG and C3, predominantly in the lower layers of the epidermis, whereas pemphigus foliaceus more commonly exhibits intercellular deposition of IgG and C3 in the upper layers of the epidermis.

To the Editor. — The association of lithium and psoriasis, acne and acneiform eruptions, and folliculitis is relatively well known. There have been other rare and isolated reports of the association of lithium with alopecia, exfoliative dermatitis, maculopapular rash, ulcer, stomatitis, ichthyosis, xerosis, eczema, and pruritus, and a single case of dermatitis herpetiformis. 1 The last case was reported by Posey in 19722; in his short report he described an adult woman who had been taking lithium carbonate for a manicdepressive illness and in whom an intensely pruritic papular dermatitis developed that appeared on the elbows and resembled dermatitis herpetiformis clinically. This diagnosis was not histologically confirmed. Sulfoxone sodium therapy was started with cessation of symptoms, but lithium therapy could not be reinstituted without new lesion formation.

Question 3: What treatment would NOT be indicated in this patient?
A. Dapsone
B. Topical corticosteroids
C. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
D. Sulfasalazine
E. Antibiotic therapy of triggering infection

Answers:
A. Dapsone – Correct. Dapsone is used in dermatology for the treatment of inflammatory dermatoses like dermatitis herpetiformis, IgA linear bullous disease, subcorneal pustulosis, erythema elevatum et diutinum, Sweet syndrome, and acne fulminans, among others.
B. Topical corticosteroids – Incorrect. Skin and mucosal lesions can be treated with topical treatments, including corticosteroids and keratinolytic agents.
C. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs – Incorrect. Most patients will also need treatment of joint symptoms, including analgesics, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or local steroid injections.
D. Sulfasalazine – Incorrect. Patients with chronic arthritis not responding to therapy with corticosteroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may need other treatment options including sulfasalazine, retinoids, methotrexate, or azathioprine.
E. Antibiotic therapy of triggering infection – Incorrect. Appropriate antibiotic treatment of initiating genitourinary infection is fundamental, especially when triggered by C trachomatis. Our patient was given doxycycline, 100 mg twice a day for 7 days, to treat the urethritis, with resolution of the pyuria but persistence of the mucocutaneous lesions and the joint symptomatology. There is no current evidence that treatment of gastrointestinal infection has an effect on the severity and duration of reactive arthritis.

### Management of cutaneous disorders related to inflammatory bowel disease [^5880b721]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Linear IgA bullous disease

Linear IgA bullous disease (LABD) is a rare acquired subepidermal autoimmune blistering disorder associated with the deposition of IgA in a linear pattern at the dermoepidermal junction. The etiology of LABD is still unknown, although it has been associated with malignancy, autoimmune diseases, infections and drugs. Its association with IBD, particularly UC, has been reported. UC prevalence in LABD patients was 7.1% compared to the 0.05% prevalence in the general population. UC usually precedes the onset of the skin disease, although the opposite may also occur.

Clinical lesions are tense vesicles or bullae. This eruption is usually confined to the skin, but it may involve the mucous membranes in up to 80% of patients. Diagnosis of LABD is based on the histopathological and immunopathological findings.

The primary therapy in LABD is still dapsone. Sulfapyridine may be used, if the patient is intolerant to dapsone. Small doses of corticosteroids are often needed in addition to dapsone or sulfapyridine in cases where high-dose dapsone or sulfapyridine alone do not adequately control the disease. Sulfamethoxypyridazine, colchicine, cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, mycophenolate mofetil, oxacillin, dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, erythromycin, IgIV and a combination of tetracycline and nicotinamide have also been tried with variable results.

Complete remission of LABD after total colectomy for UC has been reported.

The course of UC and LABD is not considered to be parallel, but, in some case reports, both disorders improved after therapy.

### Ulcerative colitis complicated with linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis [^efe7dd7e]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a rare disorder involving subepidermal blistering characterised by IgA deposition along the basement membrane. The clinical features of LABD are variable but can include bullae, vesicles and erythematous lesions. Histopathology reveals formation of subepidermal bullae and linearly deposition of IgA in the basement membrane of the epidermis. LABD has been reported as a rare complication of ulcerative colitis (UC). We report the case of a young woman with UC complicated by LABD. The latter manifested as vesicles with erythema on almost the entire body. A biopsy of the skin lesions revealed linear IgA deposits in the basement membrane according to a direct immunofluorescence assay. Prednisolone administration resulted in clinical remission of UC but poor improvement of skin lesions. Oral administration of diaminodiphenyl sulfone led to improvement of blisters. Thereafter, abdominal and skin symptoms did not recur and she was discharged from hospital.

### Drug-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis with extensive mucosal involvement [^0d5d06ff]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case highlights a rare occurrence of drug-induced LABD with oral, ocular, nasal, and genital manifestations. Although multiple IV medications were prescribed, the most likely culprit that triggered the LABD in our patient was the single dose of IV vancomycin administered at admission. Onodera et alreported that between 1981 and 2019, 100 cases of LABD were published with vancomycin being the most common trigger. As the patient only received 1 dose of IV vancomycin, discontinuation of the offending drug did not apply to this case.

Vancomycin is primarily eliminated by the kidneys and 80% to 90% of vancomycin is excreted within 24 hours. Vancomycin clearance decreases linearly with creatinine. Owing to our patient's impaired renal function secondary to hepatorenal syndrome, we hypothesize that decreased clearance of IV vancomycin may have exacerbated his condition.

The extent of mucosal involvement in this case, encompassing multiple mucosal surfaces, including the genital area, is exceptionally rare in LABD. Although previous cases of LABD with oral and nasal involvement have been documented, reports of genital involvement are limited, with only 1 prior case described in the literature. However, this previous case involved localized lesions confined to the penis without concurrent cutaneous manifestations. Additionally, this case was believed to be due to viral or autoimmune LABD in contrast to our case, which we hypothesize is drug-induced. To our knowledge, our case is the first case of drug-induced LABD reported with diffuse blistering encompassing the oral, nasal, ocular, and genital areas.

The management of drug-induced LABD primarily involves discontinuation of the offending medication and symptomatic treatment of skin lesions. In severe cases with extensive blistering, as seen in this patient, supportive measures such as wound care and topical corticosteroids may be necessary to promote healing and prevent secondary infection.

Though infrequent, considering drug-induced LABD as a potential cause for diffuse blistering, encompassing the oral, nasal, ocular, and genital areas is crucial. A multidisciplinary approach and heightened awareness are essential for better managing such cases.

### Childhood linear IgA bullous disease triggered by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [^87db170c]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Linear immunoglobulin A bullous disease is an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease that has been described in both children and adults. Reports have shown that as many as two-thirds of occurrences may be drug-induced. The offending drugs include antibiotics, predominantly vancomycin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and diuretics. We report childhood linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis developing following amoxicillin-clavulanic acid administration. The patient presented with characteristic blisters in an annular fashion, likened to a "crown of jewels". The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of a linear band of immunoglobulin A at the dermoepidermal junction on direct immunofluorescence. The lesions resolved with withdrawal of the drug, and systemic therapy was not required. We review the current literature and concepts of drug-induced linear immunoglobulin A bullous disease.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients evaluated by the oncodermatology clinic and consultative service of Yale New Haven Hospital from 2016 to 2018.

Results

We identified 9 of 853 patients who developed bullous eruptions (∼1%) that were treated with an-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy at our institution during the study period: 7 presented with bullous pemphigoid, 1 presented with bullous lichenoid dermatitis, and 1 presented with linear IgA bullous dermatosis in the context of vancomycin therapy. In all, 8 patients required systemic steroids, 5 required maintenance therapy, and 8 required interruption of immunotherapy. All 9 patients had an initial positive tumor response or stable disease, but 4 went on to develop disease progression.

Limitations

This was a retrospective study from a single tertiary care center.

Conclusions

Bullous disorders developed in approximately 1% of patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy at our institution and frequently resulted in interruption of immune therapy and management with systemic corticosteroids and occasionally steroid-sparing agents.

### Linear immunoglobulin A / G bullous dermatosis associated with ulcerative colitis [^7d87a6de]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Linear immunoglobulin (Ig)A/G bullous dermatosis (LAGBD) is an autoimmune bullous disease characterized by formation of subepidermal blisters and linear deposition of IgA and IgG antibodies along the basement membrane zone (BMZ). The association between linear IgA bullous dermatosis and ulcerative colitis (UC) is well recognized, but reports of UC-associated LAGBD are lacking. We have reported a 24-year-old man suffering from LAGBD associated with UC, which occurred before exacerbations of skin rash. A skin biopsy indicated a subepidermal blister with an infiltration of primarily neutrophils and eosinophils in the dermis. Direct immunofluorescence (IF) studies showed a linear deposition of IgA, IgG and C3c. Indirect IF of human skin revealed IgA and IgG anti-BMZ autoantibodies. Indirect IF of 1 M NaCl-split human skin demonstrated reactivity of IgA and IgG antibodies at the epidermal side. Immunoblotting showed that IgG antibodies reacted to the BP180 NC16a domain and 120-kDa linear IgA dermatosis-1, and enzyme-linked immunoassay detected IgG anti-BP230 antibodies. Administration of prednisolone and diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS) via the p.o. route improved skin lesions and bowel conditions. These results suggest that the bowel inflammation observed in UC may have a causative effect of initiation of the immune response to the skin and development of the bullous skin lesions in LAGBD. A combination of DDS and corticosteroid could be a recommended therapeutic option for patients with LAGBD with UC.

### Treatment of chronic bullous disease of childhood with dupilumab after dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia in a 2-year-old female patient [^a4f8733b]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: We read with interest the report by Almuhanna et alon the remarkable response to the off-label use of dupilumab in a 7-year-old boy with linear IgA bullous dermatosis. This case report highlights the challenges of treating linear IgA bullous dermatosis with the current conventional treatment. We aim to expand upon this finding regarding the successful treatment of chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC) with dupilumab after dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia in our patient.

A 2-year-old female patient was referred to our clinic with tense bullae in rosette configurations and erosions distributed on the trunk, back, extremities, ears, buttocks, and labia majora. Her body weight was 16 kg, and she was not responsive to oral prednisolone 35 mg daily for the past 4 days (Fig 1). Moreover, she did not have systemic symptoms. Biopsy was considered but not performed because of the classic clinical findings of CBDC. The patient was tapered off prednisolone and simultaneously started on oral dapsone 32 mg daily after confirmation of normal complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) level laboratory results. After 5 days of dapsone treatment, physical examination revealed blue discoloration of the face, lips, and tongue without any improvement of prior lesions (Fig 2).

Consequently, laboratory blood test revealed an elevated methemoglobin level of 20.9% (normal range, 0.0%-1.5%). The patient was diagnosed with dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia and admitted to pediatric intensive care unit for methylene blue treatment. Her parents were reluctant to consider other potential conventional options such as cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil because of the trauma of dealing with the methemoglobinemia from the dapsone. The patient was started on dupilumab 300 mg monthly injection and oral prednisolone 45 mg daily. The 8-week follow-up revealed significant improvement in lesions with prednisolone tapering (Fig 3). The patient responded well to stopping prednisolone completely, and she is currently on dupilumab only.

### Linear IgA disease: complicated by alpha thalassemia [^260eb4ee]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Dapsone is regarded as the treatment of choice for linear immunoglobulin A disease (chronic bullous disease of childhood). It is associated with both hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia. The hematotoxic effects are dose related and can result in significant hemolysis. We present a case of a patient with chronic bullous disease of childhood and alpha thalassemia trait. Complete resolution occurred on a standard dose of dapsone without significant hemolysis.

Discussion

Autoimmune subepidermal blistering diseases are rare. The BP incidence is 6–13 per million people and typically affects adults over 60 years of age. The LABD incidence is 0.3–2.3 per million and may present both in children and adults. A review of 45 LAGBD cases in Japan showed that 49% of the patients were younger than 60 years of age.

In BP, the most common antigens are BP230 (a 230-kDa intracellular protein) and BP180 (a 180-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein). Antibodies against BP180 are believed to induce the initial blisters, while anti-BP230 antibodies enhance the inflammatory reaction. In LABD, the target antigens are the 97-kDa or 120-kDa fractions of BP180 carboxy-terminus. In LAGBD, IgG and IgA antibodies target BP180 most commonly, and, less often, laminin-332, and BP230. Drug-induced BP and LABD have been reported; there is, however, no specific association of LAGBD with drugs. LAGBD has been reported in patients with ulcerative colitis, B-cell lymphoma, and colorectal carcinoma.

Clinical manifestations of BP and LABD are variable and can overlap. LAGBD presentations include erythema, pustules, tense bullous lesions, and small vesicles in annular patterns. Ocular and oral mucosa, involvement, as well as a case of LAGBD-related interstitial pneumonia, have been reported. The relationship between LAGBD clinical manifestations and the type of predominant antibody highlights that BP, LAGBD, and LABD are on a spectrum.

Histopathologic evaluation shows subepidermal bullae. Eosinophilic spongiosis and/or dermal infiltrate of eosinophils are seen in BP. LABD shows predominantly neutrophilic infiltrates.LAGBD has mixed eosinophilic and neutrophilic infiltrates. Direct immunofluorescence typically reveals the presence of linear deposits of IgG, IgA, and C3. LAGBD has been reported to have IgA and IgG binding mostly to the epidermal surface (as seen in this case), and rarely combined epidermal-dermal, or dermalsides.

### Autoimmune bullous dermatoses: a review [^82fb1df3]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Bullous dermatoses can be debilitating and possibly fatal. A selection of autoimmune blistering diseases, including pemphigus vulgaris, paraneoplastic pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, cicatricial pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA dermatosis are reviewed. Pemphigus vulgaris usually starts in the oral mucosa followed by blistering of the skin, which is often painful. Paraneoplastic pemphigus is associated with neoplasms, most commonly of lymphoid tissue, but also Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, sarcomas, thymomas and Castleman's disease. Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by large, tense bullae, but may begin as an urticarial eruption. Cicatricial (scarring) pemphigoid presents with severe, erosive lesions of the mucous membranes with skin involvement in one third of patients focused around the head and upper trunk. Dermatitis herpetiformis is intensely pruritic and chronic, characterized by papulovesicles and urticarial wheals on the extensor surfaces in a grouped or herpetiform, symmetric distribution. Linear IgA dermatosis is clinically similar to dermatitis herpetiformis, but it is not associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy as is dermatitis herpetiformis.

### Successful treatment of linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis with dupilumab in a pediatric patient [^d11758c9]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

While investigations were pending, the patient was started on oral 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone taper for 3 weeks, topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus, topical mupirocin, and emollients.

As work-up by the hematology team at the time, was still pending, and the patient continued to flare, given the risk of hemolysis, dapsone was avoided, and off-label dupilumab (600 mg loading dose followed by 300 mg monthly subcutaneous injections) was initiated.

At 1-month follow-up, he had a significant improvement in his pruritus and denied any new lesions. By 4-month follow-up, the patient had a complete resolution of his bullae and pruritus with a parent-proxy Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score score of 0 (Fig 1, B).

### Annular bullous diseases [^0550bdfc]. Clinics in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Annular bullous dermatoses represent an etiologically diverse group of cutaneous phenomena that present with a figurate morphology in association with vesicles and bullae. This group of diverse conditions consists of bullous pemphigoid; pemphigoid gestationis; epidermolysis bullosa simplex, Dowling-Meara type; linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis; chronic bullous disease of childhood; anti-p200 pemphigoid; subcorneal pustular dermatosis; and immunoglobulin A pemphigus. Astute examination of clinical, histopathologic, and serologic features is crucial in distinguishing these bullous dermatoses. We review the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, histopathology, and treatments for each bullous annular disease to aid physicians in their recognition, diagnosis, and management.
