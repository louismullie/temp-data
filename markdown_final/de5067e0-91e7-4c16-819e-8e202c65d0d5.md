## Question

What is the timing of immune-mediated pulmonary toxicity?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the timing of immune-mediated pulmonary toxicity (checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis) during therapy and after stopping immune checkpoint inhibitors, including typical onset, extremes, modifiers, recurrence, and practice implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how CIP is defined and which sources carry the strongest evidence. Then, I should verify the earliest-to-latest onset windows across studies and guidelines. Next, I will check the median or typical onset ranges and whether there is clustering. After that, I need to assess factors that shift timing earlier or later, including regimen, tumor type, and host lung disease. I will then examine timing after treatment is stopped and the recurrence patterns on rechallenge. Finally, I should align diagnostic and therapeutic timing with guideline recommendations and synthesize practical surveillance intervals.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and data hierarchy so I don't over-interpret single-center series or case reports; checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) is an immune-related adverse event attributed to PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 blockade, diagnosed after excluding alternative etiologies and typically requiring corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe grades, with the most reliable timing estimates coming from large cohorts, regulatory labels, and society guidelines supplemented by focused real-world cohorts and case series [^11299S8P] [^112fo2zU] [^113wuVbs].

> Wait, let me verify the extreme temporal boundaries because assumptions of "only early onset" are often wrong; across high-credibility reviews and case-based syntheses, onset has been reported as early as several hours after the first dose and as late as approximately 24 months from initiation, with a commonly cited overall range of hours to 24 months and individual cohorts spanning roughly 9 days to about 19 months, which establishes a very wide biological window for CIP onset [^112iPaX1] [^112FyXPK] [^112iPaX1].

> I should confirm the typical onset window and whether events cluster; convergent data show that CIP most often emerges at about 2–3 months after starting therapy, with medians such as 52.5 days in a multi-center NSCLC cohort and 79 days in an irAE hospitalization analysis, and single-center NSCLC series around 82 days, which together suggest peak risk around 7–10 weeks with a long tail thereafter [^112fo2zU] [^112FyXPK] [^112iPaX1] [^114H5CA9] [^114Uf326].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about regimen effects without reconciling inconsistent numbers; one statement said combination therapy leads to earlier onset by about 17 weeks with "6.9 months vs 2.6 months", but that actually suggests later, not earlier, so I should correct this using the melanoma cohort where combination ipilimumab–nivolumab presented earlier at about 10.3 weeks compared with 27.5 weeks on nivolumab alone, and broader datasets confirm higher incidence with combination regimens even as most monotherapy cases follow the 2–3 month pattern [^112hisjW] [^112W7tba].

> Let me consider tumor context and host risk that can shift timing; melanoma cohorts include reports of very acute presentations with median time near 10 days in some series, while NSCLC typically follows the 2–3 month profile, and host or disease factors associated with earlier onset include higher BMI, concurrent chemotherapy, EGFR mutations, older age, preexisting interstitial lung disease, tumor infiltration, and baseline fibrotic changes on CT, which also correlate with higher overall risk of CIP in lung cancer [^114KfHTv] [^112fo2zU] [^114hgXBM].

> I will now examine timing after stopping therapy because delayed immune dysregulation can emerge off treatment; although uncommon, CIP has been documented from roughly 2 weeks up to 24 months after discontinuation, with a median around 4.5 months post-cessation in collated reports, so I need to ensure post-treatment surveillance plans account for this tail [^114Uf326] [^112iPaX1].

> Next, I should review recurrence timing because that shapes safety on rechallenge; in a melanoma series, 3 of 7 rechallenged patients had recurrent pneumonitis and 3 of 19 recurred despite complete discontinuation, while regulatory labels show variable recurrence rates upon reinitiation across agents, for example approximately 29% with nivolumab, around 4% with atezolizumab in one dataset, none reported among five reinitiating Opdualag in that series, and about 19% with tislelizumab, all reinforcing that recurrence can occur within weeks to months after rechallenge and mandates close monitoring [^112hisjW] [^116EeUBc] [^112og8Zo] [^1127GhXU] [^114bj73f].

> I need to check how severity intersects with persistence and time to resolution; more severe grades have higher rates of incomplete resolution in NSCLC cohorts, and guideline-recommended steroid courses reflect the protracted immune activation, typically 4–6 weeks for grade 2 and at least 6–8 weeks for grade 3 or higher, acknowledging that failure to improve by 48–72 hours should prompt escalation that itself may prolong the clinical timeline [^114hgXBM] [^11299S8P].

> Let me think about surveillance timing and cadence in practice because this is where timing translates to safety; vigilance is highest in the first 3 months when incidence peaks, continues through months 3–6 given persistent risk, and should extend up to 24 months overall, including at least several months after discontinuation, especially in higher-risk settings like combination ICI therapy, melanoma, prior thoracic RT, or baseline ILD, as supported by timing distributions in real-world cohorts and post-cessation case syntheses [^112FyXPK] [^114Uf326] [^112iPaX1].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic timing steps aligned to symptom onset; at first suspicion of CIP, guidelines advise immediate comprehensive assessment including chest CT with contrast and exclusion of infection, tumor progression, pulmonary embolism, and cardiogenic etiologies, with early bronchoscopy and BAL considered to exclude infection and support immune etiology, recognizing that BAL lymphocytosis above approximately 15% is commonly reported though not pathognomonic [^1113bXsN] [^115C4rNt] [^111PntZA] [^115ApBrY].

> I should double-check treatment timing triggers and escalation; for grade 2 disease, start oral prednisone or equivalent at about 1 mg/kg/day with a 4–6 week taper after improvement, and for grade 3 or higher, initiate IV methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day with a taper of at least 6–8 weeks, and if no clinical improvement within roughly 72 hours, escalate to additional immunosuppression such as infliximab, mycophenolate, IVIG, or tocilizumab per guideline options, while planning any rechallenge only after complete resolution and steroid taper with close monitoring [^11299S8P] [^1119vxQ3] [^113o1Txq].

> Hmm, wait a minute, calling the distribution "bimodal" might be overstated; it is more accurate to say there is an early peak around 2–3 months with a long tail extending to about 2 years from initiation and a smaller post-discontinuation tail with a median around 4.5 months, with earlier onset more likely in combination therapy, melanoma, and patients with specific risks like ILD or fibrotic changes, so clinicians should maintain high suspicion from hours to months after starting ICIs and for months after stopping them [^112iPaX1] [^114Uf326] [^112fo2zU] [^112hisjW] [^114KfHTv].

Immune-mediated pulmonary toxicity (pneumonitis) most often occurs **within 2–3 months** [^112W7tba] of starting immune checkpoint inhibitors, but onset is highly variable, ranging from days to over a year, and can occur after discontinuation [^112iPaX1]. Early onset is more common with **combination therapy** or **prior thoracic radiation**, while **late onset** can occur months after stopping treatment [^114Uf326]. Clinicians should maintain vigilance throughout therapy and after discontinuation, as delayed or recurrent pneumonitis is possible [^112hisjW].

---

## Typical timing of onset

- **Median onset**: 2–3 months [^112W7tba] [^112iPaX1] after initiating ICIs.
- **Range**: Days to over a year [^112W7tba] after starting therapy [^113wuVbs].
- **Post-discontinuation**: Can occur months [^114Uf326] after stopping ICIs [^112iPaX1].

---

## Early-onset pneumonitis

- **Timing**: Within the first few weeks to months of therapy [^11291MBD].
- **Risk factors**: Combination therapy (e.g. anti-PD-1/PD-L1 with anti-CTLA-4) [^112W7tba] and prior thoracic radiation [^112og8Zo] [^116EeUBc].
- **Clinical course**: Often more severe, requiring prompt recognition and management [^112fo2zU].

---

## Late-onset pneumonitis

Late-onset pneumonitis occurs months after initiating therapy, including **after discontinuation** [^112iPaX1]. The clinical course may be milder but can still be severe or fatal if unrecognized [^11488GLf].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Monitoring**: Regular clinical and radiographic assessment during and after therapy [^115C4rNt].
- **Management**: Early recognition, corticosteroids, and immunosuppression for severe cases [^113VtyXL].
- **Patient education**: Inform patients about symptoms and the need for prompt reporting [^117JDdTf].

Pneumonitis is an uncommon but potentially fatal toxicity of anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features are poorly described.

- **Methods**: Patients who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy or in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 mAb were identified at two institutions: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (advanced solid cancers, 2009 to 2014) and Melanoma Institute of Australia (melanomas only, 2013 to 2015). Pneumonitis was diagnosed by the treating investigator; cases with confirmed malignant lung infiltration or infection were excluded. Clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features of pneumonitis were collected. Associations among pneumonitis incidence, therapy received, and underlying malignancy were examined using Fisher's exact test, as were associations between pneumonitis features and outcomes.

- **Results**: Of 915 patients who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs, pneumonitis developed in 43 (5%; 95% CI, 3% to 6%; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 27 of 578 [5%]; Melanoma Institute of Australia, 16 of 337 [5%]). Time to onset of pneumonitis ranged from 9 days to 19.2 months. The incidence of pneumonitis was higher with combination immunotherapy versus monotherapy (19 of 199 [10%] vs. 24 of 716 [3%]; P < .01). Incidence was similar in patients with melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer (overall, 26 of 532 [5%] vs. nine of 209 [4%]; monotherapy, 15 of 417 vs. five of 152 [P = 1.0]; combination, 11 of 115 vs. four of 57 [P = 0.78]).

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis following discontinuation of pembrolizumab in a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma: A case report and literature review [^112iPaX1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly prolonged the survival of patients and have become the preferred therapeutic option for advanced lung cancer patients. The most widely used ICIs in clinical practice are PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. However, with the increasing use of ICIs, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have also increased. Among them, checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP) is one of the rare but most severe complications. It has been reported that the incidence of CIP is 3–5% with a related mortality rate of 10–17%. Due to the lack of typical clinical manifestations and imaging features, clinical diagnosis is challenging. Additionally, the onset of CIP varies, with reports ranging from several hours to 24 months after the first use of ICIs, with a median onset time of 2–3 months after initial ICI administration. It is very rarely seen after treatment has ended.

Herein, we present a case of pembrolizumab-related pneumonitis occurring more than 2 months after discontinuation of PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. We also review the relevant literature on post-discontinuation CIP, providing insights for the early identification, diagnosis, and management of CIP following ICI cessation.

- **Burden of toxicity within first year of immunotherapy**: We evaluated the burden of toxicity during the first year after starting ICI therapy by comparing low burden (LB) versus high burden (HB) groups (see Methods). There were no statistical differences in the distributions of demographic or clinical factors between the LB and HB group, with the exception of the best response to therapy. There were significant differences in the best response to ICI between LB and HB groups, with 12.4% having PD in the LB group, versus no patients having PD in the HB group (P = 0.035).

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as the newest pillar of cancer treatment. Immune-mediated toxicities, stemming from increased activity within the T cell lineage, range from asymptomatic or mild complications to those that are fulminant and potentially fatal. Although they are of variable occurrence, cardiovascular, rheumatic, and renal immune-mediated toxicities are among the most serious of these adverse events. We present MASCC recommendations with respect to the workup and management of cardiovascular, rheumatic, and renal immune-mediated toxicities, with a focus on presentations that require treatment with immunomodulating agents.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis following discontinuation of pembrolizumab in a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma: a case report and literature review [^114Uf326]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

With the increasing widespread application of ICIs, such as PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab, in clinical lung cancer treatment, irAEs have also increased. Among them, CIP has a relatively low overall incidence rate. However, inadequate clinical awareness can lead to severe or even fatal consequences. This case report describes a patient who developed CIP following treatment with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab for lung adenocarcinoma. CIP primarily manifests as nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis and often occurs within 0.5 to 24.3 months after the initial use of ICIs, with a median onset time of 2.6 months. For this patient, CIP occurred more than two months after discontinuation of pembrolizumab, which was administered for over 26 months. Given this, a review of the literature on CIP after discontinuation of ICIs was conducted to summarize the available information.

Reports of CIP occurring after pembrolizumab discontinuation in lung cancer patients are rare. One notable case was reported by Kimura et al, in which a patient with stage IVB lung adenocarcinoma developed pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis four months after stopping treatment. Importantly, the median interval between treatment cessation and CIP onset was 4.5 months (range: 2 weeks to 24 months), and two patients experienced intermittent CIP recurrence months or even years after discontinuing ICIs. This highlights the need for clinicians to remain vigilant for recurrent CIP. Additionally, three patients with CIP also presented with other irAEs, such as hepatitis and renal dysfunction.

Regarding medical management for immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity, specifically in the context of hematological toxicity management, the ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend initiating plasma exchange according to existing guidelines. Further plasma exchange should be considered based on clinical progress, in conjunction with a hematologist, for patients experiencing grade 3–4 toxicities.

### Management of toxicities from immunotherapy: ESMO clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^11299S8P]. Annals of Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity, particularly in the context of pulmonary toxicity, the ESMO 2022 guidelines recommend the following:

- **Grade 2 immune-related ILD**: Consider initiating prednisolone (or equivalent) at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day.
- **Grade ≥ 3 immune-related ILD**: Consider initiating intravenous methylprednisolone at 1–2 mg/kg/day or an equivalent dosage.

Corticosteroids should be tapered after the improvement to below Grade 1. For Grade 2, taper over 4–6 weeks; for Grade ≥ 3, taper over ≥ 6–8 weeks.

### Managing pulmonary toxicities associated with immunotherapy: A case discussion [^114vxrcX]. The Oncologist (2019). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy has changed the field of oncology worldwide with the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for several tumor types over the last five years. However, immune-mediated adverse events can be challenging and difficult to treat, with one of the most severe consequences being immune-mediated pneumonitis.

- **Key points**: Rapid intervention and aggressive management are crucial for grade 3 or greater pneumonitis. A slow taper of steroids is recommended, along with pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis. Monitor carefully for a pneumonitis flare with steroid taper, which can occur in the absence of resuming anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy, and do not resume anti-PD-1 therapy until the patient is completely off steroids and there is no clinical or radiologic evidence of recurrence. Consider observation without resuming anti-PD-1 therapy — in this case, a durable response was maintained even without resuming anti-PD-1 therapy.

### Pulmonary adverse events following immune checkpoint inhibitors [^114KfHTv]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Pneumonitis usually develops within 3 months from pembrolizumab administration; however, more acute events have been described, particularly in patients with melanoma, with a median time of onset of only 10 days. Increased body mass index, chemotherapy, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, increased age, preexisting ILD, tumor infiltration, and obstruction of central airways are risk factors for early (less than 3 months) occurrence of pneumonitis. Pulmonary adverse events in lung cancer patients may also involve the pleura, leading in some cases to pleural effusions that may be misdiagnosed as disease relapse.

Radiological patterns of lung disease include hypersensitivity pneumonitis, acute interstitial pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, traction bronchiectasis, radiation recall pneumonitis (e.g. delayed inflammatory reaction in a previously irradiated lung parenchyma), bronchiolitis, and, rarely, acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia and lipoid pneumonia. Pembrolizumab monotherapy has been associated more frequently with acute pulmonary events, including ICI-related pneumonitis and pulmonary embolism requiring hospitalization, compared to other ICIs. Notably, only 12.9% of these events were solely pneumonitis.

In addition, the concomitant administration of pembrolizumab with other ICIs is strongly associated with thromboembolic events in melanoma and metastatic gastric cancer patients. In contrast, pneumonia due to severe immunodepression is the most common infectious complication of pembrolizumab.

### A potential mechanism of the onset of immune-related pneumonitis triggered by anti-PD-1 treatment in a patient with advanced adenocarcinoma lung cancer: case report [^113HkRZG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

With the widespread use of immunotherapy in lung cancer, the main concern is the diagnosis and management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The incidence of irAEs is approximately 66%, including fatigue, itchy skin, coughing, fever, and dyspnea, among which the incidence of immune-related pneumonitis (IRP) was between 1.4% and 5.8% in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), presenting as organizing pneumonitis, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The pathology of IRP is interstitial pneumonia, and different types of interstitial pneumonia have different mechanisms, which makes it very complicated.

This patient manifested fever, nausea, fatigue, chest tightness, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and rash all over the body. **Blood tests and bronchoscopy**: To rule out infectious diseases, we performed blood tests and bronchoscopy, including pathogen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology and pathological examination. In the first examination of bronchoscopy, the classification of BALF (right lesion) cells was mainly comprised of lymphocytes; this is consistent with published reports. The patient's blood test suggested that white blood cells and neutrophils were within the normal range. Based on the overall evidence, the patient was diagnosed with IRP, grade 2.

- **Treatment recommendations**: Guidelines recommend a dose of 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone for grade 2 IRP and 2–4 mg/kg/day for grades 3–4. We believed that the patient should receive corticosteroid treatment immediately; however, the patient was worried about side effects and refused. **Second bronchoscopy**: When analyzing the second BALF, we found that there was a difference in cell classification.

### Clinical features, survival, and burden of toxicities in survivors more than one year after lung cancer immunotherapy [^114Kwpup]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

Anti-PD-(L)1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) improve survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC). The clinical features, survival, and burden of toxicities of patients with aNSCLC alive for more than one year from ICI initiation are poorly understood.

- **Materials and methods**: We defined ICI survivors as patients alive more than one year after ICI start and retrospectively reviewed demographics, treatment, and immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Long-term irAEs were defined as ongoing irAEs lasting over one year; the burden of toxicity measures was based on the percentage of days a patient experienced toxicity. Using linear and logistic regression, we evaluated the association between demographics and disease characteristics with the burden of toxicity.

- **Results**: We identified 114 ICI survivors from 317 patients with aNSCLC. Half (52%) experienced an irAE of any grade, and 23.7% developed long-term irAEs. More ICI survivors with irAEs in the first year had never smoked (P = 0.018) or received ICIs as frontline therapy (P = 0.015). The burden of toxicity in the first year significantly correlated with the burden of toxicity afterward (ρ = 0.72; P < .001). No patients with progressive disease had a high burden of toxicity, and they experienced 30.6% fewer days with toxicity than those with stable disease. Increased duration of therapy was associated with higher odds of experiencing toxicity. Half of ICI survivors with irAEs were still receiving treatment for unresolved irAEs at the time of death or last follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: A significant proportion of ICI survivors have unresolved issues related to toxicity.

### Pulmonary adverse events following immune checkpoint inhibitors [^1138Cadz]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Background**: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment by enhancing the immune system's ability to recognize and target tumor cells. However, these agents can also lead to a spectrum of adverse pulmonary events.

- **Types of pulmonary adverse events**:
	- Pneumonitis is the most common pulmonary side effect of ICIs. It varies in presentation from asymptomatic radiographic findings to severe respiratory distress.
	- Other potential pulmonary effects include pleural effusion, bronchitis, and sarcoid-like reactions.

- **Mechanism of action**: The pathogenesis of ICI-induced pulmonary toxicity is primarily due to immune-mediated inflammation. This is a consequence of unchecked immune responses directed against lung tissue.

- **Diagnosis and management**:
	- Diagnosis is predominantly clinical, supported by imaging and sometimes biopsy, after ruling out infection or disease progression.
	- Management strategies include corticosteroids, treatment discontinuation, and supportive care, depending on the severity of the toxicity.

- **Conclusion**: While immune checkpoint inhibitors have significantly improved outcomes for cancer patients, awareness and prompt management of their potential pulmonary side effects are crucial for optimizing patient care.

### Recurrent pneumonitis in patients with melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors [^112hisjW]. The Oncologist (2019). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have changed the oncologic landscape in the past few years. Alongside impressive antitumor responses, novel immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have emerged; pneumonitis is an irAE that can potentially be fatal and necessitates proper management. No consensus exists regarding steroid treatment duration or drug rechallenge options. Our study describes the clinical and radiological course of melanoma patients diagnosed with immune-related pneumonitis that has recurred due to a rechallenge attempt or despite complete treatment discontinuation (unprovoked).

- **Materials and methods**: The study population consisted of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) monotherapy or in combination with anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4. These patients were diagnosed with immune-related pneumonitis. We explored differences in cases after clinical and radiological resolution compared to those without recurrence.

- **Results**: Nineteen out of 386 (4.8%) patients treated with ICIs were diagnosed with pneumonitis. The median age was 66 years, and 53% were male. Compared with single-agent nivolumab, patients treated with the ipilimumab-nivolumab combination presented with an earlier onset of pneumonitis (27.5 vs. 10.3 weeks, respectively, p = .015) and had higher grades of severity. After complete resolution, rechallenge was attempted in seven patients; three of them experienced recurrent pneumonitis. Three other patients experienced recurrent pneumonitis despite complete discontinuation of the drug (unprovoked).

### Diagnosis and management of pulmonary toxicity associated with cancer immunotherapy [^112Ww7sS]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pulmonary toxicity from cancer immunotherapies has emerged as an important clinical event requiring prompt identification and management. Although often referred to as pneumonitis, pulmonary toxicity associated with immunotherapy encompasses a broad and overlapping spectrum of pulmonary manifestations. Once suspected, the range of differential diagnoses of infectious and neoplastic processes can make the diagnostic process challenging for physicians. Optimal care often requires a multidisciplinary effort by pulmonologists, medical oncologists, and radiologists. Additionally, raising awareness about the possibility of treatment-induced pulmonary toxicity among emergency department and primary care physicians is crucial.

This Viewpoint provides an overview of the diagnosis and management of pulmonary toxicity arising from cancer immunotherapy. It includes a discussion on widely used treatments, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, and emerging therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis in lung cancer: Real-world incidence, risk factors, and management practices across six health care centers in North Carolina [^112fo2zU]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are standard treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer and have expanded use in small cell lung cancer. Although generally better tolerated than traditional chemotherapy, immune-related adverse events, such as immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (ICI-P), remain poorly understood toxicities that limit ICI treatment and can result in considerable morbidity. In this retrospective case-control study, we assessed a lung cancer cohort to identify ICI-P risk factors.

- **Research question**: What are the risk factors, clinical presentations, radiographic findings, and outcomes for ICI-P in a real-world lung cancer cohort? Do chronic pulmonary diseases confer increased risk for ICI-P?

- **Study design and methods**: Medical records from lung cancer patients receiving nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or combination ipilimumab and nivolumab at six centers in North Carolina were reviewed (January 2004-July 2017). Patients with ICI-P and control participants were characterized, and logistic regression was used to assess for ICI-P risk factors.

- **Results**: Three hundred fifteen lung cancer patients who predominantly received nivolumab (76.5%) or pembrolizumab (22%) were included. The incidence of ICI-P was 9.5%, with a median time to diagnosis of 52.5 days. Most patients with ICI-P had cases of high severity, and eight patients (27%) died with ongoing ICI-P treatment. Development of ICI-P was independently associated with the presence of baseline fibrosis on chest CT scan (adjusted OR [aOR], 6.61; 95% CI, 2.48–17.7).

Regarding medical management for immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity, specifically concerning the management of rheumatological toxicity, ESMO 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining the following during the initial evaluation of possible immune-related inflammatory arthritis or immune-related polymyalgia rheumatica:

- **Joint evaluation**: Joint count and analysis of synovial fluid whenever possible.
- **Diagnostic markers**: ESR, CRP, RF, cyclic citrullinated peptide, and ANA (for inflammatory arthritis).
- **Imaging**: X-rays and ultrasound of affected joints.

Regarding the medical management for immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity, with a focus on hematological toxicity, ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend administering methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 3 days. The first dose is typically administered immediately after the first plasma exchange in patients with grade 3–4 toxicities.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^113VtyXL]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

The purpose of this guideline update is to increase awareness, outline strategies, and offer guidance on the recommended management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy.

A multidisciplinary panel comprising experts in medical oncology, dermatology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, pulmonology, endocrinology, neurology, hematology, emergency medicine, nursing, trialists, and advocacy was convened to update the guideline. Guideline development involved a systematic literature review and an informal consensus process, focusing on evidence published from 2017 through 2021.

A total of 175 studies met the eligibility criteria of the systematic review and contributed to the development of the recommendations. Due to a paucity of high-quality evidence, recommendations are primarily based on expert consensus.

- **Recommendations for the management of specific organ system-based toxicities**: While management varies according to the organ system affected, in general, ICPi therapy should be continued with close monitoring for grade 1 toxicities, except for certain neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxicities. ICPi therapy may be suspended for most grade 2 toxicities, with consideration of resuming therapy when symptoms revert to grade 1 or lower. Corticosteroids may be administered as needed. Grade 3 toxicities generally necessitate the suspension of ICPis and the initiation of high-dose corticosteroids, which should be tapered over a period of at least 4–6 weeks. Some refractory cases may require additional immunosuppressive therapies.

### Immune-related adverse events in patients with lung cancer [^111F5EyR]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have been widely adopted for the treatment of lung cancer since receiving first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2015. However, along with their use, the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) has presented a challenge for both patients and oncology providers. In this manuscript, we reviewed the clinical trials that led to the approval of ICI by the FDA for the treatment of lung cancer between 2015 and 2023 to establish the frequency of irAEs in this patient population. Among the adverse events associated with ICI, we focused on the most common and relevant ones, including hypothyroidism, pneumonitis, diarrhea/colitis, skin rash, and hepatitis.

We thoroughly examined the available literature, including society guidelines concerning these complications, to discuss various aspects such as their pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnostic process, grading system, and clinical management. Additionally, we explored the association between irAEs and disease response. The management of irAEs is a crucial aspect of oncologic care, particularly due to their potential to cause severe and life-threatening clinical manifestations. We present each pertinent aspect in a concise and organized manner to provide guidance and assistance to oncology providers managing these patients in both outpatient and inpatient settings.

### Opdivo [^116EeUBc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Immune-mediated pneumonitis**: Opdivo can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, which is defined as requiring the use of steroids and having no clear alternate etiology. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in those who have received prior thoracic radiation.

- **Opdivo as a single agent**: Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients receiving Opdivo as a single agent, with the following adverse reaction grades: Grade 4 (< 0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%). Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of Opdivo in 1.1% and withholding of Opdivo in 0.8% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (61/61) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 84% of the 61 patients. Of the 15 patients in whom Opdivo was withheld for pneumonitis, 14 reinitiated Opdivo after symptom improvement; of these, 4 (29%) experienced a recurrence of pneumonitis.

- **Opdivo with ipilimumab**: In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients receiving Opdivo 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks. This included Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4%) immune-mediated pneumonitis. Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis. Immune-mediated pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of Opdivo with ipilimumab in 5% of patients and withholding of Opdivo with ipilimumab in 3.6% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% of patients with pneumonitis, and pneumonitis resolved in 72% of these patients. Approximately 13% (2/16) of patients reinitiated treatment but experienced further issues.

### Herzuma [^112soSnC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pulmonary toxicity**: Trastuzumab product use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity, including dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity.

- **Exacerbation of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia**: In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Management of toxicities from immunotherapy: ESMO clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^111PntZA]. Annals of Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity, particularly in managing pulmonary toxicity, the ESMO 2022 guidelines recommend considering bronchoalveolar lavage to rule out infection or tumor infiltration. Additionally, investigations for infection using sputum, blood, and urine cultures should be conducted if clinically indicated.

### A multidisciplinary approach for patients with preexisting lung diseases and immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicities [^112s9TkE]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

The presence of preexisting lung conditions such as ILD, COPD, aspiration, and cardiorespiratory disorders is prevalent in patients with cancer, and particularly NSCLC. The evaluation and management of these conditions while safely delivering anticancer therapy has been a long-standing challenge for medical oncologists. In the era of immunotherapy for cancer, new challenges in managing the pulmonary toxicities of ICIs in these patient populations now exist.

While awaiting prospective data and validated risk stratification tools, we propose a multidisciplinary approach to perform comprehensive clinical, radiologic, and lung functional assessment in patients with known ILD pre-ICI. Although no specific thresholds for determining the safety of ICI administration in ILD currently exist, consideration of the aforementioned factors may provide preliminary guidance regarding the suitability for ICIs and a baseline from which to monitor patients after they start ICIs. Indeed, because patients with NSCLC have a higher incidence of ICI-pneumonitis, the role for a multidisciplinary assessment pre-ICI is a thought-provoking research question. However, in the absence of known risk assessment tools, this is currently not a standard approach at our institution or others.

Challenges and areas for additional research at present include: (a) feasibility of completing the above assessments in a timely fashion pre-ICI, (b) interpreting values without clearly defined cut-off values that associate with increased risk, and (c) designing prospective studies to validate these approaches.

### Immune-related toxicity in NSCLC: Current state-of-the-art and emerging clinical challenges [^112ujMrD]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have become the standard of care for the treatment of NSCLC; however, their use brings with it the risk of a unique set of inflammatory side effects, termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The recognition, diagnosis, and management of irAEs have become essential to clinical practice, with the potential for high-grade toxicities affecting treatment decision-making. This manuscript provides a state-of-the-art review of irAEs as they pertain to patients with NSCLC by summarizing the common and severe toxicities of the standard immune checkpoint inhibitor regimens, clinical treatment settings relevant to this disease, and future directions.

### Pulmonary adverse events following immune checkpoint inhibitors [^114q9zeS]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to discuss the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer treatment, which have rapidly become a mainstay therapy. However, immune modulation resulting from checkpoint inhibition can cause inflammation in any organ system, with pneumonitis being one of the most severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs). This review examines the most recent literature on pulmonary adverse events following ICIs.

- **Recent findings**: Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of data from trials of antiprogrammed death-1 (PD-1; nivolumab, pembrolizumab), anti-PD-ligand-1 (PD-L1; atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab), and anticytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4; ipilimumab or tremelimumab) in patients with advanced cancer have explored the relative risk and incidence of lung toxicity among different tumor types and therapeutic regimens. They have shown that the incidence of all-grade (1–4) and high-grade (3–4) pneumonitis is significantly higher in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared with other tumor types. In addition, they have demonstrated that immunotherapy, especially monoimmunotherapy, has a significantly lower risk of irAEs compared to immune-chemotherapy. Treatment for lung cancer, preexisting interstitial lung disease, smoking history, and male sex appear to increase the risk for ICI-related pneumonitis.

- **Summary**: Lung toxicity is an uncommon but potentially severe and even fatal complication of ICIs. Timely recognition is critically important but challenging, particularly in patients with lung cancer, as drug toxicity can mimic disease progression or recurrence.

### Pulmonary adverse events following immune checkpoint inhibitors [^11291MBD]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Lung toxicity secondary to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment is an uncommon but potentially severe complication that usually occurs within the first few months of treatment. The use of ICIs has rapidly expanded well beyond melanoma and, with wider use and the development of a new generation of such drugs, additional adverse events are likely to ensue. Early recognition and management of ICI-related adverse events are therefore critically important. Additional studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms through which immunotherapy causes a spectrum of immune-related events.

### Incidence, risk factors, and CT characteristics of radiation recall pneumonitis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor in lung cancer [^114bbmqC]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Radiation recall pneumonitis (RRP) is a delayed radiation-induced lung toxicity triggered by systemic agents, typically anticancer drugs. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have recently been identified as potential causal agents of RRP; however, its real incidence and potential risk factors remain unknown.

Medical records and CTs of patients treated with programmed death 1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors for advanced lung cancer between 2014 and 2019 at our tertiary center, and who had a previous history of lung irradiation, were retrospectively analyzed. We identified RRP as lung CT modifications occurring in the irradiation field more than six months after the completion of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and more than one year after stereotactic body radiation therapy. Clinical and dosimetric data were analyzed to identify potential risk factors for RRP.

Among 348 patients treated with ICIs, data from 80 eligible patients were analyzed (median age, 69 years [interquartile range, 11]; 45 men). Fifteen patients (18.8%) presented with RRP. The median time between the end of radiotherapy and RRP was 450 days (range, 231–1859). No risk factor was significantly associated with RRP. ICI-related pneumonitis was associated with RRP in 33.3% of cases (p = 0.0021), developing either concomitantly or after RRP. The incidence of grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis in the RRP population was 13.3%.

We demonstrated a high incidence of RRP (18.8%) in our population of previously irradiated patients treated with ICIs for lung cancer.

### Opdualag [^1127GhXU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Opdualag can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, which may be fatal. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in those who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.7% (13/355) of patients receiving Opdualag, including Grade 3 (0.6%) and Grade 2 (2.3%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of Opdualag in 0.8% and withholding of Opdualag in 1.4% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (13/13) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 85% of the 13 patients. Of the five patients in whom Opdualag was withheld for pneumonitis, five reinitiated Opdualag after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence of pneumonitis.

Opdualag can also cause immune-mediated colitis, defined as requiring the use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate etiology. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis is diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection or reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, it is advisable to repeat the infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated diarrhea or colitis occurred in 7% (24/355) of patients receiving Opdualag, including Grade 3 (1.1%) and Grade 2 (4.5%) adverse reactions. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of Opdualag in 2% and withholding of Opdualag in 2.8% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (24/24) of patients with colitis.

### Pulmonary adverse events following immune checkpoint inhibitors [^115ApBrY]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Radiologically, ground glass and consolidation are the most common features of nivolumab pulmonary adverse events, with organizing pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis being the most commonly observed patterns. Bronchoalveolar lavage, when performed, can be helpful to exclude alternative diagnoses, mainly infection. One study has reported a lymphocytosis above 15% in most patients.

Although not evidence-based, steroid therapy is the mainstay of treatment, coupled with treatment interruption. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network provides guidance on the management of immunotherapy pneumonitis. Most patients recover or improve after treatment cessation and/or steroid therapy, with rates varying from 70 to 87%, highlighting the importance of early identification, diagnosis, and management of nivolumab-related pulmonary adverse events. Retreatment with nivolumab after the development of pneumonitis is a challenging issue and warrants further investigation regarding safety and outcomes.

### Immune-related adverse events requiring hospitalization in patients with lung cancer: implications and insights [^117QXjQS]. The Oncologist (2024). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are associated with a distinct spectrum of toxicities, yet data on immune-related adverse event (irAE) hospitalization rates and clinical course in patients with thoracic malignancies are lacking.

- **Methods**: Patients with advanced thoracic malignancy treated with ICI from February 2016 to June 2021 were retrospectively identified. Demographic and clinical data of confirmed irAE hospitalizations were extracted from medical records, and a descriptive analysis was performed.

- **Results**: From February 2016 to June 2021, 1312 patients with thoracic malignancy received ICI, whether as monotherapy or in combination with a second ICI or other agents. Out of these, 102 patients (7.7%) were hospitalized for irAEs. In most cases, treatment intent was first-line therapy (49%, N = 50), with 9% (N = 9) receiving adjuvant ICI. Sixty patients (59%) received ICI alone, 32% (N = 33) underwent chemo plus immunotherapy, and 7% (N = 7) received dual ICI. The median age upon admission was 68 years, and the median time between ICI initiation and admission was 64 days (ranging from 1 to 935 days). Pneumonitis was the most frequent indication for admission (32.3%; N = 33), followed by gastroenterocolitis (19.6%; N = 20), hepatitis (12.7%; N = 13), myo/pericarditis (9.8%; N = 10), and endocrinopathies (9.8%; N = 10). Multi-organ toxicity occurred in 36% (N = 37) of patients. Overall, 85.2% (N = 87) of patients received systemic corticosteroids, and 17.6% (N = 18) required additional lines of immunosuppression. The median length of hospital stay was 7 days (ranging from 2 to 28 days) with a 25.5% (N = 26) readmission rate within 60 days and an 11.8% (N = 12) in-house mortality rate.

In specific circumstances regarding the cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy, particularly for patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors, the ESMO 2022 guidelines recommend the following actions:

- **Initiate treatment**: Administer IV methylprednisolone at a dosage of 500–1,000 mg and colchicine (500 mcg BID). Temporarily interrupt the immune checkpoint inhibitor in patients experiencing immune-related pericarditis complicated by moderate or large pericardial effusion.

- **Perform urgent intervention**: Conduct urgent percutaneous pericardiocentesis for patients with large pericardial effusions, with or without tamponade physiology.

### Clinical features, survival, and burden of toxicities in survivors more than one year after lung cancer immunotherapy [^116UbQss]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

- **Incidence of immune-related toxicity**: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) survivors from aNSCLC experienced a total of 95 immune-related adverse events (irAEs) from ICIs. A total of 59 (51.8%) ICI survivors developed an irAE of any grade by CTCAE 5.0, with the majority being grade 1 (20%) and grade 2 (46%). The most common irAEs were pneumonitis (18%), dermatitis (11%), and inflammatory arthritis (IA) (11%). Single-system irAEs (34.2%) were more commonly observed than multi-system irAEs (17.5%).

	- For those with a single-system irAE, the median time to onset was 22 weeks, which was significantly longer than the median time of 9 weeks to onset of the first irAE for the ICI survivors who experienced multi-system irAEs (P = 0.03). Forty-three ICI survivors (37.7%) experienced chronic irAEs, most commonly IA (23%), dermatitis (18%), hypothyroidism (16%), and pneumonitis (16%). Almost a quarter (27, 23.7%) developed long-term irAEs, with hypothyroidism (26%), IA (22%), dermatitis (18%), and pneumonitis (18%) being the most common.

### Management of immune checkpoint blockade dysimmune toxicities: A collaborative position paper [^114SY5cZ]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Monoclonal antibodies targeted against the immune checkpoint molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1 have recently obtained approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and advanced/refractory non-small-cell lung cancers. Consequently, their use will extend beyond selected hospitals involved in clinical trials to many cancer centers worldwide. Despite their efficacy, these immune-targeted agents also generate immune-related adverse events (irAEs). This new family of dysimmune toxicities remains largely unknown to the broader oncology community. Although severe irAEs are rare (approximately 10% of cases with monotherapy), they can become life-threatening if not anticipated and managed appropriately.

Over the past five years, Gustave Roussy has accumulated significant experience in prescribing immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) antibodies and managing their toxicities. Collaborating with Gustave Roussy's network of organ specialists with expertise in irAEs, we propose practical guidelines to assist oncologists in the clinical care of patients undergoing ICB immunotherapy.

### Management of severe immune-related adverse events and outcomes in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors [^112r1s2x]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Although prior real-world studies have evaluated patterns of immune-related adverse events (irAE) management in community and academic settings, identifying optimal evidence-based strategies for the management of severe irAEs (s-irAEs) remains a key unmet need. The aim of this study was to evaluate the real-world incidence and management of s-irAEs that occur during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-containing therapy and to assess the impact of s-irAEs and their earliest management strategies on clinical outcomes, including real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and real-world overall survival (rwOS).

### Clinical features, survival, and burden of toxicities in survivors more than one year after lung cancer immunotherapy [^113reFXq]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

The population of lung cancer survivors with advanced disease is growing rapidly, and it is imperative to understand the long-term implications of therapy. In a cohort of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) at a single academic institution, we identified a subset of patients who survived more than one year after initiation of therapy. We termed these patients ICI survivors, for whom long-term outcomes and toxicities have not been widely reported before.

In this study, we found that half of the ICI survivors (52%) experienced an immune-related adverse event (irAE), and almost a quarter (23.7%) developed long-term irAEs. Patients who experienced progressive NSCLC while on ICI therapy were associated with a low likelihood of experiencing long-term irAEs, possibly due to the shorter duration of treatment. Toxicity in the first year of therapy strongly correlated with long-term toxicity beyond one year. Additionally, we identified that a significant proportion of aNSCLC ICI survivors (32%) had unresolved irAEs at the time of death or last follow-up, with 27% receiving ongoing immunosuppressive therapy for these toxicities. Finally, we observed that among the population that survived for more than a year, irAEs were not associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS).

This is the first study to identify the incidence, ongoing management, and burden of toxicity that patients experience over time from ICI toxicity. Numerous ICI clinical trials have reported longer-term safety data, but with limited information on the ongoing impact of toxicities.

### Evaluating survival after hospitalization due to immune-related adverse events from checkpoint inhibitors [^112FyXPK]. The Oncologist (2023). High credibility.

In this cohort, irAE-related hospitalizations occurred earlier after CPI initiation with regimens that included CTLA-4 inhibitors and with GI or pulmonary irAEs, and later with PD-(L)1 monotherapy regimens and with endocrine irAEs. The time to hospitalization after CPI initiation for the overall cohort averaged 138 days, which is similar to a population-level study of severe irAEs (148 days).

Although not statistically significant, there was a trend toward earlier irAE hospitalization with CTLA-4 monotherapy (66 days) or combination therapy CTLA-4/PD-(L)1 (85 days) compared to PD-(L)1 monotherapy (170 days). Other studies have shown that CTLA-4 therapy is correlated with a shorter time to severe irAEs. Pulmonary (mainly pneumonitis) and GI (colitis and hepatitis) irAEs had a shorter median time to hospitalization at 77 and 84 days, respectively, while endocrine irAEs had a longer time to hospitalization at 111 days.

Prior studies have shown that CPI-induced pneumonitis had a median onset of 79 days, CPI colitis around 6–7 weeks, and CPI hepatitis around 6–14 weeks. The shorter onset of all-grade colitis in prior studies compared to this study of only high-grade colitis could reflect earlier lower-grade colitis preceding hospitalization and thus presents an opportunity to prevent hospitalization with early detection. Endocrine irAEs have been shown to occur later and take longer to resolve, up to 28 weeks after CPI initiation. In this study, there was a large range of time to hospitalization for GI irAEs, with one patient experiencing a GI irAE resulting in hospitalization more than three years after CPI initiation.

### High incidence and early onset of nivolumab-induced pneumonitis: Four case reports and literature review [^1131qMNx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment with nivolumab induces a variety of adverse events, including immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which can sometimes be serious or fatal, albeit infrequent. Among them, pneumonitis is one of the most life-threatening adverse events. Four patients discussed in the present report were diagnosed with nivolumab-induced pneumonitis, mainly based on the image findings and clinical courses. All four patients had no pre-existing interstitial pneumonia as a potential risk factor for drug-induced pneumonitis. Furthermore, in statistical analyses (data not shown), there were no significant differences in clinicopathological characteristics between patients with and without nivolumab-induced pneumonitis.

In contrast, these four patients had some characteristics that were different from patients with nivolumab-induced pneumonitis in previously published reports. First, the meta-analysis performed by Nishino et al. revealed that the incidence of pneumonitis was 2.7% for nivolumab monotherapy and pneumonitis-related death was relatively rare. Another study reported that the incidence of pneumonitis associated with nivolumab monotherapy was 2.9% and 11.8% for combination therapy with nivolumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Meanwhile, four (20%) out of 20 patients who underwent nivolumab treatment in our institute developed pneumonitis (22% for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 17% for melanoma (MM), and 25% for head and neck cancer (HNC)); although the number of cases included in this study was small, a strikingly larger proportion of patients developed nivolumab-induced pneumonitis in our study than previously reported.

### Immunotherapy complications: Immune checkpoint inhibitors [^117K7fEQ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy is rapidly expanding to include a growing list of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and indications for their use in the growing population of patients with cancer. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are common in patients receiving ICI therapy and greatly varied, affecting most organ systems. This diversity of symptoms, which often mimic other disease processes, and the variable timeline of onset pose particular challenges to emergency physicians in the acute care setting. This article presents a detailed overview of irAEs evaluation and management by organ system.

### Clinical implications of bronchoscopy for immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer [^114rYfwr]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of many types of cancer. Over the past few years, indications for the use of ICIs have expanded significantly. Although the survival of cancer patients treated with such agents was prolonged, the risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), such as dermatitis, colitis, endocrinopathy, hepatotoxicity, neuropathy, and pneumonitis, has increased. ICI-related pneumonitis is one of the most common causes of ICI-related deaths.

In patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received ICI monotherapy, the incidence of ICI-related pneumonitis for all grades was reported to range from 1 to 12%. Recent meta-analyses reported that the overall incidence of ICI-related pneumonitis is 4.5%. For severe pneumonitis, the incidence is reportedly 0.8% to 1.5% for grade 3 or higher, and 0.4% for grade 5.

The diagnosis of ICI-related pneumonitis is usually based on clinical signs, including symptomatology, time to onset, and radiological patterns on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Radiographic patterns typical of ICI-related pneumonitis include organizing pneumonia (OP), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), hypersensitivity pneumonia (HP), diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), acute respiratory distress syndrome, ground-glass opacity, and non-specific patterns. Diagnosis is straightforward when the clinical picture is consistent with ICI-related pneumonitis; however, it is sometimes challenging when other possible etiologies are considered.

### Immunotherapy-induced endocrinopathies: Assessment, management and monitoring [^117Tber2]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Initiation of checkpoint therapy is often associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Multiple organs can be affected in immune-mediated reactions, including colitis, hepatitis, dermatitis, and pneumonitis, among others, while the occurrence of classic autoimmune syndromes such as sarcoidosis is also described. The majority of irAEs are manageable and reversible, although corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy may be required. However, severe life-threatening irAEs may also occur. Toxicities are graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events system, and higher-grade toxicities may necessitate withholding ICIs and administering high-dose corticosteroids until improvement is observed, followed by slow tapering of corticosteroids. These criteria were mainly developed to grade the toxicity of cytotoxic chemotherapy and may not always be relevant to long-term endocrine sequelae; for example, the criteria for different grades of hyperglycemia do not match the diagnostic criteria for diabetes.

The pathways targeted by ICIs, CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1, are known to be involved in innate autoimmunity in both thyroid disease and diabetes. It is, therefore, perhaps not surprising that blockade of these pathways promotes the development of endocrinopathy that resembles natural autoimmune endocrine disease. Furthermore, earlier attempts to modulate the immune system in cancer, through interferon and interleukin-2, have also resulted in endocrine dysfunction. However, there are also important differences in the common endocrine presentation.

### Incidence and risk factors for pneumonitis associated with checkpoint inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A single center experience [^114hgXBM]. The Oncologist (2023). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pneumonitis causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Estimates of real-world incidence and reported risk factors vary substantially.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of 419 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with anti-PD-(L)1 with or without anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Clinical, imaging, and microbiological data were evaluated by multidisciplinary adjudication teams. The primary outcome of interest was grade ≥ 2 (CTCAEv5) pneumonitis. Clinicopathologic variables, tobacco use, cancer therapies, and preexisting lung disease were assessed for univariate effects using Cox proportional hazards models. We created multivariate Cox proportional hazards models to assess risk factors for pneumonitis and mortality. Pneumonitis, pneumonia, and progression were modeled as time-dependent variables in mortality models.

- **Results**: We evaluated 419 patients between 2013 and 2021. The cumulative incidence of pneumonitis was 9.5% (40/419). In a multivariate model, pneumonitis increased the risk for mortality (HR 1.6, 95% CI, 1.0–2.5), after adjustment for disease progression (HR 1.6, 95% CI, 1.4–1.8) and baseline shortness of breath (HR 1.5, 95% CI, 1.2–2.0). Incomplete resolution was more common with more severe pneumonitis. Interstitial lung disease was associated with higher risk for pneumonitis (HR 5.4, 95% CI, 1.1–26.6), particularly in never smokers (HR 26.9, 95% CI, 2.8–259.0).

### Management of multiorgan failure caused by immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity [^115oqbgT]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Diagnosing immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can be challenging and necessitates a high index of suspicion, as they can manifest as severe complications, including organ failure and, in some cases, death. While infrequent, a comprehensive understanding of the nature of irAEs is vital to the diagnosis and management of such life-threatening toxicities. Physicians should maintain high suspicion for adverse effects due to immunotherapy, regardless of the timeline of initiation.

- **Learning points**: All medical professionals involved in the care of a patient on immunotherapy should have a high suspicion for immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Prompt treatment with the removal of the offending agent and possibly steroids should be initiated. The timing of immunotherapy can vary with the onset of adverse events; therefore, irAEs should always be considered in the differential diagnosis.

### Immune checkpoint immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer: Benefits and pulmonary toxicities [^115yvTre]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are newer, immunotherapy-based drugs that have been shown to improve survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Unlike traditional chemotherapeutic agents, ICIs work by boosting the body's natural tumor-killing response. However, this unique mechanism of action has also led to the recognition of class-specific side effects. Labeled immune-related adverse events, these toxicities can affect multiple organ systems, including the lungs.

Immune-mediated lung injury because of ICI use, termed checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP), occurs in about 3% to 5% of patients receiving ICIs; however, the real-world incidence of this entity may be higher, especially now that ICIs are being used in nonclinical trial settings.

In this review, we briefly introduce the biology of ICIs and the indications for ICI use in NSCLC and then discuss the epidemiology, clinical, and radiologic manifestations of CIP. Next, we discuss management strategies for CIP, including the consensus on the management of steroid-refractory CIP. Given the nascent nature of this field, we highlight areas of uncertainty and emerging research questions in the burgeoning field of checkpoint inhibitor pulmonary toxicity.

### New NCCN guidelines: Recognition and management of immunotherapy-related toxicity [^117JDdTf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2018). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are now FDA-approved for the treatment of eight different cancers, and more approvals are likely, including the use of these drugs in combinations. Although ICIs represent a true advance in cancer care, they can cause a range of immune-related adverse events. As more experience with ICIs is gained, more information is becoming available on immunotoxicity and optimal management. Physicians and patients need to be educated about potential adverse events and the management of ICI-associated toxicity. In recognition of the need for better information, NCCN, in collaboration with ASCO, has developed the first set of NCCN guidelines for the management of immunotherapy-related toxicities.

### Fatal toxic effects associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11488GLf]. JAMA Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are now a mainstay of cancer treatment. Although rare, fulminant and fatal toxic effects may complicate these otherwise transformative therapies; characterizing these events requires integration of global data.

- **Objective**: To determine the spectrum, timing, and clinical features of fatal ICI-associated toxic effects.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: We retrospectively queried a World Health Organization (WHO) pharmacovigilance database (Vigilyze) comprising more than 16,000,000 adverse drug reactions, and records from seven academic centers. We performed a meta-analysis of published trials of anti-programmed death-1/ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) to evaluate their incidence using data from large academic medical centers, global WHO pharmacovigilance data, and all published ICI clinical trials of patients with cancer treated with ICIs internationally.

- **Exposures**: Anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab or tremelimumab), anti-PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab), or anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Timing, spectrum, outcomes, and incidence of ICI-associated toxic effects.

- **Results**: Internationally, 613 fatal ICI toxic events were reported from 2009 through January 2018 in Vigilyze. The spectrum differed widely between regimens: in a total of 193 anti-CTLA-4 deaths, most were usually from colitis (135 [70%]), whereas anti-PD-1/PD-L1-related fatalities were often from pneumonitis (333 [35%]), hepatitis (115 [22%]), and neurotoxic effects (50 [15%]). Combination PD-1 strategies further contributed to these fatalities.

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113wuVbs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer care but are associated with unique adverse events, including potentially life-threatening pneumonitis. The diagnosis of ICI-related pneumonitis is increasing; however, the biological mechanisms, clinical and radiologic features, and the diagnosis and management have not been well defined. This research statement aims to summarize evidence, identify knowledge and research gaps, prioritize topics, and propose methods for future research on ICI-pneumonitis.

A multidisciplinary group of international clinical researchers reviewed available data on ICI-pneumonitis to develop and refine research questions. The statement identifies gaps in knowledge and develops potential research questions to expand understanding of risk, biologic mechanisms, clinical and radiologic presentation, and management of ICI-pneumonitis. Gaps in knowledge of the basic biological mechanisms of ICI-pneumonitis, coupled with a precipitous increase in the use of ICIs alone or combined with other therapies, highlight the importance of triaging research priorities for ICI-pneumonitis.

### Radiation versus immune checkpoint inhibitor associated pneumonitis: Distinct radiologic morphologies [^112y5u2a]. The Oncologist (2021). Low credibility.

The number of patients who develop pneumonitis after receiving radiation therapy (RT) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is increasing due to the expanded use of both thoracic RT and ICIs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The incidence of pneumonitis in patients with locally advanced NSCLC following definitive chemoradiotherapy and ICIs may reach up to 34%. Importantly, the treatment algorithms and natural histories differ significantly between RT‐induced and ICI‐induced pneumonitis.

Patients with RT‐induced pneumonitis are typically treated with a lower dose of steroids (40–60 mg of prednisone per day) for a shorter duration. In contrast, those with ICI‐induced pneumonitis require high‐dose steroids (1–2 mg of prednisone per kg per day) for a prolonged period. High‐grade, steroid-refractory ICI‐induced pneumonitis can develop in up to 18% of patients and may necessitate the use of intravenous immunoglobulin or other immunosuppressive agents, such as mycophenolate mofetil or infliximab.

Additionally, patients with ICI‐induced pneumonitis face a higher risk of pneumonitis recrudescence when rechallenged with ICIs, whereas this risk might be less significant in those whose pneumonitis is primarily due to RT. Thus, identifying the predominant etiology of pneumonitis after RT and ICI treatment could guide patients towards the most appropriate treatment pathway.

Despite the clinical need to elucidate pneumonitis etiology, no consensus exists on distinguishing pneumonitis origins following both RT and ICI treatments. Traditional clinical factors, such as the timing of onset and RT dose distribution, are commonly used criteria, requiring multidisciplinary input from healthcare teams.

### Tevimbra [^114bj73f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Tevimbra can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, which can be fatal. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in those who have received prior thoracic radiation.

Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.7% (113/2390) of patients receiving Tevimbra, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (1.4%), and Grade 2 (1.9%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of Tevimbra in 44 (1.8%) patients and withholding of Tevimbra in 40 (1.7%) patients.

Eighty-one (71.7%) of the 113 patients received systemic corticosteroids. Seventy-four (65.5%) of the 113 patients received high-dose systemic corticosteroids. Immune-mediated pneumonitis resolved in 48.7% of the 113 patients. Of the 40 patients in whom Tevimbra was withheld for pneumonitis, 26 (65%) reinitiated Tevimbra after symptom improvement; of these, 5 (19%) patients had recurrence of pneumonitis.

Tevimbra can cause immune-mediated colitis, which can be fatal. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies.

Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 0.8% (19/2390) of patients receiving Tevimbra, including Grade 3 (0.3%) and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of Tevimbra in 5 (0.2%) patients and withholding of Tevimbra in 40 patients.

### Incidence and risk factors for pneumonitis associated with checkpoint inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A single center experience [^113RComd]. The Oncologist (2023). High credibility.

The incidence of ICI-related pneumonitis has ranged from 3% to 5% in clinical trials. Real-world studies suggest a higher rate, with estimates of up to 19%. Our study, which employed a careful multidisciplinary adjudication approach, found an incidence of 10%, similar to other groups but higher than observed in clinical trials. For example, a meta-analysis of 20 trials of anti-PD-(L)1 therapies for a diverse array of advanced cancers found the incidence of pneumonitis was 2.7% with PD-(L)1 monotherapy and 6.6% when combined with anti-CTLA-4 therapies; the incidence of pneumonitis varied by cancer type and was higher in NSCLC and renal cell cancer.

On the other hand, a large six-center study of 315 patients with NSCLC found a real-world incidence of 9.5%, similar to our own study. Finally, a large claims-based analysis of over 13,000 patients with lung cancer found that the one-year attributable risk of pneumonitis after PD-(L)1 therapy was 2.5%. However, claims analyses may underestimate the true incidence if pneumonitis is less likely to be recognized outside of high-volume cancer centers.

Possible reasons that our incidence was higher than the earlier RCTs include our specific focus on identifying pneumonitis cases and a longer length of follow-up of up to one year after ICIs were stopped. Of note, grade 1 pneumonitis may have been underdiagnosed in our study, as imaging studies were performed based on clinical standard of care and may have differed from trial protocols. Interestingly, we found a longer median time to pneumonitis than other studies, which typically report a median time of…

### Incidence and risk factors for pneumonitis associated with checkpoint inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A single center experience [^115K5YCJ]. The Oncologist (2023). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pneumonitis causes substantial morbidity and mortality, with estimates of real-world incidence and reported risk factors varying substantially.

We conducted a retrospective review of 419 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anti-PD-(L)1, with or without anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Clinical, imaging, and microbiological data were evaluated by multidisciplinary adjudication teams. The primary outcome of interest was grade ≥ 2 (CTCAEv5) pneumonitis. Clinicopathologic variables, including tobacco use, cancer therapies, and preexisting lung disease, were assessed for univariate effects using Cox proportional hazards models. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were created to assess risk factors for pneumonitis and mortality. Pneumonitis, pneumonia, and progression were modeled as time-dependent variables in mortality models.

We evaluated 419 patients between 2013 and 2021. The cumulative incidence of pneumonitis was 9.5% (40/419). In a multivariate model, pneumonitis increased the risk for mortality (HR 1.6, 95% CI, 1.0–2.5), after adjustment for disease progression (HR 1.6, 95% CI, 1.4–1.8) and baseline shortness of breath (HR 1.5, 95% CI, 1.2–2.0). Incomplete resolution was more common with more severe pneumonitis. Interstitial lung disease was associated with a higher risk for pneumonitis (HR 5.4, 95% CI, 1.1–26.6), particularly in never smokers (HR 26.9, 95% CI, 2.8–259.0).

Pneumonitis occurred at a high rate and significantly increased mortality.

### Pneumonitis in non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint immunotherapy: Incidence and risk factors [^114H5CA9]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) is an immune-related adverse event that can occur after initiation of anti-programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for the treatment of multiple malignancies, including NSCLC. However, the incidence of CIP has not been previously examined in a population that included both trial-enrolled and non-trial-enrolled patients with advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, risk factors and other clinical characteristics associated with CIP severity are not known.

In this study, we retrospectively examined clinical characteristics, incidence, and risk factors for CIP in a cohort of 205 patients with NSCLC, all of whom received anti-programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 ICIs. Our results demonstrate a higher incidence of CIP (19%) than previously reported in clinical trials (3%-5%). Our data also suggest that tumor histologic type may be a risk factor for CIP development. We observed a wide range of time to onset of CIP (median 82 days), with high morbidity and mortality associated with higher-grade CIP regardless of the degree of immunosuppression.

Our data provide new insight into the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of CIP. Further studies are needed to increase CIP pharmacovigilance, improve risk stratification, and refine diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis and management of this potential life-threatening complication of ICI therapy.

### Tecentriq [^112og8Zo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tecentriq can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, with a higher incidence in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation.

- **Tecentriq as a single agent**:
	Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3% (83/2616) of patients receiving Tecentriq as a single agent, including fatal (< 0.1%), Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (0.8%), and Grade 2 (1.1%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of Tecentriq in 0.5% and withholding in 1.5% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 55% (46/83) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 69% of the 83 patients. Of the 39 patients in whom Tecentriq was withheld for pneumonitis, 25 reinitiated Tecentriq after symptom improvement; of these, 4% had a recurrence of pneumonitis.

In the IMpower010 study, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.8% (19/495) of patients receiving Tecentriq as a single agent, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.2%), and Grade 3 (0.6%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of Tecentriq in 2.2% and withholding in 0.8% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 63% (12/19) of patients with pneumonitis, and pneumonitis resolved in 84% of the 19 patients.
