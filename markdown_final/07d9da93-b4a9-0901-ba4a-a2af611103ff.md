## Question

Can you start allupriniol during an acute attack?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether allopurinol can be started during an acute gout flare. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical teaching and why it cautioned against starting urate-lowering therapy during flares. Then, I should verify what contemporary randomized trials actually show about early initiation versus delayed initiation. Next, I will review current guideline positions, especially the ACR 2020 and EULAR recommendations. After that, I need to check dosing strategy and the necessity of anti-inflammatory prophylaxis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and note exceptions and monitoring needs, anchoring on the highest-quality sources I can find.

> Let me first confirm the traditional view. Historically, many clinicians were taught not to start allopurinol during an acute flare because lowering serum urate can mobilize crystals and theoretically worsen or prolong inflammation; this mechanistic concern has been longstanding and is reflected in older practice patterns and some older guidelines, though I should be careful not to overgeneralize from tradition alone [^e243816d].

> Wait, let me verify what the randomized data actually show. Two small RCTs directly tested starting allopurinol during an acute flare with concomitant anti-inflammatory therapy. In the larger RCT, 57 men with crystal-proven gout were randomized to allopurinol 300 mg daily versus placebo for 10 days, with all receiving indomethacin and colchicine prophylaxis; there was no difference in daily pain scores or flares by day 30, despite rapid urate lowering in the allopurinol arm, suggesting no prolongation of the current episode with early initiation [^1d76900b]. In a smaller RCT of 31 patients, allopurinol 100 mg daily (titrated to 200 mg at 14 days) versus placebo during a flare, with colchicine prophylaxis, likewise showed no significant difference in time to resolution of the flare, again supporting that early initiation did not prolong the attack [^2f075291]. Hold on, I should also note that a febuxostat RCT during acute flares showed similar findings, reinforcing the concept that ULT initiation during a flare, when paired with anti-inflammatory therapy, does not worsen the acute episode [^f013602e].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure consistency. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline makes a conditional recommendation that, when ULT is indicated, starting ULT during a flare is acceptable if anti-inflammatory prophylaxis is provided, rather than waiting for the flare to resolve; this is a conditional recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence from the small RCTs and observational data, and it emphasizes patient-specific factors and concurrent prophylaxis [^4f057803] [^5b3e28b5]. EULAR 2016/2017 does not directly endorse starting during a flare but supports early ULT initiation with low starting doses and prophylaxis, aligning with the same safety principles even if the timing language is less explicit [^af396802] [^d59375bb].

> I need to ensure dosing strategy is correct because this affects flare risk. Guidelines and labeling consistently recommend starting allopurinol low, typically 100 mg daily, and lower in chronic kidney disease, with slow titration every 2–4 weeks toward a serum urate target, as this reduces mobilization flares and adverse effects; this "start-low, go-slow" approach is strongly recommended by ACR and EULAR and is reflected in FDA labeling [^345f2cd5] [^5a66e003] [^eac3ea81]. Hold on, I should verify the CKD nuance: ACR advises ≤ 100 mg/day and lower in CKD, and some guidance suggests 50 mg/day when eGFR is below 60 mL/min, with careful titration and monitoring, which is especially important to mitigate hypersensitivity risk and nephrotoxicity [^345f2cd5] [^6509fbb1].

> I should confirm the necessity of anti-inflammatory prophylaxis because this is pivotal. ACR strongly recommends concomitant colchicine, NSAID, or low-dose prednisone/prednisolone for at least 3–6 months when initiating ULT, as this markedly reduces mobilization flares; this is a strong recommendation and is echoed by FDA labeling advising prophylaxis during initiation [^d59375bb] [^757142af]. Let me double-check the evidence base: randomized and pooled analyses show that 3–6 months of prophylaxis cuts flare risk substantially compared with shorter courses, and a placebo-controlled RCT of colchicine during allopurinol initiation reduced flare frequency and severity, supporting this practice [^a2afff65] [^7ea3bc09].

> But wait, what if the patient is having frequent flares or has tophi or CKD — does that change the calculus? ACR recommends ULT for patients with frequent flares, tophi, or radiographic damage, and supports allopurinol as first-line even in CKD; in these scenarios, the indication for ULT is strong, so starting during a flare with prophylaxis is reasonable rather than delaying care, especially if the patient is engaged and reliable for follow-up and monitoring [^a3f9b726] [^4ef37d02]. I should also note that ACR conditionally recommends against starting ULT after a first-ever flare in most patients, which tempers initiation in low-burden disease but does not preclude starting during a flare if ULT is otherwise indicated and prophylaxis is feasible [^a8a4b616].

> I will now examine practical implementation and monitoring. Before starting allopurinol, obtain baseline labs including serum urate, CBC, liver enzymes, and creatinine/eGFR; in patients at higher risk of hypersensitivity (e.g. Asian ancestry), consider HLA-B✱5801 testing where cost-effective, and counsel patients to stop immediately if a rash develops due to allopurinol hypersensitivity risk [^757142af] [^3618fb32]. During initiation, reassess serum urate every 2–5 weeks and titrate the dose to achieve a target of less than 6 mg/dL, or less than 5 mg/dL if tophi or severe disease are present, while continuing anti-inflammatory prophylaxis until the patient is at target and flare-free for several months [^647133e7] [^d59375bb].

> Let me reconsider potential pitfalls. Early initiation without adequate anti-inflammatory coverage can increase mobilization flares, which is why the conditional recommendation hinges on providing prophylaxis; additionally, abrupt changes in urate — whether from starting or stopping ULT — can transiently increase flare risk, reinforcing the need for slow titration and consistent prophylaxis during the first months [^e243816d] [^c11e5141]. I should double-check that if a flare occurs after starting allopurinol, the correct action is to treat the flare aggressively and not stop the ULT, as stopping can worsen rebound hyperuricemia and delay crystal dissolution [^757142af].

> Putting this together, my synthesis is that yes, allopurinol can be started during an acute gout flare when ULT is indicated, provided three conditions are met: start at a low dose with slow titration, provide concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months, and monitor closely with baseline labs and periodic serum urate checks. This approach is supported by small RCTs and endorsed by contemporary guidelines, and it avoids the common pitfall of indefinite deferral that can delay disease control [^1d76900b] [^2f075291] [^4f057803] [^d59375bb].

---

In select cases, **allopurinol can be started during an acute gout attack** if anti-inflammatory prophylaxis is in place and the patient understands the risk of transient flares [^4f057803] [^5b3e28b5]. The ACR conditionally recommends starting ULT during a flare when indicated, and RCTs show no prolongation of pain or increase in flares when allopurinol is started with colchicine or NSAIDs [^1d76900b] [^2f075291]. Start low (≤ 100 mg/day, lower if CKD) and titrate slowly to a serum urate < 6 mg/dL, with prophylaxis for 3–6 months [^345f2cd5] [^5a66e003] [^d59375bb]. Avoid starting allopurinol during an acute flare without anti-inflammatory cover, and prioritize treating the flare first if the patient is unstable or has poor adherence [^526db9c4].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Randomized controlled trials show that **starting allopurinol during an acute gout attack does not worsen pain or prolong the flare** when anti-inflammatory prophylaxis is used:

- **RCT by Taylor et al. (2012)**: 57 patients with crystal-proven gout were randomized to allopurinol 300 mg/day or placebo for 10 days, with indomethacin and colchicine prophylaxis. No significant differences in pain scores or flares were observed, and urate fell from 7.8 to 5.9 mg/dL by day 3 in the allopurinol group [^1d76900b].

- **RCT by Rees et al. (2019)**: 31 patients starting allopurinol 100 mg/day (titrated to 200 mg/day) during a flare, with colchicine prophylaxis, had no significant difference in time to resolution versus placebo (15.4 vs 13.4 days; P = 0.50) [^2f075291].

- **Post hoc analysis (2024)**: In a 72-week treat-to-target trial with colchicine prophylaxis, flare risk during allopurinol initiation/escalation was similar to febuxostat, supporting safe initiation with prophylaxis [^34e29286].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Guidelines reflect this evidence and provide **conditional support** for starting allopurinol during an acute flare:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ACR 2020 | Conditionally recommends starting ULT during a flare if anti-inflammatory prophylaxis is used; start low and titrate slowly [^4f057803] [^5b3e28b5] [^345f2cd5] |
| EULAR 2016 | Recommends starting allopurinol low (100 mg/day) and titrating to target urate; does not explicitly advise against starting during a flare [^af396802] |
| BSR 2017 | Recommends starting allopurinol low (50–100 mg/day) and titrating to target urate; no explicit prohibition on starting during a flare [^287dee90] |

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

When starting allopurinol during an acute flare, **clinicians should**:

- **Treat the acute flare first**: Use colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids to control inflammation before or alongside ULT initiation [^526db9c4].

- **Provide anti-inflammatory prophylaxis**: Use colchicine 0.5–0.6 mg once or twice daily, or an NSAID if tolerated, for at least 3–6 months to reduce mobilization flares [^d59375bb] [^a2afff65].

- **Start low and go slow**: Begin allopurinol at ≤ 100 mg/day (≤ 50 mg/day if CKD stage ≥ 3) and titrate by 100 mg every 2–4 weeks to a serum urate < 6 mg/dL [^345f2cd5] [^5a66e003].

- **Monitor closely**: Check serum urate every 2–4 weeks initially, assess renal function, and watch for hypersensitivity (stop if rash occurs) [^757142af] [^0e226692].

---

## Potential risks and benefits

Benefits include earlier urate lowering, faster crystal dissolution, and improved adherence; risks include transient flares from crystal mobilization, which are mitigated by prophylaxis and slow titration [^e243816d] [^d59375bb]. Serious adverse effects (e.g. allopurinol hypersensitivity) are rare and not increased by starting during a flare when standard precautions are followed [^eb86b515].

---

## Situations where initiation should be avoided

Avoid starting allopurinol during an acute flare when:

- **No anti-inflammatory prophylaxis**: The patient cannot take colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids due to contraindications or intolerance [^d59375bb].

- **Poor adherence**: The patient is unlikely to adhere to prophylaxis or monitoring.

- **Unstable comorbidities**: The patient is medically unstable or has severe renal impairment without adjusted dosing plans [^eac3ea81].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Conditional initiation**: Allopurinol can be started during an acute gout attack if anti-inflammatory prophylaxis is used and the patient is reliable [^4f057803].

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at ≤ 100 mg/day (lower if CKD) and titrate to serum urate < 6 mg/dL [^345f2cd5] [^5a66e003].

- **Prophylaxis**: Use colchicine or NSAIDs for 3–6 months to prevent mobilization flares [^d59375bb] [^a2afff65].

- **Monitor**: Track serum urate, renal function, and watch for hypersensitivity [^757142af] [^0e226692].

- **Exceptions**: Avoid starting without prophylaxis or in unstable patients; treat the flare first [^526db9c4].

---

Starting allopurinol during an acute gout attack is **acceptable when anti-inflammatory prophylaxis is in place**, with evidence showing no worsening of pain or flares and guidelines offering conditional support. Use low starting doses, titrate slowly, and monitor closely to maximize benefits and minimize risks [^1d76900b] [^4f057803] [^345f2cd5].

### Initiation of allopurinol at first medical contact for acute attacks of gout: a randomized clinical trial [^1d76900b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Streamlining the initiation of allopurinol could result in a cost benefit for a common medical problem and obviate the perception that no treatment is required once acute attacks have resolved. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in patient daily pain or subsequent attacks with early versus delayed initiation of allopurinol for an acute gout attack.

Methods

A total of 57 men with crystal-proven gout were randomized to allopurinol 300 mg daily or matching placebo for 10 days. All subjects received indomethacin 50 mg 3 times per day for 10 days, a prophylactic dose of colchicine 0.6 mg 2 times per day for 90 days, and open-label allopurinol starting at day 11. Primary outcome measures were pain on visual analogue scale (VAS) for the primary joint on days 1 to 10 and self-reported flares in any joint through day 30.

Results

On the basis of 51 evaluable subjects (allopurinol in 26, placebo in 25), mean daily VAS pain scores did not differ significantly between study groups at any point between days 1 and 10. Initial VAS pain scores for allopurinol and placebo arms were 6.72 versus 6.28 (P = 0.37), declining to 0.18 versus 0.27 (P = 0.54) at day 10, with neither group consistently having more daily pain. Subsequent flares occurred in 2 subjects taking allopurinol and 3 subjects taking placebo (P = 0.60). Although urate levels decreased rapidly in the allopurinol group (from 7.8 mg/dL at baseline to 5.9 mg/dL at day 3), sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels did not differ between groups at any point.

Conclusions

Allopurinol initiation during an acute gout attack caused no significant difference in daily pain, recurrent flares, or inflammatory markers.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^f013602e]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is a common arthritic condition that results from monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Urate-lowering treatment (ULT) is important for patients with gout. Previous guidelines have provided conflicting recommendations on whether ULT could be initiated during an acute gout flare. Generally, ULT should be initiated after an acute flare has resolved to avoid prolongation of symptoms. The incidence of gout flares has been positively correlated with the reduction of serum uric acid (sUA) levels in the first few months after initiating ULT.

However, ULT could be initiated during an acute flare to reduce the number of outpatient treatment visits required, and hence increase patient compliance. The 2016 EULAR Gout Management Recommendations have not provided clear guidance on this. In addition, the 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the management of gout have conditionally recommended that pharmacological urate-lowering therapy could be initiated during an acute gout flare based on anti-inflammatory treatment. However, this recommendation was graded moderate based on two small randomized clinical trials and an observational study.

Two small randomized clinical trials observed that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. Febuxostat (40 mg/day) had a superior urate-lowering effect compared with limited allopurinol doses (maximum 200–300 mg/day). At present, no studies have been published regarding the initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flares. Our objective of this study was to determine whether the initiation of febuxostat during an acute gout flare prolongs the current episode.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^d097b803]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The response rate of patients with gout is about 80% within 7 days of using traditional non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with maximum 'days to resolution' being 28 days. Hence, diclofenac was continued for 4 weeks in this study. We found that initiation of febuxostat administration during an acute gout flare did not prolong acute flares, and the rate of 'treat to target' was higher in the febuxostat group. This may increase patient compliance.

Two randomized clinical trials demonstrated that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. In one of the trials, allopurinol was initiated at 100 mg daily for the first 14 days and then increased to 200 mg daily for the next 14 days. The investigators observed that the days to resolution were 15.4 days for the allopurinol group and 13.4 days for the placebo group (P = 0.05). However, the sample cohort used in the study was small (17 in the placebo and 14 in the allopurinol group), and the type of anti-inflammatory drugs used in the study increased the experimental uncertainty. In addition, the days to resolution coincided with the time it takes to spontaneously resolve inflammation during typical gout flares. In another published study, patients presenting within the first 7 days of onset of an acute gout flare were evaluated. The mean daily visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores did not differ significantly between the study groups at any point between days 1–10. However, allopurinol was initiated at 300 mg daily, which was not consistent with the recommended guidelines, and inflammation was reflected only using VAS, and not by joint swelling, tenderness and erythema.

### Allopurinol for chronic gout [^eb86b515]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is considered one of the most effective urate-lowering drugs and is frequently used in the treatment of chronic gout.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of allopurinol compared with placebo and other urate-lowering therapies for treating chronic gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE on 14 January 2014. We also handsearched the 2011 to 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts, trial registers and regulatory agency drug safety databases.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that compared allopurinol with a placebo or an active therapy in adults with chronic gout.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted and analysed data using standard methods for Cochrane reviews. The major outcomes of interest were frequency of acute gout attacks, serum urate normalisation, pain, function, tophus regression, study participant withdrawal due to adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE). We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 11 trials (4531 participants) that compared allopurinol (various doses) with placebo (two trials); febuxostat (four trials); benzbromarone (two trials); colchicine (one trial); probenecid (one trial); continuous versus intermittent allopurinol (one trial) and different doses of allopurinol (one trial). Only one trial was at low risk of bias in all domains. We deemed allopurinol versus placebo the main comparison, and allopurinol versus febuxostat and versus benzbromarone as the most clinically relevant active comparisons and restricted reporting to these comparisons here. Moderate-quality evidence from one trial (57 participants) indicated allopurinol 300 mg daily probably does not reduce the rate of gout attacks (2/26 with allopurinol versus 3/25 with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 3.52) but increases the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate over 30 days (25/26 with allopurinol versus 0/25 with placebo, RR 49.11, 95% CI 3.15 to 765.58; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 1). In two studies (453 participants), there was no significant increase in withdrawals due to AE (6% with allopurinol versus 4% with placebo, RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.08) or SAE (2% with allopurinol versus 1% with placebo, RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.48 to 7.80). One trial reported no difference in pain reduction or tophus regression, but did not report outcome data or measures of variance sufficiently and we could not calculate the differences between groups. Neither trial reported function. Low-quality evidence from three trials (1136 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily over eight to 24 weeks (21% with allopurinol versus 23% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.1); however more participants may achieve target serum urate level (four trials; 2618 participants) with febuxostat 80 mg daily versus allopurinol 300 mg daily (38% with allopurinol versus 70% with febuxostat, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.65, NNTB with febuxostat 4). Two trials reported no difference in tophus regression between allopurinol and febuxostat over a 28- to 52-week period; but as the trialists did not provide variance, we could not calculate the mean difference between groups. The trials did not report pain reduction or function. Moderate-quality evidence from pooled data from three trials (2555 participants) comparing allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily indicated no difference in the number of withdrawals due to AE (7% with allopurinol versus 8% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.26) or SAE (4% with allopurinol versus 4% with febuxostat, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.82) over a 24- to 52-week period. Low-quality evidence from one trial (65 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 600 mg daily compared with benzbromarone up to 200 mg daily over a four-month period (0/30 with allopurinol versus 1/25 with benzbromarone, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.58). Based on the pooled results of two trials (102 participants), there was moderate-quality evidence of no probable difference in the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate level with allopurinol versus benzbromarone (58% with allopurinol versus 74% with benzbromarone, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11). Low-quality evidence from two studies indicated there may be no difference in the number of participants who withdrew due to AE with allopurinol versus benzbromarone over a four- to nine-month period (6% with allopurinol versus 7% with benzbromarone, pooled RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.58). There were no SAEs. They did not report tophi regression, pain and function. All other comparisons were supported by small, single studies only, limiting conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found low- to moderate-quality evidence indicating similar effects on withdrawals due to AEs and SAEs and incidence of acute gout attacks when allopurinol (100 to 600 mg daily) was compared with placebo, benzbromarone (100 to 200 mg daily) or febuxostat (80 mg daily). There was moderate-quality evidence of little or no difference in the proportion of participants achieving target serum urate when allopurinol was compared with benzbromarone. However, allopurinol seemed more successful than placebo and may be less successful than febuxostat (80 mg daily) in achieving a target serum urate level (6 mg/dL or less; 0.36 mmol/L or less) based on moderate- to low-quality evidence. Single studies reported no difference in pain reduction when allopurinol (300 mg daily) was compared with placebo over 10 days, and no difference in tophus regression when allopurinol (200 to 300 mg daily) was compared with febuxostat (80 mg daily). None of the trials reported on function, health-related quality of life or participant global assessment of treatment success, where further research would be useful.

### Colchicine for prophylaxis of acute flares when initiating allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis [^7ea3bc09]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of colchicine to prevent acute gout flares during initiation of allopurinol therapy is widely practiced despite lack of proven benefit. We investigated if colchicine administration during initiation of allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis reduces the frequency and/or severity of acute gout flares.

Methods

Patients starting allopurinol for crystal-proven chronic gouty arthritis were randomized to receive colchicine 0.6 mg po bid or placebo in a randomized, prospective, double blind, placebo controlled trial. Subjects were followed for evidence of acute gout flares and remained on study drug for 3 months beyond attaining a serum urate concentration < 6.5 mg/dl. Treatment arms were analyzed regarding frequency of flares, likelihood of any flare or multiple flares, severity of flares on the visual analog scale (VAS), and length of flares in days.

Results

Forty-three subjects were studied. Subjects treated with colchicine experienced fewer total flares (0.52 vs 2.91, p = 0.008), fewer flares from 0 to 3 months (0.57 vs 1.91, p = 0.022), fewer flares 3–6 months (0 vs 1.05, p = 0.033), less severe flares as reported on VAS (3.64 vs 5.08, p = 0.018), and fewer recurrent gout flares (p = 0.001). Colchicine was well tolerated.

Conclusion

Colchicine prophylaxis during initiation of allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis reduces the frequency and severity of acute flares, and reduces the likelihood of recurrent flares. Treating patients with colchicine during initiation of allopurinol therapy for 6 months is supported by our data.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to management of acute flares, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend to treat acute flares of gout as early as possible. Educate fully informed patients to self-medicate at the first warning symptoms. Decide on the drug choice based on the presence of contraindications, the patient's previous experience with treatments, time of initiation after flare onset and the number and type of joints involved.

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### What is allopurinol failure and what should we Do about It? [^126e1560]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Allopurinol is the most widely used urate-lowering medication worldwide. However, allopurinol failure is frequently observed in clinical practice. In this review, we provide a framework for assessing allopurinol failure, which includes failure of allopurinol to control serum urate concentrations, failure of allopurinol to control clinical symptoms, and failure of allopurinol due to an adverse drug reaction. Understanding the causes of allopurinol failure underpins the approach required to turn failure into success in gout management.

### Serum urate during acute gout [^756de3b2]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the frequency of normal serum urate (SU) levels during acute gout in the largest studies of acute gout treatment to date.

Methods

Data collected from 2 randomized controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of etoricoxib or indomethacin for 7 days in acute gout were used to assess SU levels during acute gouty attacks. Efficacy was similar with both agents, so both groups were combined for analysis.

Results

A total of 339 patients were enrolled in the 2 studies; 94% were male; mean age was 50.5 years. At baseline, 14% of patients had a "true" normal SU (≤ 6 mg/dl) and 32% had SU ≤ 8 mg/dl during acute gout. Baseline mean SU was 7.1 versus 8.5 mg/dl (p < 0.001) in those taking allopurinol versus nonusers. Patients taking chronic allopurinol were more likely to have lower SU at baseline compared to those not taking chronic allopurinol (p < 0.001) during the acute attack.

Conclusion

A normal SU level at presentation does not exclude an acute gouty attack. In the largest studies of acute gout to date, attacks still occurred despite SU levels being below 6.8 mg/dl, the saturation level for urate. This may be attributed to persistence of tophi and an increased body uric acid pool. Additional studies are needed to determine the correlation between SU and the body uric acid pool as well as the relationship to timing of changes during acute gout.

### Gout: an update [^ffd5097a]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis caused by gout (i.e., gouty arthritis) accounts for millions of outpatient visits annually, and the prevalence is increasing. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues leading to arthritis, soft tissue masses (i.e., tophi), nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The biologic precursor to gout is elevated serum uric acid levels (i.e., hyperuricemia). Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and usually does not progress to clinical gout. Acute gout most often presents as attacks of pain, erythema, and swelling of one or a few joints in the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed if monosodium urate crystals are present in synovial fluid. First-line therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, depending on comorbidities; colchicine is second-line therapy. After the first gout attack, modifiable risk factors (e.g., high-purine diet, alcohol use, obesity, diuretic therapy) should be addressed. Urate-lowering therapy for gout is initiated after multiple attacks or after the development of tophi or urate nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the most common therapy for chronic gout. Uricosuric agents are alternative therapies in patients with preserved renal function and no history of nephrolithiasis. During urate-lowering therapy, the dose should be titrated upward until the serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg per dL (355 micromol per L). When initiating urate-lowering therapy, concurrent prophylactic therapy with low-dose colchicine for three to six months may reduce flare-ups.

### Prophylaxis for acute gout flares after initiation of urate-lowering therapy [^60cff61c]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

This review summarizes evidence relating to prophylaxis for gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published in English from 1963 to 2013 using MEsH terms covering all aspects of prophylaxis for flares. Dispersion of monosodium urate crystals during the initial phase of deposit dissolution with ULT exposes the patient to an increased rate of acute flares that could contribute to poor treatment adherence. Slow titration of ULT might decrease the risk of flares. According to the most recent international recommendation, the two first-line options for prophylaxis are low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice a day) or low-dose NSAIDs such as naproxen 250 mg orally twice a day. They can be given for up to 6 months. If these drugs are contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) might be used. Recently, reports for four trials described the efficacy of canakinumab and rilonacept, two IL-1 inhibitors, for preventing flares during the initiation of allopurinol therapy. Prophylaxis for flares induced by ULT is an important consideration in gout management. Low-dose colchicine and low-dose NSAIDs are the recommended first-line therapies. Although no IL-1 blockers are approved as prophylactic treatment, this class of drug could become an interesting option for patients with gout with intolerance or contraindication to colchicine, NSAIDs or corticosteroids.

### EULAR evidence based recommendations for gout. part II: management. report of a task force of the EULAR standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^25f55c58]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### How to prevent allopurinol hypersensitivity reactions? [^3618fb32]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is a severe and sometimes life-threatening adverse drug reaction. Although AHS is rare, the number of patients with gout requiring allopurinol is high, and there are sufficient overall cases of AHS to warrant consideration of preventive measures. Most cases occur within 8–9 weeks of commencing allopurinol, and good patient education at initiation may lead to rapid drug cessation at onset of symptoms. Pretreatment testing for HLA-B✱5801 and avoidance of allopurinol when positive reduces the risk of AHS and is cost-effective in some ethnic groups. A low starting allopurinol dose may reduce AHS risk, but the relationship between maintenance dose and AHS is more controversial. Chronic kidney disease increases AHS risk, but slowly increasing the allopurinol dose in chronic kidney disease has not been associated with AHS. Alternative newer treatments are available for patients at risk of AHS, but similar adverse reactions can also occur with these.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^2f075291]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

In a retrospective study of patients hospitalized for gout flares while receiving allopurinol (n = 59), dose reductions (or discontinuations) of allopurinol during admissions were associated with higher rates of flares in the 3 months following discharge than admissions during which allopurinol doses were unchanged or increased (53% vs 22%; P = 0.03). The primary reason provided for the allopurinol dose reductions/discontinuations was acute kidney injury, which was present in a higher proportion of this group than that of the comparator group (60% vs 36%). Patients in the dose-reduced/discontinued cohort were less likely to have received flare prophylaxis at discharge than the dose-unchanged/increased cohort (60% vs 27%; P -value not specified), which may have contributed to the observed differences in post-discharge flares.

Whether to initiate ULT during a gout flare has been evaluated in three studies that included participants recruited from EDs and inpatient settings. In an RCT, 31 participants were recruited from EDs and rheumatology clinics within 72 h of initial therapy for a gout flare and randomized to receive allopurinol 100 mg daily (up-titrated to 200 mg daily after 14 days) or placebo. Treatment for the flare was determined by the treating physician, with corticosteroids utilized in over 80% of participants. Both study arms received prophylactic low-dose colchicine. The primary end point of time to resolution of the flares was not significantly different between the allopurinol and the placebo arms (15.4 days vs 13.4 days, respectively; P = 0.50). It is of note, however, that post-hoc power calculations suggested 116 subjects per arm were required in order to have demonstrated a significant difference in this end point. Pain and physician global assessment scores declined rapidly in both study arms. As might be expected, SU levels were significantly lower in the allopurinol arm than the placebo arm at study completion (6.4 mg/dl vs 8.3 mg/dl; P = 0.012).

### Evolution of management of gout: a comparison of recent guidelines [^815e9aaa]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There have been several guidelines on the management of gout over the last decade; however, inconsistencies between them create confusion for practitioners. This review highlights areas of agreement between guidelines and discusses data where disagreements exist.

Recent Findings

For acute gout, the guidelines agree that anti-inflammatory treatment should start as soon as possible, preferably within 24hours. Older guidelines preferred NSAIDs or colchicine over steroids, but newer ones leave the choice of agent to the physician. For colchicine, all guidelines recommend using low dose. Intra-articular, oral or intramuscular steroids are all described as effective. For management of hyperuricemia, indications for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) have become more inclusive over the years by requiring lower burden of disease severity or including patient comorbidities. Probenecid has fallen out of favour with most guidelines favouring allopurinol over febuxostat. Although there is a disagreement about timing of initiation for ULT, guidelines recommend treating to target of serum urate (sUA) less than 6mg/dl, and less than 5mg/dl for patients with more severe disease. Concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis has gained strong support over the years.

Summary

Most guidelines are in agreement with recommendations for management of gout and most changes have been directional and evolutionary.

### Management of gout: a systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^5168a7c3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis in patients seen by primary care physicians.

Purpose

To review evidence about treatment of acute gout attacks, management of hyperuricemia to prevent attacks, and discontinuation of medications for chronic gout in adults.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2016, reference mining, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Study Selection

Studies of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and commonly prescribed by primary care physicians, randomized trials for effectiveness, and trials and observational studies for adverse events.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.

Data Synthesis

High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only 3 of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces long-term risk for acute gout attacks after 1 year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy, and moderate-strength evidence indicates that duration of prophylaxis should be longer than 8 weeks. Although lower urate levels reduce risk for recurrent acute attacks, treatment to a specific target level has not been tested.

Limitation

Few studies of acute gout treatments, no placebo-controlled trials of management of hyperuricemia lasting longer than 6 months, and few studies in primary care populations.

Conclusion

Colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout. Urate-lowering therapy decreases serum urate levels and reduces risk for acute gout attacks.

### Gout [^fcbd57e1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Gout is a chronic disease caused by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Gout typically presents as an acute, self-limiting inflammatory monoarthritis that affects the joints of the lower limb. Elevated serum urate level (hyperuricaemia) is the major risk factor for MSU crystal deposition and development of gout. Although traditionally considered a disorder of purine metabolism, altered urate transport, both in the gut and the kidneys, has a key role in the pathogenesis of hyperuricaemia. Anti-inflammatory agents, such corticosteroids, NSAIDs and colchicine, are widely used for the treatment of gout flare; recognition of the importance of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and bioactive IL-1β release in initiation of the gout flare has led to the development of anti-IL-1β biological therapy for gout flares. Sustained reduction in serum urate levels using urate-lowering therapy is vital in the long-term management of gout, which aims to dissolve MSU crystals, suppress gout flares and resolve tophi. Allopurinol is the first-line urate-lowering therapy and should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation. Low-dose anti-inflammatory therapies can reduce gout flares during initiation of urate-lowering therapy. Models of care, such as nurse-led strategies that focus on patient engagement and education, substantially improve clinical outcomes and now represent best practice for gout management.

5.2 Gout Flares

Gout flares have been reported during initiation of treatment with allopurinol tablets, even when normal or subnormal serum uric acid levels have been attained due to the mobilization of urates from tissue deposits. Even with adequate therapy with allopurinol tablets, it may require several months to deplete the uric acid pool sufficiently to achieve control of the flares. The flares typically become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy.

In order to prevent gout flares when treatment with allopurinol tablets is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with colchicine or an anti-inflammatory agent is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Advise patients to continue allopurinol tablets and prophylactic treatment even if gout flares occur, as it may take months to achieve control of gout flares.

5.3 Nephrotoxicity

Treatment with allopurinol tablets may result in acute kidney injury due to formation of xanthine calculi or due to precipitation of urates in patients receiving concomitant uricosuric agents. Patients with pre-existing kidney disease, including chronic kidney disease or history of kidney stones, may be at increased risk for worsening of kidney function or acute kidney injury due to xanthine calculi while receiving treatment with allopurinol tablets.

In patients receiving allopurinol tablets for the management of gout or the management of recurrent calcium oxalate calculi, monitor kidney function frequently during the early stages of allopurinol administration. Maintain fluid intake sufficient to yield a urinary output of at least 2 liters per day of neutral or, preferably, slightly alkaline urine to avoid the possibility of formation of xanthine calculi and help prevent renal precipitation of urates in patients receiving concomitant uricosuric agents.

In patients receiving allopurinol tablets for the management of tumor lysis syndrome, monitor kidney function at least daily during the early stages of allopurinol administration. Maintain fluid intake sufficient to yield a urinary output of at least 2 liters per day in adults and at least 2 liters/m2/day (or at least 100 mL/m2/hour) in pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^6577200c]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practice and barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome. To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Current perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout. Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensuring adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### An appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the management of gout [^c87d10a9]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the Management of Gout.

Recent Findings

The ACRs first clinical practice guidelines for the management of gout focus on recommendations for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to hyperuricaemia and the treatment and prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology employed assessed risks and benefits of alternative treatments for efficacy, safety and quality but not for cost-effectiveness. Novel recommendations include the use of either allopurinol or febuxostat for first-line urate-lowering drug therapy (ULT), screening for HLA-B✱5801 prior to initiation of allopurinol in Asians at relatively high risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity, and the use of pegloticase for patients with severe, symptomatic, tophaceous gout refractory to, or intolerant of, appropriately dosed ULTs. Appraisal and comparison with other guidelines using Guidelines International Network and Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) criteria showed good scores for scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, editorial independence and, overall quality, but not for applicability.

Summary

The ACR guidelines provide comprehensive, up-to-date, good-quality, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the management of gout in clinical practice but score poorly for applicability. To improve the management of gout in the community a summary of key recommendations, criteria for audit and standards of care are now required.

### Allopurinol [^757142af]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Testing Prior to Treatment Initiation

Prior to initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets in patients with gout, assess the following baseline tests: serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver function tests (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), kidney function tests (serum creatinine and eGFR).

2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares

Gout flares may occur after initiation of allopurinol tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine or an anti- inflammatory agent according to practice guidelines is recommended upon initiation of allopurinol tablets. While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol tablets in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, continue flare prophylaxis drugs until serum uric acid has been normalized and the patient has been free of gout flares for several months. If a gout flare occurs during allopurinol tablets treatment, allopurinol tablets need not be discontinued. Manage the gout flare concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Allopurinol [^eac3ea81]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Gout

The initial recommended dosage for the management of gout is 100 mg orally daily, with weekly increments of 100 mg, until a serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is reached. Initiating treatment with lower dosages of allopurinol tablets and titrating slowly, decreases the risk of gout flares and drug induced serious adverse reactions.

In patients with renal impairment the initial dosage is 50 mg orally daily with lower dose increases until serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is reached. For complete dosage recommendations for patients with renal impairment see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

The minimal effective dosage is 100 mg to 200 mg daily and the maximal recommended dosage is 800 mg daily. The appropriate dosage may be administered in divided doses or as a single equivalent dose with the 300 mg tablet. Doses in excess of 300 mg should be administered in divided doses. Monitor patients' kidney function during the early stages of administration of allopurinol tablets and decrease the dosage or withdraw the drug if persistent abnormalities in kidney function occur [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

The dosage of allopurinol tablets to achieve control of gout varies with the severity of the disease. In general, gout control is achieved with 200 mg to 300 mg daily in patients with mild gout, and with 400 mg to 600 mg daily in patients with moderate to severe tophaceous gout. Gout attacks usually become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^d109f4d6]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

To enhance usability of a DA in daily practice, it is essential to adhere to national and/or international recommendations (EULAR/ACR). The distinction in the current DA between the first-line (allopurinol) and second-line (febuxostat and benzbromaron) ULT options, advice on lifestyle changes, need for prophylaxis on ULT initiation and the role of a sUA target are all supported in national as well as international recommendations.

The development of the DA posed some challenges, especially regarding evidence-based information on the risk of flares with and without ULT. Flares, the most important indicator of effectiveness for patients, are not or inconsistently reported in RCTs and follow-up is often too short to provide meaningful data on risks and benefits for clinical care. Fortunately, observational studies on the relation between sUA and flares with and without ULT were helpful, the discussion on sUA as biomarker for gout is ongoing. An advantage of this approach was that we could 'personalise' the DA, by presenting different risk for future flares depending on the initial sUA level while keeping the relative effectiveness of ULT. Some studies suggest that febuxostat has exacerbation of acute gout flares at the start of treatment, which is less the case for allopurinol, but evidence is weak. In other words, while febuxostat is more effective in sUA target achievement compared with allopurinol at the recommended dose, this does not translate into better effectiveness on flare reduction. Yet, the relationship between sUA and gout flares is complex.

Objective

Initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in gout can precipitate arthritis flares. There have been limited comparisons of flare risk during the initiation and escalation of allopurinol and febuxostat, administered as a treat-to-target strategy with optimal anti-inflammatory prophylaxis.

Methods

This was a post-hoc analysis of a 72-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial comparing the efficacy of allopurinol and febuxostat. For this analysis, the occurrence of flares was examined during weeks 0 to 24 when ULT was initiated and titrated to a serum urate (sUA) goal of less than 6 mg/dl (< 5 mg/dl if tophi). Flares were assessed at regular intervals through structured participant interviews. Predictors of flare, including treatment assignment, were examined using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.

Results

Study participants (n = 940) were predominantly male (98.4%) and had a mean age of 62.1 years with approximately equal proportions receiving allopurinol or febuxostat. Mean baseline sUA was 8.5 mg/dl and all participants received anti-inflammatory prophylaxis (90% colchicine). In a multivariable model, there were no significant associations of ULT treatment (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17; febuxostat vs allopurinol), ULT-dose escalation (HR 1.18 vs no escalation), prophylaxis type, or individual comorbidity with flare and no evidence of ULT-dose escalation interaction. Factors independently associated with flare risk during ULT initiation/escalation included younger age, higher baseline sUA, and absence of tophi.

Conclusion

These results demonstrate that gout flare risk during the initiation and titration of allopurinol is similar to febuxostat when these agents are administered according to a treat-to-target strategy using gradual ULT-dose titration and best practice gout flare prophylaxis.

Gout — starting dose and titration of ULT — starting treatment with low-dose allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day and lower in patients with CKD [stage ≥ 3]) and febuxostat (≤ 40 mg/day) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is strongly recommended; starting treatment with low-dose probenecid (500 mg once to twice daily) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is conditionally recommended. A lower starting dose of any ULT reduces the risk of flare associated with initiation, and lower initial allopurinol doses (e.g., ≤ 50 mg/day) are noted as examples.

### How would you manage this patient with gout? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^8071efc0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued a guideline, which was followed in 2017 by one from the American College of Physicians (ACP). The guidelines agree on treating acute gout with a corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or colchicine and on not initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for most patients after a first gout attack and in those whose attacks are infrequent (< 2 per year). However, they differ on treatment of both recurrent gout and problematic gout. The ACR advocates a "treat-to-target" approach, and the ACP did not find enough evidence to support this approach and offered an alternative strategy that bases intensity of ULT on the goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks ("treat-to-avoid-symptoms") with no monitoring of urate levels. They also disagree on the role of a gout-specific diet. Here, a general internist and a rheumatologist discuss these guidelines; they debate how they would manage an acute attack of gout, if and when to initiate ULT, and the goals for ULT. Lastly, they offer specific advice for a patient who is uncertain about whether to begin this therapy.

### Implementing Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^f5a935bc]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and intervention

We performed a prospective cohort study at a large teaching hospital in South London, UK, which serves a population of over 1 million people. We evaluated outcomes after implementation of a strategy designed to optimize care for people hospitalized for gout flares, and compared these outcomes with a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients from before implementation.

The intervention package consisted of two key components: (i) an in-hospital gout management pathway (Supplementary Data S1, available at Rheumatology online), based on British Society for Rheumatology (BSR), European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) gout management guidelines; and (ii) a nurse-led telephone appointment performed 2 weeks after discharge.

The intervention was developed with extensive stakeholder input, following a systematic literature review, audit and process mapping of gout care at our hospital. The management pathway was designed as a quick-reference guide on optimal gout care for use by frontline clinicians and rheumatologists. This included recommendations on: diagnostic tests (including serum urate levels and joint aspiration); rheumatologist input; flare treatments (NSAIDs, colchicine and/or corticosteroids, where appropriate); offering ULT (allopurinol first-line) to all patients unless contraindicated; initiating ULT during the acute flare; considering prophylaxis against flares during ULT initiation and titration; admission-avoidance strategies (e.g. ambulatory care units); disease education; and post-discharge advice (including treat-to-target ULT optimization, as recommended in the BSR gout management guideline).

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to management of acute flares, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate colchicine (within 12 hours of flare onset) at a loading dose of 1 mg followed 1 hour later by 0.5 mg on day 1 and/or an NSAID (plus PPIs if appropriate), oral corticosteroid (30–35 mg/day of equivalent prednisolone for 3–5 days) or performing articular aspiration and administering intra-articular corticosteroids as first-line options for the management of acute flares.

### Improving management of gout in primary care using a customised electronic records template [^9a21d8e1]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

This quality improvement project took place within London Road Medical Practice in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, Scotland. It is a training practice in an urban area which serves a patient population of 12,722.

It is known that the management of gout in relation to SUA monitoring, allopurinol dosing, and lifestyle advice is generally sub-optimal in primary care.

The British Society of Rheumatology guidelines 2007 provide useful guidance for the management of gout. There have been more recent guidelines produced by the American College of Rheumatology in 2012 with the main difference in the latter being that allopurinol can be started during an acute flare of gout.

Several important best practice points were found within the guidelines. These included that patients with recurrent gout on ULT should have their SUA measured and should have lifestyle advice. SUA should be measured 2–5 weeks after dose adjustment of allopurinol. The target for SUA is less than 300µmol/l.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^07208b99]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

In another single-centre RCT, 57 participants recruited from EDs, wards and outpatient clinics within 7 days of onset of gout flares were randomized to receive allopurinol 300 mg daily or placebo for 10 days. After day 10, all participants received open-label allopurinol 300 mg daily. All participants received indomethacin 50 mg three times daily for 10 days and colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily for 90 days. The co-primary end point of participant-reported joint pain normalized rapidly in both study arms, with no significant differences between arms from days 1 to 10. Self-reported new or recurrent gout flares did not differ significantly between study arms by day 30 (7.7% in the early initiation group vs 12.0% in the delayed initiation group; P = 0.61), despite rapid decreases in SU levels in the early initiation group. Similarly, in a retrospective study involving patients recruited from hospital or outpatient settings, more rapid attainment of target SU levels was observed with immediate vs delayed initiation of ULT (2.5 vs 3.8 months, respectively; P = 0.004). Repeat flares occurred more frequently in the immediate commencement cohort than in the delayed commencement cohort in the 12 weeks after the initial flare, but were comparable beyond this point.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^647133e7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### Relationship between gout flare States and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^d8603dd7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Gout flares are the most important clinical feature for people who have gout. Gout flares affect just about every aspect of life including physical, psychological, social and family life. Prevention of gout flares is therefore a key goal of management for both health care providers and people with gout. Despite this, the majority of studies of urate‐lowering therapies have used serum urate (SU) as a "surrogate" measure for gout flares. However, the burden of gout flares is multifaceted and includes the number of flares as well as the severity of each individual flare. Defining the overall flare burden for people with gout has been challenging because of variable reporting and lack of a validated flares severity definition.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Flare prevention and treatment are critical aspects of gout management.
As gout flare burden increases, so does the impact of gout on the patient.
Most people commencing allopurinol are able to achieve gout flare patient‐acceptable symptom state or low disease activity in the second six months of treatment.

### Uricosuric medications for chronic gout [^dc839af2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Uricosuric agents have long been used in the treatment of gout but there is little evidence regarding their benefit and safety in this condition.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of uricosuric medications in the treatment of chronic gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 4, 2013), Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid EMBASE for studies to the 13 May 2013. We also searched the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry, ClinicalTrials.gov and the 2011 to 2012 American College of Rheumatology and European League against Rheumatism abstracts. WE considered black box warnings and searched drug safety databases to identify and describe rare adverse events.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials (controlled clinical trials (CCTs)) that compared uricosuric medications (benzbromarone, probenecid or sulphinpyrazone) alone or in combination with another therapy (placebo or other active uric acid-lowering medication, or non-pharmacological treatment) in adults with chronic gout for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted data and performed a risk of bias assessment. Main outcomes were frequency of acute gout attacks, serum urate normalisation, study participant withdrawal due to adverse events, total adverse events, pain reduction, function and tophus regression.

Main Results

The search identified four RCTs and one CCT that evaluated the benefit and safety of uricosurics for gout. One study (65 participants) compared benzbromarone with allopurinol for a duration of four months; one compared benzbromarone with allopurinol (36 participants) for a duration of nine to 24 months; one study (62 participants) compared benzbromarone with probenecid for two months and one study (74 participants) compared benzbromarone with probenecid. One study (37 participants) compared allopurinol with probenecid. No study was completely free from bias. Low-quality evidence from one study (55 participants) comparing benzbromarone with allopurinol indicated uncertain effects in terms of frequency of acute gout attacks (4% with benzbromarone versus 0% with allopurinol; risk ratio (RR) 3.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 84.13), while moderate-quality evidence from two studies (101 participants; treated for four to nine months) indicated similar proportions of participants achieving serum urate normalisation (73.9% with benzbromarone versus 60% with allopurinol; pooled RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.79). Low-quality evidence indicated uncertain differences in withdrawals due to adverse events (7.1% with benzbromarone versus 6.1% with allopurinol; pooled RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.28 to 5.62), and total adverse events (20% with benzbromarone versus 6.7% with allopurinol; RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.64 to 14.16). The study did not measure pain reduction, function and tophus regression. When comparing benzbromarone with probenecid, there was moderate-quality evidence based on one study (62 participants) that participants taking benzbromarone were more likely to achieve serum urate normalisation after two months (81.5% with benzbromarone versus 57.1% with probenecid; RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.00). This indicated that when compared with probenecid, five participants needed to be treated with benzbromarone in order to have one additional person achieve serum urate normalisation (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5). However, the second study reported no difference in the absolute decrease in serum urate between these groups after 12 weeks. Low-quality evidence from two studies (129 participants) indicated uncertain differences between treatments in the frequency of acute gout attacks (6.3% with benzbromarone versus 10.6% with probenecid; pooled RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.09 to 5.83); fewer withdrawals due to adverse events with benzbromarone (2% with benzbromarone versus 17% with probenecid; pooled RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.79, NNTB 7) and fewer total adverse events (21% with benzbromarone versus 47% with probenecid; pooled RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.74; NNTB 4). The studies did not measure pain reduction, function and tophus regression. Low-quality evidence based on one small CCT (37 participants) indicated uncertainty around the difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks between probenecid and allopurinol after 18 to 20 months' treatment (53% with probenecid versus 55% with allopurinol; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.75). The study did not measure or report the proportion achieving serum urate normalisation, pain reduction, function, tophus regression, withdrawal due to adverse events and total adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

There was moderate-quality evidence that there is probably no important difference between benzbromarone and allopurinol at achieving serum urate normalisation, but that benzbromarone is probably more successful than probenecid at achieving serum urate normalisation in people with gout. There is some uncertainty around the effect estimates, based on low-quality evidence from only one or two trials, on the number of acute gout attacks, the number of withdrawals due to adverse events or the total number of participants experiencing adverse events when comparing benzbromarone with allopurinol. However, when compared with probenecid, benzbromarone resulted in fewer withdrawals due to adverse events and fewer participants experiencing adverse events. Low-quality evidence from one small study indicated uncertain effects in the incidence of acute gout attacks when comparing probenecid with allopurinol therapy. We downgraded the evidence because of a possible risk of performance and other biases and imprecision.

### Treating to target: a strategy to cure gout [^84e0df15]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute gout attacks and the long-term complications of gout are associated with the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) monohydrate crystals in the joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. The aim of long-term treatment is to reduce the serum urate (sUA) level to 6 mg/dl (≤ 360 micromol/l), below the saturation point of MSU, so that new crystals cannot form and existing crystals are dissolved. Serial joint aspiration studies confirmed the disappearance of crystals with effective urate-lowering therapy. There is good evidence that achieving sUA < 6 mg/dl (360 micromol/l) results in freedom from acute gout attacks, and shrinkage and eventual disappearance of tophi. Gout patients must be informed about their diagnosis and educated about gout management including the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Patients starting urate-lowering therapy need to understand the importance of prophylactic therapy with colchicine or NSAIDs to reduce the risk of 'mobilization flares' in the first few months. In the long term, reduction in the sUA below the target level will result in gout being effectively cured.

Methods

Study design and participants

This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded, multicentre study conducted from June 2018 to November 2019 (trial registration: chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR1800015962). This study was approved by the Institutional Medical Ethics Committee of the Fourth Clinical Medical College of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. Informed written consent was obtained from all study participants. Patients were blinded and enrolled from three Chinese hospitals. Male and female patients, 18–70 years of age, with an onset of acute gout flares within 72 h were enrolled. These patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for acute arthritis of gout. Patient exclusion criteria were as follows: secondary gout (chronic kidney disease, blood disorders, etc.), a history of congestive heart failure, anticoagulant use, presence of gastrointestinal ulcers, patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) of < 50 mL/min, aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST/ALT) or alkaline phosphatase levels > 1.25 times the upper limit of normal, or patients who were administered steroids, colchicine, allopurinol, uricosuric drugs, chemotherapy, or immunosuppressive therapy in the past 3 months.

### Frequency and predictors of inappropriate management of recurrent gout attacks in a longitudinal study [^3d223886]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the patterns and determinants of medication use during recurrent gout attacks.

Methods

We followed participants with documented gout in an online prospective case-crossover study. During an attack, subjects were asked if they had consulted a physician for the attack and what medications they were using. Definitely inappropriate therapy was defined as use of allopurinol or a uricosuric agent acutely without having used it as a prophylactic. Potentially inappropriate therapy was defined as use of analgesics alone, alternative remedies, or no medications. We estimated the risk of having ≥ 1 attack in 1 year using life table methods. We examined the relation of various risk factors to the risk of inappropriate therapy using Poisson regression.

Results

Among 232 participants (mean age 52 yrs, 81% male) with documented gout, the risk of having ≥ 1 attack in a year was 69%. One hundred ten participants consulted a physician for each attack, 49 did so for only some attacks, while 43 never consulted a physician for any attack. Fifty-three participants had definitely (n = 10) or potentially (n = 43) inappropriate therapy for their recurrent attacks. Physician consultation for an attack was associated with increased risk of inappropriate therapy (risk ratio, RR, 2.5, p = 0.006), whereas an increasing number of gout attacks was associated with lower risk of inappropriate therapy (RR 0.8, p = 0.01).

Conclusion

Given the high risk of recurrent attacks and the substantial number of persons whose attacks are not appropriately managed, further education about management of gout attacks for both patients and physicians may be warranted.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^d95935e3]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares: colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/l (5–6 mg/dl), to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend initiation of ULT during flares, rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the USA between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100 000 adults, respectively; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100 000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100 000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from RA. There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years on a background of an ageing population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome; the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics and inpatient settings, and only a minority of patients achieve the SU levels required to prevent flares.

Hospital admissions provide a unique opportunity to engage patients in shared decision-making and begin the process of establishing optimal ULT. What is not known is how best to implement evidence-based treatments during hospitalizations for gout. Such strategies are essential if the rising number of gout admissions is to be countered. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in patients hospitalized with gout.

### Gout and hyperuricemia [^15096b64]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Gout continues to be a health problem around the world despite the availability of effective therapies. Although the prevalence is influenced by genetic factors, the associations of alcohol consumption, obesity, and hypertension appear to be partially responsible for the increased prevalence of gout and hyperuricemia in African and Oriental countries. The association between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular disease seems linked to insulin resistance. This relation, in part, explains the common coexistence of hyperlipidemia and glucose intolerance in patients with gout. Accordingly, it is recommended that one pay more attention to dietary manipulation in patients with gout in addition to managing hypertension, obesity, and other medical problems. Although acute gout attacks can be treated, eliminating gout requires effective removal of urate from the body. Allopurinol remains a dominant urate-lowering agent, however its use may be limited by allergic reactions. Uricosuric agents are also effective urate-lowering agents and provide an alternative to allopurinol. Strategies to treat patients who are sensitive to allopurinol continue to evolve.

ALLOPURINOL- allopurinol tablet Advanced Rx of Tennessee, LLC ----------. These reactions occur in approximately 5 in 10, 000 patients taking allopurinol. Other serious hypersensitivity reactions that have been reported include exfoliative, urticarial and purpuric lesions, generalized vasculitis, and irreversible hepatotoxicity. Discontinue allopurinol permanently at the first appearance of skin rash or other signs which may indicate a hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue allopurinol immediately if a skin rash develops. Instruct patients to stop taking allopurinol immediately and seek medical attention promptly if they develop a rash. Gout flares have been reported during initiation of treatment with allopurinol, even when normal or subnormal serum uric acid levels have been attained due to the mobilization of urates from tissue deposits.

Even with adequate therapy with allopurinol, it may require several months to deplete the uric acid pool sufficiently to achieve control of the flares. The flares typically become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy. Treatment with allopurinol may result in acute kidney injury due to formation of xanthine calculi or due to precipitation of urates in patients receiving concomitant uricosuric agents. Patients with pre-existing kidney disease, including chronic kidney disease or history of kidney stones, may be at increased risk for worsening of kidney function or acute kidney injury due to xanthine calculi while receiving treatment with allopurinol. Myelosuppression, manifested by anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, has been reported in patients receiving allopurinol. The cytopenias have occurred as early as 6 weeks up to 6 years after the initiation of therapy of allopurinol.

Concomitant use of allopurinol with cytotoxic drugs associated with myelosuppression may increase the risk of myelosuppression. Monitor blood counts more frequently when cytotoxic drugs are used concomitantly. Most Common Adverse Reactions Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, nausea, alkaline phosphatase increase, AST/ALT increase. Metabolic and Nutritional: Acute attacks of gout. Skin and Appendages: Rash, maculopapular rash. Less Common Adverse Reactions.

### Gout: will the "King of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured? [^189a75ce]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines, treat-to-target serum urate, and new drugs for gout

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but one that has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL, namely (1) associated benefits of reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target; (2) the fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL; and (3) the use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome in gout randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the drug approval of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) by the regulatory authorities. Since there is no way to achieve the sUA target without monitoring or reassessing sUA, rheumatologists monitor sUA and aim for an sUA target level of less than 6 mg/dL. Therapeutic doses of allopurinol (100–800 mg/day) or febuxostat (40–80 mg/day) or a combination with uricosurics is often needed to achieve target sUA. Allopurinol maximum dose need not be reduced, even in the presence of renal failure, since adverse events are related to initial, and not final, allopurinol dose; pegloticase is another option. Appropriately titrated ULT doses can help achieve a near cure for gout by resolving all urate crystals.

### Effect of prophylaxis on gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy: analysis of data from three phase III trials [^a2afff65]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), such as febuxostat or allopurinol, is recommended for the long-term management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout to reduce the incidence of acute flares. Because of the paradoxical relationship between early use of ULT and the increased incidence of gout flares, prophylaxis with either low-dose colchicine or NSAIDs has been recommended, although there have been concerns about the long-term prophylactic use of these agents.

Objectives

The present analysis examined flare rates during the 3 Phase III trials of febuxostat based on mean postbaseline serum urate (sUA) concentrations and duration of prophylaxis. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by prophylaxis with colchicine or naproxen.

This investigator-initiated, post hoc reanalysis of data on gout flares from the 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase III trials evaluated the proportion of patients requiring treatment for gout flares at 4-week intervals based on mean postbaseline sUA concentrations < 6.0 and ≥ 6.0 mg/dL. The 3 trials enrolled males or females aged 18–85 years who had a diagnosis of gout and a baseline sUA concentration ≥ 8.0 mg/dL. Patients received ULT (febuxostat or allopurinol) or placebo for 6 months or 1 year and flare prophylaxis with colchicine 0.6 mg/d or naproxen 250 mg BID for 8 weeks or 6 months. The prophylactic regimen was chosen at the discretion of the investigator, based on renal function and known intolerance to either drug. Patients with an estimated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min were not to receive naproxen. AEs were summarized based on prophylaxis with colchicine or naproxen.

Results

The 3 trials enrolled a total of 4101 patients with gout. The majority were white (80.1%), male (94.5%), and obese (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) (62.8%). The mean duration of gout ranged from 10.9–11.9 years, and the mean baseline sUA concentration ranged from 9.6–9.9 mg/dL. Flare rates increased sharply (up to 40%) at the end of 8 weeks of prophylaxis and then declined gradually, whereas flare rates were consistently low (range, 3%-5%) at the end of 6 months of prophylaxis. Mean postbaseline sUA concentrations were correlated with flare rates; by the end of each study, patients with a mean postbaseline sUA concentration < 6.0 mg/dL had fewer flares than did those with a mean postbaseline sUA concentration ≥ 6.0 mg/dL. There were differences in rates of AEs between prophylaxis groups, but the rates did not increase with increased duration of prophylaxis.

Conclusion

This analysis of gout flare data from the 3 Phase III trials of febuxostat found that flare prophylaxis for up to 6 months during the initiation of ULT appeared to provide greater benefit than flare prophylaxis for 8 weeks, with no increase in AEs.

### Probenecid [^64c98991]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Gout:

Therapy with probenecid should not be started until an acute gouty attack has subsided. However, if an acute attack is precipitated during therapy, probenecid may be continued without changing the dosage, and full therapeutic dosage of colchicine, or other appropriate therapy, should be given to control the acute attack.

The recommended adult dosage is 250 mg (½ probenecid tablet), twice a day for one week, followed by 500 mg (1 tablet) twice a day thereafter.

Some degree of renal impairment may be present in patients with gout. A daily dosage of 1000 mg may be adequate. However, if necessary, the daily dosage may be increased by 500 mg increments every 4 weeks within tolerance (and usually not above 2000 mg per day) if symptoms of gouty arthritis are not controlled or the 24 hour uric acid excretion is not above 700 mg. As noted, probenecid may not be effective in chronic renal insufficiency particularly when the glomerular filtration rate is 30 mg mL/minute or less.

Gastric intolerance may be indicative of over dosage, and may be corrected by decreasing the dosage.

As uric acid tends to crystallize out of an acid urine, a liberal fluid intake is recommended, as well as sufficient sodium bicarbonate (3 to 7.5 g daily), or potassium citrate (7.5 g daily) to maintain an alkaline urine (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Relationship between gout flare States and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^ed520a7d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Post hoc analyses of the 12‐month "Is colchicine prophylaxis required with start‐low go‐slow allopurinol dose escalation in gout?" noninferiority randomized controlled trial were undertaken (ACTRN 12618001179224). Detailed methods and results of the full trial have been reported previously. In brief, this was a one‐year double‐masked placebo‐controlled noninferiority trial with participants randomized 1:1 to colchicine 0.5 mg daily or placebo for the first six months. All participants were required to have at least one gout flare in the preceding six months. All participants commenced allopurinol, increasing monthly to achieve target urate < 0.36 mmol/L. The starting dose of allopurinol was 50 mg daily in those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 mand 100 mg daily in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Allopurinol dose was increased monthly by 50 mg daily in those with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 100 mg daily in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 until serum urate was < 0.36 mmol/L for three consecutive visits. Ethical approval was obtained from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee, New Zealand (18/STH/156), and all participants provided written informed consent.

Participants were seen every three months by study coordinators with intervening monthly telephone assessments. Gout flares, defined as self‐reported gout flares requiring treatment were recorded at each assessment. Participants were categorized into three disease burden states at month 6 and month 12 as follows: (i) PASS, no gout flares in the preceding six months; (ii) LDA, one flare in the preceding six months; and (iii) non‐LDA/PASS, more than one gout flare in the preceding six months. Participants were also classified into these three disease states based on the whole 12‐month study period. The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), EuroQol‐5D‐3L (EQ‐5D‐3L) questionnaire, and the gout‐specific brief illness perception questionnaire (BIPQ)were collected at months 0, 6, and 12.

### Discordant American College of Physicians and international rheumatology guidelines for gout management: consensus statement of the gout, hyperuricemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) [^af19a095]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines and examine possible reasons for discordance between them. The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, and evidence from clinical experience and clinical trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based and promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits, is promoted by the ACR, EULAR and 3e Initiative recommendations. By contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent, recurrent flares or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary end point are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near term future.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^c1ebc32e]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

Recent Findings

Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade including those from the British Rheumatism Society; the European League Against Rheumatism; the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative; the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism; the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. However, despite the extant guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations and uptake have been slow and initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate is infrequent. Greater education in proper management as well as increased awareness of new treatment strategies appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management as well as areas for further research.

Summary

Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers are struggling with appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### Safety profile of anti-gout agents: an update [^6d58a487]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent interest in gout has led to development of new drugs for acute gout and long-term urate-lowering, as well as interest in improving the use of older drugs. The patients' comorbidities and concomitant medications may contribute to the risk of adverse drug reactions with anti-gout therapies. This review will highlight recent data on the safety of drugs used in gout.

Recent Findings

Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index, and low doses are effective with less gastrointestinal toxicity. There are significant interactions between colchicine and CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors, and the colchicine dose must be reduced. Allopurinol and febuxostat have similar adverse effect profiles. Recent data have highlighted the risk association of HLA-B5801 in some ethnic groups and of allopurinol starting dose in allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome. Further long-term cardiovascular safety data in patients with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors receiving febuxostat and allopurinol are pending. Infusion reactions are common in patients receiving pegloticase, particularly in patients with pre-infusion serum urate above 0.36mmol/l (6mg/dl).

Summary

In general, treatments for gout are well tolerated, although clinicians must keep in mind the potential for drug interactions and the contribution of comorbidities to the potential for adverse effects with gout therapies.

### Predicting gout flares in people starting allopurinol using the start-low Go-slow dose escalation strategy [^f89f9331]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The study objective was to determine predictors of gout flare when commencing allopurinol using the "start-low go-slow" dose escalation strategy.

Methods

A post hoc analysis of a 12-month double-blind placebo-controlled noninferiority trial with participants randomized 1:1 to colchicine 0.5 mg daily or placebo for the first six months was undertaken. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify independent predictors of gout flares in the first and last six months of the trial.

Results

Multivariable analysis revealed a significant association between risk of a gout flare in the first six months and flare in the month before starting allopurinol (odds ratio [OR] 2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36–5.17) and allopurinol 100 mg starting dose (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.41–7.27). The predictors of any gout flares in the last six months of the trial, after stopping colchicine or placebo, were having received colchicine (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.48–5.86), at least one flare in the month before stopping study drug (OR 5.39, 95% CI 2.21–13.15), and serum urate ≥ 0.36 mmol/L at month 6 (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.14–7.12).

Conclusion

Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis when starting allopurinol using the "start-low go-slow" dose escalation strategy may be best targeted at those who have had a gout flare in the month before starting allopurinol and are commencing allopurinol 100 mg daily. For those with ongoing gout flares during the first six months of starting allopurinol who have not yet achieved serum urate target, a longer period of prophylaxis may be required.

### Long-term cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared with allopurinol in patients with gout (FAST): a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^362f81ea]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Febuxostat and allopurinol are urate-lowering therapies used to treat patients with gout. Following concerns about the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat, the European Medicines Agency recommended a post-licensing study assessing the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared with allopurinol.

Methods

We did a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, non-inferiority trial of febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients with gout in the UK, Denmark, and Sweden. Eligible patients were 60 years or older, already receiving allopurinol, and had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Those who had myocardial infarction or stroke in the previous 6 months or who had severe congestive heart failure or severe renal impairment were excluded. After a lead-in phase in which allopurinol dose was optimised towards achieving a serum urate concentration of less than 0·357 mmol/L (< 6 mg/dL), patients were randomly assigned (1:1, with stratification according to previous cardiovascular events) to continue allopurinol (at the optimised dose) or start febuxostat at 80 mg/day, increasing to 120 mg/day if necessary to achieve the target serum urate concentration. The primary outcome was a composite of hospitalisation for non-fatal myocardial infarction or biomarker-positive acute coronary syndrome; non-fatal stroke; or cardiovascular death. The hazard ratio (HR) for febuxostat versus allopurinol in a Cox proportional hazards model (adjusted for the stratification variable and country) was assessed for non-inferiority (HR limit 1·3) in an on-treatment analysis. This study is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2011-001883-23) and ISRCTN (ISRCTN72443728) and is now closed.

Findings

From Dec 20, 2011, to Jan 26, 2018, 6128 patients (mean age 71·0 years [SD 6·4], 5225 [85·3%] men, 903 [14·7%] women, 2046 [33·4%] with previous cardiovascular disease) were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive allopurinol (n = 3065) or febuxostat (n = 3063). By the study end date (Dec 31, 2019), 189 (6·2%) patients in the febuxostat group and 169 (5·5%) in the allopurinol group withdrew from all follow-up. Median follow-up time was 1467 days (IQR 1029–2052) and median on-treatment follow-up was 1324 days (IQR 870–1919). For incidence of the primary endpoint, on-treatment, febuxostat (172 patients [1·72 events per 100 patient-years]) was non-inferior to allopurinol (241 patients [2·05 events per 100 patient-years]; adjusted HR 0·85 [95% CI 0·70–1·03], p < 0·0001). In the febuxostat group, 222 (7·2%) of 3063 patients died and 1720 (57·3%) of 3001 in the safety analysis set had at least one serious adverse event (with 23 events in 19 [0·6%] patients related to treatment). In the allopurinol group, 263 (8·6%) of 3065 patients died and 1812 (59·4%) of 3050 had one or more serious adverse events (with five events in five [0·2%] patients related to treatment). Randomised therapy was discontinued in 973 (32·4%) patients in the febuxostat group and 503 (16·5%) patients in the allopurinol group.

Interpretation

Febuxostat is non-inferior to allopurinol therapy with respect to the primary cardiovascular endpoint, and its long-term use is not associated with an increased risk of death or serious adverse events compared with allopurinol.

### Increased risk of cardiovascular events and death in the initial phase after discontinuation of febuxostat or allopurinol: another story of the CARES trial [^06fb4969]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Febuxostat is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase that has been developed to treat patients who have an insufficient response or intolerance to allopurinol. However, the adverse cardiovascular (CV) effects of febuxostat have been a concern throughout its development, and the Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat or Allopurinol in Patients with Gout (CARES) trial was performed as a requirement by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with gout and major CV disease. The CARES trial suggested that the incidence of CV death was higher in the febuxostat group than in the allopurinol group. Consequently, the FDA added a boxed warning to febuxostat regarding the increased mortality risk. However, the urate-lowering efficacy and safety of febuxostat in the treatment of the hyperuricemia of gout (CONFIRMS) trial and the Long-term cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared with allopurinol in patients with gout (FAST) trial demonstrated that febuxostat was not associated with an increased risk of death or serious adverse CV events compared with allopurinol. In addition, the risk of CV events and mortality between patients treated with febuxostat and allopurinol were similar in the subsequent nationwide retrospective cohort studies. Thus, the higher risk of CV events and mortality from febuxostat than from allopurinol remains controversial.

Regarding the increased risk of CV mortality associated with febuxostat in the CARES trial, there are previous studies that reanalysed the CARES trial data to calculate the mortality rates on the basis of the median duration of exposure to study drugs (table S12 of the previous work). In our reanalysis, a 40-fold increase in mortality was observed after allopurinol or febuxostat was discontinued. The sharp increase in mortality was thought to be associated with rapid changes in the serum uric acid levels because of the drug discontinuation (rebound hyperuricaemia), which is a known risk factor for acute gout attacks. Accordingly, we hypothesised that some CV events may share the same mechanism as those of acute gout attacks (acute inflammation induced by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the CV system).

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Allopurinol tablets are indicated for:

The management of adults with signs and symptoms of primary or secondary gout (acute attacks, tophi, joint destruction, uric acid lithiasis, and/or nephropathy)
The management of adult and pediatric patients with leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumor malignancies who are receiving cancer therapy which causes elevations of serum and urinary uric acid levels
The management of adult patients with recurrent calcium oxalate calculi whose daily uric acid excretion exceeds 800 mg/day in male patients and 750 mg/day in female patients, despite lifestyle changes (such as reduction of dietary sodium, non-dairy animal protein, oxylate rich foods, refined sugars and increases in oral fluids and fruits and vegetables)

### Febuxostat: a new treatment for hyperuricaemia in gout [^8f925bc0]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Febuxostat is a new non-purine xanthine oxidase inhibitor that is more potent than allopurinol 300 mg daily. In two Phase III trials, significantly more febuxostat-treated gout patients met the primary endpoint [serum urate (sUA) < 6 mg/dl (< 360 mumol/l) at the last three visits] (48 and 53% with 80 mg; 65 and 62% with 120 mg), compared with those receiving allopurinol 300 mg (22 and 21%; P < 0.001 in both studies). Febuxostat was more effective than allopurinol in the subset with impaired renal function; no dose adjustment is required in mild-to-moderate renal impairment. Long-term extension studies confirmed the efficacy and tolerability of febuxostat. In patients who achieved the sUA target of 6 mg/dl (360 mumol/l), the incidence of gout flares fell steadily and tophi resolved in many patients. The incidence of adverse events such as dizziness, diarrhoea, headache and nausea with febuxostat was similar to allopurinol. The incidence of cardiovascular side-effects (Antiplatelet Trialists Collaboration events) was numerically higher with febuxostat than with allopurinol, but this was not statistically significant. Co-administration of febuxostat with AZA or 6-mercaptopurine is not recommended. Prophylaxis (colchicine and/or NSAIDs) against acute attacks should be used for at least the first 6 months, since early mobilization flares were observed in the clinical trials. In conclusion, febuxostat is more effective than allopurinol 300 mg daily in reducing sUA levels < 6 mg/dl (360 mumol/l), the target recommended by EULAR, and offers a new option for the long-term treatment of gout.

### Comparative effectiveness of allopurinol and febuxostat in gout management [^1f442c57]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The relative efficacy and safety of allopurinol and febuxostat when used according to current guidelines for the treatment of hyperuricemia are unknown. This double-blind noninferiority trial examined these issues.

Methods

Participants with gout and hyperuricemia (with at least 33% having stage 3 chronic kidney disease) were randomly assigned to allopurinol or febuxostat in this 72-week trial, with doses titrated to target serum urate. The trial had three phases: titration (weeks 0 to 24), maintenance (weeks 25 to 48), and observation (weeks 49 to 72). Allopurinol and febuxostat were initiated at daily doses of 100 and 40 mg, with maximum titration to 800 and 120 mg, respectively. Antiinflammatory prophylaxis was given during phases 1 and 2. The primary end point was the proportion of patients experiencing one or more flares during phase 3, with a prespecified noninferiority margin of less than 8 percentage points between allopurinol and febuxostat. Secondary end points included efficacy in patients with chronic kidney disease, proportion achieving target serum urate levels, and serious adverse events.

Results

This study included 940 participants; 20.1% withdrew, with similar proportions in treatment arms. During phase 3, 36.5% of allopurinol-treated participants had one flare or more compared with 43.5% of febuxostat-treated participants (P < 0.001 for noninferiority). Overall, 80% of participants achieved mean target urates during phase 2 with no differences by treatment. There were no treatment differences (including cardiovascular events) in serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Allopurinol and febuxostat achieved serum urate goals in patients with gout; allopurinol was noninferior to febuxostat in controlling flares. Similar outcomes were noted in participants with stage 3 chronic kidney disease.

MSU crystals in the vasculature and CV gout attacks

Recent studies with dual-energy CT (DECT) have demonstrated the deposition of MSU crystals in the vasculature of 86%–88% of patients with gout, while MSU crystals have also been observed in the coronary arteries, aortic plaques and various tissues.

Since inflammation in the vasculature is known to trigger plaque rupture, it is likely that inflammation in the blood vessels can cause CV events. A sudden change in serum uric acid levels as a result of the withdrawal or initiation of allopurinol or febuxostat, or other risk factors for acute gout attacks, could induce the formation of MSU crystals in the blood vessels. It is thought that MSU crystals might cause acute inflammation in the blood vessels as well as intermittent gout attacks in the joints, resulting in plaque rupture and CV events (CV gout attacks). Therefore, a situation in which a gout attack is triggered might also trigger CV gout attacks; this could explain the increase in CV events and mortality after discontinuation of allopurinol and febuxostat in this reanalysis of the CARES trial, as well as the sudden increase in CV events before and after the initiation of allopurinol and febuxostat in a nationwide cohort from our other study. Furthermore, higher MACE risk after drug discontinuation was observed on increasing levels of the difference between baseline and last measured uric acid levels prior to drug discontinuation. This difference may act as a surrogate marker for the degree of rebound hyperuricaemia. Considering the fact that uric acid levels increase within 1–2 weeks after drug discontinuation, rebound hyperuricaemia that occurs after drug discontinuation might be considered a significant risk factor for MACE. This significant association of difference in baseline and last measured uric acid levels prior to drug discontinuation and MACE risk after drug discontinuation is an important result in supporting our hypothesis.

### What makes gouty inflammation so variable? [^ba809735]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Intersecting effects of therapeutics on gouty inflammation

The mechanisms of action of the primary treatment options for prophylaxis and treatment of acute gout clearly intersect with many of the novel inflammation-mediating pathways cited above. Specifically, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and certain other NSAIDs activate PPAR-γ.

Corticosteroids, which inhibit transcription of many inflammatory genes, also regulate annexin A1. However, corticosteroids also paradoxically induce NLRP3, which may contribute to rebound flares of acute gout after steroid therapy is stopped. Low doses of colchicine suppress not simply neutrophil and endothelial function, but also multiple inflammatory effects in macrophages, transduced in large part by colchicine-induced activation of AMPK.

With respect to investigational agents, randomized clinical trials of the IL-1β-specific monoclonal antibody canakinumab have demonstrated superiority compared to a single dose of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide in reducing pain in acute gout and delaying time to next acute gout flare. Canakinumab is approved in Europe as an option for acute gout therapy. Multiple retrospective case series have reported on the efficacy of anakinra (recombinant IL-1ra) in acute gout in many but not all patients. Failure in acute gout (but not for anti-inflammatory flare prophylaxis) of the IL-1 blocker rilonacept may have been due to binding of rilonacept to IL-1ra. Finally, the partial PPAR-γ agonist arhalofenate, which is a uricosuric, has been reported to be associated with a decreased frequency of acute gout flares in comparison to allopurinol in a Phase II randomized controlled trial comparing ULT strategies and flare prophylaxis.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^5138ace2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases from inception to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2010 until 2013) and reference lists of identified studies. We searched the clinical trials register clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials register.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (active or placebo) in acute gout. The primary benefit outcome of interest was pain, defined as a proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain, and the primary harm outcome was study participants withdrawal due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened search results for relevant studies, extracted data into a standardised form and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled data if deemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Two RCTs (124 participants) were included in this updated review, including one new RCT. We considered one trial to be at low risk of bias, while we considered the newly included trial to be at unclear risk of bias. Both trials included a placebo and a high-dose colchicine arm, although the colchicine regimens varied. In one trial 0.5 mg colchicine was given every two hours until there was either complete relief of symptoms or toxicity and the total doses were not specified. In the other trial a total of 4.8 mg colchicine was given over six hours. The newly identified trial also included a low-dose colchicine arm (total 1.8 mg over one hour). Based upon pooled data from two trials (124 participants), there is low-quality evidence that a greater proportion of people receiving high-dose colchicine experience a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours compared with placebo (35/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 12/50 in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.65), with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 12). However, the total number of adverse events (diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) is greater in those who receive high-dose colchicine versus placebo (62/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 11/50 in the placebo group (RR 3.81, 95% CI 2.28 to 6.38), with a number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) of 2 (95% CI 2 to 5). Only one trial included reduction of inflammation as part of a composite measure comprising pain, tenderness, swelling and erythema, each graded on a four-point scale (none 0 to severe 3) to derive a maximum score for any one joint of 12. They reported the proportion of people who achieved a 50% reduction in this composite score. Based upon one trial (43 participants), there was low-quality evidence that more people in the high-dose colchicine group had a 50% or greater decrease in composite score from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours than people in the placebo group (11/22 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 1/21 in the placebo group (RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38) and 45% absolute difference). Based upon data from one trial (103 participants), there was low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is more efficacious than placebo with respect to the proportion of people who achieve a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline to 32 to 36 hours (low-dose colchicine 31/74 versus placebo 5/29 (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.64)), with a NNTB of 5 (95% CI 2 to 20). There are no additional harms in terms of adverse events (diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting) with low-dose colchicine compared to placebo (19/74 and 6/29 respectively (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.79)). Based upon data from one trial (126 participants), there is low-quality evidence that there are no additional benefits in terms of the proportion of people achieving 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine compared to low-dose (19/52 and 31/74 respectively (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36). However, there were statistically significantly more adverse events in those who received high-dose colchicine (40/52 versus 19/74 in the low-dose group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.98 to 4.54)), with a NNTH of 2 (95% CI 2 to 3). No trials reported function of the target joint, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life or withdrawals due to adverse events. We identified no studies comparing colchicine to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other active treatments such as glucocorticoids (by any route).

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon only two published trials, there is low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is likely to be an effective treatment for acute gout. We downgraded the evidence because of a possible risk of selection and reporting biases and imprecision. Both high and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo. While there is some uncertainty around the effect estimates, compared with placebo, high-dose but not low-dose colchicine appears to result in a statistically significantly greater number of adverse events. Therefore low-dose colchicine may be the preferred treatment option. There are no trials about the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as NSAIDs and glucocorticoids.

### Improving the use of allopurinol in chronic gout: monitoring oxypurinol levels to guide therapy [^0296d1df]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Urate-lowering therapy (ULT), adjusted to achieve and maintain a serum uric acid (SUA) of < 6 mg/dl, remains the standard of care for the chronic management of gout. New urate-lowering medications are important options; however, these agents should be reserved for patients who do not tolerate or cannot achieve SUA < 6 mg/dl on allopurinol. The result of oxypurinol monitoring to guide allopurinol therapy suggests that allopurinol should still be considered first-line ULT for gout.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^e43ae695]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis that is characterised by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues. The natural history of articular gout is generally characterised by three periods: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, episodes of acute gout and chronic gouty arthritis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. Published guidelines recommend their use to treat acute attacks, using maximum recommended doses for a short time.

Objectives

To assess the benefit and safety of NSAIDs (including COXIBs) for acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies to 7 October 2013, the 2010 and 2011 ACR and EULAR abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of articles. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trial register and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy (including non-pharmacological therapies) for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain (proportion with 50% or more reduction in pain or mean pain when the dichotomous outcome was unavailable), inflammation (e.g. measured by joint swelling/erythema/tenderness), function of target joint, participant's global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 23 trials (2200 participants). One trial (30 participants) of low-quality evidence compared an NSAID (tenoxicam) with placebo. It found that significantly more participants had more than 50% reduction in pain after 24 hours (11/15 participants) compared with those taking placebo (4/15 participants) (risk ratio (RR) 2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 6.72). A similar outcome was seen for more than 50% improvement in joint swelling after 24 hours (5/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 2/15 participants taking placebo; RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.93). The trial did not measure function, participant global assessment of treatment success and health-related quality of life. There were no adverse events reported with the use of tenoxicam; two adverse events (nausea and polypuria) were reported in the placebo group. No between-group differences in outcome were observed after four days. Moderate-quality evidence based upon four trials (974 participants) indicated that NSAIDs and COXIBs produced similar benefits in terms of pain, swelling and global improvement, but COXIBs were associated with fewer adverse events. Pain reduction was 1.9 points on a 0- to 10-point scale with COXIBs (0 was no pain) while pain reduction with NSAIDs was 0.03 points lower or better (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.13). Joint swelling in the COXIB group was 1.64 points on a 0- to 3-point scale (0 is no swelling) and 0.13 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.34). Function was not reported. Participant-reported global assessment was 1.56 points on a 0- to 4-point scale with COXIBs (0 was the best score) and was 0.04 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.20). Health-related quality of life assessed using the 36-item Short Form showed no evidence of a statistically significant between-group difference (MD 0.49, 95% CI -1.61 to 2.60 for the physical component). There were significantly fewer withdrawals due to adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (3%) compared with NSAIDs (8%) (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.28). There was a significantly lower number of total adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (38%) compared with NSAIDs (60%) (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86). There was moderate-quality evidence based on two trials (210 participants) that oral glucocorticoids did not differ in pain reduction, function or adverse events when compared with NSAIDs. Pain reduction was 9.5 on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, pain reduction with NSAIDs was 1.74 higher or worse (MD 1.74, 95% CI -1.44 to 4.92). The trials did not assess inflammation. Function measured as walking disability was 17.4 points on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, function with NSAIDs was 0.1 lower or better (MD -0.10, 95% CI -4.72 to 4.52). The trials did not measure participant-reported global assessment and health-related quality of life. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events. There was no evidence of a difference in total number of adverse events with glucocorticoids (31%) versus NSAIDs (49%) (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.28).

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence supported the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute gout. One placebo-controlled trial provided evidence of benefit at 24 hours and little or no harm. We downgraded the evidence due to potential selection and reporting biases, and imprecision. While these data were insufficient to draw firm conclusions, they did not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, other inflammatory arthritis and expert consensus, which support the use of NSAIDs in acute gout. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial although COX-2 inhibitors are likely to be associated with significantly fewer total and gastrointestinal adverse events. We downgraded the evidence due to an unclear risk of selection and reporting biases. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs were also equally beneficial in terms of pain relief. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events were similar between groups. We downgraded the evidence due to unclear risk of selection and reporting bias. There was low-quality evidence that there was no difference in function. We downgraded the quality due to unclear risk of selection bias and imprecision.

### Relationship between gout flare States and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^f4f64d47]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Low disease activity (LDA) has been defined as "a useful target of treatment by both physician and patient, given current treatment possibilities and limitations". Patient‐acceptable symptom state (PASS) has been defined as the "value beyond which the patient feels well", that is, a tolerable level of symptoms for the individual. In 2021, Taylor et alrecruited 512 participants who answered questions about their gout flares that would classify them into one of three gout flare states: (i) remission, defined as an affirmative response to the question, "Considering the number of attacks (flares) that you have had over the last [6 or 12] months, do you think your gout has gone away?"; (ii) LDA, defined as a negative response to the question, "Considering the number of attacks (flares) that you have had over the last [6 or 12] months, do you think you need more or stronger treatment?"; or (iii) PASS, defined as an affirmative response to the question, "Considering the number of attacks (flares) that you have had over the last [6 or 12] months, would you say that your gout control is currently satisfactory?" Participants also reported the hypothetical maximum number of flares that they could experience over 6 and 12 months and still consider themselves to be in the associated disease activity state. Based on these data, participants in LDA reported a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 1 (0–2) flares and those in PASS 0 (0–1) flares in a six‐month period. Similar results were observed over a 12‐month period, with participants in PASS reporting a median (IQR) 0 (0–2) flares and in LDA 1 (0–2) flares. Whether LDA and PASS are associated with patient‐reported outcomes is unknown. The aim of this analysis was to determine the relationship between gout flare states (PASS, LDA, and not in LDA or PASS [non‐LDA/PASS]) and patient‐reported outcomes.

### Concordance of the management of chronic gout in a UK primary-care population with the EULAR gout recommendations [^09239d53]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess concordance of the management of chronic gout in UK primary care with the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) gout recommendations.

Methods

A postal questionnaire was sent to all adults aged > 30 years registered with two general practices. Patients with possible gout attended for clinical assessment, at which the diagnosis was verified clinically. Aspects of chronic gout management, including provision of lifestyle modification advice, use of urate-lowering therapies (ULT) including dose titration to serum urate (SUA) level, prophylaxis against acute attacks, and diuretic cessation were assessed in accordance with the EULAR recommendations.

Results

Of 4249 (32%) completed questionnaires returned, 488 reported gout or acute attacks and were invited for clinical assessment. Of 359 attendees, 164 clinically confirmed cases of gout were identified. Advice regarding alcohol consumption was recalled by 59 (41%), weight loss by 36 (25%) and diet by 42 (29%). Allopurinol was the only ULT used and was taken by 44 (30%); 31 (70%) were taking 300 mg daily. Mean SUA was lower in allopurinol users than non-users (318 vs 434 micromol/l) and was less often > 360 micromol/l in allopurinol users (23% vs 75%). Eight patients had recently commenced allopurinol; two of these also were taking prophylactic colchicine or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Of 25 patients with diuretic-induced gout, 16 (64%) were still taking a diuretic.

Conclusion

Treatment of chronic gout is often suboptimal and poorly concordant with EULAR recommendations. Lifestyle advice is infrequently offered, and allopurinol is restricted to a minority. Persistent hyperuricaemia was often seen in allopurinol non-users, but was also in allopurinol users, suggesting that doses > 300 mg are often necessary.

### Relationship between gout flare States and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^1f06f763]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Gout flares are the most important clinical feature of the disease. A hypothetical maximum flare occurrence in the preceding six months has been suggested to be no flares for a patient-acceptable symptom state (PASS) and only one flare for low disease activity (LDA). The aim of this analysis was to determine the relationship between gout flare states (PASS, LDA, and not in LDA or PASS [non-LDA/PASS]) and patient-reported outcomes.

Methods

Post hoc analyses of variance were undertaken using data from a 12-month randomized controlled trial involving 172 people with gout, which compared low-dose colchicine to placebo for the first 6 months while starting allopurinol with a further 6-month follow-up. Self-reported gout flares were collected monthly. Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and EuroQol 5-domain (EQ-5D-3L) were completed at 0, 3, 6 ,9, and 12 months, and the gout-specific brief illness perception questionnaire (BIPQ) was collected at months 0, 6, and 12.

Results

In the final six months of the study, 68 participants (38%) were classified as being in PASS, 34 (19%) as in LDA, and 77 (43%) as non-LDA/PASS. There was no association between gout flare states and EQ-5D-3L or HAQ. There was a statistically significant association between three of eight BIPQ items with increasing consequences, identity, and concern scores across the three states of PASS, LDA, and non-LDA/PASS.

Conclusion

The majority of people were able to achieve gout flare PASS or LDA in the second six months after commencing allopurinol. As flare burden increases, so does the impact of gout on the patient. These findings highlight the importance of flare prevention in the management of gout.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^7649a7a0]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design

Post hoc analyses of the 12‐month "Is colchicine prophylaxis required with start‐low go‐slow allopurinol dose escalation in gout?" noninferiority randomized controlled trial were undertaken (ACTRN 12618001179224). The methods and results of the full trial have been reported. Briefly, this was a one‐year double‐blind placebo‐controlled noninferiority trial with participants randomized 1:1 to colchicine at 0.5 mg daily or placebo for the first six months. All participants commenced allopurinol, increasing monthly to achieve a target urate level of < 0.36 mmol/L. Starting doses of allopurinol were 50 mg daily in those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 100 mg daily in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The allopurinol doses were increased monthly by 50 mg daily in those with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and by 100 mg daily in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 until the serum urate level was < 0.36 mmol/L (6 mg/dL) for three consecutive visits. Ethical approval was obtained from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee, New Zealand (18/STH/156), and all participants provided written informed consent.

Participants were seen in person every three months by study coordinators, with intervening monthly telephone assessments. Gout flares, defined as self‐reported gout flares requiring treatment, were recorded at each monthly assessment. Adverse events and serious adverse events were collected monthly and coded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). Participants were asked about the occurrence of any adverse events as well as colchicine‐specific adverse events (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle weakness, and myalgia). Blood samples were obtained monthly for serum urate and creatinine; every three months for complete bloodcount, alanine transaminase, alkaline phophatase, and gamma glutamyl transferase; and at baseline, month three, and month six for CK. Nonfasting plasma samples were collected for trough colchicine plasma concentrations (just before the next colchicine dose) and the assumed peak (30–60 minutes post dose) colchicine concentrations at month three.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^b8c7bf4e]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Intervention, randomization and blinding

One hundred and forty patients who met the study criteria were randomized at a 1:1 ratio without stratification. Patients were administered febuxostat 40 mg daily (febuxostat group) or placebo (placebo group). All patients were administered diclofenac (150 mg/day) for 7 days and then open-labelled on day 8. Febuxostat 40 mg daily and diclofenac 75 mg daily were administered from day 8 through 28 for patients in remission. The dose of diclofenac was 150 mg/day before remission in both arms, the original protocol was maintained until remission.

A pre-allocated blocked randomization schedule was implemented using a block size of four. Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the febuxostat or the placebo group. Patients were enrolled by study site personnel. Each centre (hospital) recruited study participants by means of competition. The College of Public Health Management of Southern Medical University was designated as the 'random centre' to manage and perform the randomization process. To ensure representativeness, each centre enrolled at least 28 subjects. Each centre had a principle investigator (PI) who knows the treatment code, and another doctor who did not know the treatment code was responsible for assessing inflammation and recording the data. Before any of the study subjects were assigned to a group, the PI requested a randomized number from the 'random centre'. Medications were self-administered at home and participants were blinded to the treatments assigned.
