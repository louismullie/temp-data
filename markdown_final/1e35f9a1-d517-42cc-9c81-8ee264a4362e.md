## Question

Itchy ear syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "itchy ear syndrome", including its definition, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, and management, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the entity and confirming whether it is a recognized clinical syndrome. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and exclude mimics like infectious or allergic otitis externa. Next, I will examine plausible pathophysiological mechanisms. After that, I need to outline a practical diagnostic algorithm. Finally, I will synthesize management options, including topical and systemic therapies, and close with a concise clinical summary and follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm the definition and nomenclature. "Itchy ear syndrome" is not a formal ICD diagnosis; rather, it is a descriptive label used for pruritus of the external auditory canal without identifiable infection, eczema, or allergic otitis externa, and with no inflammatory changes on otoscopy, which aligns with the original description and contemporary otolaryngology perspectives on isolated canal pruritus without overt pathology [^116XxYFd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check the differential and exclude common mimics. Acute otitis externa typically presents with pain, canal edema/erythema, and tragal/pinnal tenderness; itching is common but usually coexists with pain and inflammation, so pure itch without inflammation argues against AOE, though I should confirm with careful otoscopy and history of moisture exposure or trauma [^111C8v8t] [^113JAUMB]. Allergic otitis externa and contact dermatitis from ear drops, hearing aids, or metals can cause pruritus with erythema and edema; absence of these findings makes that less likely, but I should still ask about topical exposures and prior ear instrumentation [^114ifUPV] [^116CNm1o]. Cerumen impaction can cause itch and fullness; if I see obstructive wax, I should treat the impaction and reassess symptoms before labeling this as primary pruritus [^1168rT7u] [^113EoJWW]. Neuropathic itch from trigeminal or cervical contributions, including red ear syndrome or postherpetic neuralgia, should be considered when symptoms are episodic, unilateral, or accompanied by dysesthesias or erythema/burning, and I should screen for those features and triggers [^112r1mc8] [^115sNBgW]. Systemic pruritus rarely localizes solely to the ear canal, but I should keep a low threshold to screen for systemic contributors if generalized features or red flags emerge [^notfound].

> I will now examine pathophysiology. Wait, let me verify the proposed mechanisms. The original description speculated that histamine and leukotriene release could drive itch in the absence of visible inflammation, which is plausible given the rich innervation of the canal skin and the capacity for neurogenic inflammation; however, this remains hypothetical and not proven in the ear specifically, so I should frame this as a working model rather than established fact [^116XxYFd]. More broadly, chronic pruritus involves peripheral and central sensitization, with contributions from histaminergic and nonhistaminergic pathways; in localized neuropathic itch, TRPV1 and other ion channels play key roles, which supports the mechanistic rationale for topical capsaicin in focal pruritus even if the ear-specific data are limited [^115xuiW1] [^115sNBgW] [^112cDbud].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. Let me think about a stepwise algorithm. First, confirm canal pruritus without pain, discharge, edema, or erythema on otoscopy; if inflammation is present, pivot to AOE or dermatitis pathways rather than "itchy ear syndrome". Second, obtain a targeted history of moisture exposure, swimming, hearing aid/earbud use, topical drops, metal sensitivities, and seasonal patterns; ask about unilateral episodic erythema/burning to screen for red ear syndrome. Third, inspect for cerumen impaction and remove if present, then reassess symptoms. Fourth, if symptoms persist and the exam remains unrevealing, consider neuropathic etiologies and, selectively, allergy testing or imaging only if atypical features arise; routine labs are not indicated in isolated canal pruritus without systemic signs [^111C8v8t] [^1168rT7u] [^112r1mc8].

> Now, I need to ensure management aligns with the likely mechanisms and available evidence. For localized, noninflammatory canal pruritus, I should prioritize canal care and avoidance of trauma: keep the canal dry, avoid cotton swabs, and consider barrier strategies during bathing; if dryness contributes, a tiny amount of mineral oil or a nonwater-based emollient may help, but I should avoid water-based drops if the canal is macerated and avoid potential allergens in topical products [^112oQnh3] [^113EoJWW]. For refractory focal itch, topical capsaicin 0.025–0.1% applied sparingly to the canal entrance (not deep) can be considered; I should counsel on initial burning and use brief courses with reassessment, consistent with guideline support for localized chronic pruritus and the mechanistic rationale for TRPV1 desensitization, even though ear-specific randomized data are lacking [^112cDbud] [^115xuiW1]. If symptoms suggest neuropathic drivers or coexisting dysesthesias, I can consider off-label use of agents such as gabapentin or pregabalin, recognizing the evidence base is extrapolated and decisions should be individualized with shared decision-making and follow-up for efficacy and adverse effects [^115sNBgW] [^111q1aDm]. I should double-check that I am not inadvertently treating a secondary inflammatory process; if I see erythema, edema, or discharge, I need to pivot to AOE or dermatitis management rather than persisting with neuropathic strategies [^111C8v8t] [^113JAUMB].

> But wait, what if symptoms are seasonal and accompanied by nasal/ocular itch or sneezing? In that scenario, I should reconsider allergic rhinitis with referred auricular itch; intranasal corticosteroids can reduce ear and palate itch in seasonal allergic rhinitis, so a therapeutic trial of mometasone or similar may be reasonable if the history fits, with reassessment of ear symptoms alongside nasal and ocular outcomes [^115eKWYX] [^112k8ZYU]. I need to ensure I do not over-attribute ear itch to allergy in the absence of supportive features, so I should confirm concordant symptoms and, if uncertain, consider targeted allergy testing rather than empiric long-term steroids [^112FVUn4].

> I should confirm follow-up and safety netting. If symptoms persist beyond a few weeks despite canal care and appropriate topical therapy, or if new features develop (pain, discharge, hearing change, erythema, swelling), I should re-examine the canal, reassess the diagnosis, and consider ENT referral for microscopy, culture if infection is suspected, or evaluation for less common entities such as red ear syndrome or medication-related osteonecrosis in patients on anti-resorptives. Persistent unexplained canal symptoms in patients on bisphosphonates warrant inspection for exposed bone and targeted imaging when indicated [^116CNm1o] [^117AbYEe] [^112r1mc8].

> In summary, I need to ensure the label "itchy ear syndrome" is applied only after excluding inflammatory and structural causes of canal pruritus. It represents a diagnosis of exclusion characterized by canal itch without otoscopic inflammation, with plausible but unproven neurogenic mechanisms, and management centers on canal protection, avoidance of irritants, and, for refractory cases, topical capsaicin or neuropathic agents, with allergy-directed therapy reserved for those with clear allergic phenotypes and ENT input for refractory or atypical cases [^116XxYFd] [^112cDbud] [^111C8v8t].

Itchy ear syndrome is best understood as **pruritus of the external auditory canal** without infection or dermatitis, often due to neuropathic or neurogenic itch [^116XxYFd]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, with otoscopy to exclude infection, eczema, or cerumen impaction [^111C8v8t] [^1165pq5f]. Management focuses on **avoiding trauma and moisture**, topical capsaicin for neuropathic itch [^115LVQ6i], and topical steroids for inflammation; refractory cases may need gabapentin or pregabalin [^116MvfHE]. Prognosis is generally good with care, but recurrence is common without behavioral change [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients report **itching of the external auditory canal** without pain, discharge, or hearing loss. On examination, the canal appears normal or mildly erythematous, with no infection, eczema, or cerumen impaction [^116XxYFd]. Symptoms may be unilateral or bilateral and can recur.

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Itchy ear syndrome is **multifactorial**; proposed mechanisms include:

- **Neuropathic itch**: Nerve injury or dysfunction causing localized pruritus [^115sNBgW] [^115LVQ6i].
- **Neurogenic itch**: Central nervous system dysregulation leading to pruritus without nerve damage [^115ffqKv].
- **Environmental factors**: Dryness, trauma, or irritants triggering itch [^114tQTwk].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and evaluation

Diagnosis is **clinical**, based on:

- **History**: Itching without infection, eczema, or cerumen impaction.
- **Otoscopy**: Normal or mildly erythematous canal [^116XxYFd].
- **Exclusion**: Infection, eczema, cerumen impaction, or systemic disease [^116XxYFd] [^1168rT7u].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Features distinguishing from itchy ear syndrome** |
|-|-|
| Otitis externa | - Pain <br/> - Discharge <br/> - Erythema <br/> - Edema [^111C8v8t] |
| Eczema | - Visible dermatitis <br/> - Scaling <br/> - Erythema [^notfound] |
| Cerumen impaction | - Visible cerumen <br/> - Hearing loss <br/> - Fullness [^1168rT7u] |
| Systemic pruritus | Generalized itch with systemic symptoms [^notfound] |

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **symptom control and trigger avoidance**:

- **Avoidance**: Trauma, moisture, and irritants [^112oQnh3].
- **Topical capsaicin**: 0.025–0.1% cream for neuropathic itch [^115LVQ6i].
- **Topical steroids**: For inflammation or eczema [^notfound].
- **Systemic therapy**: Gabapentin or pregabalin for refractory cases [^116MvfHE].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally good** with appropriate management, but recurrence is common without sustained behavioral change [^113JAUMB]. Persistent symptoms may require ongoing therapy and follow-up.

---

## Patient education and preventive measures

Education is **essential** to prevent recurrence:

- **Avoidance**: Trauma, moisture, and irritants [^112oQnh3].
- **Ear hygiene**: Gentle cleaning and dryness [^112oQnh3].
- **Follow-up**: Regular visits to monitor and adjust therapy [^111qDrVB].

---

Itchy ear syndrome is a clinical diagnosis of canal pruritus without infection or dermatitis, often neuropathic or neurogenic; management centers on avoidance, topical capsaicin or steroids, and systemic agents for refractory cases, with a generally good prognosis but frequent recurrence without behavioral change [^116XxYFd] [^112cDbud].

### What is swimmer's ear? [^112oQnh3]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

How Does This Happen. Swimmer's ear is common in children but may occur at any age. Swimmers are at highest risk, but anyone can be affected. For example, people who wear hearing aids or ear buds may trap moisture in the ear canal from sweating or showering. When the ear does not dry completely, bacteria and fungi grow more easily. This causes infection and irritation of the ear canal. Cleaning, scratching, or putting items in the ear can also cause infection. Unlike other ear infections, the space behind the eardrum is usually not involved. What Are the Symptoms. Ear pain is very common. A feeling of fullness in the ear or muffled hearing are also common. There may be smelly drainage from the ear, especially on the pillow after sleeping. Many people may experience itchiness, redness, or swelling. Fever, chills, or symptoms not involving the ear are rare. Who Needs Treatment. If the symptoms of swimmer's ear are present, a clinician should be seen.

The main treatment is antibiotic ear drops for about a week. Antibiotics by mouth are usually not needed. This will help fight the bacteria and control the infection. The ear drops may include a steroid to decrease swelling and pain. Sometimes repeat infections happen. Completing the entire treatment is important. If the infection causes a lot of swelling, sometimes an ear, nose, and throat specialist needs to put something in the ear canal to keep it open and allow the antibiotic drops to reach the infection. This is called an ear wick. An ENT specialist may also need to clean the ear by using instruments or suction. Keeping the ears dry, avoiding putting items in the ear, and cleaning ear devices regularly can decrease infections. While bathing, a cotton ball with Vaseline can be used to prevent water from entering the ear. After swimming or bathing, a hair dryer on cool can be used to gently dry the ear.

Over-the-counter ear cleaning devices, candling, or other home remedies should be avoided. What If It Does Not Improve. Symptoms should improve within a few days after treatment starts. Most patients will be fully healed within 7 to 10 days. If not, this may be a sign that it is more serious, and an ENT specialist should be seen. When left untreated, there is a risk of the infection spreading to nearby bones or skin. This is especially important in older people with diabetes or weak immune systems. Long-term infections can result in decreased hearing and scarring.

5.3 Treatment approaches acting on peripheral sensory nerves

Antihistamines are well‐established antipruritic agents that inhibit H1R, which is expressed by itch‐transmitting peripheral sensory nerve fibers and thus attenuates histaminergic itch. Histaminergic itch is a significant contributor to itch observed in urticaria and insect bites/stings. These forms of itch can be effectively treated with antihistamines. However, the other majority of itching cases outside of these dermatoses may result from nonhistaminergic itch mechanisms, and, thus, antihistamines may not be the optimal treatment option.

Analgesics and anesthetics inhibit the activation of ion channels (particularly Na v channels) and the generation of action potentials (Figure 4). Topical creams containing lidocaine are available as over‐the‐counter antipruritics in Japan and other countries. Topical ketamine (10% or 5%)–amitriptyline (5%)–lidocaine (5%) (TKAL) has been demonstrated to alleviate both inflammatory itch (itch in atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis) and neuropathic itch (brachioradial pruritus and other forms of neuropathic itch).

The use of coolants (cooling agents) result in partial and transient alleviation of the itching sensation. They activate cold‐sensing TRPM8‐expressing nociceptors, which, in turn, stimulate Bhlhb‐5‐expressing itch‐inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord (Figure 3). Topical formulations containing TRPM8 agonists menthol (1%–3%) and/or camphor are available over‐the‐counter in Japan and other countries. Of note, a subset of patients with chronic itch report exacerbation of their itch when exposed to cold, and they should be recommended to avoid cold sensation.

Capsaicin, an active alkaloid compound contained in chili peppers and a ligand for TRPV1, has been demonstrated to alleviate itching when applied topically. The precise mechanism of action of capsaicin in the itch treatment remains to be elucidated. Treatment with capsaicin may result in functional and/or structural alterations of TRPV1‐expressing peripheral sensory nerve fibers that are involved in the transmission of itching sensations. The capsaicin 8% patch is indicated in adults for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia in some countries, but it is not approved for itching conditions. Topical formulations containing capsaicin at lower concentrations are available over‐the‐counter in Japan and other countries.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^116DGn4J]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye syndrome staged management — Step 4 specifies that if the above options are inadequate consider topical corticosteroid for longer duration, amniotic membrane grafts, surgical punctal occlusion (punctal cautery), and other surgical approaches (e.g., tarsorrhaphy, minor salivary gland transplantation). One or more options concurrently within each category can be considered within that step of the dry eye disease state, and options within a category are not ranked according to importance and may be equally valid.

### Red scrotum syndrome: an update on clinicopathologic features, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^115uN4mf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The genital skin may be affected by a variety of dermatoses, be it inflammatory, infectious, malignant, idiopathic, or others. The red scrotum syndrome is characterized by persistent erythema of the scrotum associated with a burning sensation, hyperalgesia, and itching. Its cause is unknown, but proposed mechanisms include rebound vasodilation after prolonged topical corticosteroid use and localized erythromelalgia. The condition is chronic, and treatment is often difficult. Here we review the etiology, the physical and histopathologic findings, and the management of this condition. We also describe related conditions such as red scalp syndrome, red ear syndrome, and red vulva syndrome. Finally, we summarize the different cases reported in the literature and discuss the features that help in the differentiation of red scrotum syndrome from its mimickers.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^112822vf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — guideline outcomes and development methods emphasize evidence-based, actionable statements: The primary outcome considered in this guideline is resolution or improvement in the signs and symptoms associated with cerumen impaction, while secondary outcomes include complications or adverse events, and additional considerations included cost, adherence, quality of life, return to work or activity, return physician visits, and effects on comorbid conditions. This guideline update was developed with an explicit and transparent a priori protocol for creating actionable statements based on supporting evidence and the balance of benefit and harm, and the original guideline update was first sent to a panel of expert reviewers to assess key action statements and identify new literature or treatments relevant to recommendations.

### The external auditory canal: examination and evaluation [^116ktebT]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The external auditory canal is a highly specialized skin appendage whose primary purpose is to provide a pathway for the transmission of sound to the tympanic membrane and beyond. It is also a frequent source of symptoms for our patients. Sources of pain, hearing loss, tinnitus, itching, and other sensations can be inferred from an appropriate history. This should be followed by a thorough cleaning of the ear, so that a thorough examination can be performed.

### Interventions for chronic pruritus of unknown origin [^116xy64i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pruritus is a sensation that leads to the desire to scratch; its origin is unknown in 8% to 15% of affected patients. The prevalence of chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) in individuals with generalised pruritus ranges from 3.6% to 44.5%, with highest prevalence among the elderly. When the origin of pruritus is known, its management may be straightforward if an effective treatment for the causal disease is available. Treatment of CPUO is particularly difficult due to its unknown pathophysiology.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for CPUO in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the following up to July 2019: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registries. We checked the reference lists of included studies for additional references to relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We sought to include randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials that assessed interventions for CPUO, as defined in category VI ('Other pruritus of undetermined origin, or chronic pruritus of unknown origin') of the International Forum for the Study of Itch (IFSI) classification, in children and adults. Eligible interventions were non-pharmacological or topical or systemic pharmacological interventions, and eligible comparators were another active treatment, placebo, sham procedures, or no treatment or equivalent (e.g. waiting list).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were 'Patient- or parent-reported pruritus intensity' and 'Adverse events'. Our secondary outcomes were 'Health-related quality of life', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Depression', and 'Patient satisfaction'. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We found there was an absence of evidence for the main interventions of interest: emollient creams, cooling lotions, topical corticosteroids, topical antidepressants, systemic antihistamines, systemic antidepressants, systemic anticonvulsants, and phototherapy. We included one study with 257 randomised (253 analysed) participants, aged 18 to 65 years; 60.6% were female. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of three different doses of oral serlopitant (5 mg, 1 mg, and 0.25 mg, once daily for six weeks) compared to placebo for severe chronic pruritus; 25 US centres participated (clinical research centres and universities). All outcomes were measured at the end of treatment (six weeks from baseline), except adverse events, which were monitored throughout. A pharmaceutical company funded this study. Fifty-five per cent of participants suffered from CPUO, and approximately 45% presented a dermatological diagnosis (atopic dermatitis/eczema 37.3%, psoriasis 6.7%, acne 3.6%, among other diagnoses). We unsuccessfully attempted to retrieve outcome data from study authors for the subgroup of participants with CPUO. Participants had pruritus for six weeks or longer. Total study duration was 10 weeks. Participants who received serlopitant 5 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient-reported pruritus intensity as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS; a reduction in VAS score indicates improvement) compared to placebo (126 participants, risk ratio (RR) 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 3.35; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 5 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low-certainty evidence: adverse events (127 participants; RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.50); health-related quality of life (as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI); a higher score indicates greater impairment; 127 participants; mean difference (MD) -4.20, 95% CI -11.68 to 3.28); and sleep disturbances (people with insomnia measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Symptom Questionnaire-Insomnia (PSSQ-I), a dichotomous measure; 128 participants; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.01). Participants who received serlopitant 1 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient-reported pruritus intensity as measured by VAS compared to placebo; however, the 95% CI indicates that there may also be little to no difference between groups (126 participants; RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.54; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 1 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low-certainty evidence: adverse events (128 participants; RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.47); health-related quality of life (DLQI; 128 participants; MD -6.90, 95% CI -14.38 to 0.58); and sleep disturbances (PSSQ-I; 128 participants; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.84). Participants who received serlopitant 0.25 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient-reported pruritus intensity as measured by VAS compared to placebo; however, the 95% CI indicates that there may also be little to no difference between groups (127 participants; RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.77; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 0.25 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low-certainty evidence: adverse events (127 participants; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.24); health-related quality of life (DLQI; 127 participants; MD -5.70, 95% CI -13.18 to 1.78); and sleep disturbances (PSSQ-I; 127 participants; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.17). The most commonly reported adverse events were somnolence, diarrhoea, headache, and nasopharyngitis, among others. Our included study did not measure depression or patient satisfaction. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes due to indirectness (only 55% of study participants had CPUO) and imprecision. We downgraded outcomes other than patient-reported pruritus intensity a further level due to concerns regarding risk of bias in selection of the reported result and some concerns with risk of bias due to missing outcome data (sleep disturbances only). We deemed risk of bias to be generally low.

Authors' Conclusions

We found lack of evidence to address our review question: for most of our interventions of interest, we found no eligible studies. The neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) antagonist serlopitant was the only intervention that we could assess. One study provided low-certainty evidence suggesting that serlopitant may reduce pruritus intensity when compared with placebo. We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant on other outcomes, as certainty of the evidence is very low. More studies with larger sample sizes, focused on patients with CPUO, are needed. Healthcare professionals, patients, and other stakeholders may have to rely on indirect evidence related to other forms of chronic pruritus when deciding between the main interventions currently used for this condition.

### Middle ear atelectasis: what causes it and how is it corrected? [^114oHvDS]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Many options are available to manage a patient who has atelectatic ears. Establishing normal middle ear ventilation and aeration is the cornerstone to successful control of these ears. Often, medical management with nasal steroids and decongestants is all that is needed. If recurrent infections have weakened the tympanic membrane progressively, or the middle ear environment is so severe that medical management does not correct the problem, then surgical correction is often necessary. This article explores the pathogenesis of middle ear atelectasis and explains a classification system to help the clinician determine the best course of management.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^113nWtig]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guideline for cerumen impaction — scope and target population notes that the target patient for this guideline is > 6 months of age with a clinical diagnosis of cerumen impaction. The primary purpose is to help clinicians identify patients with cerumen impaction who may benefit from intervention and to promote evidence-based management, with another purpose to highlight needs and management options in special populations or in patients who have modifying factors; the secondary goal includes creating a guideline suitable for deriving a performance measure on cerumen impaction. This update is needed due to the time since the original publication and to the presence of new evidence, and it is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with cerumen impaction and applies to any setting in which cerumen impaction would be identified, monitored, or managed. The guideline does not apply to patients with cerumen impaction associated with the following conditions: dermatologic.

### Prevalence of asthma and other allergic conditions in Colombia 2009–2010: a cross-sectional study [^112Fg3sa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Questionnaire and data collection

Data collection took place during the academic year 2009–2010. The questionnaires were similar to those in a previous study. Questions used were originally developed and validated by the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Children initiative (ISAAC). We included a "does not know/does not respond" option in the questionnaire, and assumed for analysis as a "NO" answer. The calculations provided in the text and in the tables include this proportion of responses in the denominator of all prevalence estimates.

We added questions on absenteeism from school or work, health care consultants, and out-of-pocket costs. The definitions for current and past disease symptoms used for prevalence estimations were the following:

Asthma symptoms in the last year: Have you (or your child) had wheezing, or whistling in the chest in the past 12 months?

Past (lifetime) asthma symptoms: Have you (or your child) ever had wheezing or whistling in the chest at any time in the past?

Allergic rhinitis symptoms in the last year: In the past 12 months, have you (or your child) had a problem with sneezing or a running or blocked nose, when you (or your child) DID NOT have a cold or the flu?"

Past (lifetime) allergic rhinitis symptoms: Have you (or your child) ever had a problem with sneezing or a running or blocked nose, when you (or your child) DID NOT have a cold or the flu?"

Atopic eczema symptoms in the last year: "Have you (or your child) had this itchy rash at any time in the past 12 months?" and answered positively to the question, "Has this itchy rash at any time affected any of the following places: the folds of the elbows, behind the knees, in front of the ankles, under the buttocks, or around the neck, ears or eyes?". These questions were preceded by: "Have you (have your child) ever had a skin rash which was coming and going for at least six months?

Past (lifetime) atopic eczema symptoms: Have you (have your child) ever had a skin rash which was coming and going for at least six months?

The definitions for disease severity and previous medical diagnosis of the three conditions were identical to those previously used in other ISAAC studies and can be found at.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^112FVUn4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common diseases affecting adults. It is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States today and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall. AR is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually. It can impair quality of life and, through loss of work and school attendance, is responsible for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. Not surprisingly, myriad diagnostic tests and treatments are used in managing this disorder, yet there is considerable variation in their use. This clinical practice guideline was undertaken to optimize the care of patients with AR by addressing quality improvement opportunities through an evaluation of the available evidence and an assessment of the harm-benefit balance of various diagnostic and management options.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, in any setting, who are likely to manage patients with AR as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The guideline is intended to be applicable for both pediatric and adult patients with AR. Children under the age of 2 years were excluded from the clinical practice guideline because rhinitis in this population may be different than in older patients and is not informed by the same evidence base. The guideline is intended to focus on a limited number of quality improvement opportunities deemed most important by the working group and is not intended to be a comprehensive reference for diagnosing and managing AR. The recommendations outlined in the guideline are not intended to represent the standard of care for patient management, nor are the recommendations intended to limit treatment or care provided to individual patients.

Action Statements

The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend intranasal steroids for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life. The development group also made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should make the clinical diagnosis of AR when patients present with a history and physical examination consistent with an allergic cause and 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing. Findings of AR consistent with an allergic cause include, but are not limited to, clear rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, pale discoloration of the nasal mucosa, and red and watery eyes. (2) Clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, or when the diagnosis is uncertain, or when knowledge of the specific causative allergen is needed to target therapy. (3) Clinicians should assess patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR for, and document in the medical record, the presence of associated conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media. (4) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with AR who have inadequate response to symptoms with pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls. The panel recommended against (1) clinicians routinely performing sinonasal imaging in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of AR and (2) clinicians offering oral leukotriene receptor antagonists as primary therapy for patients with AR. The panel group made the following options: (1) Clinicians may advise avoidance of known allergens or may advise environmental controls (ie, removal of pets; the use of air filtration systems, bed covers, and acaricides [chemical agents formulated to kill dust mites]) in patients with AR who have identified allergens that correlate with clinical symptoms. (2) Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR. (3) Clinicians may offer combination pharmacologic therapy in patients with AR who have inadequate response to pharmacologic monotherapy. (4) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a surgeon who can offer, inferior turbinate reduction in patients with AR with nasal airway obstruction and enlarged inferior turbinates who have failed medical management. (5) Clinicians may offer acupuncture, or refer to a clinician who can offer acupuncture, for patients with AR who are interested in nonpharmacologic therapy. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the use of herbal therapy for patients with AR.

### Otitis externa: review and clinical update [^114tQTwk]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Otitis externa can take an acute or a chronic form, with the acute form affecting four in 1,000 persons annually and the chronic form affecting 3 to 5 percent of the population. Acute disease commonly results from bacterial (90 percent of cases) or fungal (10 percent of cases) overgrowth in an ear canal subjected to excess moisture or to local trauma. Chronic disease often is part of a more generalized dermatologic or allergic problem. Symptoms of early acute and most chronic disease include pruritus and local discomfort. If left untreated, acute disease can be followed by canal edema, discharge, and pain, and eventually by extra-canal manifestations. Topical application of an acidifying solution is usually adequate in treating early disease. An antimicrobial-containing ototopical is the preferred treatment for later-stage acute disease, and oral antibiotic therapy is reserved for advanced disease or those who are immunocompromised. Preventive measures reduce recurrences and typically involve minimizing ear canal moisture, trauma, or exposure to materials that incite local irritation or contact dermatitis.

### Diagnosis and management of Cornelia de Lange syndrome: first international consensus statement [^111kuJPi]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Ears, nose and throat

Individuals with CdLS typically have low-set, hairy and malformed ears, and one-third have small and stenotic ear canals. Inspection of the eardrum using the common small paediatric speculum is frequently difficult, thus cerumen removal or middle ear evaluation may require sedation for a complete assessment.

Middle and inner ear abnormalities in individuals with CdLS include malformed ossicles, especially the malleus and incus, small mastoids, cochlear abnormalities, malformed vestibules and soft-tissue opacification of the tympanomastoid cavity. Findings on temporal bone computed tomography, especially soft tissue in the middle ear, correlate well with audiometric data, and imaging studies are useful to assess the cause of hearing loss.

Hearing loss is very common (85–90%) in individuals with CdLS. It is typically bilateral, present in infancy, ranges from mild to severe (40–50%)and is sensorineural in 25% and conductive in 75%(R39). In adults, sensorineural hearing loss is reported in 45% of individuals with CdLS.

Conductive hearing loss is often secondary to persistent otitis media with effusion (80–85%), and canal stenosis is present in 30% of individuals with CdLS. Chronic or serous ear infection (otitis media) and chronic sinusitis are common (39%) in adulthood(R40). Initial evaluation of children with CdLS should include standard audiometric testing, plus otoacoustic emissions testing, auditory brainstem evoked response audiometry, or both, to assess for auditory neuropathies. Early identification of hearing loss is critical to maximize communication skills. Hearing has been reported to improve with time in 50% of adults with CdLS, including those with severe hearing loss. These findings indicate longitudinal evaluations of hearing.

### Clinical aspects and management of chronic itch [^111WKGoK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pruritus (CP) (ie, itch that persists for more than 6 weeks) poses significant challenges to patients' health and quality of life. It is a common reason for visits to dermatologists and general practitioners and can be caused by a range of conditions, including systemic diseases such as chronic kidney disease or liver diseases, malignancies, neuropathic conditions, and dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis. CP often does not develop in parallel with the course of the disease and can become an entity of its own, which must be treated with antipruritic drugs, even if the underlying cause is already under therapy. Depending on the etiology of CP, different pathways in the pathogenesis have been analyzed recently, following which new treatments have been developed and tested in randomized controlled trials. This article discusses the recent results of these studies and highlights how best to manage health care for patients with CP.

### Effects of intranasal mometasone furoate on itchy ear and palate in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis [^115eKWYX]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Intranasal steroids relieve nasal symptoms and ocular itch in allergic rhinitis. Itchy ear and palate are also common and bothersome symptoms but have received little attention in clinical trials of allergic rhinitis.

Objective

To ascertain the efficacy of mometasone furoate nasal spray in alleviating itchy ear and palate in seasonal allergic rhinitis.

Methods

Data were pooled from 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of mometasone furoate nasal spray, 200 μg/d. Participants rated ear and palate itching from baseline through treatment day 15 as follows: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe.

Results

A total of 962 study participants received mometasone furoate nasal spray or placebo. Baseline least squares mean itchy ear and palate score was 1.81 for participants receiving mometasone furoate nasal spray (n = 480) and 1.85 for participants receiving placebo (n = 482). Mometasone furoate nasal spray was associated with a greater decrease in itchy and ear palate score vs placebo during the 15-day study period (least squares mean change, -0.73 vs -0.45; P < .001). The difference reached significance on day 2 and persisted through day 15 (P ≤ .01 for each day). Results were similar in a subgroup of patients (n = 305) with moderate-to-severe symptoms at baseline. Adverse events with mometasone furoate nasal spray were similar to those observed in other studies of intranasal steroid therapy.

Conclusion

These preliminary findings suggest that mometasone furoate nasal spray effectively treats itchy ear and palate in individuals with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Itchy ear and palate is a relevant end point for future clinical trials of allergic rhinitis.

### Recognizing bisphosphonate-induced ear osteonecrosis in primary care: a case report [^117AbYEe]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Medication-related ear canal osteonecrosis (MRECO) is a growing concern linked to prolonged anti-resorptive medication use. Despite primary care providers being key prescribers of these medications, there is limited information about MRECO in primary care literature. This article presents a case of bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal (EAC), emphasizing the vital role of primary care providers in identifying this rare yet significant side effect of anti-resorptive medication.

Main Symptoms and Clinical Findings

A 65-year-old female, on long-term alendronic acid for osteoporosis, presented to primary care with a 2-year history of left-sided ear blockage and itchiness. Despite prolonged topical treatment for ear wax, symptoms persisted, leading to an Otolaryngology referral. Microsuction revealed exposed bone in the left EAC.

Diagnoses, Interventions, and Outcomes

A computed tomography scan confirmed bony erosion of the left EAC, and in the absence of other osteonecrosis risk factors, bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis was diagnosed. Management involved bisphosphonate discontinuation, regular aural toilet, and topical treatment, achieving complete ear canal epithelialisation within 6 months.

Conclusion

MRECO, a rare complication of anti-resorptive therapy, is anticipated to rise with increasing antiresorptive medication use in the ageing population. Unexplained ear symptoms in those with a history of current or prior anti-resorptive therapy should raise clinical concern, prompting evaluation for exposed bone in the EAC. Raising awareness of MRECO among primary care providers is crucial for early diagnosis and timely management.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^115a6bxm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Patient-reported symptoms and likely diagnosis — Allergic rhinitis (AR), nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), acute upper respiratory tract infection, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps, and CRS with nasal polyps — are contrasted by frequency descriptors. Rhinorrhea/sniffing in AR is described as very common with clear watery discharge, whereas NAR is common but less than AR overall; in acute infection it is common and may be clear to purulent and watery to mucoid with crusts; and in CRS (with or without nasal polyps) it is common and clear to mucoid. Ocular pruritus/watery discharge/red eyes is very common in AR but uncommon in NAR and acute infection and very uncommon in CRS. Nasal congestion or blocked nose/mouth breathing is very common and persistent in AR and very common, chronic, almost universal in CRS with nasal polyps. Facial or sinus pain/pressure is very uncommon in AR yet common in acute infection and in CRS without nasal polyps. Postnasal drip is uncommon and persistent in AR but very common in NAR and common in acute infection and CRS without nasal polyps. Nasal/palate/ear itching is common in AR and very uncommon in NAR, acute infection, and CRS with or without nasal polyps. Snoring is uncommon and persistent in AR but common in the other listed conditions, and sleep disturbance/sleep apnea is common across all listed conditions. Frequencies are based on expert evidence and opinion and the table was developed based predominantly on expert opinion.

### Innovative management of pruritus [^112K3ULj]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

Pruritus remains a significant problem facing dermatologists and can be associated with various dermatoses and systemic derangements. At times, one can treat the underlying cutaneous or systemic process to alleviate itch. However, it is frequently challenging to identify the cause of a patient's itch and, in this situation, even more difficult to manage the symptom effectively. In this article, the authors discuss the approach to a patient with generalized pruritus without clinically obvious dermatoses. They also addresses mechanisms and management modalities of itch in common systemic diseases, including cholestasis, uremia, and neuropathic dysfunction.

### Treatment options in trigeminal trophic syndrome: a multi-institutional case series [^116wcYnP]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS) is an uncommon medical condition that may be encountered by otolaryngologists and facial plastic surgeons. TTS begins with damage to the trigeminal nerve or its central sensory connections, causing anesthesia in a dermatomal distribution. With repeated scratching and manipulation, an ulceration occurs, often in the alar region. In this multi-institutional report, we summarize a small series of patients with TTS. Treatment options are discussed along with a review of the relevant literature. Although rare, it is important that practicing otolaryngologists be familiar with the classic signs and symptoms of this condition in order to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^114syHK2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — background and symptoms note that cerumen, or "earwax", is a naturally occurring substance that cleans, protects, and lubricates the external auditory canal and is the primary reason why the ear canal can become obstructed. Blockage of the ear canal by cerumen can cause symptoms including hearing loss, tinnitus, fullness, itching, otalgia, discharge, odor, and cough, and can prevent diagnostic assessment by preventing complete examination of the external auditory canal and/or eardrum (tympanic membrane).

### Psychogenic pruritus and its management [^111e5EbH]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic itching can be frustrating for patients and providers, and patients are not always willing to accept that their psychiatric health has an impact on their skin. Psychogenic pruritus is defined as itch not related to dermatologic or systemic causes. When a patient presents with pruritus, regardless of the presumed cause, the standard work-up should include a thorough history, dermatologic examination, and laboratory examinations or biopsies as needed. If no medical source is found, the provider must work in partnership with the patient to explore other causes and that may include acknowledging and treating underlying psychiatric conditions.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^1165pq5f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of the 2008 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation cerumen impaction clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing cerumen impaction. Cerumen impaction is defined as an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms, prevents assessment of the ear, or both. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the development group; new evidence (3 guidelines, 5 systematic reviews, and 6 randomized controlled trials); enhanced information on patient education and counseling; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; expanded action statement profiles to explicitly state quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, intentional vagueness, and differences of opinion; an enhanced external review process to include public comment and journal peer review; and 3 new key action statements on managing cerumen impaction that focus on primary prevention, contraindicated intervention, and referral and coordination of care. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to help clinicians identify patients with cerumen impaction who may benefit from intervention and to promote evidence-based management. Another purpose of the guideline is to highlight needs and management options in special populations or in patients who have modifying factors. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with cerumen impaction, and it applies to any setting in which cerumen impaction would be identified, monitored, or managed. The guideline does not apply to patients with cerumen impaction associated with the following conditions: dermatologic diseases of the ear canal; recurrent otitis externa; keratosis obturans; prior radiation therapy affecting the ear; previous tympanoplasty/myringoplasty, canal wall down mastoidectomy, or other surgery affecting the ear canal. Key Action Statements The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, cerumen impaction, defined as an accumulation of cerumen that is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should explain proper ear hygiene to prevent cerumen impaction when patients have an accumulation of cerumen. (2) Clinicians should diagnose cerumen impaction when an accumulation of cerumen, as seen on otoscopy, is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both. (3) Clinicians should assess the patient with cerumen impaction by history and/or physical examination for factors that modify management, such as ≥ 1 of the following: anticoagulant therapy, immunocompromised state, diabetes mellitus, prior radiation therapy to the head and neck, ear canal stenosis, exostoses, and nonintact tympanic membrane. (4) Clinicians should not routinely treat cerumen in patients who are asymptomatic and whose ears can be adequately examined. (5) Clinicians should identify patients with obstructing cerumen in the ear canal who may not be able to express symptoms (young children and cognitively impaired children and adults), and they should promptly evaluate the need for intervention. (6) Clinicians should perform otoscopy to detect the presence of cerumen in patients with hearing aids during a health care encounter. (7) Clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, the patient with cerumen impaction with an appropriate intervention, which may include ≥ 1 of the following: cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, or manual removal requiring instrumentation. (8) Clinicians should recommend against ear candling for treating or preventing cerumen impaction. (9) Clinicians should assess patients at the conclusion of in-office treatment of cerumen impaction and document the resolution of impaction. If the impaction is not resolved, the clinician should use additional treatment. If full or partial symptoms persist despite resolution of impaction, the clinician should evaluate the patient for alternative diagnoses. (10) Finally, if initial management is unsuccessful, clinicians should refer patients with persistent cerumen impaction to clinicians who have specialized equipment and training to clean and evaluate ear canals and tympanic membranes. The panel offered the following as options: (1) Clinicians may use cerumenolytic agents (including water or saline solution) in the management of cerumen impaction. (2) Clinicians may use irrigation in the management of cerumen impaction. (3) Clinicians may use manual removal requiring instrumentation in the management of cerumen impaction. (4) Last, clinicians may educate/counsel patients with cerumen impaction or excessive cerumen regarding control measures.

### Trigeminal trophic syndrome from stroke: an under-recognized central neuropathic itch syndrome [^117BpEn6]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS) is the historic name for neuropathic self-induced facial ulceration from abnormal sensory symptoms leading to uncontrolled scratching. Anatomic co-localization of sensory loss (numbness) plus neuropathic itch and pain permits painless scratching. If the itch is severe, some patients will scratch to the point of causing self-injury. Patients may be unaware or may conceal the fact that their lesions are self-induced and thus the diagnosis presents a clinical challenge. Many cases remain undiagnosed, leading to unnecessary and ineffective tests, procedures, and prescribing. We document a patient with a central cause of TTS - multiple cerebral vascular accidents - and summarize the presentation, pathogenesis, and treatment options.

Conclusions

Regardless of the cause, patients with CP will benefit from the continuously increasing armamentarium of novel therapies. To a large extent, the expected progress is based on the flourishing data on CP pathophysiology, but, in the era of evidence-based medicine, another crucial factor (conscientious planning and execution of clinical trials) has to be taken into account. Thereby, therapeutic success, safety and economic issues will be maintained in real-life settings.

### Ofloxacin (ofloxacin otic) [^113FYHkD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with a Middle Ear Infection, if a dose of Ofloxacin Otic Solution is missed, it should be given as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule.

Do not use a double dose unless the doctor has instructed you to do so. If the infection is not improved after one week, you should consult your doctor. If you have two or more episodes of drainage within six months, it is recommended that you see your doctor for further evaluation.

What activities should be avoided while using Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

It is important that the infected ear(s) remain clean and dry. When bathing, avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet. Avoid swimming unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

What are some of the possible side effects of Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

During the testing of Ofloxacin Otic Solution in external ear infections, the most common side effect was discomfort upon application which happened in 7% of patients. If the pain is severe, the medication should be stopped and you should contact your doctor. Other side effects were: itching (1%), earache (0.8%), and dizziness (0.4%).

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^1168rT7u]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — symptoms and hearing outcomes are described, noting that cerumen impaction has been associated with itching, ear pain, discharge from the ear canal, ear fullness, cough, hearing loss, tinnitus, and cognitive impairment in elderly patients, and that removing impacted cerumen can improve hearing. Screening studies show that cerumen impaction is a frequent reversible cause of hearing loss. In a randomized community-based screening study in Oman, 2.7% of the population had a unilateral hearing impairment; among those with unilateral hearing loss, 54% were deemed to have a "mild" impairment (hearing threshold, 26–40 dB), and half of that group had resolution of hearing loss after clearing cerumen at screening. When examiners found new conductive hearing loss defined by a > 10-dB air-bone gap at ≥ 2 frequencies with complete or near-complete occlusion by cerumen, the conductive hearing deficit resolved after removal. In an uncontrolled series of 125 consecutive patients at an ear-syringing clinic, improvement or resolution of difficulty hearing on the phone, ear pain, or "blocked ears" occurred 62% to 75% of the time after ear irrigation, and forty to fifty percent of those with itchiness or dizziness reported improvement after ear lavage. Hearing acuity does not diminish until the cross-sectional area of the ear canal is reduced by at least 80%. In a random sample of 226 patients aged ≥ 65 years admitted to nonintensive care units, 35% had cerumen impaction blocking visualization of the tympanic membrane of 1 or both ears; after lavage with otoscopic confirmation of clearing, repeat hearing tests showed improved hearing at several frequencies, with no change in control patients who were not impacted.

### Practical strategies for pruritus management in the obeticholic acid-treated patient with PBC: proceedings from the 2018 expert panel [^113EeziP]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

This algorithm outlines individualised pruritus management for all OCA-treated patients, regardless of symptoms, and can be used in conjunction with box 1 and figure 2 to determine a course of pruritus management. The expert committee noted that most of the tools available for assessment of pruritus were developed for research purposes and may not be practical for routine use in clinical practice. However, monitoring symptoms can be as simple as asking a patient whether they are experiencing itch at each visit. Once a patient identifies that they are indeed experiencing itch, it is useful to quantify itch so that it can be monitored for improvement or worsening. With proactive, clinician-led education and counselling, active follow-up to assess pruritus, and implementation of lifestyle management and OTC treatment, as well as prescribed pharmacological treatment and dose titration, as necessary, HCPs can help support patients in continuing OCA treatment while managing pruritus symptoms.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can be difficult to treat due to a complex etiology and diverse clinical presentations. Itch is the most common symptom associated with AD with profound negative impact on quality of life. Thus, the adjunctive management of itch in patients with AD is needed to control and reduce disease burden. Supplemental treatment options are continuously emerging and undergoing testing in clinical trials. This article summarizes the latest data on topical and systemic adjunctive therapies for AD safety and efficacy in reducing itch.

### Alternative therapy in pruritus [^114L6MW5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Because of its multitude of origins, the symptom complex of pruritus has a plethora of purported remedies and few therapeutic indications. Very few topical and systemic FDA approved medications have the indication of pruritus. Specific therapy still awaits a better definition of the exact physiologic events in chronic pruritus. Hence most medications actually focus on the central nervous system — the peripheral receptors — and the lack of specific physiologic targets has inhibited pharmacologic development. The resulting gap has opened the door to a variety of alternative therapies.

Table 1 — abbreviations and definitions of common tinnitus terms define primary tinnitus as idiopathic and it "may or may not be associated with sensorineural hearing loss", with a footnote clarifying that "the word idiopathic is used here to indicate that a cause other than sensorineural hearing loss is not identifiable"; secondary tinnitus is associated with "a specific underlying cause (other than sensorineural hearing loss) or an identifiable organic condition". Duration categories are specified as recent onset tinnitus "less than 6 months in duration" and persistent tinnitus "6 months or longer in duration". Impact categories distinguish bothersome tinnitus — where a distressed patient has "affected quality of life and/or functional health status" and seeks "active therapy and management strategies" — from nonbothersome tinnitus, which "does not have a significant effect on a patient's quality of life but may result in curiosity of the cause or concern about the natural history and how it might progress or change".

Approximately 57 patients with red ear syndrome have been reported in the literature since it was initially described in 1994. The clinical phenotype therefore continues to be defined and no consistent treatment response has been described. We report three new cases of red ear syndrome and suggest that the disorder may exist as a primary trigeminal or cervical autonomic cephalalgia, coexist with other rare trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, or may be secondary. The pathogenesis in these different circumstances may be distinct, the triggers specific and, when secondary, the disorder may be more resistant to treatment.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^117RdwSi]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1.3 Anogenital pruritus

Anogenital pruritus is defined as itch localized to the anal, perianal, or genital skin. This type of itch is four times more prevalent in middle‐aged men than women. The underlying causes for anogenital pruritus remain largely unclear; however, degenerative changes to the lower spine (between L4 and S2) resulting in compression of a nerve or nerve root may contribute to its development. Additionally, postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy have been identified as potential causative factors for anogenital pruritus.

7.1.4 Scalp pruritus

Scalp pruritus is thought to primarily arise from aberrant function of the trigeminal nerves. There is evidence to suggest that the skin microbiome play a role in exacerbating itch. A similar condition is also referred to as scalp dysesthesia (burning scalp syndrome), which presents burning and tingling and sometimes an itching sensation. The question of whether scalp pruritus and scalp dysesthesia are on the same spectrum remains unanswered.

7.1.5 Postherpetic pruritus

Postherpetic pruritus (postherpetic itch) is a neuropathic itch localized on the area(s) previously affected by herpes zoster. The itch is more prevalent on the head, neck, and face (regions innervated by the trigeminal nerve), followed by the trunk. The causes include a reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber densities representing small fiber neuropathy. Of note, postherpetic pruritus not only causes itch itself but also itch sensitization phenomena (increased sensitivity to touch‐evoked itch [punctate hyperknesis]). This itch and punctate hyperkenesis improved, accompanied by restored intraepidermal nerve fiber densities in the affected area.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^113GWcwF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — diagnostic evaluation emphasizes that a minority of facial paresis/paralysis cases have identifiable causes and should not be treated as Bell's palsy; approximately 70% of facial nerve palsies are Bell's palsy and 30% have other causes, so clinicians should take a comprehensive history, confirm the acute onset of symptoms, document other cranial nerve function, inquire about viral prodrome or hyperacusis and underlying conditions (e.g., prior stroke, brain or parotid tumors, skin cancers of the head/face, trauma, recent infections), and perform a comprehensive physical examination including inspection of the ear canal, tympanic membrane, parotid gland, and head/face/cheek skin, ruling out ear infection, cholesteatoma, and vesicular rashes; atypical presentations (including bilateral facial nerve paresis/paralysis) may warrant additional specialized and more extensive laboratory testing, and clinicians should consider infrequent causes such as Lyme disease in endemic areas, sarcoidosis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, and leprosy; Bell's palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion and Table 7 outlines categories and distinguishing features of other causes, with disproportionate presentation among pregnant women and people with diabetes, influenza, a cold, or other upper respiratory illness.

### Pruritus associated with targeted anticancer therapies and their management [^114XUi24]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Targeted anticancer therapies have significantly increased the survival of patients with a variety of malignancies, improving tolerability and treatment duration. The increased lifespan and the expanded use of targeted agents have led to a variety of treatment-related adverse events. Pruritus, a common dermatologic adverse event with various incidences ranging from 2.2% to 47% across different categories of targeted anticancer therapies, has been overlooked. This article reviews the incidence, accompanying skin conditions, possible pathomechanism, and proposed management algorithms of pruritus associated with targeted therapies, including immunotherapies.

Background

Red ear syndrome is characterised by episodic unilateral erythema of the ear associated with pain and burning sensation.

Patients and Methods

We describe the case of a young woman with daily, frequent, recurrent episodes of red ear syndrome in the absence of any structural lesions, primary headache disorder or obvious triggers. We review all previously described cases and discuss postulated mechanisms for this syndrome.

Conclusions

The exact cause of this rare headache disorder remains unknown and treatment options vary considerably.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^116MzcS9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 3B: Nonintervention if asymptomatic — clinicians "should not routinely treat cerumen in patients who are asymptomatic and whose ears can be adequately examined", a "Recommendation against" based on "control groups in randomized trials and observational studies" with a "preponderance of benefit over harms". The action profile specifies "Quality improvement opportunity: Avoidance of harm, efficient use of health care resources", "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C", and "Level of confidence in the evidence: Medium", with benefits to "Avoid unnecessary treatment with potential adverse events and costs", risks of "Potential progression to impaction", and "Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harms". Value judgments are that "The presence of cerumen is not in itself harmful, and it may not progress to impaction; in fact, it may resolve spontaneously. If it progresses, it can be managed at that time", with "The word routinely was added to this statement to acknowledge that there may be circumstances where cerumen removal may be offered anyway, as in a patient with hearing aids", and "Role of patient preferences: Substantial role for shared decision making. The patient may still opt for removal of the cerumen". Exceptions include "history of recurrent cerumen impaction", with "Policy level: Recommendation against" and "Differences of opinion: None".

Several cases of relapsing attacks during which the ear becomes red and patients experience a burning sensation have been reported in the literature. This combination of symptoms has been described as 'red ear syndrome' (RES). We report on a 7-year-old boy who had episodes of reddening, swelling and a burning sensation in one ear with local hyperthermia persisting for 3 years. The differential diagnosis included RES and erythromelalgia, as isolated auricular variants of erythromelalgia have been described and the symptoms are difficult to distinguish from RES. In this report, we discuss the similarities and differences between RES and erythromelalgia.

### Delphi panel consensus regarding current clinical practice management options for… [^111swohR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blepharitis

Lid and ocular surface diseases often share a constellation of signs, including lid margin erythema, meibomian gland inspissation, conjunctivitis, conjunctival erythema, tear film instability, and keratitis. Blepharitis is a common inflammatory ocular disease that affects the eyelid margin, frequently resulting in disruption of the ocular surface and tear film. When present, blepharitis can damage the ocular surface and exacerbate concurrent ocular surface disorders. Because of its chronic nature and frequent comorbidity with other ocular surface diseases, managing these patients can be difficult. There are no FDA-approved treatments specifically for blepharitis, so the goal is often palliative, providing short-term management of signs and symptoms, with strategies such as warm compresses and lid hygiene, topical anti-inflammatory agents, and topical and oral antibiotics. While these options may temporarily relieve patient symptoms, they rarely address the root cause of the disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^116CNm1o]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — evaluation of nonresponse and contact sensitivity: Alternative causes of ear pain and otorrhea should be considered if treatment fails, with specialist referral uncommon (3%) when AOE is appropriately managed; culture of the ear canal can identify fungi, resistant bacteria, or unusual causes needing targeted therapy. Fungi may act as co-pathogens and overgrow after topical antibacterials. Allergic contact dermatitis from prolonged antimicrobial otic drops can cause refractory AOE, with sensitization developing over 10 to 14 days and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions leading to erythema, pruritus, canal edema, and persistent otorrhea. Neomycin-containing eardrops commonly cause contact sensitivity with a 13% to 30% prevalence on patch testing in chronic otitis externa, and certain preservatives/vehicles have at least a 1% incidence of contact sensitivity. Allergic contact sensitivity may also arise from silicone ear plugs or hearing aid molds containing silicone or methyl-methacrylate, and patch testing to an appropriate antigen panel is useful to identify contributing agents.

### Frequency of ear symptoms and hearing loss in ichthyosis: a pilot survey study [^115CbmPA]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Ichthyoses comprise a heterogeneous array of skin conditions resulting from impairment of cornification. Although ear structures can be affected, ear-related symptoms have never been investigated in patients with ichthyosis. In this pilot survey study, our aim was to determine the frequency of ear symptoms, hearing loss, and related medical interventions in patients with ichthyosis. Our secondary aim was to compare the frequency of these items according to age group. An online survey using Redcap was developed and posted online on the Foundation for Ichthyosis and Related Skin Types website for 6 months. Patients or parents of patients with ichthyosis were asked to complete the survey. Data analysis excluded patients with keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome and surveys that had fewer than two completed items. One hundred thirty-five unique surveys were used for data analysis. Of all participants, 80% reported ear pruritus, 66% reported trouble hearing, 29% reported frequent ear pain, 28% had abnormal hearing test results, and 16% had used hearing aids. Of the 88 participants who reported trouble hearing, 24 (27.3%) had never been to a hearing specialist. Significantly more participants older than 18 years of age (74%, 57/77) reported trouble hearing than participants age 18 years and younger (53%, 31/58; p = 0.02). The frequencies of other ear symptoms and hearing loss were not statistically significantly different between the age groups. Ear pruritus, ear pain, and hearing loss are important concerns in patients with all forms of ichthyosis in all age groups. Early diagnosis and intervention may improve the quality of life of patients with ichthyosis.

### Neuropathic pruritus [^115sNBgW]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Pruritus, also known as itch, is a very common, unpleasant sensation that elicits an urge to scratch. Its origin is not always in the skin, and neuropathic itch that is caused by neuronal or glial damage is common, but poorly understood by both dermatologists and neurologists. Although pruritus has not been considered as serious a symptom as pain, it is difficult to treat and — if chronic — can severely impair quality of life. Neuropathic itch is often associated with other clinical symptoms, most commonly neuropathic pain, and hypersensitization to stimuli is present in both pruritus and pain of neuropathic origin. The shared aetiology can aid in finding suitable treatment for itch in some cases, but more detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of itch, along with standardized, well-controlled trials, is needed. Pruritus research is an emerging but currently very active field, and our understanding of this sensation is rapidly increasing. Here, we review new discoveries regarding the role of the nervous system and the contribution of different pathways in pruritus, discuss the different aetiologies of neuropathic itch, and outline currently available and potential strategies for managing neuropathic pruritus.

1950. 00700020605009. ALLERGIC conditions of the ear and pathologic variations due to altered sensitivity occur more frequently than generally recognized. A review of the various allergic manifestations with some attempt at clarification and classification should be of value to the otologist and allergist. It is now a well established fact that allergy predisposes to and aggravates many diseases of the upper respiratory tract. Recent surveys, including those of Shambaugh, 1 King, 2 and Hamlin3 relating to the frequency of allergy as an etiologic factor or as a complication in diseases of the ear, nose and throat, show 70 to 90 per cent of all office patients to be allergic. Still more recently there has been interest in the relation of allergy to the ear.

Naltrexone Implant Patient Information

What is Naltrexone Implant?

Naltrexone blocks the effects of narcotic medicines and alcohol.
Naltrexone implants are used to treat addiction to alcohol or narcotic drugs. It is also used to prevent narcotic addiction relapse.
Naltrexone Implants prevents the reward effects of opioids and alcohol with subsequent use.
Craving decrease substantially in those people on naltrexone, and that this craving reduction occurs very quickly, from the beginning of treatment (first 2–3 weeks) and doesn't seem to return after that. There are certainly people who continue to have cravings, but this is a rather small proportion and usually occurs only after coming off medication. Those who maintain treatment with naltrexone have no cravings, and some believe that combining naltrexone with personal recovery work in a 12-step based program is especially effective.
Naltrexone implants may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.

What are the possible side effects of naltrexone implant?

Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

Call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects:

Blurred vision or eye problems
Fast heartbeat
Wheezing, difficulty breathing
Mood changes, hallucinations (seeing or hearing things), confusion, thoughts of hurting yourself
Nausea, stomach pain, low fever, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
Ear pain, ringing in your ears
Feeling light-headed, fainting
Skin rash or itching
Pain, redness, bruising, itching, swelling, oozing, skin changes, or a hard lump where the medication was implanted

### Cough and itch: common mechanisms of irritation in the throat and skin [^115jrqbF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cough and itch are protective mechanisms in the body. Cough occurs as a reflex motor response to foreign body inhalation, while itch is a sensation that similarly evokes a scratch response to remove irritants from the skin. Both cough and itch can last for sustained periods, leading to debilitating chronic disorders that negatively impact quality of life. Understanding the parallels and differences between chronic cough and chronic itch may be paramount to developing novel therapeutic approaches. In this article, we identify connections in the mechanisms contributing to the complex cough and scratch reflexes and summarize potential shared therapeutic targets. An online search was performed using various search engines, including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov from 1983 to 2024. Articles were assessed for quality, and those relevant to the objective were analyzed and summarized. The literature demonstrated similarities in the triggers, peripheral and central nervous system processing, feedback mechanisms, immunologic mediators, and receptors involved in the cough and itch responses, with the neuronal sensitization processes exhibiting the greatest parallels between cough and itch. Given the substantial impact on quality of life, novel therapies targeting similar neuroimmune pathways may apply to both itch and cough and provide new avenues for enhancing their management.

Topical capsaicin is reported to be an effective treatment for idiopathic intractable pruritus ani. While both capsaicin and menthol application produce a transient perianal burning sensation, only capsaicin relieves itching. Classical observations on functional desensitisation of nociceptors by capsaicin may explain the beneficial effects but the recent discovery of a range of receptors which respond to capsaicin, menthol, and temperature, and their expression in subsets of sensory nerve fibres, provides an exciting prospect towards advancing our understanding and treatment of sensory dysfunction.

Question 2: What is the best next step in the management of this patient?
A. Oral prednisone
B. Supportive care
C. Oral antihistamines and reassurance
D. Topical antibiotics
E. Methotrexate

Answers:
A. Oral prednisone – Correct. Corticosteroids are the first-line therapeutic option in the management of Sweet syndrome, with most patients showing rapid clinical response. In fact, improvement with systemic corticosteroids is included in the diagnostic criteria for Sweet syndrome. Topical or intralesional corticosteroids may be considered in patients with localized disease. Alternative first-line therapeutic options include colchicine, dapsone, and potassium iodide. Our patient showed rapid improvement with 60 mg daily of oral prednisone, with near-complete resolution of her rash and pruritus at 2-week follow-up.
B. Supportive care – Incorrect. Supportive care is the mainstay of management for Stevens-Johnson syndrome, but pharmacologic therapy is indicated in the treatment of Sweet syndrome.
C. Oral antihistamines and reassurance – Incorrect. Although drug-induced Sweet syndrome may improve following discontinuation of the offending medication, antihistamines and reassurance alone would not be appropriate. Oral antihistamines may be used for symptomatic relief, but further pharmacologic therapy is indicated.
D. Topical antibiotics – Incorrect. Postoperative infection and bacterial sepsis are important initial considerations in the differential diagnosis of this patient with fever, rash, and leukocytosis following surgery. Empiric intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were administered until the correct diagnosis of Sweet syndrome was established. In this situation of a systemic illness, topical antibiotic therapy is not indicated.
E. Methotrexate – Incorrect. Methotrexate has been used with success in refractory cases of Sweet syndrome. However, it is not a first-line treatment option.

### Dermatitis of the ear… [^114ifUPV]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Dermatitis of the ear has been a subject of difference of opinion between dermatologists and otologists with regard to causation and treatment. Thus many otologists would emphasize the factor of fungal infestation in the causation of dermatitis of the external ear whereas according to the dermatologist dermatitis involving the external portions of the ear and retroauricular region may result from many diverse factors. 1 It is obvious that there must be an empirical background for these divergent opinions, the probability being that the relatively simple and easily cured cases have remained in the hands of the otologist who first saw them while the refractory cases have been referred to the dermatologist.

### Topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^112z3DZy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antiseptics, one of the possible treatments for CSOM, inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antiseptics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). Antiseptics or their application can cause irritation of the skin of the outer ear, manifesting as discomfort, pain or itching. Some antiseptics (such as alcohol) may have the potential to be toxic to the inner ear (ototoxicity), with a possible increased risk of causing sensorineural hearing loss, dizziness or tinnitus.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 4, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving patients (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antiseptic agent of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. Two main comparisons were topical antiseptics compared to: a) placebo or no intervention; and b) another topical antiseptic (e.g. topical antiseptic A versus topical antiseptic B). Within each comparison we separated studies where both groups of patients had received topical antiseptics a) alone or with aural toileting and b) on top of antibiotic treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

Five studies were included. It was not possible to calculate the total number of participants as two studies only provided the number of ears included in the study. A. Topical antiseptic (boric acid) versus placebo or no treatment (all patients had aural toileting) Three studies compared topical antiseptics with no treatment, with one study reporting results we could use (254 children; cluster-RCT). This compared the instillation of boric acid in alcohol drops versus no ear drops for one month (both arms used daily dry mopping). We made adjustments to the data to account for the intra-cluster correlation. The very low certainty of the evidence means it is uncertain whether or not treatment with an antiseptic leads to an increase in resolution of ear discharge at both four weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20 to 3.16; 174 participants) and at three to four months (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.47; 180 participants). This study narratively described no differences in suspected ototoxicity or hearing outcomes between the arms (very low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported results for health-related quality of life, adverse effects or serious complications. B. Topical antiseptic A versus topical antiseptic B Two studies compared different antiseptics but only one (93 participants), comparing a single instillation of boric acid powder with daily acetic acid ear drops, provided any information for this comparison. The very low certainty of the evidence means that it is uncertain whether more patients had resolution of ear discharge with boric acid powder compared to acetic acid at four weeks (RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.53; 93 participants), or whether there was a difference between the arms with respect to ear discomfort due to the low number of reported events (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.81; 93 participants). Narratively, the study reported no difference in hearing outcomes between the groups. None of the included studies reported any of the other primary or secondary outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to paucity of the evidence and the very low certainty of that which is available the effectiveness and safety profile of antiseptics in the treatment of CSOM is uncertain.

Usher syndrome is heterogeneous, both clinically and genetically, and has been classified into three distinct clinical subtypes — USH1, USH2, and USH3 — based on symptom severity, progression, and age at onset. These three clinical subtypes are associated with nine causal genes encoding various proteins expressed in the inner ear and retina and playing key roles in auditory sensory cell development and function, and photoreceptor maintenance. However, a growing list of additional genes have been reported to be associated with a poorly defined clinical subtype called "atypical Usher syndrome" that does not meet the canonical criteria for the three recognized Usher syndrome subtypes (Bolz; Castiglione and Moller; Fuster-Garcia et al; Nisenbaum et al; Nolen et al; Stiff et al.). Moreover, for each Usher syndrome-associated gene, clinical features can vary according to the type and location of the causal gene, making it difficult to achieve an accurate diagnosis and classification of Usher syndrome (Bolz; Castiglione and Moller; Fuster-Garcia et al; Nisenbaum et al; Nolen et al; Stiff et al.). The early and accurate diagnosis of Usher syndrome is essential for effective clinical management of the patient, and to improve our understanding of genotype–phenotype relationships in USH, in anticipation of treatment options, including cochlear implantation. Here, we summarize key information about the clinical and genetic aspects of Usher syndrome. The list of genes associated with Usher syndrome has grown in recent years. We therefore revisit this list, considering the available information about the classic Usher genes and the atypical and ultra-rare Usher-like forms, and the function of the corresponding proteins in the inner ear and eye. The redefinition of criteria for Usher syndrome is important for clinicians, scientists, and patients; it will improve patient screening and counseling, and accurately guide the development of precision medicine-based therapies.

Anatomy and function of the inner ear and eye, the sensory organs targeted by Usher syndrome

The main target organs of Usher syndrome are the inner ear and eye. The extent of the sensory deficit in these two sensory organs determines the severity of clinical symptoms, according to the form of Usher syndrome. Below, we provide general information about the anatomy of these organs, focusing on key Usher target cells.

### Capsaicin for non-allergic rhinitis [^111qL8iu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There are many forms of rhinitis. Patients are diagnosed with non-allergic rhinitis when anatomic, infectious and allergic aetiologies have been excluded. The symptoms, including nasal congestion, blockage or obstruction, clear rhinorrhoea, sneezing and, less frequently, nasal itching, can range from mild to debilitating. It affects between 25% and 50% of patients with rhinitis. Several medications are widely used in the treatment of non-allergic rhinitis, including oral and topical nasal antihistamines, intranasal and (rarely) systemic corticosteroids, and anticholinergics. Capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, delivered intranasally, is considered a treatment option for non-allergic rhinitis.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of capsaicin in the management of non-allergic rhinitis compared with no therapy, placebo or other topical or systemic medications, or two or more of the above therapies in combination, or different capsaicin regimens.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 5); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 24 June 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in adult patients with non-allergic rhinitis comparing intranasal capsaicin with no therapy, placebo or other topical or systemic medications, or their combinations.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included four studies (five publications) involving 302 participants with idiopathic non-allergic rhinitis. All the included studies described patients with moderately severe, idiopathic non-allergic rhinitis who were between the ages of 16 and 65. Studies had follow-up periods ranging from four to 38 weeks. The overall risk of bias in the studies was either high or unclear (two studies had overall high risk of bias, while two others had low to unclear risk of bias). Using the GRADE system we assessed the evidence as being of low to moderate quality. A meta-analysis was not possible, given lack of similarity of the reported outcomes. Two studies compared capsaicin with placebo. One study reported that capsaicin resulted in an improvement of overall nasal symptoms (a primary outcome) measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0 to 10. There was a mean difference (MD) of -3.34 (95% confidence interval (CI) -5.24 to -1.44), MD -3.73 (95% CI -5.45 to -2.01) and MD -3.52 (95% CI -5.55 to -1.48) at two, 12 and 36 weeks post-treatment, respectively. Another study reported that, compared to placebo, capsaicin (at 4 µg/puff) was more likely to produce overall symptom resolution (reduction in nasal blockage, sneezing/itching/coughing and nasal secretion measured with a daily record chart) at four weeks post-treatment (a primary outcome). The risk ratio (RR) was 3.17 (95% CI 1.38 to 7.29). One study compared capsaicin to budesonide (an intranasal corticosteroid). This study found that patients treated with capsaicin had a better overall symptom score compared to those treated with budesonide (MD 2.50, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.94, VAS of 0 to 10). However, there were no differences in the individual symptom scores for headache, postnasal drip, rhinorrhoea, nasal blockage, sneezing and sore throat assessed during the last three days of a four-week treatment. One study compared two different regimens of capsaicin administration: five treatments in one day versus five treatments given every two to three days during two weeks. Using daily record charts, the study reported significant improvement of individual symptom scores for rhinorrhoea in patients treated five times per day, however numerical data were not presented. There were no improvements in the other outcomes: rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction, sneezing and overall nasal symptoms, measured on a VAS. Finally, one of these studies also compared three doses of capsaicin (to placebo). Patients treated with a 1 µg versus 4 µg per puff dose of capsaicin had a worse daily record chart overall symptom score resolution (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.16). Only one study attempted to measure adverse effects (a primary outcome), however due to methodological issues with the assessment we are unable to draw any conclusions. We sought to include other secondary outcomes (e.g. quality of life measures, treatment dropouts, endoscopic scores, turbinate or mucosal size, cost of therapy), but none of these were measured or reported in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Capsaicin may be an option in the treatment of idiopathic non-allergic rhinitis. It is given in the form of brief treatments, usually during the same day. It appears to have beneficial effects on overall nasal symptoms up to 36 weeks after treatment, based on a few, small studies (low-quality evidence). Well-conducted randomised controlled trials are required to further advance our understanding of the effectiveness of capsaicin in non-allergic rhinitis, especially in patients with non-allergic rhinitis of different types and severity, and using different methods of capsaicin application.

### Psychogenic itch [^117LnLkn]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psychogenic itch is a diagnosis that is (too) frequently proposed by physicians, but patients diagnosed with psychogenic itch are (too) rarely referred to psychiatrists. Only 62 references containing the key word "psychogenic itch" could be obtained from PubMed in July 2017. Psychogenic itch is also known as psychogenic pruritus, somatoform pruritus, functional itch disorder, or functional pruritus, but "psychogenic itch" is the most commonly used denomination.

In this review, data on itch will be first provided. Then epidemiology and definition, as well as differential diagnosis and inclusion in classifications will be discussed. Physiopathological and psychopathological points of view will be debated. Finally, the consequences of psychogenic itch and its management will be exposed.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^114RqM41]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Itch, also known as pruritus, is defined as an uncomfortable sensation that provokes an urge to scratch. It impairs the quality of life (QOL) of those experiencing itch and can be debilitating and even lethal when it becomes severe and/or chronic. Therefore, dermatologists and physicians who see patients with itch must be knowledgeable about it. This review will provide an overview of the pathophysiology and treatment strategies for itch, with a particular focus on itch with no underlying primary pruritic skin disease.

### Interventions for acute otitis externa [^111qDrVB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.

Search Strategy

Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible. We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa and furunculosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low. Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial). In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various topical interventions reviewed. One notable exception involved a trial of high quality which showed that acetic acid was significantly less effective when compared with antibiotic/steroid drops in terms of cure rate at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) and OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58) respectively). One trial of low quality comparing quinolone with non-quinolone antibiotics did not find any difference in clinical cure rate. No trials evaluated the effectiveness of ear cleaning. Only two trials evaluated steroid-only drops. One trial of low quality suggested no significant difference between steroid and antibiotic/steroid but did not report the magnitude or precision of the result. Another trial of moderate quality comparing an oral antihistamine with topical steroid against topical steroid alone found that cure rates in both groups were high and comparable (100% (15/15) and 94% (14/15) respectively at three weeks).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed. Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

### Acute otitis externa: rapid evidence review [^113JAUMB]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute otitis externa:

- **Definition**: Acute otitis externa is defined as an infection of the cutis and subcutis of the external auditory canal, possibly involving the tympanic membrane and pinna as well.
- **Pathophysiology**: More than 90% of acute otitis externa cases are caused by bacteria, most commonly P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Polymicrobial infection is common. Fungi are a rare cause of acute otitis externa.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute otitis externa in the US is estimated at 810 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The characteristic symptom of acute otitis externa is severe pain, which is typically worsened by pressure on the tragus or tension on the pinna. Other symptoms include otorrhea, itch, erythema, and swelling of the ear canal, potentially leading to conductive hearing loss. Inadequately treated acute otitis externa may lead to chronic otitis externa.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Early diagnosis and rapid initiation of a 4- to 6-week course of antibiotics help lower the morbidity and mortality, but recurrence is common.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^1163yKW9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 6 — cerumenolytic agents for cerumen impaction: Clinicians may use cerumenolytic agents (including water or saline solution) in the management of cerumen impaction. Option based on limited randomized trials, with a balance of benefit and harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C, with individual treatment arms of randomized trials showing beneficial outcomes and 1 RCT suggesting better outcomes over no treatment. Benefits are safe and effective removal of impacted cerumen, while potential risks, harms, and costs include external otitis, allergic reactions, and otalgia, and costs of agents other than water or saline solution or an office procedure. The benefit–harm assessment is a balance of benefit and harm; the role of patient preferences is a large role for shared decision making; and the policy level is Option. Exceptions include persons with a history of allergic reactions to any component, persons with infection of the ear canal or active dermatitis, and persons with a nonintact tympanic membrane. Topical preparations exist in 3 forms: water based, oil based and nonwater, nonoil based, and water and water-based agents have a cerumenolytic effect by inducing hydration and subsequent fragmentation of corneocytes within the cerumen, whereas oil-based preparations lubricate and soften cerumen without disintegrating cerumen.

### Emerging therapeutic options for chronic pruritus [^1119Yg7Q]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pruritus (CP), defined as an unpleasant sensation resulting in a need to scratch that lasts more than 6 weeks, is a prevalent and bothersome symptom associated with cutaneous conditions (such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis [AD], lichen planus [LP], etc.); however, primarily extracutaneous ailments may also play a role in the occurrence of CP. Prominent examples of the latter include end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, chronic hepatobiliary conditions, or malignancies, to name just a few. The etiology of CP may be comprehensively classified as dermatologic, systemic, neurologic, psychogenic, mixed or unknown. Therefore, physicians other than dermatologists also frequently encounter this phenomenon in both outpatient and clinical settings. The burden of CP stems from a marked decrease in various domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

### Practical guidelines for the use of steroid-sparing agents in the treatment of chronic pruritus [^113eiStZ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus in the adult patient is both an underappreciated and a difficult to treat condition. In the vast majority of cases, itch is the result of inflammatory skin disease and therefore may be responsive to systemic anti-inflammatory therapies. Urticarial dermatitis is an under-recognized cause of chronic itch in the adult population. Patients with this disorder are characterized by prolonged, prednisone-responsive pruritus, often in the absence of substantial cutaneous findings. Skin findings, when present, can range from subtle, persistent urticarial lesions to excoriated papules, often intermixed with urticaria, eczematous change, and lichenification secondary to chronic scratching. Hereby, we describe our algorithm for evaluation and management of adult patients with refractory pruritus (urticarial dermatitis in particular), including evaluation for other etiologies of pruritus, pre-immunosuppression workup, and the use of azathioprine and other steroid-sparing agents for treatment of recalcitrant itch.

### Diagnosis and management of neuropathic itch [^115LVQ6i]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pruritus is a challenging condition that can be caused by injury or dysfunction in any part of the nervous system. A vast array of clinical pictures exist, including both localized and generalized pruritus, and their principal entities are described in this article. Diagnosis is often difficult and depends on patient history, imaging, and neurophysiologic studies. Other causes of chronic itch should be excluded. The management of neuropathic itch is demanding and the majority of interventions are not curative. The best treatment options include anticonvulsants, topical anesthetics, and capsaicin.

### Itchy ear syndrome… [^116XxYFd]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — In our clinical practice, we come across a large number of patients with an itching sensation in the ear canal that is not associated with other allergic disorders. Otitis externa, caused by bacterial, fungal, or other identifiable agents, is excluded. The existence of allergic otitis externa had been well documented in the literature. 1, 2 Since there are no inflammatory changes in the ear canal, it is inappropriate to label the aforementioned patient as having "allergic otitis externa. " Hence, the term itchy ear syndrome is suggested. The cause of an itching sensation in the ears of these patients is not yet known, although release of histamine and leukotrienes3 have been implicated in similar symptoms of the eyes, nose, and throat. The symptoms are worse during the hot, humid, and dusty summer months. Instillation of otic drops containing steroids in an oil medium form]). SHENOY PK, PAULOSE KO, SHARMA RK.

### From compression to itch: exploring the link between nerve compression and neuropathic pruritus [^111q1aDm]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatments for Neuropathic Itch

Treatment of neuropathic itch as a direct result of nerve impingement can often require modalities with different mechanisms of action than those traditionally used in pruritus caused by inflammatory skin disease. Typically, mild and/or localized itch can be managed by utilizing topical medication. Moderate to severe itch and/or itch that is more generalized can be treated with a more systemic approach through oral medication. Treatment of neuropathic itch tends to involve medications that either specifically alter the nerve function or reduce the perception of itch from nerve receptors. As such, these treatments often overlap with those for neuropathic pain due to similar underlying mechanisms. It is important to note that, as of August 2024, there are no current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment options for neuropathic itch, and most therapeutic options are based on expert recommendations, off-label usage, and theoretical evidence.

### Heart rate variability subsequent to auriculotherapy among individuals afflicted by major burn scars [^116cbjzq]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgery and laser therapy have been demonstrated to be effective treatments for patients with burn scars; however, the administration of these treatments is often delayed until the scars become stable, particularly in cases with major burn scars even if nowadays, early laser intervention is discussed after 3–6 months after burn injury. Such delays may lead to more severe scar conditions and greater symptoms of postburn hypertrophic scar syndrome. – Furthermore, patients with large burn scar may face longer sessions of treatment with both laser and surgery because of a large surface of scar. Medications such as antihistamines, painkillers, and antianxiety agents are necessary, and the dosage is higher before surgical or laser intervention. Rehabilitation is vital for patients with burn scar contractures and restore normal activity; it is not the key treatment to reduce burn scar syndromes with pain and itchiness. A number of complementary therapies, such as massage, hypnosis, music therapy, and aromatherapy, have shown promise for the treatment of postburn scar syndrome. Acupuncture, which utilizes the meridian system, has also been reported as another complementary method to assist patients in coping with their scar symptoms. However, patients with major burn scars have scarring throughout their entire body, which may affect the application of acupuncture due to the lack of natural skin after injury. Therefore, acupuncture may not be a viable treatment option for many patients. Recently, interest in auriculotherapy has grown in clinical and experimental research in the field of autonomic balance. Chien et al showed auriculotherapy could inactivate sympathetic system and modulate the autonomic nervous system (ANS) with the examination of heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, Mercante et al (2018) proposed the concept of auricular neuromodulation based on the vagus and trigeminal nerves within the ears and the connections of these nerves to specific regions of the central nervous system. The 2017 Singapore Symposium on auriculotherapy can lead to significant improvements in a range of conditions, such as chronic pain and sleeping disturbance. However, Tuckey and Kohut et al showed 5 cases studies with low evidences with improvement on scar pain and itchiness following acupuncture on abnormal scars after tissues trauma. Because of inconsistent results, some methods are used for evaluation. Studies on HRV, especially lower HRV, are thought to be a helper maker of the ANS, reflexing pain, pruritis, and sleeping quality.

### Management of congenital ichthyoses: guidelines of care: part two: 2024 update [^115bTzYM]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2019, a group of experts published the first European guidelines for the management of congenital ichthyoses after a multidisciplinary expert meeting held in 2016. An update of these guidelines and literature search was planned every 5years, given the clinical, molecular and therapeutic advances, including the use of biologic therapies. We present here updated guidelines that have been developed by a reorganized multidisciplinary group of international experts after a systematic review of recent literature, discussions and consensus reached at an expert conference held in June 2023. The guidelines provide summarized evidence and expert-based recommendations that aim to guide clinicians in the management of these rare and often complex diseases. These guidelines consist of two sections. Part one is reported elsewhere. Here, Part two covers the management of complications (eye, ear-nose-throat, pruritus, pain, cutaneous infections, vaccinations, growth failure and nutritional deficiency, hair and nail anomalies, reaction to hot and cold climates, physical limitations, comorbidities) and the particularities of the neonatal period and Netherton syndrome.

### Cerumen impaction: diagnosis and management [^113EoJWW]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Cerumen production is a normal and protective process for the ear canal. However, cerumen should be removed when it causes symptoms (e.g., hearing loss, itching, pain, tinnitus) or prevents assessment of the external auditory canal, the tympanic membrane, or audiovestibular system. Cerumen should also be removed when it limits examination in patients who cannot communicate their symptoms, such as those with dementia or developmental delay, nonverbal patients with behavioral changes, and young children with fever, speech delay, or parental concerns. Patients with coagulopathies, hepatic failure, thrombocytopenia, or hemophilia, and those taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications, should be counseled about the increased risk of bleeding in the external auditory canal when cerumen is removed. Effective treatment options include cerumenolytic agents, irrigation with or without cerumenolytic pretreatment, and manual removal. Home irrigation with a bulb syringe may be appropriate for selected adults. Cotton-tipped swabs, ear candling, and olive oil drops or sprays should be avoided. If multiple attempts to remove the impacted cerumen-including a combination of treatments-are ineffective, clinicians should refer the patient to an otolaryngologist. Persistent symptoms despite resolution of the impaction should also prompt further evaluation for an alternative diagnosis.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^11134jjr]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Additional potential uses for topical capsaicin

Other chronic pain syndromes may also be responsive to topical capsaicin. For example, low-concentration topical capsaicin has been evaluated in four small studies as a treatment for vulvar vestibulitis (VVS), a highly localized form of vulvodynia, described above. – Daily administration of low-concentration capsaicin patches placed directly on the lower back have been evaluated in two controlled clinical studies. Pain reductions were observed both back pain studies, without notable or systemic side-effects. Topical, low-concentration capsaicin has been evaluated as a treatment for osteoarthritis (OA) in multiple double-blind vehicle-controlled clinical trials. From these data, albeit limited by the potential for inadequate blinding in some studies due to the lack of vehicle pungency, it can be inferred that topical capsaicin appears modestly effective, either as a monotherapy or as an adjunctive therapy.

If the primary cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain lies deep within joints and topical capsaicin does not provide substantial transdermal delivery, then the apparent efficacy of topical capsaicin in lower back pain and OA could be postulated to be by CNS modulatory mechanisms. Another possibility is that alterations in, or sensitization of, cutaneous nociceptors could be a contributing factor. Such alterations might be driven by unusually high concentrations of cytokines or growth factors in joints which could either diffuse some distance away from the primary site of inflammation or promote excitatory phenotypes in nearby collateral axons. To assess sensory function in the skin overlying the joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, capsaicin was injected intradermally over those joints. Capsaicin-induced axon reflex vasodilatation was significantly greater over affected joints when compared with age-matched normal controls and there was also a correlation between axon reflex vasodilatation and visual analogue pain score apparent in the rheumatoid group.

Non-pain indications for topical capsaicin for which there is some evidence include itch, psoriasis, and allergic rhinitis. Based on the premise that intranasally delivered drugs might exert direct or selective effects on the trigeminal sensory nerves thought to be hyperactive in headache, controlled studies of intranasal capsaicin have suggested efficacy in short-term prophylaxis in episodic cluster headacheand migraine.
