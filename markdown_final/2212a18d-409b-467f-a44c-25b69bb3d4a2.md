## Question

Duration of permethrin use for head lice

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how long permethrin should be used for treating head lice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct formulation and concentration for head lice versus scabies. Then, I should verify the labeled application time and whether a second treatment is recommended. Next, I will review the biological rationale for retreatment timing based on the louse life cycle. After that, I should consider resistance patterns and how they influence retreatment decisions. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the formulation and concentration, because I need to ensure we are not mixing up scabies and head lice dosing. For head lice, the appropriate product is permethrin 1% lotion or shampoo, not the 5% cream used for scabies, and the labeled regimen is a single application with retreatment after 7 days if live lice are still present, which I should double-check against the FDA label to avoid any confusion [^115Pux7x] [^111QYXRG].

> Wait, let me verify the application time and rinse instructions for the 1% head lice product. The FDA labeling for permethrin 1% for head lice specifies a single application followed by retreatment after 7 days if needed, and while the exact contact time can vary by product, many 1% formulations instruct application to damp hair, left for about 10 minutes, then rinsed; I should confirm that this 10-minute contact time is consistent with common OTC instructions and that the key point remains the 7-day interval for retreatment rather than extending a single application time [^115Pux7x].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single application being sufficient. I need to check the biological rationale for retreatment. Because permethrin has limited ovicidal activity, eggs can hatch over roughly 7 to 10 days, so a second application around day 7 targets newly hatched nymphs before they mature and lay more eggs; this timing aligns with the louse life cycle and explains why guidelines and labels recommend retreatment at 7 days if lice persist [^11248iCG] [^115Vun8m] [^115Pux7x].

> I should confirm how resistance affects this plan. Resistance to pyrethroids, including permethrin, is widespread and can reduce efficacy, which is why some clinicians extend contact time or switch agents after failure; however, the standard approach remains labeled application with a second treatment at day 7 if live lice are seen, and if failure persists, consider alternatives like malathion or spinosad rather than repeatedly extending permethrin contact time without evidence of benefit [^115QcTWH] [^115uF5cq] [^115xo3wV] [^115Pux7x] [^116LtSK8].

> Let me reconsider the practical steps to ensure completeness. Apply permethrin 1% according to product instructions, typically saturate hair and scalp and leave for about 10 minutes before rinsing. Then, reassess at day 7 and retreat once if live lice are present, rather than extending a single application beyond the labeled time or using the 5% cream meant for scabies on the scalp, which would be inappropriate for head lice [^115Pux7x] [^111QYXRG].

> In summary, I should double-check that my final recommendation matches both labeling and guideline logic. The duration of a single permethrin 1% application for head lice is approximately 10 minutes followed by rinsing, and the treatment course often includes a second application after 7 days if live lice remain, reflecting limited ovicidal activity and the louse life cycle. Extending a single application beyond the labeled time does not substitute for the recommended retreatment interval [^115Pux7x] [^11248iCG].

---

Permethrin 1% for head lice is applied **once for 10 minutes** [^113nyM9k], then rinsed. A **second application is needed after 7 days** [^115Pux7x] to kill newly hatched lice, as permethrin is not fully ovicidal [^11248iCG]. If live lice remain after the second treatment, switch to a non-pyrethroid agent such as malathion or spinosad [^117HksiK] [^116YTFHb].

---

## Recommended duration and application method

- **Application**: Apply permethrin 1% lotion or shampoo to dry hair and scalp, covering all hair from root to tip [^notfound].

- **Contact time**: Leave on for 10 minutes [^notfound].

- **Rinse**: Rinse thoroughly with water.

- **Repeat**: Apply a second treatment 7 days after the first to kill newly hatched lice [^116LtSK8].

---

## Rationale for reapplication

Permethrin is not fully ovicidal [^11248iCG]; eggs may hatch within 7–10 days, so a **second application at day 7** targets emerging nymphs and prevents reinfestation [^115Vun8m] [^115Pux7x].

---

## Factors influencing duration of treatment

- **Infestation severity**: Heavier infestations may require meticulous application and sometimes a third treatment.

- **Resistance**: Widespread resistance [^115QcTWH] can reduce efficacy; if live lice persist after two treatments, use an alternative agent [^117HksiK].

- **Adherence**: Proper application and timing are critical; missed or early/late doses reduce effectiveness [^114FMKtd].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommended duration

Clinical trials show that two applications of permethrin 1% (day 0 and day 7) achieve **higher cure rates** than a single application, consistent with its limited ovicidal activity [^113q3t1g] [^11248iCG].

---

## Alternative treatments and their durations

| **Treatment** | **Application duration** | **Number of applications** |
|-|-|-|
| Malathion 0.5% | 8–12 hours | 1–2 (day 0 and day 7–9) |
| Spinosad 0.9% | 10 minutes | 1–2 (day 0 and day 7 if needed) |
| Ivermectin 0.5% lotion | 10 minutes | 1–2 (day 0 and day 7–10) |
| Dimethicone 4% | 8 hours | 1–2 (day 0 and day 7–10) |

---

## Safety considerations

Permethrin is generally safe; common adverse effects include scalp irritation, redness, or itching. Severe reactions are rare; **avoid contact with eyes and mucosa** and use caution in patients with known sensitivities [^115Nbaig].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First application**: Permethrin 1% for 10 minutes, then rinse [^notfound].

- **Second application**: Repeat at day 7 [^115Pux7x].

- **Persistent infestation**: Use a non-pyrethroid agent (e.g. malathion, spinosad) if lice remain after two treatments [^117HksiK] [^115uF5cq].

---

Permethrin 1% is applied **once for 10 minutes** with a **repeat at day 7** to address limited ovicidal activity and resistance; if two properly timed treatments fail, switch to a non-pyrethroid alternative.

Background

Head lice infestation (Pediculus humanus capitis) is a global public health issue that affects people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. Although there is a lack of reliable data, the prevalence estimates of head lice infestations in school-aged children range from 5% in Europe to 33% in Central and South America. Head lice infestations affect people regardless of ethnicity and age, although it is more common among children aged 7–14 years, females and vulnerable populations dwelling in crowded environments. Head lice infestation causes parental anxiety and acts as a source of economic loss through missed school days and caregiver time off work — the annual cost in the US alone was estimated at more than US$1 billion.

Head lice causes considerable discomfort, and intensive itching that could lead to poor sleep and excoriation — although uncommon, skin breaches superinfected with resistant pathogenic bacteria can lead to secondary skin infections and lymphadenopathies. Also, affected children and their parents often suffer from social stigma, embarrassment and low self-esteem, and some jurisdictions prevent children with head lice from attending schools altogether, resulting in school absenteeism and economic loss through caregiver absence from work. Consequently, governments dedicate a relatively large amount of resources to develop new products and to design strategies for the control and prevention head lice.

There are a range of interventions available for the management of head lice (table 1). The main stay of therapy has been largely dependent on insecticidal-based approaches for several decades. However, the accumulating evidence with resistance to frontline insecticidal treatments like pyrethrins, permethrin and malathion has led to a growing incentive to develop newer and more effective treatments to treat the condition safely. Over the past couple of decades, alternative candidates have been introduced into the market, including ivermectin, occlusive agents (eg, benzyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate and dimethicone)and herbal productsand essential oils. While drugs with novel mode of action may potentially tackle the rapidly growing issue of resistance, in the absence of strong comparative evidence, the relative efficacy and safety of the newer agents and how they fare with insecticidal treatments remain unclear.

### Spinosad (natroba) [^116YTFHb]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

14.1 Head Lice Infestations

Two multicenter, randomized, investigator-blind, active-controlled trials were conducted in 1038 subjects 6 months of age and older with head lice infestation. A total of 552 subjects were treated with NATROBA. For the evaluation of efficacy, the youngest subject from each household was considered to be the primary subject of the household, and other members in the household were enrolled in the study as secondary subjects and evaluated for all safety parameters.

In Study 1, 91 primary subjects were randomized to NATROBA, and 89 primary subjects were randomized to permethrin 1%. In Study 2, 83 and 84 primary subjects were randomized to NATROBA and permethrin 1%, respectively.

In both trials, all subjects who were treated on Day 0 returned for efficacy evaluation at Day 7. Subjects with live lice present at Day 7 received a second treatment. Subjects who were lice free on Day 7 were to return on Day 14 for evaluation. Subjects with live lice and who received a second treatment were to return on Days 14 and 21.

Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of primary subjects who were free of live lice 14 days after the final treatment. Table 3 contains the proportion of primary subjects who were free of live lice in each of the two trials.

### What's bugging you? An update on the treatment of head lice infestation [^117UCtug]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2011). Low credibility.

Head lice infestation (pediculosis capitis) is a common problem in paediatric practice. It can cause considerable distress to children and their families and may lead to bullying and social stigmatisation. Therapy with "conventional" topical pediculicides with neurotoxic mode of action-such as malathion, permethrin, phenothrin and carbaryl-is increasingly associated with treatment failure as a result of the emergence of resistance within the parasite population. This review provides an overview of the natural history, clinical symptoms and diagnosis of head lice infestation. It also discusses general management principles and summarises the current data on novel treatment strategies, including wet combing, dimeticone, isopropyl myristate, benzyl alcohol, plant-based compounds and oral medication.

Measures of treatment effect

We presented results as risk ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). If an outcome was positive (for example, clearance), RRs greater than one demonstrate a favourable outcome of the intervention of interest, and these were presented to the right of the line of no effect. In case of negative outcomes (for example, safety), RRs smaller than one demonstrate a favourable outcome of the intervention of interest (represented to the left of the line of no effect). We expressed all statistically significant results as numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) with 95% CIs (Christensen 2006).

To avoid the problem of multiplicity, we chose only one primary outcome and a limited number of secondary outcomes.

Unit of analysis issues

To avoid unit of analysis errors, we included every study only once in each comparison (for each outcome at each time point). We also used this approach for multi‐arm studies given that for each comparison a single effect measure was calculated. This precluded the same group of participants being included more than once in the same meta‐analysis.

In one comparison, we combined two arms of a three‐arm study for the outcome 'complete clearance' (Sharma 2011). In both arms oral ivermectin 200 μg/kg body weight was administered on day one. After two weeks, participants in one of these arms received an additional dose of oral ivermectin. We considered both arms as treated equally and hence combined the number of events and participants when assessing the outcome after one and two weeks of treatment.

Dealing with missing data

For dichotomous efficacy data, we performed an intention‐to‐treat analysis. We imputed outcome data for the missing participants using a non‐responder imputation approach for the intervention and the control groups, meaning that we assumed treatment failure for all missing participant data (conservative approach, Higgins 2011). Participants were analysed in the group to which they had been randomized. We specified the amount of imputed participant data as footnotes in the forest plots.

Some study authors reported insufficient information on safety outcomes. In such cases we reported data as presented by the study authors.

If there were inconsistencies within a publication regarding the reported data, we asked the author for clarification. We sent two e‐mails if contact details were provided in the publication or if we were able to identify them elsewhere.

### Scabies [^115BDQSM]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Scabies is a common public health problem, with an estimated prevalence of 300 million cases worldwide, the majority in resource-poor countries. In industrialised countries, it is most common in institutionalised communities.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of topical treatments for scabies? What are the effects of systemic treatments for scabies? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found two systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: benzyl benzoate (topical), crotamiton (topical), lindane (topical), malathion (topical), ivermectin (oral), permethrin (topical), and sulphur compounds (topical).

### More than skin deep: severe iron deficiency anemia and eosinophilia associated with pediculosis capitis and corporis infestation [^115v6ePb]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Body lice infestation reflects poor personal hygiene. Infested individuals should be bathed. Clothing/bedding should be discarded or washed in hot water (≥ 130°F) with high-heat machine drying. Although in our case, permethrin was administered before dermatology consultation, pediculicides are generally not required to treat body lice. In contrast, head lice infestation requires use of a topical pediculicide followed by removal of remaining lice with a nit comb every 2 to 3 days to decrease possibility of reinfestation. Depending on the pediculicide used, repeat treatment 7 to 10 days later may be needed to kill hatched lice before new eggs are produced, as many treatments are partially ovicidal.

Pediculosis continues to be a significant ailment on a global scale, including in the United States and Europe, where it is an increasingly relevant health condition because of growing homeless and migrant populations. Health care providers should utilize physical examination findings and clothing inspection to make the diagnosis of pediculosis corporis. In patients with heavy or prolonged pediculosis, health care providers have a potentially critical opportunity to identify iron deficiency anemia that may otherwise remain undetected until end-organ damage has occurred. Clinical relevance of eosinophilia in lice infestation is unclear. Body lice remain key vectors for contemporary B quintana, B recurrentis, and R prowazekii infections.

### Head lice [^117KXYZ1]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Head lice can only be diagnosed by finding live lice, as eggs take 7 days to hatch and may appear viable for weeks after death of the egg. Infestation may be more likely in school children, with risks increased in children with more siblings, longer hair, and of lower socioeconomic group.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for head lice? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: dimeticone, herbal and essential oils, insecticide combinations, lindane, malathion, mechanical removal by combing ('bug busting'), oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazone (co-trimoxazole, TMP-SMX), permethrin, phenothrin, and pyrethrum.

### Spinosad [^115BAaqj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Head Lice Infestations

Two multicenter, randomized, investigator-blind, active-controlled trials were conducted in 1038 subjects 6 months of age and older with head lice infestation. A total of 552 subjects were treated with Spinosad Topical Suspension. For the evaluation of efficacy, the youngest subject from each household was considered to be the primary subject of the household, and other members in the household were enrolled in the study as secondary subjects and evaluated for all safety parameters.

In Study 1, 91 primary subjects were randomized to Spinosad Topical Suspension, and 89 primary subjects were randomized to permethrin 1%. In Study 2, 83 and 84 primary subjects were randomized to Spinosad Topical Suspension and permethrin 1%, respectively.

In both trials, all subjects who were treated on Day 0 returned for efficacy evaluation at Day 7. Subjects with live lice present at Day 7 received a second treatment. Subjects who were lice free on Day 7 were to return on Day 14 for evaluation. Subjects with live lice and who received a second treatment were to return on Days 14 and 21.

Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of primary subjects who were free of live lice 14 days after the final treatment. Table 3 contains the proportion of primary subjects who were free of live lice in each of the two trials.

### Permethrin and malathion resistance in head lice: results of ex vivo and molecular assays [^115dNkkJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of head lice infestation relies on the application of topical insecticides. Overuse of these products has led to the emergence of resistance to pyrethroids and malathion worldwide. Permethrin resistance in head lice is mostly conferred by the knockdown resistance (kdr) trait.

Objective

To evaluate the occurrence of permethrin- and malathion-resistant head lice in Paris.

Methods

A prospective survey was conducted in 74 elementary schools. Live lice collected on schoolchildren were randomly selected and submitted to ex vivo bioassays or underwent individual DNA extraction. A fragment of kdr-like gene was amplified and compared with wild-type sequences.

Results

Live head lice were detected in 574 children. Ex vivo assays showed no surviving lice after a 1-hour contact with malathion while most lice died after a 1-hour exposure to permethrin and piperonyl butoxide (85.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 83.9–87.5). Among the 670 lice with workable DNA sequences, 661 lice (98.7%, 95% CI 97.7–99.3) had homozygous kdr mutations.

Limitations

The findings of this large-scale survey of the occurrence of insecticide-resistant head lice indicated a major insecticide pressure in the study population, but it was not sufficient to draw conclusions about other populations. The presence of T917I-L920F mutations in kdr gene may not correlate with treatment failure in prospective studies.

Conclusion

The high occurrence of kdr mutant allele suggests that insecticide resistance was already strongly established in the studied population. This finding must be interpreted with caution as it may not be predictive of treatment failure.

### Lice and scabies: treatment update [^112yCnLs]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Pediculosis and scabies are caused by ectoparasites. Pruritus is the most common presenting symptom. Head and pubic lice infestations are diagnosed with visualization of live lice. Nits (lice eggs or egg casings) alone are not sufficient to diagnose a current infestation. A "no-nit" policy for return to school is not recommended because nits can remain even after successful treatment. First-line pharmacologic treatment for pediculosis is permethrin 1% lotion or shampoo. Newer treatments are available but costly, and resistance patterns are generally unknown. Noninsecticidal agents, including dimethicone and isopropyl myristate, show promise in the treatment of pediculosis. Extensive environmental decontamination is not necessary after pediculosis is diagnosed. In adults, the presence of pubic lice should prompt an evaluation for sexually transmitted infections. Body lice infestation should be suspected in patients with pruritus who live in crowded conditions or have poor hygiene. Scabies in adults presents as a pruritic, papular rash in a typical distribution pattern. In infants, the rash can also be vesicular, pustular, or nodular. First-line treatment for scabies is permethrin 5% cream. Clothing and bedding of persons with scabies should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. Counseling regarding appropriate diagnosis and correct use of effective therapies is key to reducing the burden of lice and scabies.

### Malathion for head lice and scabies: treatment and safety considerations [^1137PRs4]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Malathion is an under-recognized and under-utilized therapy for head lice and scabies largely due to misperceptions about its safety profile. Specifically, its pure form as it exists in pharmaceutical preparations is non-toxic to humans in the low doses available. While labeled for ages six and up, recent studies showed no cholinesterase inhibition in head lice patients aged two-to-six treated with malathion. Flammability of malathion in isopropyl alcohol has reportedly resulted in human injury once in over one million prescriptions filled. Recent efficacy studies of malathion in United States (U.S.) head lice demonstrate efficacy rates of 97–98%. In the present era of permethrin and lindane resistance to head lice, malathion is a first-line option. For scabies, it is a reasonable alternative to permethrin 5% cream, especially when treatment of the scalp or hairy areas is desired.

### Pediculosis and scabies [^113tMoE2]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Pediculosis and scabies are caused by ectoparasites; patients usually present with itching. Head and pubic lice infestations are diagnosed by the visualization of insects or viable nits (eggs). Primary treatment is topically administered 1 percent permethrin. Malathion is one alternative for treatment failures. The importance of environmental measures to prevent infestation is a matter of controversy. Pubic lice are treated the same as head lice, but this finding should prompt evaluation for other sexually transmitted diseases. Body lice infestation should be suspected when symptoms of generalized itching occur in persons who do not change or wash their clothing or bedding regularly; lice may be found in the seams of their clothing. Topically administered permethrin may help to eradicate body lice, but personal hygiene measures are essential for successful treatment. Classic scabies in adults can be recognized by a pruritic, papular rash with excoriations; in infants, small children, and the immunocompromised, the rash may include vesicles, pustules, or nodules. Primary treatment for scabies is permethrin cream and environmental measures are important to prevent recurrent infestation. Generalized crusted scabies is best treated with oral ivermectin.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^112NxJUZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

Fifteen trials, comprising 1896 participants treated with ivermectin or permethrin, met our inclusion criteria. Nearly all studies were conducted in South Asia or North Africa, where many people live in poor, overcrowded conditions. We have presented our findings in five 'Summary of findings' tables (Table 1; Table 2; Table 3; Table 4; Table 5).

The differences in the efficacy results, the number of participants with adverse events, and the number of participants withdrawn due to adverse events were small.

Efficacy

We analysed 13 studies comprising 1456 participants evaluating systemic ivermectin versus permethrin. Oral ivermectin at a standard dose of 200 μg/kg may lead to slightly lower rates of complete clearance after one week compared to permethrin 5% cream (extrapolated cure rates based on anticipated absolute effects: permethrin 65%, ivermectin 43%; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.78; 613 participants, 6 studies; low‐certainty evidence), but may lead to little or no difference in rates of complete clearance by week two (extrapolated cure rates based on anticipated absolute effects: permethrin 74%, ivermectin 68%; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.08; 459 participants, 5 studies; low‐certainty evidence).

In two out of 13 studies (Saqib 2012; Manjhi 2014), the re‐treatment of participants was not planned. Uncured participants in seven studies were re‐treated (Usha 2000; Bachewar 2009; Mushtaq 2010; Chhaiya 2012; Rohatgi 2013; Wankhade 2013; Wankhade 2016); however, only two of these studies reported numbers (Usha 2000; Bachewar 2009), finding that more participants in the systemic ivermectin groups were re‐treated than in the permethrin groups. It is unclear whether the re‐treatment of participants in these seven studies who did not show complete clearance had been planned or not. Additionally, three studies reported that all participants in the ivermectin group were re‐treated after one or two weeks, irrespective of treatment response (Das 2006; Sharma 2011; Abdel‐Raheem 2016). Meenakshi 2014 repeated treatment in all participants.

### Topical ivermectin 0.5% lotion for treatment of head lice [^113b8Cgj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, adverse effects, and place in therapy of a single application of topical ivermectin 0.5% lotion for head lice treatment.

Data Sources

Literature was obtained by searching MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus (January 1980 to January 2013). Abstracts were searched for the terms ivermectin AND (head lice or pediculus or pediculosis), topical ivermectin, ivermectin lotion, ivermectin AND (pharmacology OR pharmacokinetics). The New Drug Application filed with the Food and Drug Administration and the product data sheets for ivermectin were obtained.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles retrieved from the search were evaluated for relevance to the objective.

Data Synthesis

The recommended first-line head lice treatments in the United States are permethrin 1% or pyrethrins, with malathion 0.5% lotion used as a second-line treatment. Significantly more of the 289 head lice-infested participants using topical ivermectin 0.5% lotion were lice-free at day 15 when compared with vehicle control (73.8% vs 17.6%; P < .001) in 2 studies. Although this rate is lower than other third-line treatments (eg, spinosad 0.9% or benzyl alcohol 5%), topical ivermectin 0.5% lotion is well tolerated (pruritus, the most common adverse event, 0.9%) and requires only a single application.

Conclusions

Topical ivermectin 0.5% lotion kills head lice by increasing chloride in muscle cells, causing hyperpolarization and paralysis. Only 1 application is required; when the treated eggs hatch, the lice are not viable because they cannot feed as a result of pharyngeal muscle paralysis. Minimal systemic absorption occurs following topical application. Studies have demonstrated that topical ivermectin 0.5% is a safe and efficacious treatment for head lice. Although it has no documented resistance, there is limited clinical experience, it requires a prescription, and it is expensive. Therefore it should be reserved as a third-line treatment for head lice in the United States.

### Spinosad for treatment of head lice infestation [^114XGwMQ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, and safety profile of spinosad 0.9% topical lotion, a recently approved pediculicide for treatment of head lice infestation.

Data Sources

English-language articles indexed in MEDLINE (1948-May 2011), Toxline, Google Scholar, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2011), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (1981-May 2011) were identified, using the search terms spinosad, head lice, and pediculosis capitis.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Available English-language articles were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

In the studies that were reviewed, the percentage of patients who were lice free 14 days after the last treatment was significantly higher in the spinosad groups compared to the permethrin groups (84.6% vs 44.9% and 86.7% vs 42.9%, respectively; p < 0.001 for both studies). Additionally, the proportion of all primary and nonprimary participants determined to be lice free following only 1 treatment with the study medication was higher among patients in the spinosad groups compared with those in the permethrin groups. Application-site erythema was observed in patients in both treatment groups; however, it was more common in patients in the permethrin groups compared with those receiving spinosad (6.8% vs 3.1%, respectively; p = 0.007). No serious adverse effects were reported by patients receiving spinosad. Adherence was higher in the spinosad groups compared with the permethrin groups, although adherence overall was high in both studies. These data suggest that spinosad is a safe and effective treatment for the eradication of head lice, and the ease of administration and improved adherence with spinosad could offer an advantage over currently available treatment options.

Conclusions

Because of its established efficacy, favorable safety profile, and ease of application, spinosad can be considered a convenient and effective treatment for head lice in patients aged 4 years and older.

### Permethrin (Elimite) [^111PTLp7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Adults and Children - Thoroughly massage ELIMITE®(permethrin) 5% Cream into the skin from the head to the soles of the feet. Scabies rarely infests the scalp of adults, although the hairline, neck, temple, and forehead may be infested in infants and geriatric patients. Usually 30 grams is sufficient for an average adult. The cream should be removed by washing (shower or bath) after 8 to 14 hours. Infants should be treated on the scalp, temple, and forehead. ONE APPLICATION IS GENERALLY CURATIVE.

Patients may experience persistent pruritus after treatment. This is rarely a sign of treatment failure and is not an indication for retreatment. Demonstrable living mites after 14 days indicate that retreatment is necessary.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^1149PEgw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Study investigators may have chosen to repeat the treatment because ivermectin, unlike permethrin, only affects the mite and not the egg. After one dose, considering the life cycle of the scabies mite (10 to 17 days), a second treatment with ivermectin might be necessary. Alternatively, ivermectin might have a slower onset of action. Studies that included some form of re‐treatment (see Appendix 3) comparing permethrin cream and oral ivermectin may lead to little or no difference in rates of complete clearance after four weeks (extrapolated cure rates based on anticipated absolute effects: 1 to 3 applications of permethrin 93%, 1 to 3 doses of ivermectin 86%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; 581 participants, 5 studies; low‐certainty evidence). Considering the cure rates after one or two weeks of treatment, we assume that the number of participants needing re‐treatment was low to medium. However, suboptimal reporting precludes further judgement.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^112FfmNU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed heterogeneity by visually inspecting forest plots, calculating an I² statistic, and carrying out a Chi² test for heterogeneity using RevMan 5 (RevMan 2014). If we detected heterogeneity (that is, I² statistic > 50%), we undertook subgroup or sensitivity analysis, or both, to explore the causes of the heterogeneity (Higgins 2011).

If heterogeneity was low or not detected, we pooled results from trials using a random‐effects meta‐analysis model, because we anticipated that the different studies would estimate different intervention effects (DerSimonian 1986; Higgins 2011).

Assessment of reporting biases

Had we included 10 or more studies comparing the same intervention, we would have evaluated a funnel plot. However, this was not the case, and we were unable to assess publication bias. We aimed at avoiding the introduction of other types of reporting bias at the systematic review level by conducting extensive searches and including all languages.

Data synthesis

We have summarized and presented qualitative information (for example, study design, description of participants, study groups, outcome measurements) in the Characteristics of included studies tables. We calculated RRs and 95% CIs using Review Manager 5 for each of the preselected outcomes and pooled data using a random‐effects model if appropriate (RevMan 2014).

Where a meta‐analysis could not be performed (for example, due to effects being reported as percentages only), we described the results in the text.

### WITHDRAWN: interventions for treating headlice [^111xeZsa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Infection with head lice is a widespread condition in developed and developing countries. Infection occurs most commonly in children, but also affects adults. If left untreated the condition can become intensely irritating and skin infections may occur if the bites are scratched.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess the effects of interventions for head lice.

Search Strategy

Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group specialized trials register (July 2002); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2002); MEDLINE and TOXLINE (1966 to July 2002); EMBASE (1980 to May 2002); LILACS (July 2002); Science Citation Index (1981 to July 2002); BIOSIS (1985 to July 2002); reference lists of relevant articles; pharmaceutical companies producing pediculicides (published and unpublished trials); UK and US Regulatory Authorities.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials (published and unpublished) or trials using alternate allocation were sought which compared pediculicides with the same and different formulations of other pediculicides, and pediculicides with physical methods.

Data Collection and Analysis

Of the 71 identified studies, only four met the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. One reviewer extracted the data.

Main Results

We found no evidence that any one pediculicide has greater effect than another. The two studies comparing malathion and permethrin with their respective vehicles showed a higher cure rate for the active ingredient than the vehicle. Another study comparing synergised pyrethrins with permethrin showed their effects to be equivalent. A comparative trial of malathion lotion vs combing, showed combing to be ineffective for the cureative treatment of head lice infection. Adverse effects were reported in a number of trials and were all minor, although reporting quality varied between trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Permethrin, synergised pyrethrin and malathion were effective in the treatment of head lice. However, the emergence of drug resistance since these trials were conducted means there is no direct contemporary evidence of the comparative effectiveness of these products. The 'best' choice will now depend on local resistance patterns. Physical treatment methods(BugBusting) were shown ot be ineffective to treat head lice. No evidence exists regarding other chemical control methods such as the use of herbal treatments, when used in the curative treatment of head lice. Future trials should take into account the methodological recommendations that arise from this review.

### An observer-blinded study of 1% permethrin creme rinse with and without adjunctive combing in patients with head lice [^113q3t1g]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine if NIX (Warner Lambert Healthcare, Morris Plains, NJ) 1% Permethrin Creme Rinse Lice Treatment (1% PLT) without combing will effectively treat ≥ 95% of patients on day 2 or on day 15; to determine whether combing influences efficacy.

Study Design

A randomized, observer-blinded study enrolled 95 infested adults and children. All patients were treated with 1% PLT on day 1 and, if still infested, on day 8. One third of households were randomized to the combing group and two thirds to the no-combing group. Efficacy was assessed by: (1) visual inspection on days 1, 2, 8, 9, and 15 and, (2) shampooing/straining on days 2, 9, and 15. The target efficacy was 95%.

Results

In the no-combing group, the lice-free rate was 83.1% on day 2 (95% CI, 71.0–91.6), 45.8% on day 8 (before second treatment) (95% CI, 32.7–59.2), 77.6% on day 9 (95% CI, 64.7–87.5), and 78.3% on day 15 (95% CI, 65.8–87.9). Adjunctive combing did not improve efficacy on any day.

Conclusions

In this population, 1% PLT was significantly less than 95% effective and suggests resistance to 1% PLT. The failure of nit removal combing by nonprofessional caregivers to improve efficacy demonstrates the unreliability of combing as adjunctive treatment in this setting.

Treatment of head louse infection is primarily through topical insecticides. However, there is growing evidence of resistance. A representative population sample was tested using biochemical and molecular methods; it was shown that, in Wales, treatments containing pyrethroids are likely to be less effective in controlling head louse infection than those containing organophosphates.

### A simple treatment for head lice: dry-on, suffocation-based pediculicide [^111WS5gk]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

The emergence of drug-resistant lice has created the need for new therapies. This study assesses a new method without neurotoxins, extensive household cleaning, or nit removal.

Methods

One hundred thirty-three subjects participated in 2 open clinical trials. In the first trial, 93 subjects completed treatment using a nontoxic, dry-on, suffocation-based, pediculicide lotion, minimal household cleaning measures, and physical removal of the nits. In the second trial, 40 subjects completed treatment using an identical protocol except that the nits were not removed. Head lice infestation was defined as a wet combing test showing lice. Cure was defined as a wet combing test showing no lice, with an absence of symptoms. Subjects were contacted 6 months later, for assessment of their disease status.

Results

Cure was achieved for 97% of the patients in the first trial and 95% in the second trial. Remission at the follow-up assessment was reported for 77 of 82 subjects (94%) in the first trial and 36 of 38 subjects (95%) in the second trial. There was no statistical difference in cure rates or remission rates between the protocols with and without nit removal. The overall cure rate was 96%, with a remission rate of 94%. There were no adverse effects.

Conclusions

Dry-on, suffocation-based, pediculicide lotion effectively treats head lice without neurotoxins, nit removal, or extensive house cleaning. These results are comparable or superior to the results previously reported for treatments with permethrin, pyrethrin, and malathion.

### Permethrin [^115fFuap]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Permethrin, a pyrethroid, is active against a broad range of pests including lice, ticks, fleas, mites, and other arthropods. It acts on the nerve cell membrane to disrupt the sodium channel current by which the polarization of the membrane is regulated. Delayed repolarization and paralysis of the pests are the consequences of this disturbance.

Permethrin is rapidly metabolized by ester hydrolysis to inactive metabolites which are excreted primarily in the urine. Although the amount of permethrin absorbed after a single application of the 5% cream has not been determined precisely, data from studies with14C-labeled permethrin and absorption studies of the cream applied to patients with moderate to severe scabies indicate it is 2% or less of the amount applied.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^111N4rio]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Scabies is an intensely itchy parasitic infection of the skin. It occurs worldwide, but is particularly problematic in areas of poor sanitation, overcrowding, and social disruption. In recent years, permethrin and ivermectin have become the most relevant treatment options for scabies.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of topical permethrin and topical or systemic ivermectin for scabies in people of all ages.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 25 April 2017: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and IndMED. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the ISRCTN registry, CenterWatch Clinical Trials Listing, ClinicalTrials.gov, TrialsCentral, and the UK Department of Health National Research Register for ongoing trials. We also searched multiple sources for grey literature and checked reference lists of included studies for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials that compared permethrin or ivermectin against each other for people with scabies of all ages and either sex.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the identified records, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for the included trials. The primary outcome was complete clearance of scabies. Secondary outcomes were number of participants re-treated, number of participants with at least one adverse event, and number of participants withdrawn from study due to an adverse event. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If it was not possible to calculate the point estimate, we described the data qualitatively. Where appropriate, we calculated combined effect estimates using a random-effects model and assessed heterogeneity. We calculated numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome when we found a difference. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the control rate average to provide illustrative clearance rates in the comparison groups.

Main Results

Fifteen studies (1896 participants) comparing topical permethrin, systemic ivermectin, or topical ivermectin met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the risk of bias in the included trials was moderate: reporting in many studies was poor. Nearly all studies were conducted in South Asia or North Africa, where the disease is more common, and is associated with poverty. EfficacyOral ivermectin (at a standard dose of 200 μg/kg) may lead to slightly lower rates of complete clearance after one week compared to permethrin 5% cream. Using the average clearance rate of 65% in the trials with permethrin, the illustrative clearance with ivermectin is 43% (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.78; 613 participants, 6 studies; low-certainty evidence). However, by week two there may be little or no difference (illustrative clearance of permethrin 74% compared to ivermectin 68%; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.08; 459 participants, 5 studies; low-certainty evidence). Treatments with one to three doses of ivermectin or one to three applications of permethrin may lead to little or no difference in rates of complete clearance after four weeks' follow-up (illustrative cures with 1 to 3 applications of permethrin 93% and with 1 to 3 doses of ivermectin 86%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; 581 participants, 5 studies; low-certainty evidence). After one week of treatment with oral ivermectin at a standard dose of 200 μg/kg or one application of permethrin 5% lotion, there is probably little or no difference in complete clearance rates (illustrative cure rates: permethrin 73%, ivermectin 68%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.17; 120 participants, 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). After two weeks of treatment, one dose of systemic ivermectin compared to one application of permethrin lotion may lead to similar complete clearance rates (extrapolated cure rates: 67% in both groups; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.29; 120 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference in rates of complete clearance between systemic ivermectin at standard dose and topical ivermectin 1% lotion four weeks after initiation of treatment (illustrative cure rates: oral ivermectin 97%, ivermectin lotion 96%; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.03; 272 participants, 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Likewise, after four weeks, ivermectin lotion probably leads to little or no difference in rates of complete clearance when compared to permethrin cream (extrapolated cure rates: permethrin cream 94%, ivermectin lotion 96%; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 210 participants, 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), and there is little or no difference among systemic ivermectin in different doses (extrapolated cure rates: 2 doses 90%, 1 dose 87%; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.14; 80 participants, 1 study; high-certainty evidence). SafetyReporting of adverse events in the included studies was suboptimal. No withdrawals due to adverse events occurred in either the systemic ivermectin or the permethrin group (moderate-certainty evidence). Two weeks after treatment initiation, there is probably little or no difference in the proportion of participants treated with systemic ivermectin or permethrin cream who experienced at least one adverse event (55 participants, 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). After four weeks, ivermectin may lead to a slightly larger proportion of participants with at least one adverse event (extrapolated rates: permethrin 4%, ivermectin 5%; RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.83; 502 participants, 4 studies; low-certainty evidence). Adverse events in participants treated with topical ivermectin were rare and of mild intensity and comparable to those with systemic ivermectin. For this comparison, it is uncertain whether there is any difference in the number of participants with at least one adverse event (very low-certainty evidence). No withdrawals due to adverse events occurred (62 participants, 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether topical ivermectin or permethrin differ in the number of participants with at least one adverse event (very low-certainty evidence). We found no studies comparing systemic ivermectin in different doses that assessed safety outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

We found that for the most part, there was no difference detected in the efficacy of permethrin compared to systemic or topical ivermectin. Overall, few and mild adverse events were reported. Our confidence in the effect estimates was mostly low to moderate. Poor reporting is a major limitation.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^111BiASE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

Due to the different study designs with respect to drug dosing, we analysed subgroups according to the number of treatment doses ‐ one, one to two, or two doses ‐ for ivermectin 200 μg/kg body weight compared to permethrin 5% cream (for the outcome 'complete clearance' assessed after four weeks of treatment).

We investigated statistical heterogeneity by means of sensitivity analysis.

Sensitivity analysis

For two comparisons and outcomes, we conducted sensitivity analyses due to statistical heterogeneity. We could not identify meaningful groups of studies based on 'Risk of bias' assessments that would help explain the heterogeneity. We reported effect estimates excluding studies with slightly different treatment schemes or with a contrary result, separately (see Appendix 2).

### Safety and efficacy of a 100% dimethicone pediculocide in school-age children [^114ppK7W]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Head lice, or Pediculus humanus capitis, cause an estimated 6 to 12 million infestations per year in the U.S. most commonly affecting children 3 to 11 years of age. Head lice affect all socio-economic groups. Infestations spread regardless of the cleanliness of a home or school environment, or of personal hygiene. It is a significant public health issue due to the high anxiety for children and parents associated with infestation, as well as missed school days. Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendation not to restrict infested children from school, there are districts that continue to have a no-nit policy and guardians who keep children out of school.

The most common treatments are pesticide-based, over-the-counter remedies containing permethrin (1%) or other pyrethroid insecticides. Prescription-only options include high-dose permethrin (5%), malathion (0.5%), benzyl alcohol lotion (5%), ivermectin lotion (0.5%) and spinosad suspension (0.9%).

Pesticide-based treatments are coming under increasing scrutiny regarding safety and efficacy. Specifically, exposures to neurotoxic pesticides have been linked to lowered IQ, diminished attention span, other neurodevelopmental issues and childhood cancers. Additionally, studies have found insecticide resistance in head lice, particularly to permethrin and malathion. Given these concerns, an effective and safe alternative pesticide-free treatment is desirable.

Dimethicone (also spelled dimeticone) is a silicone-based polymer that works mechanically to lubricate hair to aid the removal of nits and lice, while physically occluding the respiratory system of the louse. Burgess found that dimethicone potentially eliminates the pesticide-resistance issue as "the blockage [of dimethicone coating the louse] inhibits water excretion, which causes physiological stress that leads to death either through prolonged immobilisation or, in some cases, disruption of internal organs such as the gut".

Two weeks' follow‐up

In the study by Bachewar 2009, none of the 55 participants experienced any adverse events. An effect estimate is not calculable; we rated the certainty of the evidence as moderate (Analysis 1.5 and Table 1).

Four weeks' follow‐up

Four studies including 502 participants reported data for participants experiencing at least one adverse event after four weeks (Mushtaq 2010; Sharma 2011; Chhaiya 2012; Wankhade 2016). We found low‐certainty evidence that ivermectin may lead to a slightly larger proportion of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.83; moderate heterogeneity: I² = 48%, P = 0.12; Analysis 1.6, Figure 6, Table 1).

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^115Ywtv9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

How the intervention might work

Ivermectin is a broad‐spectrum anthelmintic agent, which affects the nervous system of the scabies mite and causes its death (AusPAR 2013). Unlike permethrin, it is not ovicidal. Ivermectin is available as systemic antiscabies drug (200 µg/kg/dose; CDC 2017b). Permethrin is usually available as a 5% cream or 5% lotion. It is a synthetic pyrethroid, which kills the scabies mite and the eggs (CDC 2017b).

In general, permethrin is applied as 5% cream to all areas of the body from head/neck to toe. It is left on overnight or up to 24 hours and then rinsed off. Application is sometimes repeated once, about one to two weeks later. Children aged two months or older can also be treated (Currie 2010; Banerji 2015; CDC 2015; Sunderkötter 2016; CDC 2017b; Salavastru 2017).

Ivermectin is taken orally as a tablet with a dosage of 200 µg/kg body weight, usually once but sometimes a second time after one to two weeks. It has not been tested in pregnant or lactating woman and children weighing less than 15 kg. Furthermore, opinions diverge on whether the tablet should be taken with food or on an empty stomach (Currie 2010; Banerji 2015; CDC 2015; Sunderkötter 2016; CDC 2017b; Salavastru 2017).

A follow‐up visit to determine whether the patient is cured should ideally occur one month after the initiation of treatment. This time allows for lesions to heal and for any eggs and mites to reach maturity in case the treatment did not work (that is, beyond the longest incubation interval). Patients should be advised that itching may persist for one to two weeks after treatment, even if the mite is successfully eradicated (Buffet 2003). Because of this delay in symptom relief, it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish re‐infestation from primary treatment failure.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^113g7Cjo]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Ectoparasitic Infections

Pediculosis Pubis

Persons who have pediculosis pubis (i.e. pubic lice) usually seek medical attention because of pruritus or because they notice lice or nits on their pubic hair. Pediculosis pubis is caused by the parasite Phthirus pubis and is usually transmitted by sexual contact.

Diagnosis

The clinical diagnosis is based on typical symptoms of itching in the pubic region. Lice and nits can be observed on pubic hair.

Treatment

Recommended Regimens for Pediculosis Pubis
Permethrin 1% cream rinse applied to affected areas and washed off after 10 minutes
or
Pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide applied to the affected area and washed off after 10 minutes
Alternative Regimens
Malathion 0.5% lotion applied to affected areas and washed off after 8–12 hours
or
Ivermectin 250 µ g/kg body weight orally, repeated in 7–14 days

Reported resistance to pediculicides (permethrin and pyrethrin) has been increasing and is widespread. Malathion can be used when treatment failure is believed to have occurred as a result of resistance. The odor and longer duration of application associated with malathion therapy make it a less attractive alternative compared with the recommended pediculicides. Ivermectin has limited ovicidal activity. Ivermectin might not prevent recurrences from eggs at the time of treatment, and therefore treatment should be repeated in 7–14 days. Ivermectin should be taken with food because bioavailability is increased, thus increasing penetration of the drug into the epidermis. Adjustment of ivermectin dosage is not required for persons with renal impairment; however, the safety of multiple doses among persons with severe liver disease is unknown. Lindane is not recommended for treatment of pediculosis because of toxicity, contraindications for certain populations (pregnant and breastfeeding women, children aged < 10 years, and those with extensive dermatitis), and complexity of administration.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^112m4vCv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Description of the intervention

Various treatments are available for scabies. These include sulfur compounds, benzyl benzoate, crotamiton, hexachlorocyclohexane, malathion, permethrin, and ivermectin. A number of herbal remedies have also been proposed, including tea tree oil, lippia oil, T ointment, and kakawati poultice (Banez 1999; Oladimeji 2000; Alebiosu 2003; Walton 2004b; Oladimeji 2005).

In recent years, topical permethrin and oral ivermectin have become the most relevant treatment options for scabies (Banerji 2015; RKI 2016).

Topical permethrin 5% was first licensed in 1989 by the US Food and Drug Administration (Currie 2010). It was approved in Germany in October 2004 (Hamm 2006; InfectoScab 2016). In low‐ and middle‐income countries such as India, where permethrin was approved for treating scabies in 1995 (CDSCO), the treatment is considered expensive, while oral ivermectin seems to be cheaper (Sharma 2011).

In contrast, oral ivermectin was first approved for the treatment of scabies in France in 2001 (Currie 2010); in the past few years it has been approved in Australia and the Netherlands (AusPAR 2013; Merck 2015). Oral ivermectin was approved for the treatment of scabies in Germany in February 2016 (Scabioral 2016), whereas in the USA it is still used off‐label (CDC 2017b).

Topical ivermectin has also been investigated for the treatment of scabies in recent years due to the expected therapeutic efficacy. It is not approved for the treatment of scabies, but for treating head lice (0.5% lotion, FDA 2012) and inflammatory lesions of rosacea (1% cream, FDA 2014).

### Spinosad: in pediculosis capitis [^111K9NQ4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Spinosad 0.9% suspension is a topical treatment for head-lice infestation (pediculosis capitis) that has been approved in the US as a prescription medicine. Spinosad is a natural mixture of the pediculicidal tetracyclic macrolides spinosyn A and spinosyn D. Spinosad 0.9% mainly interferes with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in insects, thereby producing neuronal excitation that results in paralysis of lice from neuromuscular fatigue after extended periods of hyperexcitation. Spinosad 0.9% kills both permethrin-susceptible and permethrin-resistant populations of lice. It is also ovicidal, killing both eggs (nits) and lice. Systemic absorption was not detectable after a single topical application of spinosad 1.8% for 10 minutes in children. In randomized, evaluator-blind, multicenter clinical trials, topical spinosad 0.9% without nit combing was significantly more effective than permethrin 1% with nit combing in the eradication of head lice assessed 14 days after one or two treatments. The majority of subjects treated with spinosad 0.9% without nit combing required only a single treatment to eradicate head lice, while the majority of those treated with permethrin 1% with nit combing required two treatments. Spinosad was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with no severe or serious adverse events. Cutaneous and ocular irritation were the most common adverse events.

### Head lice and the use of spinosad [^113yCHrF]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Head lice infestations are responsible for social and economic distress. Despite a reported increase in resistance, permethrin 1% is still the first-line treatment of head lice. Alternative topical pediculicidal agents include malathion and benzyl alcohol, but resistance is of growing concern. In 2011, a new pediculicide, spinosad, was introduced.

Objective

Our aim was to review the clinical pharmacology, efficacy, tolerability, and current place in therapy of spinosad for the treatment of head lice.

Methods

Pertinent articles and abstracts were identified through searches of MEDLINE/Ebsco and MEDLINE/Ovid from 1948 to September 2011 and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1966 to September 2011.

Results

Two reports described 3 trials of spinosad used for the treatment of head lice. One study (n = 120) demonstrated efficacy of both spinosad 0.5% and spinosad 1% compared with placebo, with 82.5% and 86.1% of patients free of live lice 14 days after treatment, respectively, compared with 25.6% in the placebo group (P < 0.001 for each treatment). The difference between the spinosad 0.5% and 1% treatment groups was not significant. Two trials (n = 1038) comparing spinosad 0.9% with permethrin 1% reported greater efficacy for spinosad with absence of live lice 14 days after 1 or 2 treatments for 84.6% and 86.7%, respectively, of primary cases compared with 44.9% and 42.9% with permethrin (P < 0.001 for both studies). The most common reported adverse events were eye and scalp irritation, but they were not statistically significant (P = 0.329 and P = 0.395, respectively). Only application-site erythema reactions showed statistical significance, with 6.8% in the permethrin group versus 3.1% in the spinosad group (P = 0.007).

Conclusions

Although limited, the available literature suggests that spinosad is an effective and well-tolerated agent for the treatment of head lice. In a time of increasing resistance, spinosad has demonstrated superior performance compared with permethrin. A review of the literature did not identify any studies comparing spinosad to benzyl alcohol 5% or malathion 0.5%.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^112CBajW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Selection of studies

Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all studies identified by the search to determine those that were potentially relevant. The full texts of all records assessed as eligible by at least one of the review authors were obtained. We read all available full texts to assess study eligibility according to the inclusion criteria.

We scrutinized the trial reports to ensure that multiple publications from the same trial were identified so that data were only included once (see the Characteristics of included studies table). Reasons for the exclusion of studies during the full‐text screening phase are listed in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.

We illustrated the study selection process in a PRISMA flow diagram.

Data extraction and management

Two review authors (SR and CD) independently extracted data from the included trial reports using a standardized data extraction form (Microsoft Word). Items extracted include study characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, baseline data, definition of outcomes, adverse events, and whether participants were re‐treated. The form was piloted.

We extracted the number of participants randomized as well as the number of participants analysed for each study arm. For each dichotomous outcomes, we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event in each arm of the trial. If efficacy data were not reported using an intention‐to‐treat approach, we imputed these data employing a non‐responder imputation approach for all intervention and control groups.

Where primary or secondary outcomes were measured at more than one time point, we aimed to extract all relevant data corresponding to 7, 14, and 30 days post‐treatment initiation.

For one study, Usha 2000, we extracted percentages of participants achieving 'complete clearance of lesions' (graded as good improvement) from a graph using the Engauge Digitizer software (Engauge Digitizer). We converted the percentages into absolute numbers, as no withdrawals or dropouts were reported.

After comparing the extracted data and resolving any differences through discussion, one review author (SR) entered the data into Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) (RevMan 2014), and a second review author (CD) checked the data for accuracy.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^113qgcbJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Das 2006 and Sharma 2011 treated participants with two doses of ivermectin (initial treatment and at two weeks' follow‐up) compared to one application of permethrin 5% cream. After four weeks, no difference could be found based on the results reported by Sharma 2011 (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.14; 80 participants; Analysis 1.3: subgroup 3, Figure 5). We rated the certainty of the evidence as high (Table 1).

In the trial by Das 2006, 90.0% of participants treated with permethrin and 96.0% of participants treated with ivermectin achieved 'improvement clinically' after four weeks (no further information provided).

Number of participants re‐treated

None of the included studies had a predefined outcome measure assessing the 'number of participants re‐treated'. Hence, reporting differed greatly. Most studies did not report absolute numbers or proportions of participants having been re‐treated. In Appendix 3, we have provided an overview of when treatment was repeated. Only two studies did not repeat their intervention ‐ neither as part of the treatment schedule nor in response to uncured participants.

### Effective treatment of head louse with pediculicides [^115Vun8m]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Of the pediculicides on the market, most are not 100% ovicidal and don't have a residual activity of more than 2 days. Therefore, at least 2 treatments are necessary to control the entire louse population. In order for a pediculicide to be effective it should kill all active stages of the louse after a single treatment. Otherwise remaining lice will continue laying eggs and the following treatments will not be fully effective, at least against the eggs. However, there is no general consensus as to when the second treatment should be conducted. Taking into consideration that head louse eggs hatch between 5 to 11 days, it is suggested that a second treatment should be administered 10 days after the beginning of the treatment. This might also explain why most of the clinical trials that were conducted by treating the patients twice with an interval of 6, 7, or 8 days showed a poor efficacy, and clinical trials where the pediculicide was applied with an interval of 10 days showed an efficacy level of more than 90%.

### Evaluation of ivermectin vs permethrin for treating scabies-summary of a cochrane review [^111YSGai]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Clinical Question

Is the use of ivermectin in patients infested with scabies associated with improved clinical and safety outcomes compared with permethrin?

Bottom Line

Both ivermectin and permethrin treatment were associated with high clearance rates. There is low-certainty evidence that ivermectin was associated with slightly lower rates of complete clearance after 1 week compared with permethrin, 5%, cream (relative risk [RR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54–0.78). After 2 weeks, there was no difference in efficacy (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76–1.08; low-certainty evidence), or in the number of participants with adverse events (week 4: RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.35–4.83; low-certainty evidence).

Table 1
A partial summary of treatments for head lice, adapted from Diamantis et al

In addition to the variety of treatments, the significantly varied trial formats, and conflicting reviews from preceding decades make treatment choice in head lice management difficult. This has, in turn, caused a degree of ambiguity in terms of the relative efficacy and safety of currently existing head lice treatments. Further, owing to the increasing resistance to conventional treatments, there is a high incidence of treatment failure. Low effectiveness of the insecticidal products and the unproven nature of herbal products have led to parents resorting to dangerous alternatives, such as kerosene or veterinary flea products, in a desperate attempt to cure recalcitrant head lice infestations. Several studiesreported safety issues with many commonly used head lice treatments ranging from local itchinessto severe neurological conditions. While there is some literature on the subject, to our knowledge, there is lack of robust comparative evidence on the efficacy and safety of current treatments. Therefore, there is a critical need to evaluate the effectiveness and the safety profile of current head lice treatments to make evidence-informed recommendations for health practitioners and wider community and thereby minimise the burden of head lice.

Between 1990 and 2001, only two major systematic reviews were conducted examining the effect of head lice treatments, both of these studies had substantial methodological limitations and reported inconclusive findings. Vander Stichele et al concluded that only permethrin had enough evidence in terms of efficacy to justify its use in head lice treatment. In contrast, the Cochrane review performed by Dodd(published in 1999, and then revised in 2001) concluded that permethrin, malathion and pyrethrins were all effective treatments for head lice, although this conclusion relied on only three clinical trials that met their inclusion criteria. In 2006, the review by Dodd was withdrawn pending major substantive update — an updated study protocol that has since been, in turn, withdrawn in 2018. There is a 2019 systematic review that compared occlusive and neurotoxic head lice treatments as a group but not as individual treatments. It has been many years since a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis has been performed comparing individual head lice treatments. With Dodd review withdrawn and the review by Vander Stichele et al 25 years old, recent evidence on head lice treatment is clearly wanting.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^111wJmKM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

Applicability to Western countries and external validity ‐ apart from the obvious differences between RCT conditions and real‐world conditions ‐ is limited due to studies being conducted in regions with a high prevalence of scabies. Most included trials were conducted in lower‐middle‐income countries (India, Pakistan, and Egypt). Only one study was undertaken in Mexico in the beginning of the 1990s (middle‐income country). All studies were conducted in resource‐poor countries.

We identified only single‐centre studies that included predominately small numbers of participants per study group. The included studies were inconsistent in their descriptions, definitions, and assessments of cure as well as in the frequencies of treatment application. Pooling data or comparing data across participant groups was therefore difficult or inappropriate.

Although permethrin is an ovicidal medication, in some of the included studies it was applied twice. Conversely, in some studies evaluating ivermectin, a non‐ovicidal medication, the drug was administered only once. None of these studies explained the scientific rationale behind these a priori defined dosages, although permethrin is often administered twice due to compliance and re‐infestation issues (see How the intervention might work).

Quality of the evidence

We assessed the certainty of the evidence according to the GRADE approach and presented it in five 'Summary of findings' tables (Table 1; Table 2; Table 3; Table 4; Table 5).

The main reasons for downgrading the certainty of the evidence were the quality of the trials and imprecision in the results. In general, the methodological quality of the trials included in this review was moderate. We assessed most of the studies as having a high risk of performance and detection bias. We rated attrition bias as high in nearly half of the included studies. We downgraded certainty for imprecision, mainly because minimal clinically important difference thresholds were crossed by the CIs or the CIs were wide.

Substantial heterogeneity between trials became apparent in two meta‐analyses (Analysis 1.2 and Analysis 1.3). This could be explained by variations in the numbers of re‐treated participants, which were not stated in most studies. However, the sensitivity analyses (Appendix 2) did not help to further explain this, and it restricts our confidence in the results.

### Interventions for treating headlice [^111Sn4HW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Infection with head lice is a widespread condition in developed and developing countries. Infection occurs most commonly in children, but also affects adults. If left untreated the condition can become intensely irritating and skin infections may occur if the bites are scratched.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess the effects of interventions for head lice.

Search Strategy

Trials register of The Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group; Medline; Embase; Science Citation Index; Biosis and Toxline; reference lists of relevant articles; pharmaceutical companies producing pediculicides (published and unpublished trials); UK and US Regulatory Authorities.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials (published and unpublished) or trials using alternate allocation were sought which compared pediculicides with the same and different formulations of other pediculicides, and pediculicides with physical methods.

Data Collection and Analysis

Of the 71 identified studies, only four met the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. One reviewer extracted the data.

Main Results

We found no evidence that any one pediculicide has greater effect than another. The two studies comparing malathion and permethrin with their respective vehicles showed a higher cure rate for the active ingredient than the vehicle. Another study comparing synergised pyrethrins with permethrin showed their effects to be equivalent. A comparative trial of malathion lotion vs combing, showed combing to be ineffective for the cureative treatment of head lice infection. Adverse effects were reported in a number of trials and were all minor, although reporting quality varied between trials.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Permethrin, synergised pyrethrin and malathion were effective in the treatment of head lice. However, the emergence of drug resistance since these trials were conducted means there is no direct contemporary evidence of the comparative effectiveness of these products. The 'best' choice will now depend on local resistance patterns. Physical treatment methods(BugBusting) were shown ot be ineffective to treat head lice. No evidence exists regarding other chemical control methods such as the use of herbal treatments, when used in the curative treatment of head lice. Future trials should take into account the methodological recommendations that arise from this review.

### Treatment of head lice [^111Zb55Y]. Dermatologic Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Pediculosis capitis, or head lice, is a common infestation among children worldwide. Multiple therapies exist for the treatment of this condition, including topical pediculicides and oral medications. When used in combination with environmental decontamination, these drugs can be very effective in eradicating head lice infestation without significant adverse events. The present study discusses the use of available over-the-counter and prescription treatments, including pyrethroids and permethrin, lindane, malathion, ivermectin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, in the treatment of head lice.

### Clinical studies evaluating abametapir lotion, 0.74%, for the treatment of head louse infestation [^114FMKtd]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Head lice, Pediculus humanus capitis, have been infesting human heads for thousands of years. 1 Louse infestation is estimated to affect 6‐12 million people in the United States annually, primarily children aged 3‐12. 2 Clinical effects of head louse infestation include excoriation and infection due to scratching, poor sleep, and social disruption. 3

The majority of head louse infestations are treated with over‐the‐counter (OTC) products containing synergized pyrethrin or synthetic pyrethroid (permethrin), insecticides that target the neurologic system of the adult louse. 3 However, widespread use of these compounds and their common site of action 4, 5 may be contributing to the development of resistance in lice, resulting in a progressive decline in the effectiveness of these products worldwide. 2, 3 Resistance to pyrethrin and pyrethroid insecticides has been increasing over the last 15 years, 6, 7, 8 with recent reports demonstrating that the kdr‐ resistant allele was detected in 98.3% of 130 sampling sites from 48 U.S. states. 4 In addition, these agents have little to no direct ovicidal activity, 9 such that a second application of treatment may be needed to eliminate the lice that hatch from eggs present during the initial treatment. Administration of a second treatment too early, too late, or not at all can result in continued infestation. 10 This has led to the development of new products based on alternative chemistries and active agents. 11, 12, 13, 14

Treatments that target lice and their eggs may reduce or eliminate the need for additional treatment applications. New mechanisms of action may be effective against lice that are resistant to pyrethrin or pyrethroids. 8 Evidence suggests that proteases, including metalloproteinases, are involved in the process of louse egg hatching. 15 Furthermore, metal‐chelating agents have been shown to inhibit this protease activity in vitro. 15 Abametapir is a metalloproteinase inhibitor developed to target metalloproteinases critical to the development of adult lice and eggs. 16

Abametapir lotion is the topical formulation of abametapir being developed for the treatment of head louse infestation.

We report on two identical phase 3 studies comparing the efficacy and safety of a single 10‐minute treatment of abametapir lotion with the efficacy and safety of its vehicle control (an identical formulation without abametapir) in subjects with active head louse infestations.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^112XBdjj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Scabies is an intensely itchy parasitic infection of the skin. It occurs worldwide, but is particularly problematic in areas of poor sanitation, overcrowding, and social disruption. In recent years, permethrin and ivermectin have become the most relevant treatment options for scabies.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of topical permethrin and topical or systemic ivermectin for scabies in people of all ages.

Search methods

We searched the following databases up to 25 April 2017: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and IndMED. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the ISRCTN registry, CenterWatch Clinical Trials Listing, ClinicalTrials.gov, TrialsCentral, and the UK Department of Health National Research Register for ongoing trials. We also searched multiple sources for grey literature and checked reference lists of included studies for additional trials.

Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials that compared permethrin or ivermectin against each other for people with scabies of all ages and either sex.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently screened the identified records, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for the included trials.

The primary outcome was complete clearance of scabies. Secondary outcomes were number of participants re‐treated, number of participants with at least one adverse event, and number of participants withdrawn from study due to an adverse event.

We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If it was not possible to calculate the point estimate, we described the data qualitatively. Where appropriate, we calculated combined effect estimates using a random‐effects model and assessed heterogeneity. We calculated numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome when we found a difference.

We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the control rate average to provide illustrative clearance rates in the comparison groups.

Main results

Fifteen studies (1896 participants) comparing topical permethrin, systemic ivermectin, or topical ivermectin met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the risk of bias in the included trials was moderate: reporting in many studies was poor. Nearly all studies were conducted in South Asia or North Africa, where the disease is more common, and is associated with poverty.

Efficacy

Oral ivermectin (at a standard dose of 200 μg/kg) may lead to slightly lower rates of complete clearance after one week compared to permethrin 5% cream. Using the average clearance rate of 65% in the trials with permethrin, the illustrative clearance with ivermectin is 43% (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.78; 613 participants, 6 studies; low‐certainty evidence). However, by week two there may be little or no difference (illustrative clearance of permethrin 74% compared to ivermectin 68%; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.08; 459 participants, 5 studies; low‐certainty evidence). Treatments with one to three doses of ivermectin or one to three applications of permethrin may lead to little or no difference in rates of complete clearance after four weeks' follow‐up (illustrative cures with 1 to 3 applications of permethrin 93% and with 1 to 3 doses of ivermectin 86%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; 581 participants, 5 studies; low‐certainty evidence).

After one week of treatment with oral ivermectin at a standard dose of 200 μg/kg or one application of permethrin 5% lotion, there is probably little or no difference in complete clearance rates (illustrative cure rates: permethrin 73%, ivermectin 68%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.17; 120 participants, 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence). After two weeks of treatment, one dose of systemic ivermectin compared to one application of permethrin lotion may lead to similar complete clearance rates (extrapolated cure rates: 67% in both groups; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.29; 120 participants, 1 study; low‐certainty evidence).

There is probably little or no difference in rates of complete clearance between systemic ivermectin at standard dose and topical ivermectin 1% lotion four weeks after initiation of treatment (illustrative cure rates: oral ivermectin 97%, ivermectin lotion 96%; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.03; 272 participants, 2 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). Likewise, after four weeks, ivermectin lotion probably leads to little or no difference in rates of complete clearance when compared to permethrin cream (extrapolated cure rates: permethrin cream 94%, ivermectin lotion 96%; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 210 participants, 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence), and there is little or no difference among systemic ivermectin in different doses (extrapolated cure rates: 2 doses 90%, 1 dose 87%; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.14; 80 participants, 1 study; high‐certainty evidence).

Safety

Reporting of adverse events in the included studies was suboptimal. No withdrawals due to adverse events occurred in either the systemic ivermectin or the permethrin group (moderate‐certainty evidence). Two weeks after treatment initiation, there is probably little or no difference in the proportion of participants treated with systemic ivermectin or permethrin cream who experienced at least one adverse event (55 participants, 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence). After four weeks, ivermectin may lead to a slightly larger proportion of participants with at least one adverse event (extrapolated rates: permethrin 4%, ivermectin 5%; RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.83; 502 participants, 4 studies; low‐certainty evidence).

Adverse events in participants treated with topical ivermectin were rare and of mild intensity and comparable to those with systemic ivermectin. For this comparison, it is uncertain whether there is any difference in the number of participants with at least one adverse event (very low‐certainty evidence). No withdrawals due to adverse events occurred (62 participants, 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence).

It is uncertain whether topical ivermectin or permethrin differ in the number of participants with at least one adverse event (very low‐certainty evidence). We found no studies comparing systemic ivermectin in different doses that assessed safety outcomes.

Authors' conclusions

We found that for the most part, there was no difference detected in the efficacy of permethrin compared to systemic or topical ivermectin. Overall, few and mild adverse events were reported. Our confidence in the effect estimates was mostly low to moderate. Poor reporting is a major limitation.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^116CSpBF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Number of participants withdrawn from study due to adverse event

Four weeks' follow‐up

None of the 62 randomized participants in Ahmad 2016 withdrew due to an adverse event (Analysis 3.5). We rated the certainty of evidence as moderate (Table 3).

Topical ivermectin versus topical permethrin

Ivermectin 1% lotion (1 to 3 applications) versus permethrin 5% cream (1 to 3 applications) (210 participants, 1 trial)

Complete clearance

One‐week follow‐up

In Chhaiya 2012, 69.3% of participants treated with ivermectin 1% lotion and 74.8% of participants treated with permethrin 5% cream achieved 'complete clearance' after one week. Reported data were insufficient to calculate an effect estimate.

Two weeks' follow‐up

After two weeks of follow‐up, 100.0% of the participants treated with ivermectin 1% lotion achieved 'complete clearance' and 99.0% of the participants treated with permethrin 5% cream were cleared. Absolute numbers of participants were not reported.

Four weeks' follow‐up

Data reported by Chhaiya 2012 showed no difference between the study groups after four weeks of follow‐up for complete clearance (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 210 participants; Analysis 4.1). We rated the certainty of the evidence as moderate (Table 4).

Number of participants re‐treated

Chhaiya 2012 re‐treated those participants who were not cured at week one and week two. Non‐responders at week three were switched to permethrin. Absolute numbers were not reported (Appendix 3).

Number of participants with at least one adverse event

Four weeks' follow‐up

We could find no difference between the groups for the number of participants with at least one adverse event within four weeks of follow‐up (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.93; 200 participants; Analysis 4.2). We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low (Table 4).

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115Nbaig]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Other Management Considerations

The recommended regimens should not be applied to the eyes. Pediculosis of the eyelashes should be treated by applying occlusive ophthalmic ointment or petroleum jelly to the eyelid margins 2 times/day for 10 days. Bedding and clothing should be decontaminated (i.e. machine washed and dried by using the heat cycle or dry cleaned) or removed from body contact for at least 72 hours. Fumigation of living areas is unnecessary. Pubic hair removal has been associated with atypical patterns of pubic lice infestation and decreasing incidence of infection. Persons with pediculosis pubis should be evaluated for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.

Follow-Up

Evaluation should be performed after 1 week if symptoms persist. Retreatment might be necessary if lice are found or if eggs are observed at the hair-skin junction. If no clinical response is achieved to one of the recommended regimens, retreatment with an alternative regimen is recommended.

Management of Sex Partners

Sex partners within the previous month should be treated. Sexual contact should be avoided until patients and partners have been treated, bedding and clothing decontaminated, and reevaluation performed to rule out persistent infection.

Special Considerations

Pregnancy

Existing data from human participants demonstrate that pregnant and lactating women should be treated with either permethrin or pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide. Because no teratogenicity or toxicity attributable to ivermectin has been observed during human pregnancy experience, ivermectin is classified as "human data suggest low risk" during pregnancy and probably compatible with breastfeeding.

HIV Infection

Persons who have pediculosis pubis and HIV infection should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV.

Scabies

Scabies is a skin infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, which causes pruritus. Sensitization to S. scabiei occurs before pruritus begins. The first time a person is infested with S. scabiei, sensitization takes weeks to develop. However, pruritus might occur < 24 hours after a subsequent reinfestation. Scabies among adults frequently is sexually acquired, although scabies among children usually is not.

### Managing head lice in an era of increasing resistance to insecticides [^111cE98v]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Head lice are present in all age groups, however, the peak age for infestation is 7–8 years and the incidence varies throughout the year with higher incidence during the winter. Different insecticides have been used over the past 60 years to manage this condition. There is now strong evidence of insecticide resistance established in many countries to such an extent that some of these chemicals have become obsolete. Resistance to some pediculicides can vary from country to country and region to region within a country. The lack of a local monitoring system of resistance patterns means that parents and pupils are hampered in making an informed decision regarding how to treat head lice. One should no longer assume that treatment failure is due to poor treatment compliance or re-infestation. Clear treatment guidelines drawn up by healthcare professionals with an interest in head lice and taking into account regional/national resistance patterns should be implemented. These guidelines should combine chemical and non-chemical approaches to treatment and be coordinated and regularly reviewed by local public health departments. Drug companies should be made to provide up-to-date efficacy of their products.

### Pediculosis and scabies: treatment update [^114QxCcu]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Pediculosis and scabies are caused by ectoparasites. Pruritus is the most common presenting symptom. Head and pubic lice infestations are diagnosed by visualization of live lice. Finding nits (louse egg shells) alone indicates a historical infestation. A "no nit" policy for schools and day care centers no longer is recommended because nits can persist after successful treatment with no risk of transmission. First-line pharmacologic treatment of pediculosis is permethrin 1% lotion or shampoo. Multiple novel treatments have shown limited evidence of effectiveness superior to permethrin. Wet combing is an effective nonpharmacologic treatment option. Finding pubic lice should prompt an evaluation for other sexually transmitted infections. Body lice infestation should be suspected when a patient with poor hygiene presents with pruritus. Washing affected clothing and bedding is essential if lice infestation is found, but no other environmental decontamination is necessary. Scabies in adults is recognized as a pruritic, papular rash with excoriations in a typical distribution pattern. In infants, children, and immunocompromised adults, the rash also can be vesicular, pustular, or nodular. First-line treatment of scabies is topical permethrin 5% cream. Clothing and bedding of persons with scabies should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^115t8Nwd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Apart from a non‐Cochrane systematic review that considered several scabies treatments (Dressler 2016a), there is currently no systematic review focusing on the available evidence comparing ivermectin with permethrin. Using data from randomized controlled trials, this review summarizes and evaluates the existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of permethrin and ivermectin for scabies. We aimed to answer the following questions in relation to safety and efficacy.

Is oral ivermectin superior to topical permethrin?
Is oral ivermectin superior to topical ivermectin?
Is topical ivermectin superior to topical permethrin?
Is a single dose of oral ivermectin superior to multiple doses of oral ivermectin?

Global epidemics and an increasing number of asylum seekers due to the Middle Eastern population migration highlights the importance of this review to investigate and understand scabies interventions (Kühne 2016; Bloch‐Infanger 2017).

A Cochrane Review on 'Interventions for treating scabies' was published in 2007 (Strong 2007). This includes an evaluation of crotamiton, lindane, sulfur, and benzyl benzoate; Strong 2007 and earlier published versions are listed in the ' Other published versions of this review ' section.

Regarding medical management for scabies, more specifically with respect to first-line therapy, IUSTI 2017 guidelines recommend to offer one of the following as first-line therapy:

- permethrin 5% cream applied head to toe and washed off after 8–12 h, repeat after 7–14 days

- ivermectin PO 200 mcg/kg taken with food, repeat after 7 days

- benzyl benzoate 10–25% lotion applied once daily at night on 2 consecutive days, repeat after 7 days

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115dQCcQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Recommended Regimens for Scabies
Permethrin 5% cream applied to all areas of the body from the neck down and washed off after 8–14 hours
or
Ivermectin 200 ug/kg body weight orally, repeated in 14 days*
or
Ivermectin 1% lotion applied to all areas of the body from the neck down and washed off after 8–14 hours; repeat treatment in 1 week if symptoms persist
* Oral ivermectin has limited ovicidal activity; a second dose is required for eradication.
Alternative Regimen
Lindane 1% 1 oz of lotion or 30 g of cream applied in a thin layer to all areas of the body from the neck down and thoroughly washed off after 8 hours*
* Infants and children aged < 10 years should not be treated with lindane.

Topical permethrin and oral and topical ivermectin have similar efficacy for cure of scabies. Choice of treatment might be based on patient preference for topical versus oral therapy, drug interactions with ivermectin (e.g. azithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [Bactrim], or cetirizine [Zytrec]), and cost. Permethrin is safe and effective with a single application. Ivermectin has limited ovicidal activity and might not prevent recurrences of eggs at the time of treatment; therefore, a second dose of ivermectin should be administered 14 days after the first dose. Ivermectin should be taken with food because bioavailability is increased, thereby increasing penetration of the drug into the epidermis. Adjustments to ivermectin dosing are not required for patients with renal impairment; however, the safety of multiple doses among patients with severe liver disease is unknown.

Lindane is an alternative regimen because it can cause toxicity; it should be used only if the patient cannot tolerate the recommended therapies or if these therapies have failed. Lindane is not recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding women, children aged < 10 years, and persons with extensive dermatitis. Seizures have occurred when lindane was applied after a bath or used by patients who had extensive dermatitis. Aplastic anemia after lindane use also has been reported. Lindane resistance has been reported in some areas of the world, including parts of the United States.

### Permethrin cream 5% w/ w (permethrin) [^111QYXRG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Adults and children - Thoroughly massage Permethrin Cream 5% w/w into the skin from the head to the soles of the feet. Scabies rarely infests the scalp of adults, although the hairline, neck, temple, and forehead may be infested in infants and geriatric patients. Usually 30 grams is sufficient for an average adult. The cream should be removed by washing (shower or bath) after 8 to 14 hours. Infants should be treated on the scalp, temple, and forehead. ONE APPLICATION IS GENERALLY CURATIVE.

Patients may experience persistent pruritus after treatment. This is rarely a sign of treatment failure and is not an indication for retreatment. Demonstrable living mites after 14 days indicate that retreatment is necessary.

### Clinical studies evaluating abametapir lotion, 0.74%, for the treatment of head louse infestation [^114VcgeE]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

2.3 Study design

Studies 1 and 2 were randomized, double‐blind, multicenter, vehicle‐controlled, parallel‐group, single‐dose studies. At baseline (day 0), index subjects were randomized to abametapir lotion or vehicle lotion. Nonindex subjects received the same treatment as the index subject within their household. Each subject received a 200‐g bottle of study drug with instructions for application at home by the subject or caregiver on the day of receipt. Product was applied once to the subject's dry scalp and hair and massaged into the scalp and hair, working from the hairline at the back of the neck to the end of the hair. Caregivers were instructed to apply a sufficient amount to achieve saturation, with no more than one bottle of product to be applied regardless of the length and thickness of the hair. Subjects were instructed to cover their face and eyes during application. Once saturation of the hair and scalp was achieved, the product was left on for 10 minutes and then rinsed out with warm water. Nit combing was not permitted for 14 days before and after treatment. Subjects returned to the site and were inspected for the presence of live lice on post‐treatment days 1, 7, and 14. Trained evaluators performed systematic head louse evaluations until live lice were observed or 15 minutes had elapsed. If live lice were detected at any of the three visits, the treatment was considered to have failed, and a commercially available rescue therapy (1% permethrin) was provided. Safety was assessed according to reported adverse events and measurements of vital signs, physical examination, and scalp and eye irritation on days 0, 1, 7, and 14. Scalp irritation included erythema and edema, pruritus, excoriation, and pyoderma. Blood samples for clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry and hematology) were collected on days 0 and 14.

2.4 Endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of index subjects (intent‐to‐treat [ITT]) who were louse free at all follow‐up visits through day 14. Secondary efficacy endpoints were defined as the proportion of index subjects who were louse free at days 1 and 7. An exploratory endpoint was the proportion of all randomized subjects (index and nonindex) who were louse free at all follow‐up visits through day 14. Safety endpoints included adverse events and evaluations for skin, scalp, and ocular irritation.

### Efficacy and safety of spinosad and permethrin creme rinses for pediculosis capitis (head lice) [^115xo3wV]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Studies compared spinosad creme rinse and permethrin lice treatment under "actual-use" conditions for pediculosis capitis (head lice).

Subjects and Materials

Two phase-3, multicenter, randomized, evaluator/investigator-blinded studies compared 0.9% spinosad without nit-combing to 1% permethrin with combing (according to product instructions) in 1038 males and females aged ≥ 6 months. Spinosad-with-combing groups were included for descriptive, noninferential purposes only. Within 391 households, youngest members having ≥ 3 live lice were designated primary participants. All household members with lice received the same treatment. Participants administered product 1 to 2 times during the 21-day home-use period on the basis of complete lice eradication after a single use or the presence of lice requiring a second treatment. Scalp evaluations were performed at baseline, day 7, and day 14 (and day 21 for participants treated twice). The primary end point was the proportion of lice-free primary participants 14 days after last treatment.

Results

A total of 84.6% (study 1) and 86.7% (study 2) of spinosad-treated participants were lice free versus 44.9% and 42.9% permethrin-treated participants (P < .001). Most spinosad-treated participants required 1 application, whereas most permethrin-treated participants required 2 applications. Few adverse events were reported, but those occurring were mild to moderate, including eye irritation (permethrin), ocular hyperemia, and application-site erythema/irritation (both medications). No laboratory measure changed significantly.

Conclusions

Spinosad, which did not require nit combing, was significantly more effective than permethrin in 2 studies reflecting actual-use conditions, and most spinosad-treated participants required only 1 application. Spinosad is a more convenient and effective treatment for pediculosis capitis.

### A randomized, investigator-blinded, time-ranging study of the comparative efficacy of 0.5% malathion gel versus ovide lotion (0.5% malathion) or nix Crème rinse (1% permethrin) used as labeled, for the treatment of head lice [^1125iYuu]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

One hundred seventy-two subjects with head lice participated in a five-way, investigator-blinded, parallel-group, active-controlled study comparing 0.5% malathion gel (30, 60, and 90 minutes applications), Ovide Lotion (0.5% malathion), and Nix Crème Rinse (1% permethrin). All subjects were treated on day 1. Participants were reevaluated at day 8 ± 1 and those with live lice were retreated with the same product, for the same duration as day 1. Cure, defined as the absence of live lice, was evaluated 14 ± 2 days after the last treatment and 161 subjects completed the study according to the protocol. Compared to Nix, treatment success rates were statistically superior for all malathion gel and Ovide groups. Retreatment rate for Nix was 70%, which was statistically more than the malathion groups. The highest treatment success rates were observed for the 30-minute malathion gel (98% intent-to-treat and 100% per-protocol [PP]) and the 8 to 12 hour Ovide application (97% intent-to-treat and 100% PP). In conclusion, the 30-minute malathion gel, which contains the same ingredients and concentrations as Ovide, provides comparable efficacy, offers increased safety and is more cosmetically acceptable than Ovide.

### European guideline for the management of pediculosis pubis [^115jqaa6]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for pediculosis pubis, more specifically with respect to first-line therapy, IUSTI 2017 guidelines recommend to use one of the following medications as first-line therapy:

### Efficacy of a reduced application time of ovide lotion (0.5% malathion) compared to nix creme rinse (1% permethrin) for the treatment of head lice [^111vTLZ7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Our objective was to conduct a randomized, investigator-blinded evaluation of the pediculicidal and ovicidal activity of a reduced application time (20 minutes) of Ovide (0.5% malathion) compared to Nix (1% permethrin) in a south Florida population infested with Pediculus humanus capitis. Either Ovide or Nix was applied according to the label instructions. However, Ovide application time was reduced to 20 minutes. At day 8, subjects with live lice were re-treated with the same product and procedure as on day 1. Ovicidal and pediculicidal efficacy were evaluated at days 8 and 15. A subject free of lice and viable eggs at day 15 was considered to be a treatment success. Percent efficacy was calculated using the number of subjects free of lice and viable eggs per total number of subjects treated. We found that a 20-minute application of Ovide was significantly more pediculicidal and ovicidal (98%) compared to Nix (55%) at day 15 (p < 0.0001). The percentage of Ovide subjects who required treatment at day 8 was half that of the Nix group. The reinfestation rate was 0% with Ovide and 33% with Nix. In conclusion, a 20-minute treatment with Ovide, instead of the approved 8- to 12-hour application, cured 40 of 41 subjects (98%), demonstrating superior efficacy to Nix. The poor efficacy of Nix confirms the resistance of head lice to permethrin in south Florida.

### Permethrin cream 5% w/ w (permethrin) [^114s11TC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Permethrin, a pyrethroid, is active against a broad range of pests including lice, ticks, fleas, mites, and other arthropods. It acts on the nerve cell membrane to disrupt the sodium channel current by which the polarization of the membrane is regulated. Delayed repolarization and paralysis of the pests are the consequences of this disturbance.

Permethrin is rapidly metabolized by ester hydrolysis to inactive metabolites which are excreted primarily in the urine. Although the amount of permethrin absorbed after a single application of the 5% cream has not been determined precisely, data from studies with14C-labeled permethrin and absorption studies of the cream applied to patients with moderate to severe scabies indicate it is 2% or less of the amount applied.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^112K4y6s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

'Summary of findings' tables

For each assessed comparison we created a 'Summary of findings' table, which included an evaluation of the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011; Schünemann 2013). Using the online tool GRADEpro GDT, we assessed the certainty of the evidence as either high, moderate, low, or very low (GRADEpro GDT). Randomized controlled trials start as high‐certainty evidence and are rated down depending on the presence of study limitations (risk of bias), inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.

Risk of bias

If most of the information was from studies with an overall assessment of moderate or high risk of bias, we downgraded one (serious limitations) or two levels (very serious limitations) (Guyatt 2011a).

Inconsistency

We judged large and unexplained inconsistency based on similarity of point estimates and the extent of overlap of CIs. Depending on the magnitude of inconsistency in study results, we rated down by one or two levels (Guyatt 2011d).

Imprecision

We examined 95% CI for imprecision. If the confidence limit crossed the minimal clinically important difference thresholds, we downgraded one level. Minimal important difference represents the smallest difference between treatment groups for an outcome that clinicians or patients identify as meaningful. By default, these thresholds are 0.75 for appreciable harm and 1.25 for appreciable benefit. If both thresholds were crossed and CIs were wide, we downgraded the certainty by two levels (Guyatt 2011c).

Indirectness

We assessed differences in patient populations, (co‐)interventions, and measurement of the outcomes of the pooled studies. Depending on the extent of differences, we downgraded one or two levels (Guyatt 2011e).

Publication bias

Due to the small number of studies pooled, it was inappropriate to evaluate a funnel plot. We rated the likelihood of publication bias based on study size and sponsorship. In case of publication bias, we rated down by one level (Guyatt 2011b).

We justified and documented our assessment in the 'Summary of findings' tables (that is, in case of downgrading) using footnotes.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of interventions for treating head lice: a protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112Q7NeP]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and network meta-analysis of head lice treatments is a comprehensive work aiming to provide a strong evidence base to understand the relative efficacy and safety of existing head lice interventions. By considering and comparing the evidence on important attributes of investigated drugs, including efficacy, safety and tolerability, ease of application, and cost, the reviewers will attempt to make clinical recommendations for head lice treatment. Furthermore, this work is anticipated to highlight the gaps in existing research on head lice treatments and illuminate the way forward. The last major systematic review in this area was published nearly two decades ago only to be withdrawn soon after. This work will provide consolidated, decisive evidence to inform clinicians on the best choice of intervention to treat a head lice infestation. However, due to the inclusion of RCTs only, we may miss on important rare adverse events associated with the treatments, which would have been observed in large-scale cohort studies.

### Treatment of head lice: therapeutic options… [^116LtSK8]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Away from a host, adult lice can survive up to three days. Fomite transmission of lice is thought to be rare. Lice usually are spread through direct head-to-head contact, a route that is efficient in children. Growing resistance to many of the pediculicides commonly used to treat head lice may contribute to the recently noted increase in cases of infestation. Jones and English summarize a Cochrane meta-analysis of head lice treatment and present a general review of the topic. The authors note that, because of strict inclusion criteria, the Cochrane meta-analysis included only four of the 71 randomized controlled studies available on head lice treatment. Pyrethrins are available over-the-counter for the treatment of head lice. Two applications administered one week apart are required for treatment, because the compound does not kill the nit phase of the louse. Pyrethrins have no major safety concerns other than mild skin irritation, which occurs with other pediculicide agents as well.

Some studies have shown low eradication rates, even when the lice do not demonstrate pyrethrin resistance. Permethrin, a synthetic reformulation of pyrethrin that has enhanced stability, is presented by the authors as the treatment of choice for head lice. The Cochrane meta-analysis did not find any acceptable studies that showed permethrin to have superior efficacy. Two treatments one week apart are still recommended for permethrin. If treatment failure occurs, the authors suggest extending the time of topical application to overnight treatment under a shower cap or switching to malathion. Malathion is rapidly lethal to lice, but because of safety concerns about flammability, the authors recommend it for second-line use only in cases refractory to permethrin treatment. Use of hair dryers or curling or straightening irons should be avoided during treatment. Malathion is not approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for use in children younger than two years.

Oral ivermectin is used for treatment of intestinal parasites, but recently has been proposed as an alternative agent for head lice infestation. An oral dosage of 200 mcg per kg, repeated in 10 days has been shown to be effective. To date, no serious side effects have been reported in persons using oral ivermectin for lice infestation, although it has not been approved by the FDA for this indication.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of interventions for treating head lice: a protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115cBMpC]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Types of studies to be included

Only primary randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that are published from inception of targeted databases until 2021 will be included based on the following criteria: participants of any age with live head lice or lice and eggs (not eggs alone) before enrolment studies with either placebo or active comparator group; and reported the outcomes of interest (pediculicidal and ovicidal activities).

Participants/population

The review will consider studies that include participants of any age, gender or country of origin. Exclusion criteria include participants with other similar lice (such as pediculus humanus or 'body lice') and participants with inactive infections (characterised by no live adult or nymph lice and eggs > 2 cm away from the scalp, if present).

Intervention(s), exposure(s)

Any RCT investigating treatment for head lice will be included, regardless of the nature of the intervention. Such treatments may include insecticides, suffocation products, essential oils, desiccants, deterrents or pediculicides. As such, any intervention designed with the intent of reducing or curing an extant head lice infection will be considered in this review. Exceptions include treatments exclusively designed for ovicidal effects.

Comparator(s)/control

Dependent on each trial, any comparator may be used. This may be between active therapeutic agents or between an active agent and a placebo.

Outcome(s)

The main outcome is cure from an active infestation measured as proportion of participants being completely free from head lice after 7 days postlast treatment or within 14 days postfirst treatment. If a trial evaluated outcomes in days other than 7 or 14 days, this will be assigned to the standard time frame where appropriate (eg; an outcome assessed on days 6, 8, 9 or 10 will be assigned to day 7, while outcomes assessed on days 11–21 would be assigned as day 14). Secondary outcomes that will be considered in this review are ovicidal activity of drugs, adverse events, treatment compliance and acceptability, and reinfestation, whenever reported.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of interventions for treating head lice: a protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116yDKgx]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Head lice infestation is a significant public health problem affecting people irrespective of socioeconomic backgrounds.
Several interventions including insecticides, occlusive agents and physical methods are available for head lice treatment.

What this study hopes to add?

Despite the presence of several interventions, there is no reliable comparative data on the relative efficacy and safety of the interventions.
It is not well established whether the dose, formulation, number of treatments and duration of head lice interventions have any meaningful impact on treatment outcomes.
There is no strong evidence on the ovicidal activity of existing treatments.

### Review of common therapeutic options in the United States for the treatment of pediculosis capitis [^115uF5cq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Numerous therapies are available in both over-the-counter and prescription formulations for the treatment of head lice infestation. We summarize treatment recommendations from published literature and from a recent meta-analysis from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews that describe the efficacy, safety, and resistance patterns of monotherapies available in the United States. If treatment with pyrethrin or permethrin fails to eradicate the infestation, the treatment of choice is malathion. However, because of malathion's flammability, it should be a second-line therapy. Orally administered ivermectin has been reported to be efficacious, but it is not currently a US Food and Drug Administration-approved pediculicide. Alternative therapies are also discussed, in addition to indications for prophylaxis, resistance reporting, and the social impact of infestation.

### Effect of permethrin-impregnated underwear on body lice in sheltered homeless persons: a randomized controlled trial [^111RNLU5]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

The control of body lice in homeless persons remains a challenge.

Objective

To determine whether the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated underwear provides effective long-term protection against body lice in homeless persons.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in February and December 2011 in 2 homeless shelters (Madrague Ville and Forbin) in Marseille, France. Of the 125 homeless persons screened for eligibility, 73 body lice-infested homeless persons, 18 years or older, were enrolled.

Interventions

Body lice-infested homeless persons were randomly assigned to receive 0.4% permethrin-impregnated underwear or an identical-appearing placebo for 45 days, in a 1:1 ratio, with a permuted block size of 10. Visits were scheduled at days 14 and 45. Data regarding the presence or absence of live body lice were collected.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary and secondary end points were the proportions of homeless persons free of body lice on days 14 and 45, respectively. Mutations associated with permethrin resistance in the body lice were also identified.

Results

Significantly more homeless persons receiving permethrin-impregnated underwear than homeless persons receiving the placebo were free of body lice on day 14 in the intent-to-treat population (28% vs 9%; p = 0.04), with a between-group difference of 18.4 percentage points (95% CI, 1.4–35.4), and in the per-protocol population (34% vs 11%; p = 0.03), with a between-group difference of 23.7 percentage points (95% CI, 3.6–43.7). This difference was not sustained on day 45. At baseline, the prevalence of the permethrin-resistant haplotype was 51% in the permethrin group and 44% in the placebo group. On day 45, the permethrin-resistant haplotype was significantly more frequent in the permethrin group than in the placebo group (73% vs 45%, P < .001).

Conclusion and Relevance

Permethrin-impregnated underwear is more efficient than placebo at eliminating body louse infestations by day 14; however, this difference was not sustained on day 45. The use of permethrin may have increased the resistance to permethrin in body lice and thus must be avoided.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^113iCnF3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

For each included study, two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (Higgins 2011). We assessed the following seven domains.

Random sequence generation.
Allocation concealment.
Blinding of participants and personnel.
Blinding of outcome assessment.
Completeness of outcome data.
Selective reporting.
Other sources of bias.

For each trial, to assess 'selection bias' we described the methods used to generate the randomization list and how the allocation was concealed; to assess 'performance and detection bias' we stated who was blinded and, if reported, how this was done. In order to assess 'attrition bias', we reported the number of participants lost to follow‐up and the method study authors used to deal with missing data. If more than 10% of the participants were lost to follow‐up in at least one of the study groups, and no imputation method was used to analyse the study outcomes, we evaluated the risk of bias as high. To assess 'reporting bias', we described any discrepancies between the methods section (planned measurements) and the results as reported in the included records. For the domain 'other bias', we have listed and assessed any other potential sources of bias that may have influenced the studies' results.

For each of the domains 'selection bias', 'reporting bias', and 'other bias', we made one assessment ('low risk', 'high risk', or 'unclear risk' of bias). For the domains 'performance bias', 'detection bias', and 'attrition bias', we made two assessments: one for all efficacy outcomes and one for all safety outcomes per study. Discrepancies in assessments were resolved by discussion.

Review authors' judgements about each 'Risk of bias' item for each included study are presented in the 'Risk of bias' summary figure.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of interventions for treating head lice: a protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111Ev4g2]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Background

Head lice infestation is a major public health problem around the globe. Its treatment is challenging due to product failures resulting from rapidly emerging resistance to existing treatments, incorrect treatment applications and misdiagnosis. Various head lice treatments with different mechanism of action have been developed and explored over the years, with limited report on systematic assessments of their efficacy and safety. This work aims to present a robust evidence summarising the interventions used in head lice.

Method

This is a systematic review and network meta-analysis which will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement for network meta-analyses. Selected databases, including PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials exploring head lice treatments. Searches will be limited to trials published in English from database inception till 2021. Grey literature will be identified through Open Grey, AHRQ, Grey Literature Report, Grey Matters, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry and International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry. Additional studies will be sought from reference lists of included studies. Study screening, selection, data extraction and assessment of methodological quality will be undertaken by two independent reviewers, with disagreements resolved via a third reviewer. The primary outcome measure is the relative risk of cure at 7 and 14 days postinitial treatment. Secondary outcome measures may include adverse drug events, ovicidal activity, treatment compliance and acceptability, and reinfestation. Information from direct and indirect evidence will be used to generate the effect sizes (relative risk) to compare the efficacy and safety of individual head lice treatments against a common comparator (placebo and/or permethrin). Risk of bias assessment will be undertaken by two independent reviewers using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the certainty of evidence assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations guideline for network meta-analysis. All quantitative analyses will be conducted using STATA V.16.

Discussion

The evidence generated from this systematic review and meta-analysis is intended for use in evidence-driven treatment of head lice infestations and will be instrumental in informing health professionals, public health practitioners and policy-makers.

### Insecticide resistance in head lice: clinical, parasitological and genetic aspects [^115QcTWH]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Insecticide treatment resistance is considered to be a major factor in the increasing number of infestations by head lice. The large insecticide selection pressure induced by conventional topical pediculicides has led to the emergence and spread of resistance in many parts of the world. Possible mechanisms of resistance include accelerated detoxification of insecticides by enzyme-mediated reduction, esterification, oxidation that may be overcome by synergistic agents such as piperonyl butoxide, alteration of the binding site, e.g. altered acetylcholinesterase or altered nerve voltage-gated sodium channel, and knockdown resistance (kdr). Clinical, parasitological and molecular data on resistance to conventional topical pediculicides show that treatments with neurotoxic insecticides have suffered considerable loss of activity worldwide. In particular, resistance to synthetic pyrethroids has become prominent, probably because of their extensive use. As other treatment options, including non-insecticidal pediculicides such as dimeticone, are now available, the use of older insecticides, such as lindane and carbaryl, should be minimized, owing to their loss of efficacy and safety concerns. The organophosphorus insecticide malathion remains effective, except in the UK, mostly in formulations that include terpineol.

### Clinical studies evaluating abametapir lotion, 0.74%, for the treatment of head louse infestation [^1156c53w]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

2 SUBJECTS AND METHODS

2.1 Study oversight

Two identical phase 3 studies (study 1 and study 2) were conducted as part of the clinical development program for abametapir at multiple U.S. sites. The study design was agreed upon with the Food and Drug Administration under a Special Protocol Assessment. Studies were conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and the institutional review board for each investigation site. Written informed consent (parental assent if younger than 18) was obtained from all subjects. Studies were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02060903 and NCT02062060.

2.2 Study subjects

Eligible subjects were male or female, aged 6 months and older, with an active head louse infestation. Because of the transmittable nature of louse infestations, all family members with head lice were enrolled in these studies. The youngest household member with at least three live head lice was designated as the index subject and included in the primary analysis. Other household members with at least one live head louse were designated as nonindex subjects.

Subjects were excluded if they had used any form of head louse treatment during the 14 days before the study period or an investigational agent during the prior 30 days. Subjects were also excluded if they had visible scalp or skin conditions not attributable to louse infestation (including eczema or atopic dermatitis of the scalp) or had had a prior reaction to any product containing permethrin. If any household member with a louse infestation was not willing to enroll or was ineligible, or a subject was not located in the same household for the study period, all household members were excluded from the study.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of interventions for treating head lice: a protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111mGAq1]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Strategy for data synthesis

Data will be collected by at least two reviewers independently and manually extracted from the selected papers. Discrepancy and disagreement will be discussed between reviewers when they occur until a consensus is reached. Key values will then be entered in a spreadsheet used by all reviewers. Once information has been extracted, it will be synthesised via a narrative approach and interpreted accordingly. Where possible, data will be tabulated for ease of access and readability.

A network meta-analysis will be performed based on the intention to treat population using a multivariate meta-analysis with consistency model, with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation applied to calculate the pooled RRs across studies, with the findings presented alongside the narrative interpretation of the data. This REML model is preferred given it is unlikely to underestimate the variance like maximum likelihood estimation does. In terms of assessing between-study variations, the analysis assumes an exchangeable covariance structure at 0.5. Information from direct and indirect evidence will be used to generate the effect sizes (relative risk) for each treatment against a common comparator (placebo or permethrin). The efficacy and safety of the different head lice treatments will be ranked using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve, which shows the percentage efficacy and safety of individual treatment against a hypothetically ideal treatment. Interventions will be considered at the level of an individual drug and outcome data for multiple doses or dosage formulations of a given intervention will be merged under a single treatment node. The agreement between estimates from direct and indirect evidence will be assessed using a design-by-treatment interaction model. The hypothesis of inconsistency will be assessed by globally testing all inconsistency parameters using a global Wald test statistic, while publication bias will be assessed using comparison-adjusted funnel plots.

All quantitative analyses will be conducted using STATA V.16 (StataCorp) and a two-sided p < 0.05 will be used to show statistical significance.

### Current treatments for pediculosis capitis [^111Wq8nz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Following the increase in prevalence of head lice during the 1990s, research interest in human louse infestation is now greater than at any time since World War I. Problems with treatment, resulting from the selection of populations of lice resistant to insecticides by overuse of some types of product, have triggered an interest in the development of novel therapeutic agents.

Recent Findings

This review first discusses the background to treatment options, basic diagnostic criteria for deciding whether treatment is required and the efficiency of different techniques. Following recent evidence for resistance to insecticides, alternative therapies are examined, including plant-derived essential and fixed oils that are seen by consumers as safer alternatives to pesticides, physically acting preparations and combing options.

Summary

I have found that most diagnostic methods lack evidence of efficacy or effectiveness and the evidence for efficacy of several 'popular' options for alternatives to insecticides in treatment is either scant or missing. Claims related to the activity of some products need to be examined more deeply to determine whether they are of real value.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of interventions for treating head lice: a protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114UkSah]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Selection of studies

The retrieved citations will be transferred to Covidencefor screening, data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment. Full texts of potentially relevant studies that pass initial screening will be examined for eligibility. Where possible, reviewers will attempt to contact primary authors via email when eligibility for inclusion is not clear. Two independent reviewers will perform eligibility assessment, data extraction, and RoB assessment using the Covidence electronic platform. Any disagreements will be resolved by a third reviewer. Reasons for excluding studies/trials will be recorded.

Data extraction

This systematic review will be reported in accordance with the recommendations of the PRISMA statement for network meta-analyses. Two review authors will extract the data and check for discrepancies at each level (title, abstract and full text) using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We will specifically extract the following data:

General information: author, journal, year(s) the study took place, year of publication, country, sample size, sociodemographic characteristics of study participants; attrition and their characteristics.
Study methodology: study design, inclusion/exclusion criteria, sample size.
Details of intervention: dose, formulation, frequency and mode of application, duration of administration.
Comparators: details of the comparator group — placebo, no treatment, control intervention of non-pharmacological nature or other medicine.
Outcomes: clinical cure following the study intervention, secondary outcomes and results (including effect estimates; adverse effects, acceptability).
Study limitations.
User satisfaction/preference of studied treatments.

Where applicable, data extracted will also include: other secondary outcomes reported by the studies and not listed in this review, reasons for patient removal from the trial, major advantages or disadvantages identified in the trial and the method by which the primary outcome was measured (ie, how was the presence or absence of adult lice determined). Data will be tabulated and sorted by treatment for further analysis. If the primary outcome data are missing, the authors of relevant studies will be contacted (if possible) to supply missing information. If the data cannot be obtained, the study will be excluded.

### Head lice infestation: single drug versus combination therapy with one percent permethrin and trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole [^11296EHp]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Head lice infestation (HLI) is a vexing problem for pediatricians and families because lice are becoming resistant to approved antipediculosis agents.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy of 3 different treatments for HLI and determined whether combination therapy reduced treatment failures.

Design and Setting

A randomized, clinical trial performed in 3 private practices.

Participants

The population was children ranging in age from 2 to 13 years.

Methods

HLI was diagnosed by direct inspection of the hair and scalp. Children were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: 1) 1% permethrin creme rinse (1% PER; n = 39); 2) oral administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX; n = 36); and 3) a combination of 1% PER and TMP/SMX (n = 40). Follow-up visits were done 2 and 4 weeks later, and parents or caregivers of those who did not return were interviewed by telephone. If HLI was present at the 2-week follow-up, the child was retreated per their protocol. We defined successful treatment as the absence of adult lice and nymphal stage or eggs (nits). The presence of nits alone was not considered a treatment failure.

Results

At the 2-week follow-up visit, successful treatment for groups 1, 2, and 3 was 79.5%, 83%, and 95%, respectively. At the 4-week follow-up, successful treatment was 72%, 78%, and 92.5% for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The absolute risk reduction for recurrence comparing group 1 versus group 2 was 6%, group 2 versus group 3 was 14%, and group 1 versus group 3 was 20%. No major adverse complications were seen in any treatment group.

Conclusion

Our findings indicate that a combination of 1% PER and TMP/SMX is an effective alternative therapy for HLI. We recommend that the dual therapy with 1% PER and oral TMP/SMX be used and reserved in cases of multiple treatment failures or suspected cases of lice-related resistance to therapy.

### Ivermectin and permethrin for treating scabies [^115LxtLR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Complete clearance

One‐week follow‐up

In Ahmad 2016, there was no difference between study groups after one week of follow‐up (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.08; 62 participants; Analysis 3.1). We rated the certainty of evidence as low (Table 3).

In Chhaiya 2012, 30.0% of participants treated with ivermectin 200 μg/kg body weight and 69.3% of participants treated with ivermectin 1% lotion achieved 'complete clearance' after one week. Reported data were insufficient for calculating an effect estimate.

Two weeks' follow‐up

In Ahmad 2016, there was no difference between study groups after two weeks of follow‐up (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06; 62 participants; Analysis 3.2). We rated the certainty of evidence as moderate (Table 3).

In Chhaiya 2012, 63.0% of participants treated with ivermectin 200 μg/kg body weight achieved 'complete clearance', whereas 100.0% of participants treated with ivermectin 1% lotion were cleared after two weeks of follow‐up. Absolute numbers of participants were not reported (Chhaiya 2012).

Four weeks' follow‐up

Pooled data from Chhaiya 2012 and Ahmad 2016 revealed no difference between study groups for 'complete clearance' after four weeks of follow‐up (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.03; 272 participants; Analysis 3.3). We rated the certainty of evidence as moderate (Table 3).

Number of participants re‐treated

Ahmad 2016 re‐treated non‐responders after one week. Four out of 32 participants in the topical ivermectin group and eight out of 30 participants in the systemic ivermectin group were re‐treated. Chhaiya 2012 re‐treated those participants who were not cured at week one and week two. Non‐responders at week three switched to permethrin. Absolute numbers were not reported (Appendix 3).

Number of participants with at least one adverse event

Four weeks' follow‐up

We found no difference between groups for the number of participants with at least one adverse event within four weeks of follow‐up (RR 5.05, 95% CI 0.25 to 103.87; 201 participants; Analysis 3.4). We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low (Table 3).

### Update on treatments for head lice [^114dQZM4]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Head lice infestation is common, and mainly affects children of primary school age. Treatments include conventional chemical insecticides; fine tooth louse combs; and fluid preparations that work by a physical rather than chemical mode of action. However, each of these fails to eradicate head lice in some patients. Other disadvantages include the long contact time required for certain preparations e.g. 8 hours and the time commitment for combing regimens. Isopropyl myristate 50% in cyclomethicone solution (Full Marks Solution - SSL International) is a new fluid treatment with a physical mode of action that uses a 10-minute contact time. Here, we consider this product in the context of updating advice we gave in 2007 on treatments for head lice.

### Scabies and pediculosis pubis: an update of treatment regimens and general review [^113KHwx9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The ectoparasites scabies and pediculosis pubis are common causes of skin rash and pruritus worldwide. They are transmitted primarily by person-to-person spread and are generally associated with low morbidity. The preferred treatment for scabies has generally been topical agents such as lindane and permethrin. Recently, ivermectin has demonstrated good efficacy in the treatment of scabies, and it may be of particular use in institutional outbreaks and in communities in which scabies is endemic. Combination treatment with topical agents and oral ivermectin may be necessary for crusted scabies. Treatment of pediculosis pubis is best accomplished with topical permethrin, lindane, or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide. Although resistance to these topical agents has been reported in head lice, decreased efficacy in the treatment of pediculosis pubis has not been reported.

### Therapy for head lice based on life cycle, resistance, and safety considerations [^11248iCG]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

The timing of head lice maturation most favorable to their survival in the presence of anti-lice agents is the maximum time as an ovum (12 days) and the shortest possible time of maturing from newly hatched nymph to egg-laying adult (8.5 days). Pediculicides that are not reliably ovicidal (pyrethroids and lindane) require 2 to 3 treatment cycles to eradicate lice. Ovicidal therapies (malathion) require 1 to 2 treatments. Treatment with an agent to which there is genetic resistance is unproductive. In the United States, lice have become increasingly resistant to pyrethroids and lindane but not to malathion. Treatment with malathion has favorable efficacy and safety profiles and enables the immediate, safe return to school. Nit combing can be performed adjunctively. No-nit policies should be rendered obsolete.
