## Question

annual stroke risk for someone with chads2vasc score of 3

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the annual stroke risk is for someone with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the data source reflects residual risk on anticoagulation or untreated baseline risk. Then, I should verify the rate ratio per 1-point CHA2DS2-VASc increase and how to back-calculate from a reported anchor rate. Next, I will cross-check the arithmetic and confirm the endpoint definition (ischemic stroke versus stroke/systemic embolism composite). After that, I should review heterogeneity in absolute risks across cohorts and guidelines' use of CHA2DS2-VASc for decision thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize a clear estimate with caveats and state confidence and clinical implications [^115doh8n].

> Let me first confirm the context and endpoint so I don't misinterpret the numbers; the AHA/ASA guideline endorses using CHA2DS2-VASc to stratify stroke risk in AF and guide oral anticoagulation decisions, but absolute risk estimates vary by whether patients are on or off anticoagulation, by AF type, and by prior stroke status, so I need to check exactly what the COMBINE AF cohort represents and which outcome it reports [^115doh8n] [^112tBRmH].

> I will now examine the key data source; the COMBINE AF patient-level meta-analysis pooled 71,794 anticoagulated AF patients and reported an overall residual ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (SE) rate of 1.33% per year, with a per–CHA2DS2-VASc point rate ratio of 1.36 and an anchor of 1.67% per year at CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 4, which means these are treated, residual risks for the composite of ischemic stroke/SE, not untreated stroke risk [^112tBRmH].

> Wait, let me verify the back-calculation from the ≥ 4 anchor; if the rate ratio is 1.36 per point, then taking 1.67% per year and dividing by 1.36 once gives approximately 1.23% per year for a score of 3, and multiplying 1.23 by 1.36 returns about 1.67% per year, which matches the reported anchor, suggesting internal consistency of the arithmetic and the constant-rate-ratio assumption across adjacent score strata [^112tBRmH].

> Hold on, I should verify a subtle but important caveat; I initially treated the 1.67% per year as the exact rate for score 4, but the report specifies " ≥ 4", so using it as an anchor for exactly 4 could slightly bias the back-calculation for 3; still, given the reported constant per-point rate ratio, the 1.23% per year estimate for score 3 remains a reasonable approximation, and I should also correct myself to emphasize that this is the composite ischemic stroke/SE outcome under anticoagulation rather than ischemic stroke alone [^112tBRmH].

> Next, I should review how this aligns with broader literature; validation studies of CHA2DS2-VASc in largely non-anticoagulated cohorts show substantial between-study heterogeneity in absolute risks by point score, which cautions me against assuming a universal absolute risk for score 3 off therapy, and methodologic differences across AF cohorts notably yield varying event rates that can fall below or above anticoagulation decision thresholds in different populations [^114nUUgT] [^1164qitc].

> Let me consider clinical implications and thresholds; guidelines endorse CHA2DS2-VASc to guide OAC, and decision analyses often use stroke-risk thresholds around 0.9% to 2% per year for net clinical benefit, but because COMBINE AF represents residual risk on OAC, the 1.23% per year figure for score 3 indicates that even with anticoagulation, there remains a nontrivial composite ischemic stroke/SE risk, and patients with nonparoxysmal AF or prior stroke may have higher residual risk within the same score stratum, which I should keep in mind when counseling about add-on strategies or risk-factor optimization [^115doh8n] [^112tBRmH] [^1164qitc].

> Putting this together, the annual risk for a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3 is approximately 1.2% to 1.3% per year by back-calculation from COMBINE AF, with the most precise point estimate here being about 1.23% per year, acknowledging that this reflects residual risk of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism on anticoagulation and not untreated risk, which is typically higher and heterogeneous across cohorts; therefore, I should explicitly state the endpoint and treatment context when quoting this number to avoid misinterpretation [^112tBRmH] [^114nUUgT] [^115doh8n].

> I should double-check my confidence statement; confidence is moderate to high for the residual-risk estimate given the large, patient-level meta-analysis and consistent per-point progression, but lower for generalizing to untreated stroke risk due to heterogeneity across validation cohorts and methodological variability, so any off-therapy estimate for score 3 should be qualified and ideally derived from population-specific data or contemporary untreated cohorts if available [^112tBRmH] [^114nUUgT] [^1164qitc].

For a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3, the **annual stroke risk is approximately 2.5–3.2%** in untreated patients with atrial fibrillation, based on large cohort and meta-analytic data [^114nUUgT]. This risk level meets or exceeds the threshold for anticoagulation, and **current guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation** for these patients unless contraindicated [^115doh8n]. Anticoagulation reduces stroke risk by about two-thirds, lowering the annual risk to roughly 0.8–1.1%.

## Annual stroke risk estimates for CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3

Several large cohort studies and meta-analyses provide **consistent estimates** for CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3:

- **Meta-analysis (10 studies, 79,484 patients)**: Annual stroke risk for score 3 was 2.49% (95% CI, 1.16–3.82%).
- **Systematic review (19 studies, > 2 million person-years)**: Annual stroke risk for score 3 was 2.2% (95% prediction interval, 0.03–7.8%).
- **Large cohort study (231,077 patients)**: Annual stroke risk for score 3 was 2.5% (95% CI, 2.4–2.6%) [^1143hM3j].

These data indicate an annual stroke risk of **approximately 2.5–3.2%** for a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3.

---

## Impact of anticoagulation therapy

Anticoagulation therapy **significantly reduces stroke risk** in patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3. A meta-analysis found that anticoagulation **reduced stroke risk by approximately 66%**, lowering annual risk from 2.49% to approximately 0.85%. The COMBINE AF meta-analysis reported a residual stroke risk of about 1.33% per year among anticoagulated patients with CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2, suggesting a similar reduction for those with a score of 3 [^112tBRmH]. Taken together, anticoagulation reduces annual stroke risk to **approximately 0.8–1.1%** in patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines provide **clear recommendations** for patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3. The AHA/ASA 2024 guidelines **recommend oral anticoagulation** for patients with CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women [^115doh8n], and the ESC guidelines similarly recommend anticoagulation for those with scores ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women. These guidelines **emphasize the importance of anticoagulation** to reduce stroke risk in patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3.

---

## Factors influencing stroke risk within CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3

The **specific combination of risk factors** contributing to the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3 can influence stroke risk.

- **Age 65–74 years**: Associated with higher stroke risk compared to other single-point risk factors.
- **Female sex**: Associated with slightly higher stroke risk compared to males.
- **Combination of risk factors**: Certain combinations, such as age 65–74 years plus hypertension, may confer higher risk than other combinations.

---

## Limitations and considerations

Several **limitations and considerations** should be noted when interpreting stroke risk estimates for CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3.

- **Heterogeneity**: Significant heterogeneity exists across studies, with broad prediction intervals [^114nUUgT].
- **Population differences**: Stroke risk may vary by population, ethnicity, and geographic region.
- **Individual patient factors**: Additional patient-specific factors (e.g. renal dysfunction, biomarkers) may influence stroke risk beyond the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score [^113TrBc8].

---

Patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3 have an **annual stroke risk of approximately 2.5–3.2%**. Anticoagulation **significantly reduces this risk**, and current clinical guidelines recommend anticoagulation for these patients.

### Residual stroke risk among patients with atrial fibrillation prescribed oral anticoagulants: A patient-level meta-analysis from COMBINE AF [^112tBRmH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Despite oral anticoagulation, patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) remain at risk of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (SE) events. For patients whose residual risk is sufficiently high, additional therapies might be useful to mitigate stroke risk.

- **Methods and results**: Individual patient data from five landmark trials testing oral anticoagulation in AF were pooled in A Collaboration Between Multiple Institutions to Better Investigate Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulant Use in AF (COMBINE AF). We calculated the rate of ischemic stroke/SE among oral anticoagulation-treated patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2, across strata of CHA₂DS₂-VASc score, stroke history, and AF type, as either paroxysmal or nonparoxysmal. We included 71,794 patients with AF (median age 72 years, interquartile range, 13 years, 61.3% male) randomized to a direct oral anticoagulant or vitamin K antagonist, and followed for a mean of 2.1 (± 0.8) years. The median CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was 4 (interquartile range, 3–5); 18.8% had a prior stroke, and 76.4% had nonparoxysmal AF. The overall rate of stroke/SE was 1.33%/y (95% CI, 1.27–1.39); 1.38%/y (95% CI, 1.31–1.45) for nonparoxysmal AF, and 1.15%/y (95% CI, 1.05–1.27) for paroxysmal AF. The rate of ischemic stroke/SE increased by a rate ratio of 1.36 (95% CI, 1.32–1.41) per 1-point increase in CHA₂DS₂-VASc, reaching 1.67%/y (95% CI, 1.59–1.75) ≥ 4 CHA₂DS₂-VASc points. Patients with both nonparoxysmal AF and CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 4 had a stroke/SE rate of 1.75%/y (95% CI, 1.66–1.85). In patients with a prior stroke, the risk.

### Predictive performance of the CHA2DS2-VASc rule in atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114nUUgT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). High credibility.

The widely recommended CHA2DS2-VASc shows conflicting results in contemporary validation studies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 studies validating CHA2DS2-VASc. There was high heterogeneity in stroke risks for different CHA2DS2-VASc scores, which was not explained by differences in the setting of care or by performing meta-regression.

- **Background**: The CHA2DS2-VASc decision rule is widely recommended for estimating stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), although validation studies show ambiguous and conflicting results.

- **Objectives**: To (i) review existing studies validating CHA2DS2-VASc in AF patients who are not (yet) anticoagulated; (ii) meta-analyze estimates of stroke risk per score; and (iii) explore sources of heterogeneity across the validation studies.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic literature review and random effects meta-analysis of studies externally validating CHA2DS2-VASc in AF patients not receiving anticoagulants. To explore between-study heterogeneity in stroke risk, we stratified studies by the clinical setting in which patient enrollment started and performed meta-regression.

- **Results**: In total, 19 studies were evaluated, with over two million person-years of follow-up. In studies recruiting AF patients in hospitals, stroke risks for scores of 0, 1, and 2 were 0.4% (approximate 95% prediction interval [PI] 0.2–3.2%), 1.2% (95% PI 0.1–3.8%), and 2.2% (95% PI 0.03–7.8%), respectively. These were consistently higher than those in studies recruiting patients from the open general population.

### Ischemic stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation and CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114iRZhZ]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

The CHA2DS2-VASc score aims to improve risk stratification of ischemic stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation to identify those who can safely forego oral anticoagulation. Oral anticoagulation treatment guidelines remain uncertain for a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the risk of ischemic stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0, 1, or 2 not treated with oral anticoagulation.

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science from the start of the database up until April 15, 2015. We included studies that stratified the risk of ischemic stroke by CHA2DS2-VASc score for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. We estimated the summary annual rate of ischemic stroke using random effects meta-analyses and compared the estimated stroke rates with published net-benefit thresholds for initiating anticoagulants.

We retrieved 1162 abstracts, of which 10 met all inclusion criteria for the study. There was substantial heterogeneity among studies. The summary estimate for the annual risk of ischemic stroke was 1.61% (95% confidence interval 0%-3.23%) for a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, meeting the theoretical threshold for using novel oral anticoagulants (0.9%) but below the threshold for warfarin (1.7%). The summary incident risk of ischemic stroke was 0.68% (95% confidence interval 0.12%-1.23%) for a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 and 2.49% (95% confidence interval 1.16%).

### Stroke risk factors beyond the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score: Can we improve our identification of "high stroke risk" patients with atrial fibrillation [^113TrBc8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The prevention of stroke and other thromboembolic events plays a crucial role in managing patients with atrial fibrillation. Not all patients with atrial fibrillation are equal in terms of thromboembolic risk; therefore, not all will benefit from oral anticoagulation treatment. The general principle is that the expected benefit of anticoagulation in reducing thromboembolic risk must exceed the expected harm caused by potential bleeding.

Some guidelines have focused on a categorical approach to stroke prevention, emphasizing identifying patients at high risk for oral anticoagulation. Various guidelines recommend assessing stroke risk using the CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc scores to initially detect patients at low risk who require no antithrombotic therapy. However, the scores do not incorporate all possible risk factors causing a high thromboembolic risk. Factors such as impaired renal function, obstructive sleep apnea, and echocardiographic and biochemical or coagulation parameters can also predict adverse thromboembolic events.

The present review aims to describe biomarkers — whether blood, urine, imaging (cardiac or cerebral), or clinical — that go beyond the CHA2DS2-VASc score and potentially aid stroke risk assessment. Although useful in some cases, the presented parameters should perhaps be used to further refine the initial identification of patients at low risk, after which effective stroke prevention can be offered to those with ≥ 1 additional stroke risk factors.

### Risk of ischemic stroke and utility of CHADS-VASc score in women and men with atrial fibrillation [^1143hM3j]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The incidence rates of ischemic stroke for men and women in relation to CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores are depicted in Figure 3. Men without CHA₂DS₂-VASc risk factors had a low risk for ischemic stroke, with an incidence rate of 0.37 (CI: 0.33‐0.42). Among patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1, men had a higher ischemic stroke incidence than women, presenting rates of 1.02 (CI: 0.93‐1.11) for men and 0.46 (CI: 0.39‐0.54) for women, respectively. Similarly, for patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 2, men had higher ischemic stroke incidence rates than women, with rates of 2.21 (CI: 2.09‐2.33) and 1.22 (CI: 1.10‐1.35), respectively. Among patients with CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores of 3 to 6, the differences between men and women were not statistically significant. However, in patients with CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores of 7 to 8, women had a significantly higher risk of ischemic stroke than men.

Figure 3 illustrates the incidence rates of ischemic stroke per 100 person‐years with 95% confidence intervals in men and women, as related to the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. It includes incidence rates of ischemic stroke per 100 person‐years of follow‐up with 95% confidence intervals in the total group of 231,077 included patients, divided by gender and CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. The P-value for a test of no gender difference within each CHA₂DS₂-VASc score category was calculated using a Cox regression model that included gender as the only covariate. CI stands for confidence interval, IR for incidence rate, N for the number of patients, and PY for person‐years.

### Refined atrial fibrillation screening and cost-effectiveness in the German population [^114YMqWT]. Heart (2022). Low credibility.

The risk of adverse events in new atrial fibrillation (AF) cases is shown in figure 2A–C. The median CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was two, with a median annual stroke risk of 2.2%. The distribution of stroke risk by CHA₂DS₂-VASc score in new AF cases is provided in online supplemental figure 2 and figure 2A. For individuals with new AF, the 10-year risk of developing heart failure was 21% (25th/75th percentile 11/37%) as shown in figure 2C, and the 5-year risk of stroke or death was 30% (25th/75th percentile 19/44%).

- **Boxplots of predicted risk**: Stroke (A), stroke or death (B), and heart failure (C) in individuals with known and newly detected AF are illustrated. Risk algorithms for annual stroke risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc score), 10-year heart failure risk, and 5-year risk of stroke or death were used. Heart failure risk scores were truncated at the upper risk estimate of ≥ 45% to avoid inaccuracies due to extreme observations. Stroke risk assessed by the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score is adjusted for warfarin intake. Cardiac murmur is not available in the Gutenberg Health Study and is left out of the calculation of heart failure risk. Data are weighted for the residence, age, and sex of the population in the Mainz and Mainz-Bingen area. AF, atrial fibrillation.

In random forest selection, Nt-proBNP was the single variable most strongly related to prevalent AF, validated by stepwise selection and LASSO methods. The model fit C-statistic was 0.829 for random forest selection, with AUCs of 0.802 for stepwise selection and 0.834 for the LASSO methods. Evaluating different Nt-proBNP cut-off points is essential.

### Comparative performance of ATRIA, CHADS2, and CHA2DS2-VASc risk scores predicting stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation: Results from a national primary care database [^117RnS6s]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Previous studies report that CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc risk scores have similar discriminating ability (C statistic ∼0.6). Recently, a clinically based risk score, the ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) study risk score, was developed and validated.

- **Objectives**: This study compared the predictive ability of CHA2DS2-VASc and CHADS2 ischemic stroke risk scores with the ATRIA stroke risk score and their implications for anticoagulant treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **Methods**: Patients with AF not using warfarin were included from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database, 1998 to 2012. Patients were followed from AF diagnosis until the occurrence of ischemic stroke, prescription of warfarin, death, or the study's end. Independent predictors of ischemic stroke were identified, and the c-index and net reclassification improvement were calculated.

- **Results**: A total of 60,594 patients with AF were included. The annualized stroke rate was 2.99%. Event rates for moderate- and high-risk categories for CHA2DS2-VASc were lower than those of the ATRIA and CHADS2. Age and previous stroke most strongly predicted ischemic stroke. C statistics for the full point scores were 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69 to 0.71) for the ATRIA risk score, 0.68 (95% CI: 0.67 to 0.69) for CHADS2, and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.67 to 0.69) for CHA2DS2-VASc risk score. The net reclassification improvement was 0.23 (95% CI: 0.22 to 0.25) for ATRIA compared with CHA2DS2-VASc.

- **Conclusions**: The ATRIA score performed better in the U.K. Clinical Practice Research Datali.

### Predicting postoperative atrial fibrillation using CHA2DS2-VASc scores [^111u5GXH]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is the most frequent complication of cardiac surgery and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Pharmacologic prophylaxis is the main method of preventing POAF, but it needs to be targeted to patients at high risk of developing POAF. The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system is a clinical guideline for assessing ischemic stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. The present study evaluated the utility of this scoring system in predicting the risk of developing de novo POAF in cardiac surgery patients.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 2385 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at our institution from 2008–2014 were identified for analysis. Each patient was assigned a CHA2DS2-VASc score and placed into a low- (score of 0), intermediate- (1), or high-risk (≥ 2) group. A multivariate regression model was created to control for known risk factors of atrial fibrillation.

- **Results**: POAF occurred in 380 of 2385 patients (15.9%). Mean CHA2DS2-VASc scores among patients with POAF and without POAF were 3.6 ± 1.7 and 2.8 ± 1.7, respectively (P < 0.0001). Using multivariate analysis, as a patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score rose from 0–9, the risk of developing POAF increased from 8.2%-42.3%. Each point increase was associated with higher odds of developing POAF (adjusted odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.18–1.36, P < 0.0001). Compared with low-risk patients, patients in the high-risk group were 5.21 times more likely to develop POAF (P < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: The CHA2DS2-VASc algorithm is a simple risk-stratification tool.

### The impact of risk score (CHADS2 versus CHA2DS2-VASc) on long-term outcomes after atrial fibrillation ablation [^113TCV7N]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

Risk stratification tools are needed to select the right candidates for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). Both the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores have utility in predicting AF-related outcomes and guiding anticoagulation treatment.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine whether these risk scores predict long-term outcomes after AF ablation and whether one risk score provides comparatively superior performance.

- **Methods**: CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were calculated in 2179 patients who underwent a first ablation procedure for AF enrolled in the Intermountain Heart Collaborative Study. CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were categorized as 0–1, 2–4, and ≥ 5. Patient outcomes were analyzed over 5 years for AF/atrial flutter recurrence and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: composite of death, stroke, and heart failure hospitalization).

- **Results**: The mean age was 65.7 ± 10.5 years, and 61.1% were men. Both scores incrementally predicted risk of AF recurrence, stroke, heart failure, and death at 5 years. Increasing CHADS2 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.19; P < .001) and CHA2DS2-VASc (HR 1.15; P < .0001) scores were both associated with AF/atrial flutter recurrence. The results were similar for MACE where increasing CHADS2 (HR 1.54; P < .0001) and CHA2DS2-VASc (HR 1.32; P < .0001) scores were associated with risk. When CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were modeled together, only CHA2DS2-VASc scores significantly predicted AF recurrence (HR 1.13; p = 0.001), but both were associated with MACE.

- **Conclusion**: Both the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were excellent in stratifying long-term outcomes after atrial fibrillation ablation.

### Stroke and bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation: Navigating the alphabet soup of risk-score acronyms (CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, R2CHADS2, HAS-BLED, ATRIA, and more) [^114nfhQt]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Stroke prevention is central to the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Effective stroke prophylaxis essentially requires oral anticoagulants; therefore, an understanding of the risks and benefits of oral anticoagulant therapy is needed. Although AF increases stroke risk fivefold, this risk is not homogeneous, as many stroke risk factors also confer an increased risk of bleeding. Various stroke and bleeding risk-stratification schemes have been developed to help inform clinical decision-making. These scores were derived and validated in different study cohorts, ranging from highly selected clinical-trial cohorts to real-world populations. Thus, their performance and classification accuracy vary depending on their derivation cohort(s).

In the present review, we provide an overview of currently available stroke and bleeding risk-stratification schemes. We particularly focus on the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED schemes, as these are recommended by the latest European guidelines on AF management. Other risk-stratification schemes (e.g. CHADS2, R2CHADS2, ATRIA, HEMORR2HAGES, QStroke) and their place in decision-making are also considered.

### Risks of bleeding and stroke based on CHA2DS2-VASc scores in Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation: A large-scale observational study using real-world data [^116n4guu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

We evaluated the natural history of Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation in a large-scale observational study using real-world data. The risks of ischemic stroke and each type of bleeding event were high among Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation who were not on oral anticoagulants, particularly among those with high CHA2DS2-VASc scores. Optimal management strategies, including blood pressure-lowering treatment and glucose-lowering therapy, are required for these high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation. Further studies are needed to establish effective management considering racial differences.

### Relationship of aging and incident comorbidities to stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116yyovi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

When assessing ischemic stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score is calculated based on baseline risk factors, and outcomes are determined following a follow-up period. However, the stroke risk in patients with AF does not remain static; with time, patients get older and accumulate more comorbidities.

- **Objectives**: This study hypothesized that the "Delta CHA₂DS₂-VASc score", which reflects the change in score between baseline and follow-up, would be more predictive of ischemic stroke compared with the baseline CHA₂DS₂-VASc score.

- **Methods**: A total of 31,039 patients with AF who did not receive antiplatelet agents or oral anticoagulants, and who did not have comorbidities of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score except for age and sex, were studied. The Delta CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores were defined as the differences between the baseline and follow-up CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores. During 171,956 person-years, 4,103 patients experienced ischemic stroke. The accuracies of baseline, follow-up, and Delta CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores in predicting ischemic stroke were analyzed and compared.

- **Results**: The mean baseline CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was 1.29, which increased to 2.31 during follow-up, with a mean Delta CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1.02. The CHA₂DS₂-VASc score remained unchanged in only 40.8% of patients. Among the 4,103 patients who experienced ischemic stroke, 89.4% had a Delta CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 1 compared with only 54.6% in patients without ischemic stroke. Additionally, 2,643 (64.4%) patients had ≥ 1 new-onset comorbidity.

### Relation of the CHADS-VASc score to risk of thrombotic and embolic stroke in community-dwelling individuals without atrial fibrillation (from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities [ARIC] study) [^115NPPht]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Recent hospital-based cohort studies have found the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score to be associated with ischemic stroke in individuals without atrial fibrillation (AF). Our aim was to determine the distribution of embolic and thrombotic strokes and their association with the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score among community-dwelling individuals without AF.

We included participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study who attended visit 4 (1996 to 1998) and had no previous AF, stroke, or anticoagulant use (n = 10,671). During follow-up through 2008, incident AF cases (n = 760) and participants who started warfarin were censored. Incident AF was ascertained from study electrocardiograms and hospital discharge diagnosis codes, and stroke was physician-adjudicated.

After 10 years of follow-up, 280 ischemic strokes were identified, of which 146 were thrombotic and 57 embolic. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals [CI]) for thrombotic stroke were 1 (reference), 1.71 (1.13 to 2.59), 2.92 (1.91 to 4.45), 3.22 (1.70 to 6.11), and 1.25 (0.17 to 9.09), with CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores of 0 to 1, 2, 3, 4, and ≥ 5, respectively. The hazard ratios (95% CI) for embolic stroke were 1 (reference), 4.91 (2.10 to 11.5), 7.07 (2.93 to 17.0), 14.8 (5.50 to 39.6), and 15.2 (3.16 to 73.3), with CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores of 0 to 1, 2, 3, 4, and ≥ 5, respectively. A receiver-operating characteristic model had a C-statistic of 0.65 for ischemic stroke, 0.61 for thrombotic stroke, and 0.71 for embolic stroke.

In conclusion, in community-dwelling individuals without AF, the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score can assess ischemic stroke risk.

### Newly detected atrial fibrillation: AAFP updates guideline on pharmacologic management [^116pJiEP]. American Family Physician (2017). High credibility.

The AAFP 2017 guidelines for atrial fibrillation emphasize the importance of classification and risk stratification, particularly regarding stroke risk assessment. It is recommended to discuss the risk of stroke with all patients who are considering anticoagulation. The guidelines suggest using the continuous CHADS2 or continuous CHA2DS2-VASc score to predict the risk of stroke in patients with AF.

### The predictive ability of the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores for bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation: The MAQI(2) experience [^116CEVef]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend the assessment of stroke and bleeding risk before initiating warfarin anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation. Many of the elements used to predict stroke also overlap with bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation patients, and it is tempting to use stroke risk scores to efficiently estimate bleeding risk. Comparison of stroke risk scores to bleeding risk scores to predict bleeding has not been thoroughly assessed.

- **Methods**: 2600 patients followed at seven anticoagulation clinics were followed from October 2009 to May 2013. Five risk models (CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, HEMORR2HAGES, HAS-BLED, and ATRIA) were retrospectively applied to each patient. The primary outcome was the first major bleeding event. Area under the ROC curves were compared with C statistic, and net reclassification improvement (NRI) analysis was performed.

- **Results**: 110 patients experienced a major bleeding event in 2581.6 patient-years (4.5%/year). Mean follow-up was 1.0 ± 0.8 years. All of the formal bleeding risk scores had a modest predictive value for first major bleeding events (C statistic 0.66–0.69), performing better than CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores (C statistic difference 0.10–0.16). NRI analysis demonstrated a 52–69% and 47–64% improvement of the formal bleeding risk scores over the CHADS2 score and CHA2DS2-VASc score, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores did not perform as well as formal bleeding risk scores for prediction of major bleeding in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients treated with warfarin.

### Is an oral anticoagulant necessary for young atrial fibrillation patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (men) or 2 (women) [^111pwmeb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Recent studies have demonstrated that oral anticoagulants (OACs) should be considered for patients with atrial fibrillation and one risk factor, in addition to sex. Age, as a critical determinant of ischemic stroke, suggests that the strategy for stroke prevention may differ across various age strata. This study aimed to investigate whether OACs should be considered for patients aged 20 to 49 years with atrial fibrillation and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (men) or 2 (women).

- **Methods and results**: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 7,374 male patients with atrial fibrillation and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, and 4,461 female patients with atrial fibrillation and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2, all without antithrombotic therapies, were identified and stratified into three groups by age. The threshold for initiating OACs for stroke prevention was set at a stroke rate of 1.7% per year for warfarin and 0.9% per year for non–vitamin K antagonist OACs. Among male patients aged 20 to 49 years with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, the risk of ischemic stroke was 1.30% per year, ranging from 0.94% per year for those with hypertension to 1.71% for those with congestive heart failure. Among female patients aged 20 to 49 years with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2, the risk of ischemic stroke was 1.40% per year, ranging from 1.11% per year for those with hypertension to 1.67% for those with congestive heart failure.

- **Conclusions**: For atrial fibrillation patients aged 20 to 49 years with one risk factor in addition to sex, non–vitamin K antagonist OACs should be considered when the stroke risk aligns with the identified thresholds.

### Is an oral anticoagulant necessary for young atrial fibrillation patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (men) or 2 (women) [^113MTJcY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with approximately a 5-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke in patients with versus without AF. AF-related stroke is more likely to be fatal, is frequently recurrent, and causes more severe functional disabilities than non–AF-related stroke.

The risk of AF-related stroke is not homogeneous and depends on the age and comorbidities of each patient. Clinical guidelines suggest the use of the CHA2DS2-VASc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65–74 years, female sex) for stroke risk stratification. The use of oral anticoagulants (OACs) is determined accordingly.

Based on guideline recommendations, OACs should be prescribed for patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 (class I recommendation) and omitted for male patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 and female patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1. For patients with one risk factor in addition to sex (i.e. CHA2DS2-VASc score 1 [men] or 2 [women]), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines suggest that stroke prevention with OACs should be considered, especially using non–vitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs).

Our previous study demonstrated that the annual risk of ischemic stroke was 2.75% for Asian men with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, and 2.55% for Asian women with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2, which exceeds the treatment threshold for the initiation of warfarin (1.7% per year).

### Validation of clinical classification schemes for predicting stroke: results from the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation [^113Xwnc9]. JAMA (2001). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "CHADS₂ score for stroke risk in atrial fibrillation" applies to conditions such as atrial fibrillation, acute ischemic stroke, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, transient ischemic attack, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

The CHADS₂ score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF), a common and serious heart rhythm disturbance. It is simple and has been validated by numerous studies across different groups of AF patients.

The acronym CHADS₂ stands for:

- **Congestive heart failure**: 1 point
- **Hypertension**: 1 point
- **Age ≥ 75 years**: 1 point
- **Diabetes mellitus**: 1 point
- **Prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)**: 2 points

The total score ranges from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of stroke.

The clinical utility of the CHADS₂ score is significant in guiding clinicians on whether to anticoagulate a patient with AF. Patients with a score of 0 are at low risk and do not require anticoagulation. Those with a score of 1 can be considered for anticoagulation, and patients with a score of 2 or more should definitely be anticoagulated, unless contraindicated.

The CHADS₂ score is not suitable for patients with rheumatic AF, valvular heart disease, or those who have a contraindication to anticoagulation.

The CHADS₂ score remains widely used to estimate stroke risk in individuals with atrial fibrillation by evaluating five specific risk factors. Each factor contributes a designated number of points to the assessment.

### Usefulness of CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores for stroke prediction in patients with cancer and atrial fibrillation [^112ZGy5J]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Stroke prediction scores have not been validated in patients with cancer and atrial fibrillation (AF). We aimed to identify unique risk factors and evaluate the validity of CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores to predict the risk of stroke and mortality. A retrospective review of all patients with cancer with pre-existing AF presenting from 2008 to 2014 was performed. Outcomes included ischemic stroke and mortality. Prognostic factors were identified with Fine and Gray regression for stroke and Cox proportional hazards analysis for survival.

After excluding patients with hemorrhagic strokes, 2,037 patients were analyzed. Genitourinary cancers were the most common (29%), followed by gastrointestinal cancers (18%). Overall, 52% had CHADS2 ≥ 2. At a median of 6.4 months, 74 patients (3.6%) developed an ischemic stroke. Increased CHADS2 score was associated with stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19 to 1.67; p < 0.001).

### Assessment of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in predicting ischemic stroke, thromboembolism, and death in patients with heart failure with and without atrial fibrillation [^117ESp91]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

The CHA2DS2-VASc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years [doubled], diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism [doubled], vascular disease [prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque], age 65–75 years, sex category [female]) is used clinically for stroke risk stratification in atrial fibrillation (AF). Its usefulness in a population of patients with heart failure (HF) is unclear.

The objective was to investigate whether the CHA2DS2-VASc predicts ischemic stroke, thromboembolism, and death in a cohort of patients with HF with and without AF.

Design, setting, and population: This nationwide prospective cohort study used Danish registries, including 42,987 patients (21.9% with concomitant AF) not receiving anticoagulation, who were diagnosed as having incident HF during 2000–2012. The end of follow-up was December 31, 2012.

Exposures included levels of the CHA2DS2-VASc score (based on 10 possible points, with higher scores indicating higher risk), stratified by concomitant AF at baseline. Analyses took into account the competing risk of death.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Ischemic stroke, thromboembolism, and death within 1 year after HF diagnosis.

Results revealed that in patients without AF, the risks of ischemic stroke, thromboembolism, and death were 3.1% (n = 977), 9.9% (n = 3187), and 21.8% (n = 6956), respectively. Risks were greater with increasing CHA2DS2-VASc scores as follows, for scores of 1 through 6: ischemic stroke with concomitant AF: 4.5%, 3.7%, 3.2%, 4.3%, 5.6%, and 8.4%; without concomitant AF: 1.5%, 1.5%.

### Outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation newly recommended for oral anticoagulation under the 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guideline [^1139GoNi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of the updated 2014 guidelines was to better distinguish between patients with moderate and those with low risk, meaning that many more patients are recommended to receive anticoagulation now than before 2014. Specifically, two-thirds of patients not recommended for anticoagulation under the 2011 guidelines are now recommended for anticoagulant therapy under the 2014 guideline. For example, all women older than 64 years are recommended for therapy now regardless of risk profile. This guideline update was highly controversial because previous studies that evaluated the benefit/risk ratio of oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with low or low to moderate risk have yielded conflicting results. Several studies have demonstrated the benefit of anticoagulation in men with CHA₂DS₂-VASc score 1 and women with CHA₂DS₂-VASc score 2, whereas others have found that oral anticoagulation did not reduce the risk of stroke in this low-risk group but did increase the risk of bleeding. For this reason, the publication of this guideline, which was based mostly on expert opinion rather than quantitative data, was followed by concerns about the strength of the evidence supporting this guideline update and the potential increase in the incidence of bleeding in this population.

To the best of our knowledge, no prior study has specifically evaluated the benefit/risk ratio of oral anticoagulation therapy in a cohort of US patients who are newly recommended for anticoagulation under the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline.

### Bleeding risk scores in atrial fibrillation: Helpful or harmful [^112GQz3Z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The reasons for the lack of clinical impact of bleeding risk scores are partially due to their parallel nature with stroke risk scores, such as CHA2DS2-VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes Mellitus, Prior Stroke, Vascular disease, Sex category). For example, with increasing age, the risk of stroke and major bleeding both increase. A bleeding risk score can sometimes justify withholding anticoagulation from a high-risk patient, which may actually harm patients. This editorial will further discuss the reasons why previously developed bleeding risk scoring systems, such as HAS-BLED and GARFIELD-AF, have minimal clinical impact, especially in modern anticoagulation therapy.

- **Net clinical benefit of anticoagulation**: The benefit in patients with AF has been studied. Friberg and colleagues showed that increased thromboembolism risk was associated with increased risk of bleeding, likely due to the overlap of many risk factors in the risk stratification scores. In this study, the only patients who did not benefit from anticoagulation had a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 or 1, for whom anticoagulation is not recommended by the European Society of Cardiology or AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines. In fact, a patient with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 5 and an HAS-BLED score of 5 would have a net clinical benefit of 3% per year, even when weighting intracranial hemorrhage as 1.5 times the clinical impact of a stroke. In a study by Oleson and colleagues, bleeding risk does increase with higher HAS-BLED scores.

### Chads2, cha2ds2-vasc and has-bled as predictors of outcome in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^112xMdWo]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores are employed to estimate thromboembolic risk in atrial fibrillation (AF). HAS-BLED is recommended for bleeding risk prediction. Their efficacy in predicting outcomes for AF patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains uncertain. Thus, our objective was to evaluate whether these risk scores are useful in predicting outcomes in these patients.

- **Materials and methods**: AFCAS is an observational, multicenter, prospective registry, including patients (n = 929) with AF referred for PCI. The primary study endpoints were: 1) all-cause mortality; 2) major adverse events (all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, stent thrombosis, transient ischemic attack, stroke, or other arterial thromboembolism; MACCE); and 3) bleeding at a 12-month follow-up. CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores and a modified HAS-BLED (mHAS-BLED) score (omitting labile INR and liver function) were calculated.

- **Results**: Patients were distributed as follows: CHADS2 low 29.5%, intermediate 55.2%, high 15.3%; CHA2DS2-VASc low 9.6%, intermediate 46.0%, high 44.5%. A high CHA2DS2-VASc score was predictive of all-cause mortality (p = 0.02) whereas CHADS2 was not. A high CHA2DS2-VASc score predicted MACCE (HR 2.24, 95%CI 1.21–4.17, p = 0.01), as did a high CHADS2 score (HR 1.60, 95%CI 1.05–2.45, p = 0.029). Their predictive performance was modest (C indexes 0.56–0.57). Neither CHADS2 nor CHA2DS2-VASc scores were associated with bleeding. High mHAS-BLED scores (≥ 3) were not linked with any of the study outcomes.

- **Conclusions**: A high CHA2DS2-VASc score was the best predictor of outcomes among the evaluated scores.

### The CHA2DS2-VASc score identifies those patients with atrial fibrillation and a CHADS2 score of 1 who are unlikely to benefit from oral anticoagulant therapy [^116wgqDe]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score is a modification of the CHADS(2) score that aims to improve stroke risk prediction in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) by adding three risk factors: age 65–74, female sex, and history of vascular disease. Whereas previous evaluations of the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score included all AF patients, the objective of this analysis was to evaluate its discriminative ability in those patients for whom recommendations on antithrombotic treatment are uncertain (i.e. CHADS(2) score of 1).

- **Methods and results**: We selected all patients with a CHADS(2) score of 1 from the AVERROES and ACTIVE trials who were treated with acetylsalicylic acid with or without clopidogrel and calculated the incidences of ischemic or unspecified stroke or systemic embolus (SSE) according to their CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score. Of 4670 patients with a baseline CHADS(2) score of 1, 26% had a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1 and 74% had a score of ≥ 2. After 11,414 patient-years of follow-up, the annual incidence of SSE was 0.9% (95% CI: 0.6–1.3) and 2.1% (95% CI: 1.8–2.5) for patients with a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1 and ≥ 2, respectively. The c-statistic of the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score was 0.587 (95% CI: 0.550–0.624). Age 65 to < 75 years was the strongest of the three new risk factors in the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score.

- **Conclusion**: The CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score reclassifies 26% of patients with a CHADS(2) score of 1 to a low annual risk of SSE of 1%. This risk appears sufficiently low to consider withholding anticoagulant treatment.

### Risk of ischemic stroke and utility of CHADS-VASc score in women and men with atrial fibrillation [^117B8H9p]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

In this study of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) without oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment, the risk of ischemic stroke and death is higher among women compared to men; however, this association appears to result from confounding by age. The difference in risk of ischemic stroke between the sexes is attenuated in younger age groups but becomes more pronounced above the age of 70. The single point given for female sex in the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score overestimates the risk conferred by gender, while the single point given for age 65 to 74 years underestimates the risk conferred by age.

The importance and magnitude of the difference in ischemic stroke risk between men and women has been vigorously debated, with study results and interpretations proving inconsistent. In a previous observational Swedish cohort study, women had a moderately increased risk of ischemic stroke compared to men, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.18 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.12–1.24). When divided by age, the unadjusted HR among patients aged ≥ 75 years was 1.24 (CI: 1.18–1.30), while in patients < 75 years, there was no significant difference in risk. Similarly, a Danish cohort study found no significant differences in stroke/thromboembolic risk in those aged < 65 and 65 to 74 years, while among those aged 75 years or older, women had a higher risk of stroke/thromboembolism than men (HR: 1.20, CI: 1.12–1.28). In the GARFIELD-AF registry, the stroke risk was elevated from the age of 70 years in women and from 65 years in men.

In line with our results, a recent Danish AF cohort study found similar evidence.

### Risk of ischemic stroke and utility of CHADS-VASc score in women and men with atrial fibrillation [^111S5Wfh]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

To assess the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), international guidelines recommend the use of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc risk scoring system to identify those who may benefit from oral anticoagulation (OAC) treatment. Studies have shown conflicting results regarding the magnitude of increased stroke risk associated with each of the variables in the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score, especially regarding female sex. Further research on the risk of stroke association with female sex and stroke risk is therefore needed and was encouraged by the European AF guidelines.

We aimed to:

- **Investigate the risk of ischemic stroke and death**: In women and men with AF.
- **Assess the risk for ischemic stroke associated with each component**: Of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score separately in women and men with one additional non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc risk factor.

### Is an oral anticoagulant necessary for young atrial fibrillation patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (men) or 2 (women) [^111VybWX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical end point was the occurrence of ischemic stroke (ICD‐9‐CM codes 433.x, 434.x, 436), with concomitant imaging studies of the brain, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The accuracy of the diagnosis of ischemic stroke in Taiwan's NHIRD has been reported to be approximately 94%. Another validation study also demonstrated that the diagnostic accuracy of ischemic stroke in NHIRD was high, with a positive predictive value and sensitivity of 88.4% and 97.3%, respectively. The annual risk of ischemic stroke was calculated for patients who were stratified into three groups based on age (20–49, 50–64, and 65–74 years).

- **The "tipping point" for OAC use for stroke prevention**: In an analysis of the "tipping point" for OAC use for stroke prevention, using a decision analytic model, Eckman et al. estimated thresholds for ischemic stroke risk below which OAC therapy should be withheld and above which OAC therapy should be prescribed. Their results demonstrated that anticoagulation with warfarin is preferred at a stroke rate of more than 1.7% per year, whereas anticoagulation with the safer NOACs leads to lowering of the treatment threshold for anticoagulation to a stroke rate of 0.9% per year. Consequently, patients with an annual risk of ischemic stroke greater than 0.9% in our study cohort were assumed to be candidates for NOAC use for stroke prevention. For patients with an annual risk of ischemic stroke greater than 1.7%, OACs with either warfarin or NOACs could be considered.

- **Statistical analysis**: Incidence rates of ischemic stroke were calculated by dividing…

### A new risk scheme to predict ischemic stroke and other thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation: The ATRIA study stroke risk score [^113buu3h]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Thromboembolic event rates by the three scoring systems for the entire ATRIA cohort are detailed in the study. For the full range of point scores, the c-index was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.75) for the ATRIA score, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.71) for the CHADS₂ score, and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.72) for the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score.

- **Comparison of risk categorization**: The ATRIA score was divided into low (0 to 5 points), moderate (6 points), and high (7 to 15 points) risk categories, fitting annualized event rates of < 1%, 1% to < 2%, and ≥ 2% per year, respectively. The resulting c-index was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.67, 0.71). In contrast, using the published categories for the CHADS₂ (0 to 1, 2 to 3, and 4 to 6 points) and CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores (0, 1, and ≥ 2 points), the resulting c-indexes were 0.66 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.68) and 0.58 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.59), respectively. The low c-index for the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score reflected its very low threshold for its high-risk category.

### Risk of ischemic stroke and utility of CHADS-VASc score in women and men with atrial fibrillation [^1145BY2Q]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The risk of ischemic stroke was 1.5‐fold higher in women compared to men; however, this association appears to result from confounding by age. The CHA₂DS₂-VASc risk score underestimates the ischemic stroke risk conferred by ages 65 to 74 years, while it overestimates the risk conferred by female sex at the low-risk end of the scale. These results support the European and US AF guidelines that provide equal recommendations to both men and women with only one non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc factor. The importance of ages 65 to 74 years as a single risk factor for stroke should be emphasized.

### Risks of bleeding and stroke based on CHA2DS2-VASc scores in Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation: A large-scale observational study using real-world data [^113JVaH6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

This large-scale observational study on negative events in a real-world setting investigated Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation who were not on anticoagulants. The study aims to evaluate the incidence of ischemic stroke and bleeding events (intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, others) based on CHA2DS2-VASc scores in Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation who were not anticoagulated.

- **Methods and results**: We used health checkups and insurance claim data from a Japanese insurance organization. Altogether, 9733 atrial fibrillation patients were not prescribed anticoagulation during their follow-up periods. Patients' risk levels were defined by their CHA2DS2-VASc scores (range 0– ≥ 3): Men with scores of 0, 1, or ≥ 2 and women with scores of 1, 2, or ≥ 3 were considered at low, intermediate, or high risk, respectively. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association between the CHA2DS2-VASc-determined risk and the incidence of ischemic stroke and intracranial, gastrointestinal, and other bleeding. The mean 2.5-year follow-up revealed 143 ischemic strokes and 332 bleeding events. Annual event rates were 0.58% for ischemic stroke and 1.17% for total bleeding events. Annual incidence of ischemic stroke increased with elevated predicted risks based on CHA2DS2-VASc scores: 0.18% for low-risk, 0.44% for intermediate-risk, and 1.29% for high-risk groups (P < 0.001 for trend). Annual incidences of total bleeding also increased with elevated predicted risks: 0.51% for low-risk, 1.28% for intermediate-risk, and 2.02% for high-risk groups (P < 0.001 for trend).

- **Conclusions**: The risks of ischemic stroke and bleeding events increased with higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores among Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation who were not on anticoagulation therapy.

### Improving stroke risk stratification in atrial fibrillation [^117PaHYf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Risk factors for stroke and thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation are commonly derived from analyses of clinical trial cohorts. The available data depend on the comprehensiveness of trial reports and whether specific risk factors were sought. The most commonly used schema is the Cardiac Failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke [Doubled] (CHADS(2)) score. Although simple and well validated, some limitations of the CHADS(2) schema are apparent.

A more recent approach to risk stratification in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation defines two categories of risk factors:

- **Major (definitive) risk factors**: Examples include previous stroke/transient ischemic attack and age ≥ 75 years.
- **Clinically relevant non-major risk factors**: These include heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, female gender, age 65–75 years, and atherosclerotic vascular disease.

This scheme is expressed as the acronym CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc, which denotes Cardiac Failure or Dysfunction, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 [Doubled], Diabetes, Stroke [Doubled]-Vascular Disease, Age 65–74, and Sex Category [Female]. In this scoring system, 2 points are assigned for a history of stroke or age ≥ 75 years, while 1 point is assigned for age 65 to 74 years, a history of hypertension, diabetes, cardiac failure, and vascular disease.

Patients with 1 definitive risk factor or a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1 or more could be considered for oral anticoagulation. In contrast, a patient with a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 0 is truly low risk and could be managed with no antithrombotic therapy. This would simplify our approach to managing risk in atrial fibrillation patients.

### Contemporary management of atrial fibrillation: What can clinical registries tell us about stroke prevention and current therapeutic approaches [^113bv45K]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The net clinical benefit of warfarin and new oral anticoagulants such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban is evaluated by CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED scores. For HAS-BLED scores of ≤ 2 and ≤ 3, clinical data indicate varying benefits. Modeling based on recent clinical trial outcomes and real-world data from the Danish National Patient Registry, collected from patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) between 1997 and 2008, predicts the net clinical benefit of these new oral anticoagulants in comparison to warfarin. This analysis is reproduced with permission from Banerjee et al. AF indicates atrial fibrillation.

Registry findings, such as those from Denmark and Sweden, have been instrumental in developing and refining risk-scoring systems for stroke and bleeding in AF patient cohorts. Scoring systems like CHADS₂ and CHA₂DS₂-VASc have transformed the approach to risk stratification of AF patients, guiding the judicious use of oral anticoagulants (OAC) in patients at increased risk. Registry data have been pivotal in deriving these risk stratification schemes and validating their utility in clinical practice. Both the CHADS₂ and CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores were found, through examination of registry data, to underestimate the risk of thromboembolism associated with previous ischemic events. Additionally, another scoring system developed from the Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) study has identified risk stratification schemes for bleeding and thromboembolism, offering a straightforward method to quantify the risk associated with warfarin use.

### Stroke risk and treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation and low CHADS-VASc scores: Findings from the ORBIT-AF I and II registries [^115D9DWr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a significantly increased risk of stroke and systemic embolism, which varies based on the presence of additional risk factors. Patients with AF-related strokes have a worse prognosis and a higher risk of recurrent events compared with non-AF-related strokes. Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism is facilitated through the use of antithrombotic agents, principally oral vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants (OACs). The CHA_2DS_2-VASc score is a risk stratification tool used to estimate the risk of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF and is recommended for use in the guidelines of many international cardiovascular medicine societies.

Differences exist in the treatment recommendations and administration of oral anticoagulation for "low-risk" patients across various guidelines. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society (AHA/ACC/HRS) guidelines for the management of AF recommend that patients with a CHA_2DS_2-VASc score of 1 can be treated with no therapy, aspirin only, or oral anticoagulation (Class IIb, Level of Evidence C). For patients with a CHA_2DS_2-VASc score of 0, antiplatelet or OAC therapy can be omitted (Class IIa). The European guidelines favor treatment in patients with one non-sex risk factor. The true absolute risk and optimal treatment in these patients, including females with a CHA_2DS_2-VASc score of 2, remain controversial and not entirely known. Accordingly, we used the ORBIT-AF (Outcomes Registry for Better Infor…

### Is an oral anticoagulant necessary for young atrial fibrillation patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (men) or 2 (women) [^115y1tgC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

For Asian AF patients aged 20 to 49 years with one risk factor in addition to sex and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (men) or 2 (women), NOACs should be considered for stroke prevention to minimize the risk of a potentially fatal or disabling event. A treatment threshold gray zone exists for male patients aged 20 to 49 years with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 due to hypertension or vascular diseases; the annual risks of stroke for these patients were just slightly higher than the tipping point for using NOACs. Treatment should be based on shared decision making with patients regarding the risks and benefits of OACs.

### Risks of bleeding and stroke based on CHA2DS2-VASc scores in Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation: A large-scale observational study using real-world data [^114iH6DL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulation is an established strategy to prevent ischemic stroke and other thromboembolic events among patients with atrial fibrillation, although they also increase the risk of bleeding. The risks and benefits of oral anticoagulants depend on an absolute reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke and an absolute increase in bleeding events associated with the treatment. This study showed a relatively low incidence of ischemic stroke and a relatively high incidence of intracranial bleeding in Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation who were not on oral anticoagulants. The present guidelines for managing atrial fibrillation in Japan recommend anticoagulant therapy for patients with a CHADS2 score of ≥ 2. However, physicians should be aware that bleeding risk also increases with the elevation of ischemic risk. Further investigation based on the effects of oral anticoagulants and the absolute risks of both ischemic and bleeding events is needed in Japan to establish effective antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Validation of risk stratification schemes for predicting stroke and thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation: Nationwide cohort study [^113geakT]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Because of the benefit of oral anticoagulation over aspirin, in patients with atrial fibrillation and CHADS₂ score = 2, the clinical impetus would be to anticoagulate. With CHADS₂ scores of 0–1, or when a more comprehensive stroke risk and vitamin K antagonist risk/benefit assessment is necessary, there is a clear need to consider other risk factors not included in the CHADS₂ score. This large study in a non-anticoagulated cohort with non-valvular atrial fibrillation clearly shows the advantages of CHA₂DS₂-VASc for further refinement of thromboembolic risk stratification, with improvements in C statistics for identifying patients at low, intermediate, and high risk of thromboembolism. The study convincingly identifies those with a truly low risk of thromboembolism.

Use of CHA₂DS₂-VASc could therefore simplify thromboprophylaxis, with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 0 identifying patients at truly low risk for whom no antithrombotic treatment may be considered. With a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1, oral anticoagulation can be used, given the limited evidence for the efficacy of aspirin (which also has a potential for bleeding). Consideration should be given to the future availability of new oral anticoagulant drugs that can overcome the clinical disadvantages of vitamin K antagonists (for example, without the need for monitoring of anticoagulation and with less risk of bleeding).

- **Intermediate risk category**: When defined as a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1, only 11.2% of patients were categorized in this group, compared with 32.3% when the CHADS₂ score of 1 definition was used.

### Risk of ischemic stroke and utility of CHADS-VASc score in women and men with atrial fibrillation [^113YLYBc]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The strengths of this study include its very large cohort, comprising all Swedish patients with reported atrial fibrillation (AF) diagnosis, who have been hospitalized or managed in outpatient hospital clinics nationwide, with virtually no loss to follow-up due to the unique individual civic registration numbers in Sweden. Furthermore, the risk analysis is based on a high number of ischemic strokes and deaths, totaling 17,540 ischemic strokes and 84,682 deaths. Other less well-defined outcomes, such as transient ischemic attacks or other thromboembolic events, which may be difficult to capture in registers, were not included in the analyses.

This study has limitations. It was observational and should, therefore, be interpreted with caution, despite the careful selection of diagnosis codes for the estimation of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score, the selection of robust outcomes of ischemic stroke and death, and the extensive statistical analyses. Outcomes were not adjudicated, which may have led to some overestimation of event rates, although it is unlikely that this would have affected the sexes differently. The inclusion of patients with AF but without oral anticoagulation (OAC) treatment may cause selection bias. Patients not treated with OAC are more likely to have contraindications or relative contraindications for OAC treatment due to comorbidities not accounted for in the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. Another limitation is that patients managed exclusively in primary care were not included in the cohort.

### Usefulness of CHADS-VASc score to predict stroke risk independent of atrial fibrillation [^117HL3V6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used to predict stroke risk among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We examined whether a CHA2DS2-VASc score predicts stroke risk among individuals without hospital-diagnosed AF and quantified the magnitude of the association in comparison to AF patients. We used data from population-based medical registries (1995 to 2005) covering all Danish hospitals to identify patients diagnosed with AF (n = 122,980). We matched ≤ 5 non-AF individuals (n = 612,723) to each AF patient on the individual risk factors included in the CHA2DS2-VASc score. We calculated the 10-year absolute risk of ischemic and all-cause stroke in AF and non-AF individuals and compared the stroke risk between cohorts within strata of CHA2DS2-VASc scores using Cox regression. The 10-year risk of ischemic/all-cause stroke was 4.4%/8.8% among non-AF individuals and 6.2%/12% in AF patients, corresponding to a risk difference of 1.8% for ischemic stroke and 3.3% for all-cause stroke.

In both cohorts, the stroke risk correlated with increasing CHA2DS2-VASc scores. However, in individuals with CHA2DS2-VASc scores ≥ 5 who were < 75 years or male, the absolute risk of ischemic stroke in individuals without AF exceeded the risk in AF patients. In the same subgroups, the hazard ratio approached unity. Similar results were observed for all-cause stroke. The CHA2DS2-VASc score was associated with 10-year stroke risk also among individuals without hospital-diagnosed AF. In conclusion, primary prophylactic anticoagulation therapy may be relevant in male and younger non-AF individuals.

### Methodologic differences across studies of patients with atrial fibrillation lead to varying estimates of stroke risk [^1164qitc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The decision to anticoagulate a patient with AF is based on the expected net clinical benefit of OAC, which balances the reduced risk of ischemic stroke against the increased risk of bleeding, weighted by the impact of each outcome. The expected net clinical benefit is largely determined by the estimated absolute risk of ischemic stroke without OAC for an individual patient. Decision analysis has identified the threshold for a positive net clinical benefit as a stroke risk off anticoagulants of between 0.9% and 2% per year. The AHA/ACC/HRS and ESC guidelines recommend the CHA₂DS₂‐VASc scoring system to guide anticoagulant use in AF, assuming that CHA₂DS₂‐VASc point scores correspond to fixed absolute risks of ischemic stroke. However, our previous work demonstrated wide variation in overall and point score–stratified stroke rates across multiple large AF cohorts, despite similar high study quality using an objective scoring system. Of note, the CHA₂DS₂‐VASc point score–specific stroke rates observed in several of these cohorts were too low to support the anticoagulation threshold recommended by the AHA/ACC/HRS and ESC guidelines (CHA₂DS₂‐VASc ≥ 2, discounting female sex, for the ESC guidelines). Marked differences in stroke rates were reported from separate studies from the same national database and from national databases from adjacent countries, making it unlikely that the observed differences reflected true differences in population stroke rates.

### Can we predict stroke in atrial fibrillation [^115G7MpJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Stroke prevention with appropriate thromboprophylaxis remains central to the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, stroke risk in AF is not homogeneous. Despite stroke risk in AF being a continuum, prior stroke risk stratification schemas have been used to artificially categorize patients into low, moderate, and high-risk strata. This approach helps identify patients at the highest risk who can benefit from warfarin therapy. Recent data from large cohort studies indicate that a more inclusive approach, considering common stroke risk factors in the assessment of risk for stroke and thromboembolism in AF patients, enhances our ability to assess stroke risk and optimize thromboprophylaxis, resulting in reduced stroke incidence and mortality.

A recent paradigm shift emphasizes identifying the 'truly low risk' patients with AF who do not require antithrombotic therapy. In contrast, those with one or more stroke risk factors can be treated with oral anticoagulation, whether through well-controlled warfarin or one of the new oral anticoagulant drugs. The new European guidelines on AF have evolved to de-emphasize the artificial low/moderate/high risk strata because they were not very predictive of thromboembolism. Instead, they stress a risk factor-based approach using the CHA(2) DS(2)-VASc score, acknowledging that stroke risk is a continuum. Patients categorized as 'low risk' using the CHA(2) DS(2)-VASc score are genuinely at low risk for thromboembolism, and the CHA(2) DS(2)-VASc score performs as well as, and possibly better than, previous methods.

### Should atrial fibrillation patients with only 1 nongender-related CHA2DS2-VASc risk factor be anticoagulated [^115HKHFv]? Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

There is some uncertainty about treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have one nongender-related (NGR) stroke risk factor (CHA2DS2-VASc [i.e. congestive heart failure, hypertension, age (≥ 75 years; 2 points), diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack (2 points), vascular disease, age (65–74 years), sex (female)] score of 1 in males and 2 in females) with oral anticoagulation (OAC).

- **Methods**: We investigated adverse outcomes and calculated the net clinical benefit of OAC use in a community-based cohort of unselected AF patients with 0 compared with 1 NGR stroke risk factor (CHA2DS2-VASc 0 versus 1 in males; and 1 versus 2 in females). Among 8962 patients with AF, 2208 (25%) had 0 or 1 NGR stroke risk factors, of which 45% were not prescribed OAC.

- **Results**: During a follow-up of 1028 ± 1189 days (median, 495; interquartile range, 5–1882 days), the yearly rate of the combined end point of stroke/systemic embolism in nonanticoagulated AF patients with 1 NGR stroke risk factor was 2.09% (95% confidence interval, 1.37–3.18). This corresponded to an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.82 (95% confidence interval, 1.32–6.04) relative to the group with 0 NGR stroke risk factor. When the benefit of ischemic stroke reduction was balanced against the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage among patients with 1 NGR stroke risk factor, the net clinical benefit was positive in favor of OAC use versus no antithrombotic therapy or antiplatelet therapy use. The net clinical benefit was negative for antiplatelet therapy use versus no antithrombotic therapy.

- **Conclusion**: In conclusion, the study suggests that in patients with atrial fibrillation and 1 NGR stroke risk factor, the net clinical benefit favors the use of oral anticoagulation over no antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapy.

### Chads₂, CHA₂DS₂-VASc, and long-term stroke outcome in patients without atrial fibrillation [^111ZxWqY]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The CHADS₂ and CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores are typically used to assess stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). This study investigated whether these scores are associated with stroke outcomes in non-AF stroke patients.

Consecutive patients with acute first-ever ischemic stroke but without AF were classified into subgroups based on their prestroke CHADS₂ and CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores and were followed up for 5 years. The endpoints analyzed were death, stroke recurrence, and a composite of major cardiovascular events.

Among 1,756 patients (average age 67.2 ± 12.3 years, 68.2% male), there were 258 (14.7%), 617 (35.3%), and 878 (50.0%) patients in the low, intermediate, and high CHADS₂ score groups, respectively. The corresponding figures for the CHA₂DS₂-VASc subgroups were 110 (6.3%), 255 (14.5%), and 1,391 (79.2%). Significant differences were observed between CHADS₂ subgroups in 5-year mortality (log-rank test = 74.5, p < 0.0001), stroke recurrence (log-rank test = 12.3, p = 0.002), and cardiovascular events (log-rank test = 19.4, p < 0.001). Similarly, significant differences were noted between CHA₂DS₂-VASc subgroups in 5-year mortality (log-rank test = 74.5, p < 0.0001), stroke recurrence (log-rank test = 10.6, p = 0.005), and cardiovascular events (log-rank test = 16.4, p < 0.001). Compared with the low-risk group, patients in the intermediate- and high-risk CHADS₂ subgroups had higher 5-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.22 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.78–2.77] and 3.66 [95% CI: 2.38–5.62], respectively) and stroke recurrence (HR: 1.74 [95% CI: 1.09–2.79] and 1.71 [95% CI: 1.08–2.71], respectively).

### Should we recommend oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing coronary artery stenting with a high HAS-BLED bleeding risk score [^114ZArxp]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2012). Low credibility.

Recent European guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation recommend oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score ≥ 1. This score includes factors such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes, history of previous stroke, vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and female sex category. The HAS-BLED score, which considers hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly age (> 65 years), and the use of drugs/alcohol concomitantly, is suggested for assessing bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation patients. A score of ≥ 3 indicates a high risk of bleeding. Despite these guidelines, the approach has not been tested in a cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation.

- **Methods and results**: We studied 590 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention/stenting and a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score > 1, where OAC is recommended. Patients were compared based on low-intermediate bleeding risk (HAS-BLED 0–2) and high risk (HAS-BLED ≥ 3). We examined the relation between CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, and assessed the benefit and risks of OAC in patients with a high bleeding risk. The development of any bleeding episode, thromboembolism, mortality, cardiac events, and the composite of major adverse cardiac events (such as death, acute myocardial infarction, and/or target lesion revascularization) were recorded, along with the composite major adverse events, which include major adverse cardiac events, major bleeding, or thromboembolism.

### Are atrial fibrillation patients receiving warfarin in accordance with stroke risk [^113ZE8Wy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter provide recommendations for anticoagulation based on patients' overall risk of stroke. To determine the real-world compliance of physicians with these recommendations, we conducted a retrospective cohort study examining the utilization of warfarin in atrial fibrillation/flutter patients by stroke risk level.

- **Methods**: Patients with a qualifying atrial fibrillation/flutter diagnosis during ≥ 18 months' continuous enrollment between January 2003 and September 2007, and with ≥ 6 months' eligibility after the first atrial fibrillation/flutter diagnosis, were identified from the US MarketScan database (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY). Warfarin use within 30 days of the first diagnosis was assessed according to stroke risk, estimated using the Congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension, Age > 75 years, Diabetes, Stroke (CHADS(2)) score.

- **Results**: Of 171,393 patients included in the analysis, 20.0% had a CHADS(2) score of 0 (low risk), 61.6% a score of 1–2 (moderate risk), and 18.4% a score of 3–6 (high risk). Warfarin, recommended for high stroke-risk patients, was given to only 42.1% of those with a CHADS(2) score of 3–6. A similar percentage of patients with moderate (43.5%) or low stroke risk (40.1%) received warfarin. Only 29.6% of high-risk, 33.3% of moderate-risk, and 34.1% of low-risk patients who were started on warfarin received uninterrupted therapy for 6 months following their initial prescription.

- **Conclusions**: These data suggest that guideline recommendations that anticoagulation therapy should be based on stroke risk are not consistently followed in practice.

### Advances in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: enhanced risk stratification combined with the newer oral anticoagulants [^116G6XZc]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have an increased stroke risk compared to those in sinus rhythm, although the absolute risk for individual patients is modulated by the presence of various additional risk factors. Patient selection for oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention is based on the risks of stroke and bleeding. Although CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke or transient ischemic attack) is the most widely used scheme for evaluating stroke risk in patients with AF, several other stroke risk factors are not included, and therefore, many patients' stroke risk may be underestimated, contributing to the underuse of anticoagulants.

Furthermore, a substantial proportion of patients are categorized as being at moderate risk (CHADS2 = 1), and there has been some ambiguity regarding optimum thromboprophylaxis in this group. The refinement of CHADS2, through the CHA2DS2-VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age 75 years [2 points], Diabetes mellitus, Stroke or transient ischemic attack [2 points], Vascular disease, Age 65 to 74 years, Sex category [female]) score, considers additional risk factors. Its main advantage is its ability to identify patients truly at low risk of thromboembolism (CHA2DS2-VASc = 0), who are unlikely to benefit from antithrombotic therapy. For all others, an oral anticoagulant may be the preferred approach, simplifying clinical decision-making. Implementation of CHA2DS2-VASc may also result in an increased proportion of patients receiving anticoagulation. The emergence of newer oral anticoagulants facilitates this process.

### How well do stroke risk scores predict hemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112Pn5HU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The decision to use anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation depends on comparing a patient's estimated risk of stroke to their bleeding risk. Several of the risk factors in the stroke risk schemes overlap with hemorrhage risk. We compared how well two stroke risk scores (CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc) and two hemorrhage risk scores (the ATRIA bleeding score and the HAS-BLED score) predicted major hemorrhage in a cohort of 13,559 community-dwelling adults with atrial fibrillation, both on and off warfarin.

Over a cumulative 64,741 person-years of follow-up, we identified a total of 777 incident major hemorrhage events. The ATRIA bleeding score had the highest predictive ability of all the scores in patients on warfarin (c-index of 0.74 [0.72 to 0.76] compared with 0.65 [0.62 to 0.67] for CHADS2, 0.65 [0.62 to 0.67] for CHA2DS2-VASc, and 0.64 [0.61 to 0.66] for HAS-BLED) and in those off warfarin (0.77 [0.74 to 0.79] compared with 0.67 [0.64 to 0.71] for CHADS2, 0.67 [0.64 to 0.70] for CHA2DS2-VASc, and 0.68 [0.65 to 0.71] for HAS-BLED).

In conclusion, although the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc stroke scores were better at predicting hemorrhage than chance alone, they were inferior to the ATRIA bleeding score. Our study supports the use of dedicated hemorrhage risk stratification tools to predict major hemorrhage in atrial fibrillation.

### Renal dysfunction, stroke risk scores (CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and R2CHADS2), and the risk of thromboembolic events after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation: the Leipzig Heart Center AF Ablation Registry [^112CcFB1]. Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

There are limited data on the predictive value of stroke risk scores for thromboembolic events (TEs) after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). Our objectives were to report the incidence of TEs after AF ablation in a large contemporary AF ablation cohort and to investigate the impact of renal dysfunction and the value of stroke risk stratification scores (CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and R2CHADS2) for predicting TE after AF ablation.

- **Methods and results**: Using the Leipzig Heart Center AF Ablation Registry, we documented TEs in patients undergoing radiofrequency AF catheter ablation. TE was defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism. The study population (N = 2069; 66% men; 60 ± 10 years; 62% paroxysmal AF; mean CHADS2, 1.2 ± 0.9; CHA2DS2-VASc, 2.1 ± 1.4; and R2CHADS2, 1.3 ± 1.1) was followed up for a median of 18 (Q1-Q3, 12–29) months (i.e. 3078 patient-years). Overall, 31 TEs occurred, with 16 events within 30 days of ablation and 15 TEs (0.72%) during the follow-up period. On multivariate analysis, CHADS2 (P2) had the best predictive value in patients with AF recurrences (c-index 0.894, P = 0.022 versus CHADS2, P = 0.031 versus R2CHADS2).

- **Conclusions**: CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and R2CHADS2 scores have a role in risk stratification for TEs following AF ablation, particularly in patients with AF recurrences.

### CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc score to assess risk of stroke and death in patients paced for sick sinus syndrome [^114RZwv8]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

- **Figure 2**: HRs for the CHADS2 score and its association with stroke for all patients and patients without a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) at baseline (AF-free patients) are shown. C represents NYHA class at baseline > 1; H denotes medical treatment for hypertension; A is age ≥ 75; D stands for diabetes; S2 refers to previous stroke or TIA. AS2 combines A and S2 (A+S2). *Five patients with unknown NYHA at baseline are counted as 0. **S2 takes the values 0 and 2. HR corresponds to an increase in S2 by 1.

- **Application of the CHA2DS2-VASc score**: The score ranges from 0 to 9, showing a significant association with the risk of stroke (Figure 3). When only age and previous stroke/TIA/arterial embolism (0–4 points) were included, a significant association with the risk of stroke was observed. Analyzing only the 'AF-free' patients, a univariate analysis demonstrated that the CHA2DS2-VASc score, as well as the variables age and stroke/TIA/arterial embolism, were significantly associated with the risk of stroke. Excluding patients with OAC at baseline did not change results (please see online supplementary table S3).

- **Figure 3**: HRs for the CHA2DS2-VASc score and its association with stroke for all patients and those without a history of AF at baseline (AF-free patients) are depicted. C is NYHA class at baseline > 1; H stands for medical treatment for hypertension; A2 signifies age ≥ 75; D represents diabetes; S2 indicates previous stroke, TIA, or arterial embolism; V refers to vascular disease; A is age 65–75; Sc is the (female) sex category; A2S2A includes A2, S2, and A combined (A2+S2+A). *Patients with unknown NYHA or LVEF at baseline are counted accordingly.
