## Question

can prostate surgery history cause hematuria?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a history of prostate surgery can cause hematuria. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the types of prostate surgery and how they might injure vascular or urothelial tissues. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to bleeding after these procedures. Next, I will review direct clinical evidence linking prostate surgery to hematuria across different contexts. After that, I need to consider confounders and alternative explanations, including malignancy and radiation effects. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline practical implications for evaluation and management.

> Let me first confirm the surgical contexts we're discussing, because the mechanism and risk vary with the procedure. Prostate surgery includes transurethral resection of the prostate for BPH, radical prostatectomy for cancer, and various minimally invasive or laser approaches, and each can disrupt prostatic or urethral mucosa and vessels, creating a substrate for bleeding that may present as hematuria [^d89138b6] [^1fd33eae].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology. Wait, let me verify the key mechanisms: direct mucosal or vascular injury during instrumentation, postoperative healing with friable granulation tissue, neovascularization after tissue loss, and delayed bleeding from exposed or fragile vessels are all plausible. Importantly, after TURP or vaporization, regrowth of vascular tissue can predispose to recurrent bleeding, and anticoagulation amplifies risk, which aligns with observed delayed hematuria after photoselective vaporization and with the known bleeding risks of prostate procedures [^68b5a752] [^23f80e2c] [^300cfc32].

> Next, I should review direct evidence. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether hematuria is explicitly documented after prostate surgery. The AUA BPH guideline lists gross hematuria due to BPH as an indication for surgery, and it also recognizes that 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors can be used for refractory prostatic bleeding after other causes are excluded, which implies that prostatic bleeding — and thus hematuria — is a recognized post-surgical and prostatic phenomenon. Finasteride series show high response rates for BPH-related gross hematuria, including in patients with prior prostate surgery, supporting a causal link in selected cases [^3cf1433a] [^59f65832] [^e1d85675].

> But wait, what if the hematuria reflects something else entirely? I need to ensure we consider confounders. Prostate surgery patients may also have hematuria from bladder cancer, radiation cystitis, urethral stricture, or infection; indeed, radiation for prostate cancer increases second-malignancy risk including bladder cancer, and hematuria after radiation is common and sometimes due to radiation cystitis, so I should not attribute all bleeding to the surgery itself without evaluation. Similarly, post-prostatectomy radiotherapy cohorts show substantial rates of hematuria over time, reinforcing that not all hematuria in this population is purely surgical in origin [^3a7c65ca] [^992c1bb2] [^5552434d].

> Let me consider the clinical implications carefully. I should confirm that new hematuria after prostate surgery warrants a standard workup to exclude malignancy and other serious causes before labeling it as prostatic bleeding. Guidelines for microscopic and gross hematuria recommend history, exam, urinalysis, renal function assessment, upper tract imaging, and cystoscopy in appropriate risk contexts, and this applies even when there is a history of prostate surgery, because surgery does not eliminate cancer risk and may even complicate presentation and attribution of bleeding sources [^d50b5e85] [^9d2fb66f] [^d8ee5911].

> I should double-check management pathways when prostatic bleeding is suspected after other causes are excluded. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are a reasonable first-line medical therapy for presumed prostatic bleeding, and if refractory, procedural options such as repeat TURP or prostatic artery embolization can be considered. PAE has multisociety support as an option for hematuria of prostatic origin, albeit with lower-quality evidence, and should be individualized based on anatomy, comorbidities, and anticoagulation status [^59f65832] [^7299fadf] [^89173efc].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the evidence. Yes, prostate surgery can cause hematuria, via direct injury, postoperative vascular friability, and neovascular regrowth, and this is well-described in the context of BPH procedures and supported by guideline recognition of prostatic bleeding as a clinical entity. However, hematuria in someone with a history of prostate surgery is not automatically benign, so a structured evaluation for malignancy and other urologic causes remains essential before attributing it to prostatic bleeding alone [^3cf1433a] [^59f65832] [^d50b5e85].

Prostate surgery can cause hematuria through **direct mucosal injury** and **postoperative vascular fragility**, with bleeding typically resolving within days to weeks [^notfound]. Persistent or delayed hematuria may reflect **infection, stricture, or radiation cystitis** [^992c1bb2], and **anticoagulation increases risk** [^23f80e2c]. Initial management is conservative (hydration, catheterization, antibiotics), but persistent or severe cases need cystoscopy and imaging to exclude malignancy or structural lesions [^d50b5e85] [^9d2fb66f]. Finasteride or dutasteride can reduce recurrence in BPH-related bleeding [^e1d85675], and prostatic artery embolization is an option for refractory cases [^7299fadf].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of hematuria after prostate surgery

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** explain hematuria after prostate surgery:

- **Direct mucosal injury**: Surgical instruments can traumatize the prostatic urethra or bladder neck, causing immediate bleeding.

- **Vascular fragility**: Postoperative neovascularization and inflammation make vessels fragile and prone to bleeding with minimal trauma or straining.

- **Infection and inflammation**: Postoperative infections can exacerbate bleeding by irritating the mucosa.

- **Stricture formation**: Urethral strictures from scarring can cause turbulent flow and mucosal trauma, leading to hematuria.

- **Radiation-induced cystitis**: After radiotherapy, chronic ischemic changes can cause friable mucosa and recurrent bleeding [^992c1bb2].

---

## Incidence and clinical presentation

The incidence of hematuria after prostate surgery varies by procedure and patient factors. Immediate postoperative hematuria is common and usually self-limited, whereas **delayed hematuria** can occur weeks to months later and may be recurrent. Clinically, hematuria ranges from microscopic to gross bleeding with clots; **gross hematuria** is more concerning and often prompts urgent evaluation [^966b6000].

---

## Risk factors for hematuria after prostate surgery

Several factors increase the risk of **postoperative hematuria**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy | Strongly increases bleeding risk [^23f80e2c] [^992c1bb2] |
| Large prostate size | Greater surgical trauma and vascularity [^23f80e2c] |
| Operative technique | TURP and laser vaporization carry different risks [^23f80e2c] |
| Postoperative infection | Inflammation exacerbates bleeding |
| Radiation therapy | Radiation cystitis causes chronic bleeding [^992c1bb2] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Persistent or severe hematuria warrants a **structured evaluation**:

- **History and physical examination**: Assess bleeding severity, anticoagulant use, infection symptoms, and prior radiation [^d50b5e85].

- **Laboratory tests**: Urinalysis, CBC, renal function, and coagulation profile [^d50b5e85].

- **Imaging**: Renal ultrasound or CT urography to exclude stones, tumors, or structural lesions [^9d2fb66f].

- **Cystoscopy**: Essential to visualize the urethra, prostate, and bladder for bleeding sites, strictures, or tumors [^258b589d].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on severity and underlying cause:

- **Conservative management**: Hydration, catheterization, and antibiotics for infection are first-line [^notfound].

- **Medical therapy**: Finasteride or dutasteride reduce vascularity and recurrence in BPH-related bleeding [^e1d85675] [^89173efc].

- **Endoscopic interventions**: Cauterization, laser coagulation, or transurethral resection for identifiable bleeding sites.

- **Prostatic artery embolization**: Effective for refractory hematuria, especially in radiation cystitis or BPH [^7299fadf] [^24bebe0e].

- **Surgical interventions**: Reserved for refractory cases, including transurethral resection or open surgery [^3389ff49].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Most cases resolve with conservative management, but recurrence is common, especially with ongoing anticoagulation or radiation cystitis. Long-term outcomes depend on controlling the underlying cause and patient comorbidities [^992c1bb2].

---

Prostate surgery can cause hematuria through direct injury, vascular fragility, infection, stricture, or radiation cystitis; **most cases resolve with conservative care**, but persistent bleeding needs cystoscopy and imaging, with medical therapy, endoscopic or embolic interventions, or surgery for refractory cases.

### The approach to the patient with hematuria [^966b6000]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is common; whether gross or microscopic, it is incumbent on emergency providers to consider life-threatening and benign processes when evaluating these patients. Most workup is driven by a focused history and physical, including laboratory studies and diagnostic imaging. The cause originates in the genitourinary tract and, as long as the patient remains stable, they can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough because hematuria, especially in the elderly, frequently signals the presence of urologic malignancy. In addition, the workup occasionally yields a nongenitourinary tract cause, and these patients often require emergent management.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria—risk predictors and diagnostic definition context: Among women, being older than 60 years, having a history of smoking, and having gross hematuria are the strongest predictors of urologic cancer, and the 2012 American Urological Association guidelines require only a single positive properly collected specimen with three or more red blood cells per high-power field with no obvious benign cause.

### Assessment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults [^258b589d]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although routine screening for bladder cancer is not recommended, microscopic hematuria is often incidentally discovered by primary care physicians. The American Urological Association has published an updated guideline for the management of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, which is defined as the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field visible in a properly collected urine specimen without evidence of infection. The most common causes of microscopic hematuria are urinary tract infection, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary calculi. However, up to 5% of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria are found to have a urinary tract malignancy. The risk of urologic malignancy is increased in men, persons older than 35 years, and persons with a history of smoking. Microscopic hematuria in the setting of urinary tract infection should resolve after appropriate antibiotic treatment; persistence of hematuria warrants a diagnostic workup. Dysmorphic red blood cells, cellular casts, proteinuria, elevated creatinine levels, or hypertension in the presence of microscopic hematuria should prompt concurrent nephrologic and urologic referral. The upper urinary tract is best evaluated with multiphasic computed tomography urography, which identifies hydronephrosis, urinary calculi, and renal and ureteral lesions. The lower urinary tract is best evaluated with cystoscopy for urethral stricture disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bladder masses. Voided urine cytology is no longer recommended as part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, unless there are risk factors for malignancy.

### A (relatively) risky business: the link between prostatic radiotherapy and second malignancies [^3a7c65ca]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Previous studies have adopted variable “lag times” (ranging from two months to over 10 years) to define a tumor as “radiation induced.” The latency of such tumors likely varies by tissue type, individual biology, and age at exposure, among other factors.Importantly, in the absence of a clear biologically justified “lag time” for analysis, Wallis and colleagues confirmed that risk estimates after adjustment for “lag times” of both five or 10 years were consistent with their pooled risk estimates.

From the perspective of the radiation oncologist, this study “firms up” the suspicion that irradiation of the prostate increases the risk of second bladder and colorectal cancers in a time dependent manner. A pragmatist, however, might ask, what are the real world implications for individual patients? Despite an impressive relative risk, the absolute risk remains small, and the cancers discovered, although certainly requiring treatment, might not be lethal. This is particularly true of smaller bladder cancers discovered incidentally during cystoscopy for radiation related hematuria, which is a relatively common event. Indeed, there seems to be no survival difference between men with bladder cancers linked to previous prostate irradiation and bladder cancers identified in patients treated with surgery.Ultimately, clinicians and patients must decide together whether, for example, the roughly 1.4-1.7-fold increase in relative risk of a second malignancy after a 10 year lag period justifies alternative treatments. Young patients with few comorbidities might be more likely to factor this risk into their decision making, whereas older patients or those with competing health risks, might not and indeed should not.

Wallis and colleagues found a notable effect of “tissue volume,” and brachytherapy (high radiation dose to a small volume of tissue) was not associated with a detectable increase in risk. Therefore, the current move towards smaller tighter treatment volumes might well shift the contemporary risk back towards unity. Many studies included in this analysis were performed at a time when older poorly targeted radiation techniques were used, and large volumes of normal pelvic tissue were irradiated during treatment

While the absolute risk of second malignancy seems small, there might be subgroups with higher absolute risks and others for whom risks are negligible. Prospective analyses with large multi-institutional databases and registries could identify the predisposing characteristics of patients and culpable technical factors associated with radiation associated malignancies. Combination of these analyses with paired biologic samples of tumor and normal tissue might additionally permit investigation of subtle genetic or epigenetic factors that influence the likelihood of tumors associated with radiation.

### Updates to incontinence after prostate treatment: AUA / GURS / SUFU guideline (2024) [^8b175b2b]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) before surgery—confirmation and testing: Prior to surgical intervention for stress urinary incontinence, clinicians should confirm stress urinary incontinence by history, physical exam, or ancillary testing (Clinical Principle). History of SUI has a 95% positive predictive and 100% negative predictive value for the presence of SUI on UDS. The AUA/SUFU Guideline on the Surgical Management of Female Stress Urinary Incontinence states that the objective demonstration of SUI should be confirmed prior to surgical management (based on Panel consensus), and the International Continence Society consensus Panel on AUS recommended that every effort should be made to objectively confirm the presence of SUI prior to AUS placement. Clinicians should take all reasonable measures to demonstrate SUI on physical exam with or without provocative testing such as bending, shifting position, or rising from seated to standing position, and stress pad testing can also be performed; if there is any doubt as to whether the patient has SUI, UDS may be performed. In suspected overflow incontinence, a post-void residual (PVR) may be helpful to rule out significant retention of urine, and the presence of microscopic hematuria may warrant additional evaluation with upper tract imaging and cystoscopy. The assessment of PVR may alert the physician to the potential for incomplete bladder emptying; however, the reliability of a single elevated PVR value for predicting emptying dysfunction remains in question, just as a single low PVR value does not rule out the presence of incomplete emptying.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia: clinical manifestations, imaging, and patient selection for prostate artery embolization [^033aa7d3]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Prostate artery embolization (PAE) has been shown to be safe and effective at treating lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), urinary retention, and hematuria caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). To distinguish from other causes of these symptoms, a multidisciplinary evaluation by a urologist and interventional radiologist should include a complete history to screen for any nonprostate causes of LUTS. The International Prostate Symptom Score is a useful objective measure to quantify the patient's urinary complaints. A physical exam should be performed to evaluate a patient's candidacy for angiography, and baseline laboratory evaluation should ensure that the patient's coagulation and kidney function are adequate. In certain situations, patients may benefit from cystoscopy and urodynamic evaluation to ensure their symptoms are related to BPH. A review of the patient's imagining can be the most important component of the evaluation of a patient prior to PAE, because a patient's gland size is often a primary driver of what procedural options available are to him. Men with small glands (≤30 mL) can be treated with several of the available minimally invasive transurethral procedures, but larger glands (≥80-120 mL) may be limited to holmium laser enucleation of prostate, thulium laser enucleation of prostate, surgical prostatectomy, or PAE, depending on institutional practice patterns. Secondary considerations include medical comorbidities, the risks for sexual side effects, the risk for bleeding, and the possible adverse events associated with the procedure, which are all low for PAE. Most patients suffering from symptomatic BPH resulting in LUTS, retention, or hematuria will benefit from PAE.

### EAU guidelines on the assessment of non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms including benign prostatic obstruction [^36115fb2]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) represent one of the most common clinical complaints in adult men and have multifactorial aetiology.

Objective

To develop European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on the assessment of men with non-neurogenic LUTS.

Evidence Acquisition

A structured literature search on the assessment of non-neurogenic male LUTS was conducted. Articles with the highest available level of evidence were selected. The Delphi technique consensus approach was used to develop the recommendations.

Evidence Synthesis

As a routine part of the initial assessment of male LUTS, a medical history must be taken, a validated symptom score questionnaire with quality-of-life question(s) should be completed, a physical examination including digital rectal examination should be performed, urinalysis must be ordered, post-void residual urine (PVR) should be measured, and uroflowmetry may be performed. Micturition frequency-volume charts or bladder diaries should be used to assess male LUTS with a prominent storage component or nocturia. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) should be measured only if a diagnosis of prostate cancer will change the management or if PSA can assist in decision-making for patients at risk of symptom progression and complications. Renal function must be assessed if renal impairment is suspected from the history and clinical examination, if the patient has hydronephrosis, or when considering surgical treatment for male LUTS. Uroflowmetry should be performed before any treatment. Imaging of the upper urinary tract in men with LUTS should be performed in patients with large PVR, haematuria, or a history of urolithiasis. Imaging of the prostate should be performed if this assists in choosing the appropriate drug and when considering surgical treatment. Urethrocystoscopy should only be performed in men with LUTS to exclude suspected bladder or urethral pathology and/or before minimally invasive/surgical therapies if the findings may change treatment. Pressure-flow studies should be performed only in individual patients for specific indications before surgery or when evaluation of the pathophysiology underlying LUTS is warranted.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide evidence-based practical guidance for assessment of non-neurogenic male LUTS. An extended version is available online (www.uroweb.org/guidelines).

Patient Summary

This article presents a short version of European Association of Urology guidelines for non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The recommended tests should be able to distinguish between uncomplicated male LUTS and possible differential diagnoses and to evaluate baseline parameters for treatment. The guidelines also define the clinical profile of patients to provide the best evidence-based care. An algorithm was developed to guide physicians in using appropriate diagnostic tests.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^0c60c08c]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD)—history, physical examination, and urinalysis elements are specified. History elements include lower urinary tract management (voluntary voiding, CIC, indwelling catheter), LUTS, catheterization use, incontinence, sexual and fertility function, bowel function, skin integrity, AD, renal function tests and imaging, current and prior assessments and management (behavioral, medical, surgical), efficacy and adverse events, complications (stones, UTIs, catheter issues, skin breakdown), functional limitations, socio-economic support, goals of evaluation within the neurological condition, co-existent genitourinary conditions and prior GU surgery, past medical and surgical history, medications, and allergies. Physical exam components include general mental status and cognition, mobility and upper extremity function, abdominal and flank exam, pelvic and vaginal examination in females, genital and digital rectal exam, rectal tone, masses, reflexes and prostate assessment in males, skin integrity of pelvis, perineum, buttocks, lower back, and lower extremities, and directed neurological assessment including evaluation of bulbocavernosus, anal and cremasteric reflexes and tone and voluntary contraction of the anal sphincter and pelvic floor muscles. UA (dipstick and/or microscopic) is performed to assess for hematuria, pyuria, glucosuria, proteinuria, and other findings; abnormalities should be interpreted in context and an initial abnormal dipstick UA may prompt formal microscopic examination; the initial evaluation is part of risk stratification and may or may not lead to further investigations such as urinary tract imaging or multichannel UDS.

### Hematuria [^d5f3a63e]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician can expect to commonly evaluate patients with hematuria, and the differential diagnosis will include both benign and life-threatening causes. This differential is divided into the following categories: glomerular or nonglomerular, coagulopathy-related, traumatic, and factitious causes. Nonglomerular causes account for the majority of hematuria evaluated in the ED, with infection and stones being the most prevalent diagnoses. Glomerular causes will have associated red cell casts and proteinuria present on urinalysis. Painless atraumatic gross hematuria in the elderly is caused by a malignancy until proven otherwise. A focused history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic testing in the ED usually yields a diagnosis. If the patient is discharged home, proper follow-up with the primary care physician, urologist, or nephrologist is indicated, depending upon the diagnosis.

### Carcinoma in situ within the bladder trigone with an isolated metastasis to the prostate without involvement of prostatic urethra: a unique case report [^bbfcee14]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder, first described by Melicow MM. in 1952, is recognized as a malignant bladder condition carrying a significant risk for disease progression and increased mortality due to bladder cancer. It can be identified at various times, including (1) Primary CIS, when there’s no previous bladder cancer history; (2) Concomitant CIS, when it’s found at the same time as non-muscle-invasive (NMIBC) or muscle-invasive (MIBC) bladder cancers; and (3) Secondary CIS, when it’s detected in follow-up in patients who have had bladder cancer before. Having a first-degree relative who has been diagnosed with bladder cancer significantly increases the risk of developing the disease. The patient’s father’s death from bladder cancer further emphasizes the potential hereditary risk factors associated with the condition. While it’s known that smoking can elevate the risk of developing bladder cancer by up to fivefold, in this instance, the patient has no history of smoking. Due to the lack of a specific screening test for bladder cancer, the diagnostic process frequently depends upon the recognition of some clinical manifestation in primary healthcare settings. Shephard EA and colleagues’ study among those patients revealed seven distinct characteristics that were independently predictive of bladder cancer, which were gross hematuria, dysuria, urinary tract infection, leukocytosis, abdominal pain, elevated inflammatory markers, and elevated creatinine levels. The Expert Panel of the American Urological Association has described asymptomatic microscopic hematuria as identifying “three or more red blood cells per high-power field” when examining urinary sediment under a microscope, from at least two of three urine samples collected correctly. In this case, the initial urinalysis revealed 60–80 RBCs per field with positive hemoglobin, in conjunction with gross hematuria. A follow-up urinalysis four weeks later still showed 8–10 RBCs per field. And thus, further testing was pursued to determine the cause of the patient’s persistent microscopic hematuria. Roughly 75% of bladder cancer patients exhibit intermittent hematuria that is painless. Studies suggest that around 20% of individuals assessed for gross hematuria will end up with a diagnosis of bladder cancer. In cases where patients have non-visible, microscopic blood traces in the urine, there’s about a 10% chance they will be found to have bladder cancer. The clinical assessment of the spread of UC can be challenging, but combining the histopathological reports with imaging methods such as Ultrasonography (USG), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can aid in determining the size and extent of the primary tumor and identifying any metastases to lymph nodes or distant organs. The occurrence of primary initial CIS of the prostate is exceptionally uncommon. Around 90% of prostatic CIS cases are detected alongside either papillary or invasive urothelial carcinoma (UC), commonly situated in the bladder, as the presence of bladder CIS elevates the risk of concurrent prostatic CIS. Accurately assessing the full extent of CIS within the prostate is crucial. For optimal results, a biopsy should be taken from the prostatic urethra using a resectoscope with a loop electrode, focusing on regions at the 5 and 7 o’clock marks stretching from the bladder neck to the verumontanum, which includes the areas of the ejaculatory ducts. Such a procedure is key to detecting whether the CIS has invaded the prostatic ducts (pdCIS) or infiltrated the prostatic stroma (psCIS), while it’s also noted that in 20% of cases, CIS remains localized to just the prostatic urethra (puCIS). Stromal invasion is associated with poorer survival compared to non-invasive disease, with a 15-year survival rate of 82% for patients without invasion, whereas it drops to 48% for those with stromal invasion. In this instance, the prostatic urethra was clear of any malignancy; however, a solitary metastasis was identified within the prostatic ducts. The mechanisms behind this selective metastasis may be linked to the anatomy of the prostatic ducts and their fluid dynamics, or possibly due to the expression of specific adhesion molecules or growth factors that facilitate the migration of cancer cells to this location. Primary UC typically presents with positive GATA-3 marker results, which aligns with the findings in this particular case. This lesion progressed to invade the peripheral zone of the prostate, at which point it was reclassified from CIS, and thus required the implementation of an aggressive approach to treatment. Research comprising numerous trials and meta-analyses regarding radical cystectomy for treating locally advanced bladder cancer strongly supports its efficacy, with a notable increase in the survival rates without recurrence among these patients. The critical factor in achieving optimal outcomes following radical cystectomy is the proficiency with which the procedure is performed. Early cystoprostatectomy in patients with minimal stromal involvement and organ-confined bladder cancer may lead to improved survival rates. Studies by Herr and Donat, as well as Esrig et al. have shown better survival outcomes in patients with prostatic stromal invasion through the intraurethral route (ranging from 64.6 to 75%) compared to non-organ-confined “extravesical” bladder tumors (ranging from 13.6 to 9%). Radical cystectomy alone is often insufficient to cure locally advanced bladder cancer (T3-T4a N0M0), making adjuvant chemotherapy highly recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence. Both methotrexate/vinblastine/doxorubicin/cisplatin (MVAC) and gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy combinations are utilized, but GC has demonstrated superior safety and improved 5-year survival statistics, thus it is now favored over the MVAC regimen.

### Clinical predictors in the use of finasteride for control of gross hematuria due to benign prostatic hyperplasia [^e1d85675]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We identify predictors of clinical response as well as response time in patients treated with finasteride for gross hematuria due to benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review was preformed of 53 patients who had been given 5 mg. finasteride daily for the treatment of active bleeding or a recent history of recurrent bleeding. Urological evaluations were negative for tumor in all patients. A history of prostatectomy, anticoagulant status and prostate size was determined. The degree of hematuria was then graded before and after finasteride treatment according to our previously described system. Of the 53 patients who were actively bleeding at initial evaluation 16 were followed to determine time required for complete resolution of hematuria.

Results

Hematuria grade improved after finasteride in 50 (94%) patients. Overall 77% of patients (41 of 53) experienced no further bleeding while taking finasteride. Mean followup was 38 months (range 3 to 86). Of the patients 86% (12 of 14) taking coumadin, 77% (10 of 13) taking aspirin and 73% (19 of 26) on no anticoagulants had no further bleeding once on finasteride. Of the patients who had undergone prior transurethral prostatectomy 84% (26 of 31) experienced no further bleeding versus 68% (15 of 22) of those who had not undergone previous surgery. In the 16 patients who began finasteride while actively bleeding the average time to clear urine was 12 days (range 2 to 45). Prostatic volume correlated with the average time needed for resolution of hematuria, which was 2.7 days or longer for small (less than 40 gm.), 10.3 days or longer for large (40 to 100), 19 days or longer for extra large (100 to 150) and 45 days or longer for extra extra large (greater than 150) glands. Hematuria resolved an average of 5.5 days versus 18.6 days in those who had or had not undergone previous prostatectomy, respectively.

Conclusions

Our long-term followup demonstrates finasteride as a useful treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia related gross hematuria, which is effective in patients who are on anticoagulants. In patients with larger prostatic volumes a longer time to response and higher incidence of recurrent but lower grade bleeding should be anticipated compared to those who have undergone prior prostatectomy or have a smaller prostate.

### Evaluation and treatment of hematospermia [^2c505734]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Hematospermia can be a distressing symptom for patients, but most cases are effectively managed by a primary care physician. Although the condition is usually benign, significant underlying pathology must be excluded by history, physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and, in select cases, other diagnostic modalities. In men younger than 40 years without risk factors (e.g., history of cancer, known urogenital malformation, bleeding disorders) and in men with no associated symptoms, hematospermia is often self-limited and requires no further evaluation or treatment other than patient reassurance. Many cases are attributable to sexually transmitted infections or other urogenital infections in men younger than 40 years who present with hematospermia associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. Workup in these patients can be limited to urinalysis and testing for sexually transmitted infections, with treatment as indicated. In men 40 years and older, iatrogenic hematospermia from urogenital instrumentation or prostate biopsy is the most common cause of blood in the semen. However, recurrent or persistent hematospermia or associated symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, weight loss, bone pain) should prompt further investigation, starting with a prostate examination and prostate-specific antigen testing to evaluate for prostate cancer. Other etiologies to consider in those 40 years and older include genitourinary infections, inflammations, vascular malformations, stones, tumors, and systemic disorders that increase bleeding risk.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^3389ff49]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)—management of retention, infection, and hematuria around surgery: Although transient urethral catheterization with an alpha-adrenergic antagonist can be considered, it is unlikely to prevent further upper urinary tract deterioration, and in men with refractory urinary retention thought secondary to BPH, surgery should be the mainstay of therapy; for recurrent UTIs and recurrent bladder calculi associated with persistently elevated post-void residual (PVR), surgical elimination of obstruction should allow almost complete bladder emptying and decrease future infection risk; cystolitholapaxy can be performed concomitantly with the prostate procedure; the use of a 5-ARI (finasteride or dutasteride) can be an effective treatment for gross hematuria secondary to BPH, but if hematuria persists, surgical removal/ablation of the offending adenomatous tissue should be the next step; in patients with medically refractory LUTS associated with BPH or who choose not to pursue other minimally invasive therapies, surgery should be offered.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^02991fe6]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer—observation describes monitoring with a history and physical exam no more often than every 12 months (without surveillance biopsies) until symptoms develop or are thought to be imminent; if symptomatic, assessment of disease burden can be performed, and treatment or palliation can be considered. Observation thus differs from active surveillance, with the goal to maintain quality of life (QOL) by avoiding noncurative treatment when prostate cancer is unlikely to cause mortality or significant morbidity; the main advantage is avoidance of possible side effects of unnecessary definitive therapy or ADT, though patients may develop urinary retention or pathologic fracture without prior symptoms or increasing PSA level.

### Gross hematuria after prostate brachytherapy [^37abd34c]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To summarize the clinical course of postimplant gross hematuria occurring past the perioperative period.

Methods

From 1998 to 2000, 226 patients were treated for prostate carcinoma by implant alone or implant with supplemental external beam radiotherapy, using palladium-103 or iodine-125. Of these 226 patients, 9 had incomplete follow-up information and 2 died of causes other than prostate cancer. As a part of their routine follow-up, the remaining 215 patients were regularly mailed self-reporting questionnaires regarding urinary incontinence and hematuria. Postimplant computed tomography-based dosimetry was available for 211 (98%) of 215 patients. Dosimetric parameters were recorded for each patient using standardized methods. The rates of hematuria resolution were calculated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired t testing.

Results

Twenty-seven patients (13%) reported at least one episode of gross hematuria occurring more than 1 week after prostate implantation. The onset and duration of bleeding varied widely. Eleven patients reported only a single, isolated episode, and 16 patients reported multiple episodes, ranging from isolated sporadic to multiple times per day. No patient required a blood transfusion. The median time from the first episode of hematuria to resolution was 3 months. Of the 27 patients who reported hematuria, 88% had resolved by 24 months from time of first bleeding. Hematuria was unrelated to the maximal or mean urethral dose.

Conclusions

Gross hematuria after brachytherapy resolves spontaneously in nearly all patients. Nonetheless, in patients without a recent workup for a genitourinary malignancy other than prostate cancer, a hematuria workup is reasonable. Because of the retrospective nature of this study and the highly variable presentation and clinical course of postimplant gross hematuria, we are unable to make firmer conclusions or recommendations regarding the role of follow-up urinalysis, urine cytology, anticoagulant medication, or supplemental beam radiation. Such an analysis will require a more controlled, prospective study of a large implant patient population.

### Evaluation of hospital-based hematuria diagnosis and subsequent cancer risk among adults in Denmark [^870fcd27]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Data on the long-term risk of urologic and nonurologic cancer after hematuria diagnosis are sparse. Such data can improve understanding of hematuria and cancer and can provide insight into the clinical course of patients with hematuria.

Objective

To assess the risk of urologic or nonurologic cancer after a hospital-based diagnosis of hematuria.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used population-based, nationwide health care databases covering all hospitals in Denmark. The data set included records of all adults (n=134 173) with an inpatient, outpatient, or emergency department diagnosis of hematuria. The study was conducted from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2013. Follow-up ended on December 31, 2013. Data analysis was performed from January 16, 2017, to September 18, 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Cumulative risk of cancer was computed, and observed cancer incidence was compared with incidence expected in the general population, using standardized incidence ratios.

Results

Of the 134 173 patients included, 52 367 (39.0%) were women, 81 806 (61.0%) were men, and the median (interquartile range) age was 59 (44-72) years. Within 3 months after hematuria diagnosis, 2647 patients (1.9%) received an invasive bladder cancer diagnosis, 1077 (0.8%) a noninvasive bladder cancer diagnosis, 569 (0.4%) a kidney cancer diagnosis, and 908 (1.1%) a prostate cancer diagnosis. The 3-month cumulative incidence (or absolute risk) of any cancer diagnosis was 4.81% (95% CI, 4.70%-4.93%), the 1-year risk was 6.65% (95% CI, 6.51%-6.78%), and the 5-year risk was 12.34% (95% CI, 12.15%-12.53%). The cumulative incidence of bladder cancer only increased from 1.20% (95% CI, 1.11%-1.30%) after 1 year to 1.36% (95% CI, 1.26%-1.46%) after 5 years of follow-up in women and from 2.93% (95% CI, 2.82%-3.05%) to 3.31% (95% CI, 3.19%-3.44%) in men. For noninvasive bladder cancer, the standardized incidence ratio in the 1 year to less than 5 years of follow-up was 5.39 (95% CI, 4.58-6.30) in patients without initial cystoscopy and was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.04-0.42) in patients with cystoscopy within 3 months after hospital-based diagnosis of hematuria. For kidney cancer, the standardized incidence ratio in the 1 year to less than 5 years of follow-up was 2.63 (95% CI, 2.15-3.18) in patients without cystoscopy and 1.20 (95% CI, 0.87-1.61) in patients with cystoscopy within 3 months after hospital-based diagnosis of hematuria. After 1 year, the risk of gynecologic and colorectal cancers was as expected or even lower, whereas the risk of hematologic malignant neoplasms remained slightly elevated.

Conclusions and Relevance

Increased risk of bladder and kidney cancers even more than 1 year after hospital-based hematuria diagnosis, as well as the slightly elevated risk of invasive bladder cancer after 5 years, may indicate that it is a marker of greater cancer risk; these findings could inform follow-up recommendations for hematuria.

### Selective arterial prostatic embolization (SAPE) for refractory hematuria of prostatic origin [^24bebe0e]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess SAPE as an alternative treatment option in patients with refractory hematuria of prostatic origin.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of charts from 10 patients. Two patients were excluded from the analysis because of severe atherosclerotic disease that prevented selective angiography of the pelvic vasculature. Therefore, 8 patients, mean age of 78.3 +/- 7.1 years with a history of refractory hematuria of prostatic origin were analyzed. All patients failed conventional therapy. The selective embolization procedures were performed between 2000 and 2006. Success was monitored with postembolization angiography and cessation of hematuria clinically.

Results

Of the 8 patients, 6 had a history of adenocarcinoma of the prostate (mean Gleason Grade 7, range 5 to 9); 4 were previously treated with external beam radiation. The remaining patient's histories were consistent with benign prostatic hypertrophy. SAPE was technically successful in all 8 patients and resulted in immediate cessation of gross hematuria. Mean follow-up postembolization was 20.0 months (range 1.5 to 86.3 months). One patient had gross hematuria develop 14 months after embolization that was attributed to a bladder tumor recurrence. One patient with T4 prostate cancer had a rectovesical fistula develop 1 month after embolization.

Conclusions

SAPE results in cessation of refractory gross hematuria in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia and patients with prostate cancer previously treated with radiotherapy. SAPE may be considered an effective treatment for gross hematuria in patients with refractory hematuria regardless of the cause (radiation, cancer and/or hyperplasia).

### The hundred person wellness project and google's baseline study: medical revolution or unnecessary and potentially harmful over-testing? [^6aacf150]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the enthusiastic endorsement of screening for prostate cancer in the 1990s and 2000s, the prospective randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that the incidence of prostate cancer in the screening group has increased significantly. One of the studies demonstrated that screening improves risk of prostate cancer-specific death but an additional 37 men needed to receive a diagnosis through screening, for every 1 saved prostate cancer death, after 11 years of follow-up. The harms associated with screening include false-positive results, over-diagnosis, over-treatment, and complications of biopsy and treatment. Among men who are undergoing prostatic biopsy, 75% of them do not have cancer; side effects include pain, fever, hematuria, hematochezia, and hematospermia. Side effects of radical prostatectomy include incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Other harms include anxiety and depression. The PIVOT trial has shown that among men with localized prostate cancer, randomized to receive radical prostatectomy or active surveillance, mortality was approximately the same after 10 years of follow-up.

The relevance of this data to the HPWP and the Baseline Study is obvious. In addition to over-diagnosis and over-treatment, we should also consider that more aggressive treatments for cancer and other diseases do not always lead to improved patient outcomes.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Registry Design

The BPH Registry is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal, observational, disease registry designed to examine patient characteristics and outcomes and physician management practices for U.S. men with BPH treated conservatively (i.e. watchful waiting or medical therapy) by urologists or primary care physicians. The registry database includes baseline information on 6924 men who were enrolled by physicians at 402 geographically diverse sites from January 2024 to February 2025. A full description of the design of the registry has been previously published. In brief, men with BPH/LUTS were eligible for enrollment if they provided consent and were presently/recently treated with approved prescription medications for BPH, untreated, or were taking botanical products. The exclusion criteria included lower urinary tract disease or carcinoma; carcinoma of the prostate, bladder, or kidney; previous prostate surgery or minimally invasive procedure; isolated bladder neck disease or urethral stenosis/strictures; gross hematuria; acute urinary retention; neurologic disease affecting urinary function; active kidney or liver disease; and the use of luteinizing hormone‐releasing hormone analogs or antiandrogens. BPH management could change during enrollment in the registry. Investigators also collected information on disease history, clinical history, and laboratory test results.

2.2 Measurements

At baseline, participants were asked to complete questionnaires evaluating the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) through the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). The IPSS scores were utilized to categorize the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) as none/mild (score 0–7), moderate (score 8–19), or severe (score 20+). Additionally, participants completed the 12‐item Short Form Health Survey (SF12). The SF12 was evaluated using the Mental Component Score (MCS) and the Physical Component Score (PCS), each ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. These scores were standardized to a general U.S. population mean of 50 ± 10. Finally, all men completed a Clinical History Form which queried self‐reported history of physician diagnosed comorbidities.

### Etiology, epidemiology, and natural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1ebc084e]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Historically, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has been a major focus of urologic practice and surgery. But a simplistic causal relationship among prostatic enlargement, progressive obstruction, lower urinary tract symptoms, retention, and complications of retention has been challenged by recognition of the incomplete overlap of prostatic enlargement with symptoms and obstruction. The result has been a greater focus on symptoms than prostatic enlargement and a shift from surgery to medical treatment. Therefore, the question can be asked whether BPH per se, the glandular enlargement as it contributes to bladder dysfunction, or hyperplastic enlargement as a biomarker for generalized lower urinary tract dysfunction are concerns. This article addresses these issues.

### Landmarks in BPH – from aetiology to medical and surgical management [^71a9baf4]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinicians treat the symptoms associated with BPH on a daily basis. Although BPH is nearly universal with age, not all men develop lower urinary tract symptoms. Over the past 100 years, several notable advances in the field of urology have not only improved our understanding of the aetiology and natural history of this common disease, but have also facilitated the development of therapeutics to effectively manage BPH-related symptoms. The high quality of modern-day diagnosis, as well as medical and surgical treatment for BPH, is a testimony to centuries of observation and decades of scientific research.

### Evaluation of hospital-based hematuria diagnosis and subsequent cancer risk among adults in Denmark [^be326fdd]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

A hospital-based hematuria diagnosis may be a marker of an increased risk of cancer. Three months to more than 5 years after the first hematuria diagnosis, the risk of urologic cancers and hematologic malignant neoplasms remained slightly elevated. Nevertheless, the cumulative incidence of cancer was low and the increased risk of urologic cancers was confined to patients without documented cystoscopy within 3 months before or after hematuria diagnosis.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^8ca0b3e5]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate biopsy risks—bleeding, infection, and missed cancer are outlined: The two primary risks are bleeding and infection, with hematuria observed in about 6% to 13% of patients; to reduce bleeding risk, anticoagulants generally are discontinued in advance. To reduce infection risk, antibiotic prophylaxis usually is used, the optimal duration may be as short as 1 day, the urinary tract infection rate ranges from 0.3% to 4%, and serious infections appear to have a rate of less than 2%. Missed cancer is a potential risk; in a prospective study of over 1000 men with PSA levels >4 ng/mL, 10% of patients with negative initial biopsy results were diagnosed with prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. Repeat-biopsy detection is associated with risk factors such as high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia on initial biopsy, advanced age, PSA velocity, or higher PSA transition zone density, with detection rates up to 2 or 3 times higher than those without such risk factors.

### Systematic review of complications of prostate biopsy [^300cfc32]. European Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Prostate biopsy is commonly performed for cancer detection and management. The benefits and risks of prostate biopsy are germane to ongoing debates about prostate cancer screening and treatment.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of complications from prostate biopsy.

Evidence Acquisition

A literature search was performed using PubMed and Embase, supplemented with additional references. Articles were reviewed for data on the following complications: hematuria, rectal bleeding, hematospermia, infection, pain, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, and mortality.

Evidence Synthesis

After biopsy, hematuria and hematospermia are common but typically mild and self-limiting. Severe rectal bleeding is uncommon. Despite antimicrobial prophylaxis, infectious complications are increasing over time and are the most common reason for hospitalization after biopsy. Pain may occur at several stages of prostate biopsy and can be mitigated by anesthetic agents and anxiety-reduction techniques. Up to 25% of men have transient LUTS after biopsy, and <2% have frank urinary retention, with slightly higher rates reported after transperineal template biopsy. Biopsy-related mortality is rare.

Conclusions

Preparation for biopsy should include antimicrobial prophylaxis and pain management. Prostate biopsy is frequently associated with minor bleeding and urinary symptoms that usually do not require intervention. Infectious complications can be serious, requiring prompt management and continued work into preventative strategies.

### Prostatic artery embolization in refractory hematuria of prostatic origin [^68b5a752]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hematuria of prostatic origin has multiple etiologies including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), iatrogenic urological trauma, prostate cancer, and radiation therapy. Hematuria secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia can occur because of the increased vascularity of the primary gland, itself, or because of the vascular re-growth following a transurethral resection of the prostate. Prostatic hematuria usually resolves with conservative measures; however, refractory hematuria of prostatic origin may require hospitalization with treatment with blood transfusions, repeated indwelling urinary catheterization, and continuous bladder irrigation. Prostate artery embolization is an emerging minimally invasive procedural therapy for men with BPH that was originally utilized for the treatment of refractory hematuria of prostatic origin . This article aims to summarize the currently available evidence around prostate artery embolization for the treatment of refractory hematuria of prostatic origin.

For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Routine cystoscopy before radical prostatectomy: is it justified? [^c2e11f8a]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

The extent of the required preoperative workup of patients who are candidates for radical prostatectomy is still controversial. Traditionally, cystoscopy has been reserved only for those patients who present with hematuria. However, several investigators have reported significant incidental cystoscopic findings among these patients and advocated the routine use of cystoscopy before radical prostatectomy. In view of the conflicting recommendations, we elected to assess the role of routine cystoscopy in a series of patients with prostate cancer at our institute.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the cystoscopic findings of 225 consecutive patients with organ-confined prostate carcinoma scheduled for radical prostatectomy. Rigid cystoscopy was performed before surgery either in an outpatient setting or on the operating table just before the operation.

Results

Significant cystoscopic findings were noted in 3 (1.3%) of 225 patients. These included a bladder stone in 1 patient, superficial bladder tumor in 1 patient, and a post-sphincteric urethral polyp containing prostatic adenocarcinoma in a third patient. This polyp was resected transurethrally and the patient was treated thereafter with irradiation because of local extension. None of the 3 patients had microscopic hematuria on urinalysis to suggest the findings. Cystoscopy was uneventful in all patients, apart from occasional mild hematuria.

Conclusions

These results show that the treatment of patients who were candidates for radical prostatectomy was affected by the findings of preoperative cystoscopy in less than 1% of the cases. We believe that in view of the low yield of cystoscopic findings in these patients, in an era in which cost effectiveness is a major issue, the routine use of cystoscopy before radical prostatectomy is not justified.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^89173efc]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)—medical and interventional adjuncts for prostatic bleeding and refractory hematuria: One early intraprostatic effect of finasteride is suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor, and men with prostate-related bleeding responded to finasteride with reduction or cessation of bleeding and reduced recurrence in long-term follow-up, with a prospective study verifying these observations; the role of short term finasteride to decrease perioperative bleeding in men undergoing TURP is less defined and is not considered to be a routine method of care, and while 5-ARIs have benefits regarding bleeding events, patients should still be counseled on potential side effects. The potential role of prostatic artery embolization (PAE) in the management of refractory hematuria is evolving; many of the studies include a small number of patients with various etiologies of hematuria, and the ability to decrease prostate volume and vascular inflow makes PAE a potential adjunct in management of refractory hematuria.

### Hemangioma of the prostate – an unusual cause of lower urinary tract symptoms: case report [^55ac2cd3]. BMC Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Hemangioma of the urinary tract is uncommon with the majority of cases located in the kidney, ureter or bladder. A number of cases of hemangioma occurring in prostatic urethra and presenting with hematuria, hematospermia or postejaculation urethral bleeding have also been reported. Hemangioma located exclusively in the prostate is extremely rare and only a few cases have previously been reported. Sundarasivarao et al. reported a case where the patient presented with chronic urine retention and the diagnosis of prostatic hemangioma was only made after prostatic enucleation. Rivoir and Kaslaris reported a case of prostatic hemangioma in a 65-year-old patient with five years history of nocturia and a single episode of temporary retention of urine. Cystoscopy showed bladder trabeculation and severely injected bladder mucosa. The urine contained a large number of erythrocytes. The patient was subjected to perineal intracapsular prostatectomy, which was complicated by intraoperative uncontrollable bleeding which despite packing and use of spongostan resulted in the patient's death the day after operation. Histology showed capillary hemangioma. Whereas diagnosis of prostatic hemangiona is relatively straightforward for the pathologist, it poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the urologist. Prostatic hemangioma has no specific clinical features apart from hematuria and heamtospermia, which can occur in many other conditions. If prostatic hemangioma presents as LUTS, as it has done in the present case, the only feature that distinguishes it from benign prostate hyperplasia is association of unexplained hematuria or hematospermia. Prostatic hemangioma can be suspected at cystoscopy by visualization of bluish red areas in the bladder or prostatic urethra. A transrectal power Doppler ultrasonography is a useful tool in diagnosing prostatic hemangioma in patients with unexplained hematospermia and/or hematuria, but we do not consider it useful in routine clinical practice unless cystoscopy suggests the presence of a hemangioma. Perhaps Doppler ultrasonography using contrast could be even more helpful showing the typical wash in wash out pattern seen in hemangiomas in the liver, but that remains to be examined. Routine rectal ultrasound used to measure prostatic volume did not reveal the presence of a hemangioma in our patient. A definitive preopertative diagnosis can usually be achieved through arteriography of the internal iliac arteries. Treatment of hemangioma in the bladder and prostate has varied from electrocautery, Nd-YAG laser to radiation or in cases of periprostatic hemangioma with selective arterial embolization. In our case hemangioma was located in the prostatic tissue. The symptoms and the urodynamic investigations were similar to those of infravesical outflow obstruction. Cystoscopy did not reveal any discoloration in the prostatic urethra or on prostatic lobes. The patient was treated as a case of prostatic hyperplasia with transurethral resection. The patient developed postoperative retention of urine and this was thought to be due to detrusor insufficiency and therefore a period of conservative treatment with self-cathererization was adopted. Prostatic hemangioma presenting as LUTS can be treated as an ordinary symptomatic prostatic enlargement by transurethral resection or other modalities such as laser evaporation. Symptomatic prostatic hemangioma if diagnosed preoperatively should be treated with TURP. We have no evidence that laser or bipolar evaporation are superior to a classic TURP. Nevertheless one might choose to use laser or bipolar techniques if possible. If a prostataic hemangioma is discovered during a TURP we recommend one should carry on with a careful transurethral resection of prostate, alternatively one could convert the procedure to laser or bipolar technique if possible. One should be cautious in performing open prostatectomy in the case of symptomatic prostatic hemangioma because of risk of undue bleeding. To our knowledge hemangioma's never become malignant, but after partial removal some regeneration with growth may occur.

### Evaluation of hospital-based hematuria diagnosis and subsequent cancer risk among adults in Denmark [^ad5165c0]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

The American Urological Association guideline for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria recommends yearly evaluation for urinary tract cancer in case of persistent hematuria after a negative urologic workup.We identified few additional cases of invasive bladder cancer more than 1 year after hematuria diagnosis among patients who underwent a cystoscopy within 3 months before or after their hematuria diagnosis. Because the American Urological Association recommends cystoscopy for all patients older than 35 years with hematuria,follow-up for more than 1 year may not be needed. This recommendation accords with suggestions by Mishriki et althat patients with monosymptomatic hematuria who have undergone a thorough initial investigation with normal results do not need further follow-up.

Inclusion of nonurologic cancers in this study adds to the existing literature. The 12-fold increased risk of any cancer during the first 3 months after the initial hematuria diagnosis likely indicates that hematuria can be the presenting symptom of an occult cancer or that an occult cancer can be an incidental finding during diagnostic workup for hematuria. For rectal and gynecologic cancers, the initial increased risk of cancer was succeeded by a compensatory decreased risk, which was sustained during more than 5 years of follow-up.

### Asymptomatic bladder stones exacerbate acute genitourinary adverse events during radiation therapy for prostate cancer: insights from two case reports [^4606f872]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is among the most frequently diagnosed malignancies in men worldwide.,Treatment for localized diseases typically consists of radical prostatectomy or a combination of radical radiation therapy and androgen deprivation therapy. Although these approaches generally yield favorable outcomes, they are often associated with complications. Genitourinary (GU) toxicities are well-documented adverse events of radiation therapy, including hematuria, dysuria, urinary retention, and increased urinary frequency.Most postradiation therapy GU toxicities are mild (grades 1 or 2 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events). However, acute GU toxicities classified as grade 3 or more are relatively rare but can significantly disrupt treatment.

Bladder stones are a well-recognized risk factor for urinary complications, as they can irritate the bladder mucosa and exacerbate symptoms. Although asymptomatic bladder stones are often managed conservatively based on factors such as stone size, the patient’s overall condition, the risk of complications, and their presence during radiation therapy may increase the acute GU toxicities.

Here, we present 2 cases of prostate cancer with preexisting asymptomatic bladder stones that developed acute grade 3 GU toxicities during radiation therapy. These cases highlight the potential for untreated bladder stones to cause severe complications and emphasize the importance of proactive risk assessment and management in preventing similar outcomes.

### Hematuria following post-prostatectomy radiotherapy: incidence increases with long-term followup [^992c1bb2]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Hematuria following post-prostatectomy radiotherapy (PPRT) is inadequately characterized. We performed a consecutive cohort study of patients treated with PPRT at our institution to characterize this complication including impact on patient-reported quality of life.

Materials and Methods

Patients with potential followup ≥4 years following PPRT were identified. Freedom from ≥grade 2 hematuria (FFG2H; macroscopic blood) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Predictors of ≥grade 2 hematuria (G2H) were assessed via log-rank tests and the Cox model. Urinary patient-reported quality of life by EPIC-26 (26-question Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite) was compared for patients with/without hematuria using mixed-effects regression.

Results

A total of 216 men received PPRT (median 68.4 Gy, IQR 68.0-68.4) from 2007 to 2016 at a median of 20 months (IQR 9-45) after prostatectomy. Median followup was 72 months (IQR 54-99). A total of 85 men developed hematuria, of whom 49 (58%) underwent cystoscopy, 13 (15%) required intervention and 26 (31%) experienced recurrent hematuria. Eight-year FFG2H was 55%. G2H was highest in men treated with anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy (HR 3.24, p &lt; 0.001), men with bladder V65 Gy ≥43% (HR 1.97, p=0.004) and men with medication allergies (HR 1.73, p = 0.049). Age <65 years (HR 0.81, p = 0.374) and diabetes mellitus (HR 0.49, p = 0.098) were not associated with G2H. Change in urinary continence (mean -3.5, 95% CI: 10.1, 3.1) and irritation/obstruction (mean -3.0, 95% CI: 5.8, -0.3) domain scores did not exceed the minimally clinically important difference for men with/without hematuria.

Conclusions

Hematuria following PPRT is common, especially among men with medication allergies and those on anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy; however, PPRT-related hematuria is typically self-limited. Limiting bladder V65 Gy may reduce PPRT-related hematuria.

### The risk and prophylactic management of bladder cancer after various forms of radiotherapy [^dd0f5551]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men and remains the second most lethal malignancy. Most patients undergoing treatment elect for radical prostatectomy or radiation. As the number of patients treated has increased and survival improved, delayed complications of these modalities has assumed increased importance. Recent studies report an increased risk of certain cancers after radiation for prostate cancer. This review aims to summarize recent data.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have confirmed the association of prostate radiation with secondary cancers. The most common secondary malignancy is bladder carcinoma. We have treated 44 patients with bladder cancer who had radiation therapy for prostate cancer. At diagnosis, 60% had tumor, which invaded the bladder muscle (T2 or greater disease). The mean latency from radiation to diagnosis of bladder cancer was 5.5 years.

Summary

Radiation therapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. In our series, patients presented at higher stage than expected from population-based studies of bladder cancer. Patients and their physicians should be aware of such risks when choosing therapy for prostate cancer. Hematuria following radiation therapy for prostate cancer should be investigated rather than being attributed to radiation-induced cystitis.

### Bladder cancer after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: detailed analysis of pathological features and outcome after radical cystectomy [^a03902f4]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed outcomes and features in patients with bladder cancer who underwent cystectomy and had a history of radiation for prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of the University of Miami cystectomy database and identified 34 patients with a history of radiotherapy for prostate cancer. An age and stage matched control group was used to compare survival. Our entire male cystectomy population was used to compare clinicopathological features.

Results

Mean age in the 34 patients with cystectomy was 75 years with a mean latency of 5 years from prostate cancer radiation. Radiotherapy was the primary treatment modality for prostate cancer in 32 of 34 patients and 2 received adjuvant radiation. Of the patients 86% received external beam radiation. Hematuria was the initial symptom in 86% of the cases. In 53% of the patients the initial diagnosis was muscle invasive bladder cancer. An ileal conduit was the method of urinary diversion in 33 cases. Major perioperative complications developed in 9% of the patients. There was 1 perioperative death, resulting in a mortality rate of 2.9%. Of the patients 54% presented with a locally advanced (pT3-4) tumor. Patients with a history of radiation therapy for prostate cancer had significantly poorer overall and bladder cancer specific survival than the matched control group.

Conclusions

Most bladder cancers in patients with a history of radiation for prostate cancer present as locally advanced tumors and patients have poorer survival than age and stage matched controls.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^10084bc5]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Prostate cancer screening—biopsy-related harms and false positives are quantified as follows: In the ProtecT trial, 73% reported moderate or greater pain, 5.5% reported moderate to severe fever, and 26.6% reported troublesome hematuria within the 35 days after biopsy, and complications from transrectal prostate biopsy required hospitalization in 1.3% of men in the UK cohort, 1.6% in the VA cohort, and 0.5% in the Rotterdam cohort. In the ERSPC trial, men older than 70 years had a higher rate of false-positive results than younger men (younger than 55 years) (20.6% vs 6.7% in the first screening round, respectively), and after 1 year one-third of men with a benign biopsy after an abnormal screening result thought about prostate cancer “a lot” or “some,” compared with 18% with a normal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (P = .005).

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^178c370e]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria follow-up after a negative evaluation: in patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Most patients who have an appropriate risk-stratified negative hematuria evaluation do not require ongoing urologic monitoring and may be safely discharged from the urology clinic after shared decision-making and discussion of the best available evidence, and for these patients a future UA may be considered.

### Early initiation of aspirin after prostate and transurethral bladder surgeries is not associated with increased incidence of postoperative bleeding: a prospective, randomized trial [^0633c69b]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Lower urinary tract operations are being increasingly performed in elderly patients, in whom aspirin intake is common for preventing cardiovascular disease. We determined the safety of early aspirin re-initiation after lower urinary tract surgeries.

Materials and Methods

A randomized, open label clinical trial was done. The study cohort included patients referred for transurethral prostatectomy, open prostatectomy and transurethral resection of bladder tumor while receiving aspirin prophylaxis. After controlling for surgical modality patients were randomized into 2 arms, including aspirin treatment initiation 24 hours after discontinuing of bladder irrigation (early treatment group) and aspirin treatment initiation 3 weeks after surgery (late treatment group). Primary end points were pre-discharge hematuria necessitating the restoration of bladder irrigation or the cessation of aspirin treatment and late hematuria treated in an urgent care setting, requiring hospital admission or compelling the cessation of aspirin treatment.

Results

A total of 120 patients were enrolled, including 60 per treatment group. There were no significant differences between the groups in surgery related factors that could have affected postoperative bleeding. Primary end points were attained by 16 of the 120 patients (13.6%), including 10 of the 60 (16.7%) in the early treatment group and 6 (10%) in the late treatment group (p = 0.28). Time to catheter removal and persistent hematuria duration were similar in the 2 groups. Cardiovascular morbidity was noted in 3 of 120 patients, of whom all were assigned to the early treatment group.

Conclusions

Early aspirin initiation after lower urinary tract surgeries does not appear to carry an increased risk of postoperative bleeding. Thus, it may be considered in patients at high risk for cardiovascular morbidity.

### Clinical characteristics and endoscopic treatment of hematospermia with postcoital hematuria [^737e1b53]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, as an exceedingly rare and easily misdiagnosed clinical symptom, hematospermia accompanied by postejaculatory or posterection hematuria can be diagnosed by its characteristic manifestations. PUH and abnormal blood vessels in the prostate (as confirmed by cystourethroscopy) were common causes of hematospermia and postejaculatory hematuria. We showed that transurethral resection or fulguration of urethral hemangioma or abnormal blood vessels constitutes a minimally invasive, simple, safe, and effective treatment method.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^12f8e2a5]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (complicated presentations and referral)—Patients with co-morbid conditions and OAB symptoms would be considered complicated OAB patients, including neurologic diseases, mobility deficits, medically complicated/uncontrolled diabetes, fecal motility disorders, chronic pelvic pain, recurrent urinary tract infections, gross hematuria, prior pelvic/vaginal surgeries, pelvic cancer, pelvic radiation, significant prolapse, urgency incontinence in younger patients, extremely severe symptoms, or failure of multiple anti-muscarinics; if the history elicits these co-morbid conditions and/or special situations, the clinician should consider referring these patients to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment.

### Arterio-ureteral fistula: systematic review of 445 patients [^4a897b67]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Arterio-ureteral fistula (AUF) is an uncommon diagnosis, but increasingly reported and potentially lethal. This systematic review comprehensively presents risk factors, pathophysiology, location and clinical presentation of AUF aiming to increase clinical awareness of this rare but life-threatening condition, and to put this entity into a contemporary perspective with modern diagnostic tools and treatment strategies.

Materials and Methods

This review was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Individual Participant Data) guidelines. A literature search in PubMed® and EMBASE™ was conducted. In addition, retrieved articles were cross-referenced. Data parameters included oncologic, vascular and urological history, diagnostics, treatment, and followup, and were collected using a standard template by 2 independent reviewers.

Results

A total of 245 articles with 445 patients and 470 AUFs were included. Most patients had chronic indwelling ureteral stents (80%) and history of pelvic oncology (70%). Hematuria was observed in 99% of the patients, of whom 76% presented with massive hematuria with or without previous episodes of (micro)hematuria. For diagnosis, angiography had a sensitivity of 62%. The most predominant location of AUF was at the common iliac artery ureteral crossing. AUF-specific mortality before 2000 vs after 2000 is 19% vs 7%, coinciding with increasing use of endovascular stents.

Conclusions

AUF should be considered in patients with a medical history of vascular surgery, pelvic oncologic surgery, irradiation and/or chronic indwelling ureteral stents presenting with intermittent (micro)hematuria. A multidisciplinary consultation is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. The most sensitive test is angiography and the preferred initial treatment is endovascular.

### The history of calculus mendax and the following surgery on the prostate [^98cfec42]. The Prostate (2014). Low credibility.

In this paper we would like to present probably the first surgery performed on the prostate gland followed by microscopic analysis of the obtained tumor tissue sample. We based on the existing correspondence between Ludwig von Hammen and Johann N. Pechlin, and their successors in this field as well. Von Hammen seems to be a pioneer in the area of not only urological surgery but in directing this part of medical practice from "lithotomists" to physicians, much better educated than barbers in physiology but first of all in anatomy. This 17th century physician from Gdansk tried to set new standards both for surgical medical practice but histopathological examination of the excised material as well. Due to the change of the operational skills and procedures von Hammen's work got almost forgotten, but remains remembered due to the work of historians of the medicine from following centuries.

### Burkitt's lymphoma of the prostate presenting as acute urinary retention: a case report [^03bfc507]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Thirdly, AUR is precipitated by any situation that leads to an overdistension of the bladder (post-surgery, drugs).

The reason for obstructive urinary retention in the presented case turned out to be prostatic Burkitt’s Lymphoma, a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Less than 0.1% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas affect the prostate of which diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common entity. In younger aged patients malignant rhabdomyosarcomas are the most common prostatic malignancy. Only a couple of case reports exists of prostatic Burkitt’s lymphoma in childhood. To date in adults only four cases have been described [,–]. Lymphoma of the prostate is very rare and is usually not considered in patients with urinary retention. On the other hand, adenocarcinoma of the prostate or BPH are equally rare entities in young males and should not be assumed without further investigation either. In this case a young male was treated for urinary retention and was misdiagnosed twice. Initially, the consumption of alcohol by the patient and a lack of other findings led to the working-diagnosis of alcohol-induced urinary retention. Even though the pathophysiologic reasoning for alcohol-induced urinary retention are CNS-depression and bladder overdistention, an anti-inflammatory therapy with diclofenac was started. In the beginning, the diagnosis was affirmed by a successful TWOC, so no other diagnostic tests were performed. More common causes for AUR in this age group were not suspected due to absent flank pain, normal urinalysis and unremarkable micturition in the past. After urinary retention recurred, clinical and sonographic examination revealed an enlarged prostate. Notwithstanding the rarity in this age group, BPH was diagnosed without further workup. Prompt performance of cystoscopy or other imaging techniques would have led to the correct diagnosis earlier. Instead, progression of the lymphoma caused both-sided hydronephrosis, hematuria and systemic symptoms.

In conclusion, this case shows that the unlikely event of urinary retention in a young adult male has to be of great concern. After all, it can be the first manifestation of a serious prostatic malignancy. Thorough interviewing of previous and current symptoms and physical examination have to be performed to narrow down differential diagnoses. If benign reasons are ruled out or if initial treatment fails, more extensive diagnostic tests including cystoscopy and imaging techniques like CT or MRI scan are mandatory. Subsequent biopsy of the prostate should be performed urgently to secure the diagnosis. In our case systemic chemotherapy led to complete remission and possibly cure of the Burkitt’s lymphoma.

### Diagnostic value of serum DR-70 levels, a new fibrin-related biomarker, in bladder cancer patients [^30bcd2ab]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

In this prospective study, patients between the ages of 45 and 70 years who presented to the urology outpatient clinic of our hospital with macroscopic hematuria were enrolled between January and July 2024. It was decided that 84 patients would be sufficient with 0,95 power, 0,05 error and 0,8 effect size. The study was conducted only after the relevant informed consent forms had been obtained from the participants. In all patients, hematuria was assessed by cystoscopy, urinary ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced abdominal tomography. Among these patients, those with bladder cancer (BC) were included in the study group, and patients who developed hematuria due to benign causes other than tumors (urinary calculi, benign prostatic hyperplasia, etc.) and for whom surgery was planned for the cause were included in the control group. Patients with BC were treated with transurethral resection. All patients had sterile urine cultures.

Patients with a previous diagnosis of bladder cancer, patients with active infection at the time of admission, patients with a history of hereditary or acquired thrombosis or existing thrombosis, patients who had recently received antiaggregant, antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapy, patients with diseases that may affect the fibrinolytic system, patients who were currently smoking and patients with other malignancies elsewhere were excluded. In studies comparing active smoker and non-smoker populations, it has been shown that active smoking generally activates coagulation and increases plasma fibrinogen, D-dimer, and tissue plasminogen activator antigen levels –.

### Outcomes and toxicity of 313 prostate cancer patients receiving helical tomotherapy after radical prostatectomy [^73a7ba3c]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Late toxicity

Late toxicity data are also presented in Table 3. Actuarial late grade 3 GU and GI toxicities at 5 years were 10% (95% CI, 6.0%-14.2%) and 2% (95% CI, 0.5%-3.5%), respectively. The most common late grade 3 GU toxicities were incontinence requiring surgical intervention or Cunningham clamp (5%), stricture requiring surgical dilation (3%), and hematuria (3%). Of the 17 patients (5%) who developed grade 3 incontinence, 14 (82%) had at least grade 2 incontinence before RT. The most common surgery for incontinence was placement of an artificial urinary sphincter (3%). Of the 10 patients who developed a grade 3 stricture after radiation, 2 (20%) had a history of stricture before radiation. On multivariate analysis, only baseline urinary function was associated with higher likelihood of late grade 3 GU toxicity (baseline grade 2 GU toxicity vs grade 0 GU toxicity; HR = 4.8; 95% CI, 1.6-13.8; P =.004; Suppl Table 1 ; Suppl Fig S1). Patients who developed grade 3 GU toxicity had shorter mean intervals between surgery and RT compared with those who did not (25 vs 15 months), which approached significance (t test, P =.06). Interval from surgery to RT was not significant when included as a categorical variable (<12, 12-24, and >24 months) on multivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis for late grade 3 GI toxicity was not included because of the small number of events.

### Natural history and clinical predictors of clinical progression in benign prostatic hyperplasia [^5946beed]. Current Opinion in Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is increasing with the aging population worldwide. Knowledge of the natural history of BPH is crucial for primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of its progression. This review examines the evidence of the natural history of BPH, highlighting the group of patients with mild symptoms and the risk factors for progression.

Recent Findings

Several community and clinical studies have demonstrated the progressive nature of BPH. Different surrogate endpoints, which include symptom score, peak urinary flow rate, prostate volume, and the occurrence of acute urinary retention and need for surgery, have been described. Prostatic specific antigen and prostate volume are the two most common predictors of clinical progression and are helpful to the clinician for identifying high-risk patients.

Summary

With further understanding of the natural history and the predictors of progression of BPH, management can be better tailored according to risk stratification and the results of clinical trials of effectiveness can be better interpreted.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^d89138b6]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treatment—goals, medications, and procedural indications/classification are outlined as follows: Traditionally, the primary goal of treatment has been to alleviate bothersome LUTS that result from BPO, and more recently treatment has also focused on the prevention of disease progression and complications such as AUR; pharmacologic classes used to treat LUTS/BPH include alpha-adrenergic antagonists (alpha blockers), 5-ARIs, PDE5, and anticholinergics, which may be utilized alone or in combination to take advantage of their different mechanisms of action, and an additional class of agent that may be considered in combination with alpha blockers is beta-3 agonists; there exist clinical scenarios in which conservative or pharmacological management are either inadequate or inappropriate and long-term use of medications for LUTS/BPH have been implicated in cognitive issues and depression, and these situations merit consideration of one of the many invasive procedures available for the treatment of LUTS/BPH; indications include a desire by the patient to avoid taking a daily medication, failure of medical therapy to sufficiently ameliorate bothersome LUTS, intolerance to pharmaceutical side effects, and conditions for which medical therapy is insufficient such as acute and/or chronic renal insufficiency, refractory urinary retention, recurrent UTIs, recurrent bladder stones, and recalcitrant gross hematuria; acute and chronic adverse events associated with each class of medical therapy can include cardiovascular and sexual effects; surgical treatment of symptomatic BPH may be classified into three general types: 1. MIST; 2. Simple prostatectomy; and 3. Transurethral surgery, with transurethral surgery involving removal of the obstructing adenomatous tissue via the transurethral route, classically with monopolar electrocautery TURP, and alternatives developed including bipolar TURP and various laser-based therapies to achieve similar clinical efficacy while reducing the risks of perioperative bleeding and short- and long-term complications; in appropriate patients for whom the physical size of the prostate cannot be addressed due to the expertise of the surgeon via a safe or efficacious transurethral approach, simple prostatectomy (i.e., adenoma enucleation) may be considered.

### Pre-and intra-operative predictors of postoperative hospital length of stay in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in China: a retrospective observational study [^98d8b47d]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Independent variables measured

In this study, 32 variables were assessed. Preoperative variables included patient characteristics, comorbidities, prostate cancer disease-specific variables, urinary tract symptoms, and preoperative laboratory values. Patient characteristics assessed included age, body mass index (BMI), marital status, smoking and drinking status, and family history of prostate cancer. Comorbidities, including hypertension requiring medication; diabetes requiring either oral medication or insulin injections or both; and history of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease were combined into one variable because of the small positive sample size. History of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease was treated as a dichotomous variable and defined as positive in the presence of a history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease before or after coronary stent implantation, arrhythmia, transient ischemic attack, or cerebrovascular accident such as cerebral embolism, cerebral thrombosis, or cerebral hemorrhage. The above information was abstracted from preoperative medical records. Inclusion of the disease-specific variable of prostate specific antigen (PSA) was considered essential; the most recent PSA value prior to surgery was used in the analysis. Biopsy Gleason scores were acquired from prostate biopsy reports. Prostate volume was calculated by using the following formula: transverse diameter × vertical diameter × longitudinal diameter × π/6; the diameters were measured by color ultrasound. Urinary tract symptoms, including dysuria, pain or burning on urination, frequent urination, urgent urination, and hematuria, were assessed as dichotomous variables and abstracted from medical records of symptoms reported by patients. Preoperative laboratory values closest to the day of surgery were also recorded, including white blood count (× 10 9 /L) (WBC), neutrophil count (%), hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count (× 10 9 /L), albumin, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), serum total bilirubin, creatinine, serum potassium, serum calcium, and blood glucose. Intraoperative variables, including operation duration (h), blood loss (L), and operation type were collected from operation notes and operation logs. The type of surgery performed (open radical prostatectomy [ORP], laparoscopic radical prostatectomy [LRP], or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy [RARP]) was selected by each patient after discussion with the surgeon.

### Medical and minimally invasive therapies for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^dcd1ca01]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has changed with a substantial decrease in the use of transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) and a simultaneous increase in the use of medical therapy and minimally invasive surgical therapy (MIST). The goal of management of this chronic progressive condition is not only to provide relief of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) but also to reduce the lifetime risk of adverse outcomes. Recent clinical evidence has demonstrated a clear role for medical therapy, particularly with 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) either alone or in combination with alpha-blockers, to reduce the risk of acute urinary retention and need for surgery and provide symptom relief. Clinical data on MISTs also indicate a more pronounced short-term effect; however, the long-term durability of these therapies remains uncertain. Minimally invasive surgical therapies confer treatment benefits in a single 1-h treatment session under local anesthesia. Recovery times and adverse events are improved compared with TURP, but issues such as hematuria, prolonged catheterization, urinary tract infection and retreatment remain commonly reported issues. Today, urologists are faced with the challenge of identifying the most appropriate treatment option for the long-term management of BPH. The initial choice for any given patient will depend on his presenting circumstances and the influence of treatment risks on these circumstances. Providing patients with informed treatment decisions is a key element of management.

### Robot-assisted simple prostatectomy [^187ebaa7]. Journal of Endourology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Benign prostatic obstruction is the leading cause of lower urinary tract symptoms in older males. The management strategies include medical management and surgical therapy. However when the prostate becomes very enlarged medical therapy can be ineffective and transurethral resection may not be feasible. Open simple prostatectomy has been the mainstay of therapy however robot techniques can replicate the efficacy of the open operation while reducing convalescence.

Materials/Methods

We describe our technique of robot simple prostatectomy including indications, patient preparation and surgical procedures step by step. This technique approaches the prostate in a similar fashion to a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy thereby lending familiarity to this simple prostatectomy approach.

Conclusions

Robotic-assisted simple prostatectomy is a feasible surgical approach for patients with a very enlarged prostate. Anastomosis of the bladder edge to the distal apical prostate margin can greatly reduce postoperative hematuria.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^d8ee5911]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Current practice patterns for the evaluation of microscopic hematuria include assessing the lower and upper urinary tracts. Due to the low prevalence of bladder cancer and the low sensitivity of cytology detecting bladder cancer, the exact role of urinary cytology in the evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria may be minimal.

Despite stage migration to more organ-confined disease in the era of prostate-specific antigen, the complications of advanced prostate cancer are still relatively common. Urinary tract obstruction in advanced and metastatic prostate cancer can have a varied presentation, because it may occur in multiple anatomic locations at any point in the natural history of the disease. In all cases, management depends on the current stage of disease, technical feasibility of potential therapeutic interventions, and overall prognosis of the patient. This review highlights a practical approach to the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of obstructive uropathy from prostate cancer.

### Triptorelin pamoate (Trelstar) [^79ecbbb4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1       Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity, and angioedema related to TRELSTAR administration have been reported. In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue TRELSTAR immediately and administer the appropriate supportive and symptomatic care.

5.2       Tumor Flare

Initially, triptorelin (TRELSTAR), like other GnRH agonists, causes a transient increase in serum testosterone levels [see Clinical Pharmacology  (12.2)]. As a result, worsening signs and symptoms of prostate cancer during the first weeks of treatment have been reported with GnRH agonists. Patients may experience worsening of symptoms or onset of new symptoms, including bone pain, neuropathy, hematuria, or urethral or bladder outlet obstruction.

Closely monitor patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction during the first few weeks of therapy.

5.3       Metabolic Syndrome

The use of GnRH agonists (including TRELSTAR) may lead to metabolic changes such as hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, including cirrhosis, occurred in the post-marketing setting.  Hyperglycemia may represent new-onset of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with pre-existing diabetes. Monitor for changes in serum lipids, blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving TRELSTAR and manage according to institutional guidelines.

5.4       Cardiovascular Diseases

Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with the use of GnRH agonists (including TRELSTAR) in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Monitor patients receiving TRELSTAR for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and manage according to current institutional guidelines.

5.5       Convulsions

Convulsions have occurred in patients treated with GnRH analog (including TRELSTAR).  These events included patients with risk factors for seizures such as a history of epilepsy, intracranial tumors or co-medication with other drugs known to present a risk of seizure reactions.  Convulsions have also been reported in patients in the absence of known risk factors. Manage patients receiving TRELSTAR who experience convulsion according to institutional guidelines.

### The Lancet commission on prostate cancer: planning for the surge in cases [^1fd33eae]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Surgery: opportunities for improvement?

Surgery has key roles in diagnosis (eg, biopsy, staging examinations), treatment (including palliative procedures such as transurethral resection of prostate and orchiectomy), and relieving urinary outflow obstruction and hydronephrosis. Radical prostatectomy is widely practised in HICs to treat localised prostate cancer. For patients with clinically significant localised prostate cancer and good life expectancy (ie, >10 years), management with curative intent using either surgical approaches or radiotherapy is recommended. The most important determinant of good outcomes (ie, long survival with minimal side-effects) after surgery is the surgeon and centre’s levels of experience.Low surgical volumes are associated with high operative mortality.Robot-assisted surgery has become popular in HICs and its outcomes are largely similar to those after open surgery.In view of the findings in ProtecT that 15-year prostate cancer-specific survival did not differ among men diagnosed after PSA testing whose initial disease was managed with surgery, radiotherapy, or initial surveillance,there is a need to better define who benefits from surgery. On the basis of available evidence, radical prostatectomy seems to offer only small increases in survival compared with more conservative non-surgical approaches, and this benefit is limited to men with long life-expectancy.

### Evaluation of the learning curve for thulium laser enucleation of the prostate with the aid of a simulator tool but without tutoring: comparison of two surgeons with different levels of endoscopic experience [^c22a6318]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Exclusion criteria were a low IPSS score (<7 points), urodynamic evidence of neurogenic acontractile bladder detrusor, and/or a history of prostate surgery. We recorded the total surgical time, total laser emission time, total delivered laser energy (joules), laser fiber caliber, days of postoperative catheterization with and without continuous saline bladder irrigation, and the length of postoperative hospital stay.

Spinal anesthesia was mainly used. All operations were performed with the same laser machine (Cyber TM 150; Quanta System, Solbiate Olona VA, Italy) using two different end-firing fibers (calibers of 600 and 800 μm, depending on the prostate volume and the surgeon’s preference). A mechanical tissue morcellator (Piranha; Wolf, Knittlingen, Germany) was used in all but five cases, in which a different device (DRILLCUT; Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was used. Continuous bladder irrigation was employed for the first 12 h postoperatively in all cases. Indwelling catheters were removed on the first postoperative day if hematuria was not present. The Clavien–Dindo classification was used to assess early and late surgical complications. All patients were followed for at least 6 months postoperatively, at which time functional and subjective outcomes were recorded using the same tests that were applied as preoperative baseline studies (IPSS questionnaire, uroflowmetry, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] test) as well as urinalysis, urine culture, and echography to evaluate the post-void residual volume. Intraoperative data and data regarding clinical outcome were compared between surgeons A and B. Multivariate analysis was used to compare laser emission time (min) and prostatic adenoma volume (mL). We did not consider the total surgical time as it was influenced by variables not directly related to the intervention itself (e.g. instrument changes, technical delays, initial cystoscopy). We also created another variable linked to experience in an attempt to determine if it influenced the laser emission time. We verified our data with the Student’s t -test and the Shapiro-Wilk test.

### Anatomic locations of ureterovascular fistulae: a review of 532 patients in the literature and a new series of 8 patients [^4938209d]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

The occurrence of unexplained gross hematuria with variable clot passage and flank pain in a patient with a history of pelvic surgery, a chronic ureteral stent, and/or history of pelvic radiotherapy is highly suspicious for a UVF. It is important to bear in mind that the source of a urinary tract bleeding through the ureteral orifice is not always the kidney. If the urologist and interventional radiologist do not keep that in mind, this could lead to unnecessary renal embolization or even nephrectomy due to misdiagnosis. A high degree of suspicion in patients with known risk factors for UVF is the key to a correct diagnosis.

In our hospital, sufficient history would be taken as well as clinical urological examination of the patient excluding other more common cases of macrohematuria such as trauma, recent renal surgery, kidney stones, renal tumor and urinary tract infection. If based on history and examination, UVF was suspected, the side of the bleeding was always initially identified using endoscopy. This step is crucial to help minimize the planning time of the procedure through focusing only on the course of the bleeding ureter during examination of the subsequent CT scan. During angiography, the sole examination of the bleeding side instead of wasting time on the normal side would also minimize the intraprocedural time, thereby reducing the time to stop the bleeding and the radiation exposure. Lock et al. were able to show that there was no significant difference in the location when it comes to the side of the UVF. Stating the side of the fistula’s location was in most cases irrelevant, especially in cases where no UD was present, and therefore the side (right vs. left) was not considered in our review. We mentioned the side in our new patients in case future studies prove otherwise.

### Prostate embolization: patient selection, clinical management and results [^85d473b6]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical management

A detailed explanation of the procedure along with procedural “tips and tricks” can be found in multiple publications, and is beyond the scope of this paper (Sabharwal and Popert; Carnevale and Antunes). Instead we will focus on the pre and post procedural clinical management in this section.

At our institution an interventional radiologist will see all patients in clinic prior to PAE. We hope to have basic testing, such as urodynamics, PSA, CTA/MRA, and IPSS completed prior to the visit, however, this is not always possible. We always perform an IPSS at the initial consultation and review BPH induced LUTS specific medications and medication history. This is to ensure the patients have undergone and failed appropriate medical management, an important prerequisite, prior to offering them PAE. If the patient is deemed a good PAE candidate and desires to proceed they are scheduled for the procedure, typically within a couple weeks. Patients are given nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) prior to their procedure and continued on them for 5–7 days after the procedure. Similarly, patients are given 400 mg of ciprofloxacin intravenously (IV) just prior to the procedure, and then 500 mg twice a day for 5–7 days after the procedure.

PAE is typically performed as an outpatient procedure, however, it is important to warn patients about possible complications, and also for the intervetnionalist to know how to deal with these complications. The most dreaded complications are those of non-target embolization. Non-target embolization affecting the rectum, bladder, and penis have been reported (Pisco et al.; Sabharwal and Popert; Carnevale and Antunes; Moreira et al.; Moreira et al.). While the majority of non-target embolization injuries have resolved with symptomatic treatment, a few have required surgical repair (Pisco et al.). If patients present with symptoms of rectal or bladder non-target embolization, such as hematochezia, hematuria, bladder spasms, pain on defecation, etc. they are referred for proctoscopy or cystoscopy for evaluation. Penile non-target embolization is generally seen on the skin and can be followed in that way. It is important to discuss this potential with the patient and ask them to alert you if any symptoms should arise both at the pre-PAE consultation and on the day of embolization.

### Evaluation of asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria in children and adults [^1398985e]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria is a worrisome clinical sign for a patient that usually prompts a visit to a urologist. Hematuria is classified as microscopic versus gross; the evaluation for gross hematuria differs from that for microscopic hematuria, and the most important differentiating factor is the patient's age. The major causes of hematuria differ between children and adults, and the evaluation should reflect this. Renal disease is more common in children and malignancy more common in adults. The application and utility of laboratory tests, radiological studies, and cystoscopy are well established in adults but are more variable in children. Follow-up of hematuria after a negative evaluation is becoming more limited in adults but should be routine for children.

### Hematospermia is rarely related to genitourinary cancer: lessons learned from 15 years of experience with 342 cases [^1e4907a1]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2021). Medium credibility.

We investigated the prevalence of hematospermia among the 161,258 men with ≥18 years old, presenting to outpatient clinics with urologic complaints, between January 2003 and December 2017. We also recorded underlying causes of hematospermia to determine frequency of genitourinary cancer in 342 men who presented with hematospermia. Further evaluations such as urine/semen culture, Meares-Stamey four glass test, transrectal/scrotal ultrasound, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cystourethroscopy, and prostate biopsy were performed in the presence of additional symptoms and findings or recurrence of hematospermia after treatment of patients with monosymptomatic hematospermia. The prevalence of hematospermia was detected as 0.21% (342/161,258) among the urological patients. The mean age of the patients was 45.05±14.04 years (range 18-85), and the median duration of hematospermia was 15 days (range 1-7200). In 306 (89.5%) of the patients, hematospermia was resolved after medical therapy for infections/inflammations, surgery for ductal obstruction and cysts, prostate and testicular cancer. However, 36 (10.5%) had persistent hematospermia. The most relevant etiologic cause of hematospermia was inflammation/infections in 169 patients (49.4%), and genitourinary cancers were detected in only 11 patients (3.2%) as prostate cancer in 8 and testicular cancer in 3. Hematospermia is seen frequently due to inflammatory or infectious causes, and is rarely associated with genitourinary cancer. However, genitourinary cancers should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of patients with recurrent/persistent hematospermia and associated symptoms, such as hematuria, lower urinary tract symptom, and scrotal pain/swelling.

### Primary resection of oligometastatic recurrent prostatic carcinoma in the urethra [^14a0f6c7]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A man in his 70s presented to the emergency department with acute urinary retention following a 2-day history of gross haematuria with blood clots. He had a significant medical history of intermediate-risk prostate adenocarcinoma (grade group 2, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 14.9ng/mL) for which he underwent a robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP) 13 years ago. PSA nadir was achieved (<0.03ng/mL). Three years after RARP, he had biochemical recurrence with PSA rising to 0.06ng/mL. Salvage radiotherapy was performed with good PSA response back to nadir. Workup for gross haematuria included a flexible cystoscopy which revealed a lobulated fleshy lesion occupying the mid-penile urethra. Staging imaging showed no local recurrence at prostatectomy site or lymphadenopathy. PSA was 4.2ng/mL. Surgical resection with primary repair of the urethra was performed. Postoperative recovery was good with PSA achieving nadir. Histology revealed an upgraded metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma, grade group 5.

### Risk factors for delayed hematuria following photoselective vaporization of the prostate [^23f80e2c]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Photoselective vaporization of the prostate has become an increasingly popular option for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, delayed bleeding has been raised as a potential issue as more cases are performed. We characterize delayed bleeding after photoselective vaporization of the prostate and identify associated risk factors.

Materials and Methods

We defined delayed gross hematuria as any complaint of hematuria following hospital discharge, and further stratified it as delayed gross hematuria requiring emergency department evaluation, hospital admission, continuous bladder irrigation, transfusions or reoperation. We performed an explicit chart review of 290 patients who underwent photoselective vaporization of the prostate at a single center from 2002 through 2009. Exposures of interest included age, prostate volume, followup duration, operative factors (watts/joules), and use of oral anticoagulation therapy or 5α-reductase inhibitors.

Results

Delayed gross hematuria occurred in 33.8% of patients during an average followup of 33 months. For 8.5% of patients the bleeding was severe enough to prompt presentation to the emergency department. For 4.8% of patients hospitalization was required and for 4.5% reoperation was required. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of bleeding increased with prostate size (OR 1.08, 1.03-1.14), longer followup (OR 1.35, 1.12-1.62) and anticoagulant use (OR 3.35, 1.43-7.83), and decreased with increasing age (OR 0.71, 0.51-0.98) and use of a 5α-reductase inhibitor (OR 0.41, 0.24-0.73).

Conclusions

Delayed hematuria occurs commonly after photoselective vaporization of the prostate but severe hematuria is rare. Larger prostate size, longer followup and use of anticoagulation were associated with a higher risk of delayed gross hematuria while preoperative 5α-reductase inhibitor use and older age were protective.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Society of Interventional Radiology multisociety position statement—prostatic artery embolization (PAE) for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)—issues eight new recommendations. PAE is an acceptable minimally invasive treatment option for appropriately selected men with BPH and moderate to severe LUTS (Level of evidence: B; strength of recommendation: strong.). PAE can be considered as a treatment option in patients with BPH and moderate to severe LUTS who have very large prostate glands (≥ 80 cm3), without an upper limit of prostate size (Level of evidence: C; strength of recommendation: moderate.). PAE can be considered as a treatment option in patients with BPH and acute or chronic urinary retention in the setting of preserved bladder function as a method of achieving catheter independence (Level of evidence: C; strength of recommendation: moderate.). PAE can be considered as a treatment option in patients with BPH and moderate to severe LUTS who wish to preserve erectile and/or ejaculatory function (Level of evidence: C; strength of recommendation: weak.). PAE can be considered in patients with hematuria of prostatic origin as a method of achieving cessation of bleeding (Level of evidence: D; strength of recommendation: strong.). PAE can be considered as a treatment option in patients with BPH and moderate to severe LUTS who are deemed not to be surgical candidates for any of the following reasons: advanced age, multiple comorbidities, coagulopathy, or inability to stop anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy (Level of evidence: E; strength of recommendation: moderate.). PAE should be included in the individualized patient-centered discussion regarding treatment options for BPH with LUTS (Level of evidence: E; strength of recommendation: strong.). Interventional radiologists, given their knowledge of arterial anatomy, advanced microcatheter techniques, and expertise in embolization procedures, are the specialists best suited for the performance of PAE (Level of evidence: E; strength of recommendation: strong.).

Fibrinolytic bleeding may frequently be associated with surgical complications following heart surgery (with or without cardiac bypass procedures), and portacaval shunt; hematological disorders such as aplastic anemia; acute and life-threatening abruptio placentae; hepatic cirrhosis; and neoplastic disease such as carcinoma of the prostate, lung, stomach, and cervix.

Urinary fibrinolysis, usually a normal physiological phenomenon, may frequently be associated with life-threatening complications following severe trauma, anoxia, and shock. Symptomatic of such complications is surgical hematuria (following prostatectomy and nephrectomy) or nonsurgical hematuria (accompanying polycystic or neoplastic diseases of the genitourinary system).

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^af3a1e66]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed. Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or with hematuria persisting after treatment of urinary tract infection also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.
