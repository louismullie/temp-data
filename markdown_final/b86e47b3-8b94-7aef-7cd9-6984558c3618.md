## Question

best broad-spectrum antibiotic? unable to collect u/a. lower risk of c diff

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which broad-spectrum antibiotic is best when a urinalysis cannot be obtained and the goal is to minimize the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether broad-spectrum therapy is even indicated without a urinalysis. Then, I should verify which antibiotic classes carry the highest CDI risk and which are relatively lower. Next, I will review comparative data on CDI risk by agent, including any head-to-head or observational signals. After that, I need to consider syndrome-specific nuances and the role of diagnostic stewardship. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical premise: treating without a urinalysis risks overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, which is common and harmful, and exposes patients to antibiotics without benefit while increasing CDI risk, so I should not jump straight to "best broad-spectrum drug" without asking whether antibiotics are indicated at all [^1a72a468] [^24c92a93] [^ac4093ef].

> Wait, let me verify the CDI risk hierarchy by antibiotic class. High-risk classes repeatedly implicated include fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, clindamycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam, whereas first-generation cephalosporins and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations like amoxicillin-clavulanate are generally lower risk, though duration and patient factors still matter [^4fc317e8] [^8872b82b] [^d6bf2143].

> I will now examine comparative data. A recent single-center analysis showed ceftriaxone exposure more than doubled the risk of hospital-onset CDI compared with cefazolin for inpatient UTIs, despite similar susceptibility profiles, reinforcing that third-generation cephalosporins carry disproportionate collateral damage. This aligns with broader stewardship guidance to avoid routine third-generation cephalosporins when narrower options suffice [^c343fcbb] [^4fc317e8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought amoxicillin-clavulanate might be the "lowest CDI risk" broad-spectrum option, but I should double-check that claim. While some data suggest lower relative risk than third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, amoxicillin-clavulanate is still associated with increased CDI risk in certain cohorts, so I need to be cautious and anchor on relative risk within classes rather than declare any broad-spectrum agent "safe" from CDI [^d6bf2143] [^43d27f0c].

> Let me consider syndrome-specific context. If the concern is urosepsis or a complicated UTI where broad coverage is justified pending cultures, a first-generation cephalosporin such as cefazolin provides excellent activity against common uropathogens and has a lower CDI signal than ceftriaxone. If Pseudomonas risk is low to moderate, cefazolin is reasonable; if Pseudomonas risk is high, I should confirm that anti-pseudomonal coverage is truly indicated before accepting the higher CDI risk of agents like piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime [^c343fcbb] [^0b65ff30].

> Next, I should review stewardship principles to avoid iatrogenic harm. Diagnostic stewardship to avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria, coupled with antimicrobial stewardship to use the narrowest effective agent and shortest effective duration, reduces CDI and resistance. This means deferring antibiotics when infection is unlikely, obtaining cultures before antibiotics when feasible, and de-escalating promptly when data return [^1a72a468] [^d2bf3c67] [^8f18d8be].

> But wait, what if the patient is septic and I must start empiric therapy now without urinalysis? In that scenario, I should balance timely coverage with CDI risk by choosing the narrowest regimen that covers likely pathogens per local epidemiology, planning to de-escalate within 48–72 hours based on cultures and clinical response, and avoiding high-risk agents like clindamycin or routine third-generation cephalosporins unless specifically indicated [^76a3d479] [^8f18d8be] [^4fc317e8].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the indication for antibiotics first. If broad-spectrum therapy is truly indicated and a lower CDI-risk option is acceptable for the likely pathogens, cefazolin is the best-supported choice among broad-spectrum agents for many inpatient UTIs, with substantially lower CDI risk than ceftriaxone and comparable activity against common uropathogens. If anti-pseudomonal coverage is not needed, cefazolin is preferred over third-generation cephalosporins for this reason [^c343fcbb] [^0b65ff30].

> I need to ensure I state the caveat clearly: there is no "zero CDI risk" broad-spectrum antibiotic, and duration of therapy, patient risk factors, and prior antibiotic exposure modulate risk. Therefore, the safest "broad-spectrum" strategy is to minimize spectrum, minimize duration, and maximize diagnostic certainty as soon as possible, with explicit plans to stop or narrow therapy when infection is excluded or narrower coverage suffices [^4fc317e8] [^d2bf3c67] [^8f18d8be].

There is **no single best broad-spectrum antibiotic** with a low C. difficile risk; risk varies by agent and patient factors. Fidaxomicin has the **lowest recurrence risk** [^d0389d78] but is not used for systemic infections. Among systemic agents, **narrower-spectrum options** (e.g. beta-lactams without strong anti-anaerobic activity) are preferred when appropriate, and **limiting duration** is key to reducing C. difficile risk [^4fc317e8]. If broad-spectrum therapy is unavoidable, use the narrowest effective agent for the shortest duration and de-escalate promptly based on cultures [^8f18d8be].

---

## Antibiotics associated with lower C. difficile risk

Certain antibiotics are associated with a **lower risk of C. difficile infection** due to their minimal disruption of the gut microbiota:

- **Beta-lactams (narrow-spectrum)**: Penicillins such as amoxicillin and ampicillin, and first-generation cephalosporins such as cefazolin, are associated with a lower risk of C. difficile infection compared to broad-spectrum agents [^c343fcbb].

- **Macrolides**: Azithromycin and clarithromycin have a relatively lower risk of C. difficile infection compared to fluoroquinolones and clindamycin.

- **Tetracyclines**: Doxycycline is associated with a lower risk of C. difficile infection.

---

## Antibiotics associated with higher C. difficile risk

Certain antibiotics are **notoriously associated with a higher risk** of C. difficile infection:

- **Clindamycin**: Strongly associated with C. difficile infection due to its potent disruption of gut microbiota.

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are associated with a significantly increased risk of C. difficile infection.

- **Third-generation cephalosporins**: Ceftriaxone and cefepime are associated with a higher risk of C. difficile infection [^c343fcbb].

- **Carbapenems**: Imipenem and meropenem are associated with a high risk of C. difficile infection.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **antibiotic stewardship** and careful selection of antibiotics to minimize C. difficile risk:

- **Narrow-spectrum antibiotics**: Prefer narrow-spectrum antibiotics when clinically appropriate to minimize disruption of gut microbiota [^d2bf3c67].

- **Shortest effective duration**: Limit the duration of antibiotic therapy to the shortest effective period to reduce C. difficile risk [^4fc317e8].

- **Avoid high-risk antibiotics**: Avoid or minimize use of high-risk antibiotics such as clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins unless absolutely necessary [^4fc317e8].

---

## Clinical scenarios and antibiotic selection

The choice of antibiotic should be **tailored to the clinical scenario**, patient-specific factors, and local epidemiology:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended antibiotics** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Community-acquired pneumonia | - Amoxicillin <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - Macrolides (if local resistance is low) | Lower C. difficile risk and effective coverage |
| Complicated intra-abdominal infection | - Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam) <br/> - Carbapenems (reserved for severe cases) | Effective broad-spectrum coverage with careful risk-benefit consideration |
| Skin and soft tissue infection | - Beta-lactams (e.g. cephalexin) <br/> - Clindamycin (if beta-lactam allergy) | Effective coverage with lower C. difficile risk |
| Urinary tract infection | - Nitrofurantoin <br/> - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole <br/> - Beta-lactams (e.g. amoxicillin) | Effective coverage with lower C. difficile risk |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no single best broad-spectrum antibiotic** with a low risk of C. difficile infection. The key is to use the narrowest effective antibiotic for the shortest duration, avoiding high-risk agents when possible. Fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for C. difficile treatment due to its low recurrence risk, but it is not used for systemic infections. Clinicians should adhere to antibiotic stewardship principles and tailor antibiotic selection to patient-specific factors and local epidemiology to minimize C. difficile risk [^4fc317e8].

Antimicrobial stewardship considerations in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) emphasize limiting unnecessary cultures and therapy; a positive urine culture often encourages antimicrobial use, and obtaining urine cultures when not clinically indicated promotes inappropriate antimicrobial use. Given the potential negative societal consequence of antimicrobial resistance, screening for bacteriuria and treatment of ASB should be discouraged unless there is evidence to support a benefit of treatment for a given population. Randomized studies across multiple groups found no benefit of antimicrobial treatment, while antimicrobials increased risks including antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and in some cases increased urinary tract infection shortly after therapy.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this study was to review recently published diagnostic stewardship studies of common clinical infectious syndromes and the impact on antibiotic prescribing.

Recent Findings

Diagnostic stewardship can be implemented within healthcare systems and tailored to infectious syndromes, including urinary tract, gastrointestinal, respiratory and bloodstream infections. In urinary syndromes, diagnostic stewardship can decrease unnecessary urine culturing and associated antibiotic prescribing. Diagnostic stewardship of Clostridium difficile testing can decrease antibiotics and test ordering with a reduction in healthcare-associated C. difficile infections. Respiratory syndrome multiplex arrays can decrease time to results and increase detection of clinically relevant pathogens but may not decrease antibiotics use, or worse, could increase over-prescribing if diagnostic stewardship of ordering practices is not exercised. Lastly, blood culturing practices can be improved by clinical decision support to safely decrease collection and broad-spectrum antibiotic use.

Summary

Diagnostic stewardship decreases unnecessary antibiotic use in a way that is different from and complementary to antibiotic stewardship. Further studies are needed to quantify the full impact on antibiotic use and resistance. Future considerations should be to institutionalize diagnostic stewardship in patient care activities to leverage integration into systems-based interventions.

Diagnostic stewardship focus — blood, urine, respiratory cultures, and Clostridioides difficile testing — highlights priority targets: for blood cultures, they are "one of the most commonly ordered microbiologic tests in hospitalized patients with low positivity and high risk of false-positive results (up to half of all positive blood cultures represent contaminants)", with additional concerns that "a significant number of blood cultures are collected as single blood cultures and/or with inappropriate blood volume" and that "inappropriate testing may overestimate central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs)". For urine cultures, they are "one of the most common drivers of inappropriate antimicrobial use in hospitalized patients", have "common clinical false-positive results (positive tests due to colonization without UTI)", and "inappropriate testing may overestimate catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs)". For respiratory cultures, there is a "high risk of positive results representing colonization, especially among patients with comorbidities, in the intensive care unit, or with tracheostomy", and they are a "common driver of inappropriate antibiotic use in hospitalized patients". For C. difficile testing, "inappropriate testing may detect colonization and expose patients to unnecessary antibiotics" and "inappropriate testing may overestimate nosocomial C. difficile cases".

### Choosing wisely in healthcare epidemiology and antimicrobial stewardship [^d2bf3c67]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship — culture-negative suspected infection: Stop antibiotics in patients whose diagnostic culture(s) are negative unless there is clear evidence of bacterial infection. Patients often receive antibiotic treatment when bacterial infection is suspected but not yet confirmed, and usually, laboratory and radiology information are available after 3 days. Based on test and culture results, antibiotics should be deescalated to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic or discontinued if there is no further evidence of infection. Reducing antibiotic exposure decreases the risk of infections with C. difficile and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and medical professionals should use their local antibiogram to develop guidance for narrow empiric choices to limit patient exposures to unnecessary antibiotics.

### Choosing wisely in healthcare epidemiology and antimicrobial stewardship [^c83973d0]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic testing for infection — Do not perform diagnostic tests unless the patient has signs or symptoms of infection; a positive diagnostic test result without a correlating clinical picture may represent colonization rather than infection, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Although diagnostic tests such as urine, blood, sputum cultures, and PCR and/or NAAT tests are important for diagnosing disease when used in patients with appropriate signs or symptoms, if the patient does not have signs or symptoms test results can return positive when infection is not present. A positive blood culture may be due to contamination, a positive urine culture may represent asymptomatic bacteriuria, and a positive test for C. difficile may be from colonization. Treating patients who do not have infections exposes them to the risks of antibiotics without the benefit of treatment. Medical professionals should consider implementing a tiered approach to diagnostic testing (for example, urinalysis with reflex urine culture) for infections that are difficult to diagnose.

Regarding preventative measures for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to antibiotic stewardship, IDSA/SHEA 2018 guidelines recommend to minimize the frequency and duration of high-risk antibiotic therapy and the number of antibiotic agents prescribed to reduce CDI risk.

### Prevalence and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria at academic and critical-access hospitals-opportunities for stewardship efforts [^37bcc680]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), the presence of bacteria in the urine without signs or symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI), is a common clinical finding, particularly in the elderly and in women. Most patients with ASB derive no benefit from treatment, and evidence suggests that treatment does not prevent progression to symptomatic UTI, complications, or death. Nevertheless, antibiotics are often prescribed for ASB. Notably, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics not only contributes to the emergence of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infection but also causes harmful side effects and may increase the risk of subsequent symptomatic UTI. Overtreatment of ASB has therefore been identified as a key opportunity to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and to minimize adverse effects. A recent meta-analysis reported a pooled prevalence of 45% for ASB treatment among mostly hospitalized patients at academic medical centers, but the prevalence has not been well characterized across the spectrum of care. Critical-access hospitals (CAHs) are underrepresented in the literature. To target antimicrobial stewardship efforts in our region, we assessed the point prevalence of ASB and the frequency of ASB treatment across academic, community, and critical-access hospitals.

### Doing more with less: a narrative review of recent evidence in diagnostic stewardship [^a6cb6749]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diagnostic stewardship (DS) aims to optimise the use of laboratory testing to improve patient care while reducing unnecessary tests. This review examines recent evidence on DS interventions to optimise the use of resources, focusing on three key areas: reducing unnecessary testing, maximising the impact of existing tests, and avoiding the overdiagnosis of hospital-acquired infections.

Recent Findings

Multiple interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing unnecessary blood and urine culture testing, including clinical decision support tools, education programs, and multidisciplinary approaches. Studies on optimising existing tests have focused on blood culture workflows, reporting of nonsterile samples, and implementation of multiplex PCR panels. Interventions to reduce overdiagnosis of catheter-associated urinary tract infections and Clostridioides difficile infection have shown promise. However, the monitoring of unintended consequences varies across studies. Most publications were retrospective cohort studies, with few randomized trials.

Summary

DS can safely reduce inappropriate testing and maximise test effectiveness. Successful implementation requires multidisciplinary engagement and careful monitoring of the unintended consequences. Further high-quality studies, especially randomised trials, are needed to assess the clinical impact of DS interventions robustly.

### Diagnostic stewardship for healthcare-associated infections: opportunities and challenges to safely reduce test use [^6f061785]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND SAFETY CONCERNS

While reducing unnecessary tests for HAIs can have many potential benefits for the patient and hospital, test underutilization raises the possibility for serious infections going undiagnosed and untreated. For example, while excessive C. difficile testing may identify patients with colonization or resolving infections (which is not only a waste of resources but also leads to unnecessary treatment), more restricted testing might result in unrecognized and untreated CDI (resulting in harm to individual patients and greater risk of cross infection) or empiric treatment for CDI without testing as a workaround (resulting in unnecessary treatment in a subset of patients). A major objective for diagnostic stewardship for HAIs is to identify the "sweet spot" of test utilization that minimizes overdiagnosis and false positive results while maximizing appropriately indicated testing and true positive results. This spot likely will be infection and population (eg, disease prevalence) specific.

Because HAI-related tests pose unique risks associated with reduced testing, which outcomes should be tracked to monitor patient safety? General outcome measures, as in ASPs, could include length of stay, antimicrobial resistance rates, antimicrobial use, CDI rates, mortality, and readmission. Potential comorbid complications tailored to the HAI(s) in question are also an essential stopgap that should prompt reconsideration for testing. For instance, following the introduction of a "stewardship of culturing" aimed at reducing CAUTIs, Mullin et almonitored overall rates of hospital-acquired (HABSI) infections, given the potential for complications of untreated urinary tract infection. However, outcome data in this and other HAI-related diagnostic stewardship studies were collected in aggregate and were not stratified to patients for whom the test was prevented and thus were at the highest risk for untreated infection. Ideally, prospective monitoring for HAIs should be performed for patients before and after diagnostic stewardship interventions to assess the direct patient-centered impact of these interventions in addition to aggregate data. These safety measures have largely been overlooked in the limited literature to date that has assessed diagnostic stewardship for HAIs, and incorporation in future studies presents significant logistical hurdles. Discordance between surveillance and clinical definitions for HAIs or those without a clear gold-standard clinical definition (eg, CDI) present challenges to evaluating safety when differentiating true positives remains elusive.

### Strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^d33236fc]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Organizational outcomes associated with CAUTI

Inappropriate use of urine cultures can increase the rates of CAUTI according to the NHSN. In this document, "NHSN CAUTI" indicates ongoing, thorough review of medical and/or nursing notes in the electronic health record to observe the numbers of urinary catheters in place, urine cultures ordered, and prescribed antimicrobials. Inappropriate treatment of catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria can promote antimicrobial resistance and Clostridioides difficile infection in acute-care facilities. Diagnostic stewardship strategies could be effective in the treatment and prevention of NHSN CAUTI.

When interventions are implemented to prevent CAUTI, improved outcomes expected are reduced CAUTI, reduced indwelling urethral catheter use, reduced collection and antibiotic use for positive urine cultures, reduced antibiotic-associated complications, and reduced costs associated with these outcomes.

Risk factors for CAUTI

The duration of catheterization is the most important risk factor for developing infection. – Accordingly, reducing unnecessary catheter placement and minimizing the duration of catheterization are the primary strategies for CAUTI prevention.
Additional risk factors include female sex, older age, and not maintaining a closed drainage system. In pediatrics, specific clinical scenarios are often thought to require an open drainage system, including those with recent complex surgical repair or reconstruction of congenital abnormalities of the urogenital system. Available data are insufficient to determine whether specific patients would benefit more from an open drainage system despite an increased risk of CAUTI.
Risk factors for developing healthcare-associated urinary-tract–related bloodstream infection include neutropenia, renal disease, and male sex. –

Reservoirs of transmission

The drainage bag of the bacteriuric patient is a reservoir for organisms that may be transmitted through the hands of healthcare personnel (HCP).
The drainage bag can also become contaminated by contact with hands due to inadequate hand hygiene, contact with the patient's skin or hands, or contact with the floor or vessel used to empty the bag.
Outbreaks of infections associated with resistant gram-negative organisms attributable to bacteriuria in catheterized patients have been reported. –

THE BENEFITS OF DIAGNOSTIC STEWARDSHIP

DxS encapsulates many strategies to improve patient care by encouraging the appropriate utilization and interpretation of diagnostic testing (Table 1). As laboratory testing continues to increase in both volume and complexity, promoting the appropriate utilization of tests requires increasingly multidisciplinary teams and continuous effort. The most sustainable improvements often employ multilayered strategies, combining systems-level approaches with behavioral strategies, which the laboratory is well-suited to spearhead. Common strategies focus on the overutilization of high-volume tests, such as blood cultures, urine cultures, and testing for Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infections. Newer technologies, such as multiplex molecular panels and sequencing methods for the diagnosis of infectious diseases, also benefit from DxS efforts due to challenging interpretations and higher costs with limited reimbursement.

TABLE 1
Examples of diagnostic stewardship goals and potential benefits to patient care a

Interpreting the results of an inappropriately ordered test or suboptimally collected specimen can contribute to diagnostic error by both over-diagnosis and missed diagnosis. For example, overutilization of blood cultures and suboptimal blood culture specimen collection methods can lead to increased detection of contaminating microorganisms, resulting in increased length of stay, unnecessary antimicrobial treatment, and additional downstream testing. Many DxS efforts address appropriate collection practices, proper indications, and guidance for interpreting contaminated cultures. Also frequently misdiagnosed, asymptomatic bacteriuria or a positive urine culture in a patient without genitourinary symptoms causes significant antibiotic prescribing in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Efforts to reduce inappropriate treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria have largely focused on reducing overutilization of urine testing, spanning system-based reflex-based order sets to educational interventions.

### Patterns, predictors, and intercenter variability in empiric Gram-Negative antibiotic use across 928 United States hospitals [^af5d5a68]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date of empiric gram-negative antibiotic use in US hospitalized adults. Across a large and diverse cohort of 928 US hospitals, and > 8 million discharges in 2019, we found that 37% of hospitalized patients received gram-negative antibiotics within the first 2 days of hospitalization. Moreover, 1 of every 5 hospitalized patients received broad-spectrum empiric gram-negative antibiotics specifically. Not surprisingly, we found that all patient severity-of-illness markers were independent predictors of receipt of broad-spectrum empiric therapy, as were invasive infections at admission and receipt of broad-spectrum gram-negative antibiotics in the 3 months preceding admission.

Nearly one-third (30%) of patients who received broad-spectrum empiric therapy were not admitted to the ICU, did not have surgery, or did not have one of the common infectious syndromes defined in this study (pneumonia, UTI, sepsis, bacteremia) within the empiric window, suggesting that a subset of these patients may have been exposed unnecessarily to broad-spectrum empiric therapy and its associated downstream consequences. A common perception is that a few days of antibiotic exposure will not cause harm. However, data indicate that each day of therapy increases the risk of adverse events. For example, even 3 days of antibiotics for surgical prophylaxis increase the risks of acute kidney injury and Clostridioides difficile infection, and these risks increase with each additional DOT. Given that antibiotics for surgical prophylaxis are typically narrow-spectrum, the risks from each DOT are likely even more pronounced for broad-spectrum therapy, making efforts to reduce unnecessary empiric broad-spectrum use especially important.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^3721cd48]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) after nonrenal solid organ transplant — do not screen or treat. In patients who have received a solid organ transplant other than a renal transplant, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). This recommendation places a high value on avoidance of antimicrobial use so as to limit the acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant organisms or Clostridioides difficile infection in SOT patients, who are at increased risk for these adverse outcomes. In nonrenal SOT recipients, symptomatic UTI is uncommon and adverse consequences of symptomatic UTI are extremely rare; the risk of complications from ASB is, therefore, probably negligible.

### Changing the culture of urine culturing: utilizing agile implementation to improve diagnostic stewardship in the ICU [^6eb174d6]. American Journal of Infection Control (2020). Medium credibility.

Over diagnosis of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) contributes to unnecessary and excessive antibiotic use, selection for resistant organisms, increased risk for Clostridiodes difficile infections, as well as a false elevation in CAUTI rates. Utilizing agile implementation to implement a urine culture algorithm achieved statistically significant reduction in CAUTI rates in a critical care unit resulting in sustainment and spread throughout the system.

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^f688801b]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship examples of inappropriate test use and consequences — Table 1 lists examples that can be improved through diagnostic stewardship, including routine ordering of microbiologic tests when specimens are obtained for non-infectious indications with potential consequences of overdiagnosis, treatment of contaminant or colonizing organisms, excess cost, increased length of stay, and increased test utilization to confirm negative; unnecessary pre-operative urine cultures with overdiagnosis and unnecessary antibiotic prescribing; urine and respiratory cultures for test of cure or asymptomatic patients with overdiagnosis and unnecessary antibiotic prescribing; C. difficile testing in patients on laxatives or previously positive with overdiagnosis including unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and additional C. difficile lab ID events; and routine use of SARS-CoV-2 PCR to determine duration of isolation with overdiagnosis and unnecessary prolonged isolation.

### Promoting appropriate urine culture management to improve health care outcomes and the accuracy of catheter-associated urinary tract infections [^84131855]. American Journal of Infection Control (2017). Low credibility.

Published literature indicates that the unjustified ordering or improper collection of urine for urinalysis or culture from either catheterized patients or those without indwelling devices, or misinterpretation of positive results, often leads to adverse health care events, including increased financial burdens, overreporting of mandated catheter-associated urinary tract infection events, overtreatment of patients with antimicrobial agents, selection of multidrug-resistant organisms, and Clostridium difficile infection. Moreover, national guidelines that provide evidence-based direction on core processes that form the basis for subsequent clinical therapy decisions or surveillance interpretations; that is, the appropriate ordering and collection of urine for laboratory testing and the treatment of patients with symptomatic urinary tract infection, are not widely known or lack adherence. This article provides published evidence on the influence of inappropriate ordering of urine specimens and subsequent treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and associated adverse effects; reviews research on bacterial contamination and preservation; and delineates best practices in the collection, handling, and testing of urine specimens for culture or for biochemical analysis in both catheterized and noncatheterized patients. The goal is to provide infection preventionists (IPs) with a cohesive evidence-based framework that will assist them in facilitating the implementation of a urine culture management program that reduces patient harms, enhances the accuracy of catheter-associated urinary tract infection surveillance, improves antibiotic stewardship, and reduces costs.

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^f0a90e48]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

SHEA position paper — diagnostic stewardship is defined as modifying the ordering, performing, or reporting of diagnostic tests to improve the diagnosis and treatment of infections and other conditions, and is described as interventions prioritizing the right test, for the right patient, to prompt the right action. Historically a laboratory activity focused on optimizing specimen collection, processing, and reporting to ensure accurate test results and interpretation, more recently there has been increasing understanding that test results can strongly influence antimicrobial utilization, including that up to 80% of hospitalized patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria are inappropriately treated with antibiotics. A wide array of healthcare professionals, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and infection preventionists, can play a role in optimizing test use and these stakeholders should be involved in the development and implementation of diagnostic stewardship initiatives. Diagnostic stewardship has traditionally focused on inpatients; however, it has expanded to other healthcare settings including ambulatory and long-term care settings, with targets varying by population such as optimizing testing for group A Streptococcus in ambulatory settings versus urine cultures and C. difficile testing for nursing homes. An awareness and understanding of pretest probability of infection is essential for designing interventions; many interventions function by increasing test use in high-value settings and discouraging or blocking testing in low-value settings where there is a low probability of disease and greater potential for false-positives results that may result in patient harm, such as blood culture for cystitis. The most common type of inappropriate microbiologic testing is overtesting, which can lead to diagnostic errors in the form of overdiagnosis, unnecessary antimicrobial treatment, and excess cost.

### Reducing unnecessary urine culture testing in residents of long term care facilities [^24c92a93]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Evidence for change

Prospective cohort studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown a lack of benefit in treating ASB in non-pregnant populations in terms of morbidity, mortality, or quality of life.RCTs consistently show that antimicrobial treatment in a patient without clear signs or symptoms of a UTI does not improve the risk of progression to a symptomatic UTI or sepsis. Recurrence rates of ASB are high, and sustained sterilisation of the urine is seldom achieved, as shown in cohort studies and randomised trials. In people with delirium who have no systemic symptoms of sepsis or localising urinary signs or symptoms, antibiotic therapy for ASB does not appear to lead to improved resolution of mental status. Two recent North American cohort studies of people with delirium and ASB admitted to hospital found that the functional outcome of those who received antibiotics was not statistically different by day 7 based on the brief confusion assessment method, nor up to two months in terms of risk of death, need for ongoing institutional care, or functional status based the Older Americans Resources and Services questionnaire.

Adverse reactions to antibiotics are common, and range from minor rashes and oral or vaginal candidiasis to more severe complications such as severe allergy, acute kidney injury, or drug-drug interactions. One particular complication of antibiotics is infection with Clostridiodes difficile, which can be a life threatening complication in residents of long term care. A retrospective cohort study of residents in two US care homes found that those who received antibiotics for ASB had a 8.5 times higher risk of developing C difficile infection. At the facility level, a population based study in Canada found that differences in rates of C difficile infection were explained by the variability in rate of institutional urine culture ordering. These data reaffirm that unnecessary urine cultures are the primary drivers of unnecessary antibiotic use and their associated adverse outcomes. Another example is the selection of increasingly antibiotic resistant urinary organisms, which results in fewer therapeutic options, and often with intravenous administration or increased risk of toxicity.

### Propensity score-weighted analysis of postoperative infection in patients with and without preoperative urine culture [^af714dd0]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this analysis of nearly 290 000 surgical procedures in the national VA health care system, baseline characteristics were balanced to reduce bias associated with the routine selection of recipients of preoperative urine culture. With this robust analytical approach, we found that urine culture performance was not associated with decreased risk of UTI or SSI. The results also demonstrated no reduction in postoperative UTI or SSI risk by performing preoperative urine cultures in orthopedic and neurosurgical patients, a group vulnerable to the frequent use of implants and substantial morbidity in the event of infection. The lack of benefit is a critical message for surgeons trying to reduce SSI rates in this high-risk, high-consequence patient group. Focus should be turned to other measures that decrease SSI.

We found that in the VA health care system, 10.5% of nongenitourinary surgical procedures were preceded by a preoperative urine culture. A recent study that evaluated the frequency and cost of low-value preoperative tests among patients within the VA system found that urinalysis, a common low-value test that precedes urine culture, was performed before 55 122 low-risk operations in 1 year, costing the VA over $200 000 annually. Similarly, urine culture is a low-value test and adds to unnecessary costs.

The untoward outcomes of unnecessary urine culture are well-described in the literature. When ASB is identified, almost 75% of patients get antibiotics. Small randomized clinical trials of antibiotic treatment vs no treatment of ASB primarily in nonsurgical populations have found more harm than benefit. A review of over 1600 patients found that antibiotic treatment of ASB was associated with resolution of the bacteriuria but not decreased symptomatic UTI, length of stay, or mortality. In addition, adverse events associated with the antibiotics, including antibiotic resistance, were substantially increased in treated patients. In an observational study of 729 patients with ASB conducted in the VA health care system, antibiotic treatment did not reduce readmission or all-cause mortality; Clostridioides difficile infection occurred in 0.4% without antibiotics vs 0.8% with antibiotics (not powered for significance). Additionally, previous work focusing on cardiac, vascular, and orthopedic surgical procedures reported that preoperative ASB was not associated with lower postoperative risk of infection, even when accounting for antibiotics. The current study moves the evidence base 1 step further by addressing the performance of the culture (as opposed to the result of the culture) in a broad range of presurgical patients.

### Risk factors and outcomes associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in hospitalized patients [^ac4093ef]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) with antibiotics is a common factor in inappropriate antibiotic use, but risk factors and outcomes associated with treatment of ASB in hospitalized patients are not well defined.

Objective

To evaluate factors associated with treatment of ASB among hospitalized patients and the possible association between treatment and clinical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2016, through February 1, 2018, at 46 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium. A total of 2733 hospitalized medical patients with ASB, defined as a positive urine culture without any documented signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection, were included in the analysis.

Exposures

One or more antibiotic dose for treatment of ASB.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Estimators of antibiotic treatment of ASB. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality, 30-day hospital readmission, 30-day emergency department visit, discharge to post-acute care settings, Clostridioides difficile infection (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) at 30 days, and duration of hospitalization after urine testing.

Results

Of 2733 patients with ASB, 2138 were women (78.2%); median age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 66–86 years). A total of 2259 patients (82.7%) were treated with antibiotics for a median of 7 days (IQR, 4–9 days). Factors associated with ASB treatment included older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.10 per 10-year increase; 95% CI, 1.02–1.18), dementia (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.15–2.13), acutely altered mental status (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.23–3.04), urinary incontinence (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.36–2.41), leukocytosis (white blood cell count > 10 000/μL) (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.21–2.00), positive urinalysis (presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrite, or > 5 white blood cells per high-power field) (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.05–3.93), and urine culture with a bacterial colony count greater than 100 000 colony-forming units per high-power field (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.83–2.91). Treatment of ASB was associated with longer duration of hospitalization after urine testing (4 vs 3 days; relative risk, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.28–1.47). No other differences in secondary outcomes were identified after propensity weighting.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hospitalized patients with ASB commonly receive inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic treatment did not appear to be associated with improved outcomes; rather, treatment may be associated with longer duration of hospitalization after urine testing. To possibly reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, stewardship efforts should focus on improving urine testing practices and management strategies for elderly patients with altered mental status.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^c8894dfb]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship and the consideration of collateral damage in recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) highlight rising resistance and drug-specific risks, noting, "In the past 20 years, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens has increased dramatically". The text states, "Fluoroquinolones have been linked to infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus and increasing fluoroquinolone resistance in gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), while broad spectrum cephalosporins have been linked to subsequent infections with vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, ESBL–producing K. pneumoniae, β-lactam resistant Acinetobacter species, and Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile)". Stewardship adherence "may significantly mitigate increasing fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance", yet "Non-adherence to Guidelines for the treatment of acute cystitis, however, is more common in patients who have rUTIs than patients with an isolated episode of acute cystitis". Practices such as "lengthening the antimicrobial course, broadening antibiotic treatment, or increasing antibiotic doses" lack evidence and "have not been demonstrated to be efficacious and have the potential for harm", and "Providers should combine knowledge of the local antibiogram with the selection of antimicrobial agents with the least impact on normal vaginal and fecal flora", with an antibiogram described as providing "a profile of the local results of antimicrobial sensitivity testing", and aggregate results "usually annually, providing the percentage of a given organism sensitive to a particular antimicrobial".

### Targeting asymptomatic bacteriuria in antimicrobial stewardship: the role of the microbiology laboratory [^74972032]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

This minireview focuses on the microbiologic evaluation of patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, as well as indications for antibiotic treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as two consecutive voided specimens (preferably within 2weeks) with the same bacterial species, isolated in quantitative counts of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/ml in women, including pregnant women; a single voided urine specimen with one bacterial species isolated in a quantitative count ≥ 10⁵ CFU/ml in men; and a single catheterized urine specimen with one or more bacterial species isolated in a quantitative count of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/ml in either women or men (or ≥ 10² CFU/ml of a single bacterial species from a single catheterized urine specimen). Any urine specimen with ≥ 10⁴ CFU/ml group B Streptococcus is significant for asymptomatic bacteriuria in a pregnant woman. Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs, irrespective of pyuria, in the absence of signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection. The two groups with the best evidence of adverse outcomes in the setting of untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria include pregnant women and patients who undergo urologic procedures with risk of mucosal injury. Screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended in the following patient populations: pediatric patients, healthy nonpregnant women, older patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting, diabetic patients, patients with an indwelling urethral catheter, patients with impaired voiding following spinal cord injury, patients undergoing nonurologic surgeries, and nonrenal solid-organ transplant recipients. Renal transplant recipients beyond 1 month posttransplant should not undergo screening and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening of renal transplant recipients within 1 month, patients with high-risk neutropenia, or patients with indwelling catheters at the time of catheter removal. Unwarranted antibiotics place patients at increased risk of adverse effects (including Clostridioides difficile diarrhea) and contribute to antibiotic resistance. Methods to reduce unnecessary screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria aid in antibiotic stewardship.

### BLADDER score: evaluating a tool to support urinary diagnostic and antibiotic stewardship in hospitalized adults [^c73086af]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant threat to global health. Misuse of antimicrobials hastens AMR and increases the risk of harm including adverse effects and Clostridioides difficile infection, particularly for older adults. One of the most common reasons for antibiotic prescribing in older adults is for presumed urinary tract infections (UTI). Antimicrobial use is commonly inappropriate in such situations, ranging from 32% to 93% of prescriptions for suspected UTI deemed unnecessary. Nonspecific symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to UTI in older adults. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is very common, estimated at up to 50% of non-catheterized older adults. Positive urine cultures often falsely reinforce preexisting suspicions of UTI. This can lead to a harmful medical cascade of urine culturing, antibiotic prescribing, and then adverse effects of antibiotic use. Further, there is a risk of "premature diagnostic closure", in which other possible diagnoses are not considered due to initial anchoring on a suspicion of UTI.

Although it is important to ensure adequate and early treatment of true symptomatic UTI in older adults, tools are needed to help clinicians decide in which low-risk patients we can avoid sending urine for culture and instead shift investigation and management to other possible diagnoses (eg, dehydration, medication-induced confusion, etc.). Preventing unnecessary urine culturing in the first place can help minimize antibiotic use because positive cultures are often difficult to ignore and often result in antibiotic therapy in the absence of symptoms. In fact, upstream diagnostic stewardship (reducing unnecessary testing) may be more effective at reducing unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, compared to downstream antimicrobial stewardship (reducing unnecessary treatment) once urine culture is already reported to the treating clinician.

Given the prevalence of antibiotic overuse for presumed UTI and the complexity of this problem driven by many behavioral and clinical factors, a variety of strategies are needed. One novel approach to behavior change, "boosting", a more transparent and competency-focused alternative to "nudging", aims to improve clinician decision-making by empowering and respecting human capacity to make the right decision. Our objective was to implement a simple boosting tool called the BLADDER score and to evaluate its impact on urine culturing and antibiotic prescribing for adults with presumed UTI.

### Incidence and predictive biomarkers of Clostridioides difficile infection in hospitalized patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics [^2744078c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We studied three distinct biomarker types. Previous studies have found associations between urinary N3-IS levels and the microbiota composition. In particular, the relative abundance of bacteria from the class Clostridia was positively associated with N3-IS, whereas Bacilli were negatively associated with N3-IS. As Clostridia have been associated with a decreased and Bacilli with an increased CDI risk, we hypothesized that patients with a low N3-IS level would be at an increased risk of CDI –. However, in our study baseline N3-IS level was not predictive. Yet, there was an association between low day-6 N3-IS level and an increased CDI incidence afterwards, confirming the direction of the hypothesized association. Altogether, we conclude that N3-IS is very unlikely to be a relevant baseline predictor of CDI risk in this patient population, but when measured after several days of antibiotic treatment it may predict the subsequent risk of CDI.

Toxigenic C. difficile carriage at baseline was detected in 3.6% of participants. In previous studies, the prevalence of toxigenic C. difficile carriage was very heterogeneous with a pooled prevalence of 8.1% (95% CI: 5.7–11.1%). The low observed carriage prevalence may be due to a potentially lower sensitivity of rectal swabs compared to stool samples for detection of toxigenic C. difficile carriage. PCR testing based on swabs dipped in stool samples of CDI patients has yielded high detection rates, but this may be different for detection of colonization. On the other hand, the relative risk of toxigenic C. difficile carriage for CDI is high compared to previous studies in which relative risks between 2.5 and 10 have been observed. The very short time to CDI occurrence in participants colonized with C. difficile was surprising. A recent study among hospitalized medical patients also using PCR testing on rectal swabs for detection of toxigenic C. difficile found a similar carriage rate of 3.4% and a relative risk for CDI among carriers of 16.6 (95% CI: 4.0–69.1), but no difference in time to occurrence of CDI (median [range] 23 [4–30] days for carriers vs. 11 [4–30] days for noncarriers). The low prevalence of C. difficile carriage would make this biomarker very inefficient for enrichment of prevention trials, as about 30 patients would need to be screened to enroll one high risk patient. Moreover, rapid point-of-care testing must be available with affordable cost.

### Impact of two-step urine culture ordering in the emergency department: a time series analysis [^40aad1ee]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urine cultures (UCs) remain the most overordered clinical microbiological investigation across acute and long-term care institutions. This excess testing is not only a waste of finite healthcare resources, but results in the overdetection of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Overdetection of ASB leads to low-value care, including antimicrobial prescriptions that are of no benefit and potentially harmful to patients. Between 30% and 60% of patients with ASB receive unnecessary antimicrobial treatment, which is associated with an eightfold risk of developing Clostridium difficile infection and is one of the leading causes of unnecessary antibiotic use driving antimicrobial resistance.

Emergency departments (EDs) submit the largest volume of UCs in the hospital, yet improvement efforts to limit overordering in this patient setting have had limited success. The fast paced environment of the ED favours the pre-emptive collection of UCs for non-specific indications, to facilitate subsequent patient management. Any intervention to address overordering in the ED must also guard against underinvestigation and undertreatment of patients who are acutely ill and diagnostically undifferentiated on presentation.

Education in the form of diagnostic and treatment algorithms to promote appropriate ordering of UCs and antibiotic prescribing for symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) have had limited success and require significant resources to sustain. Even when the pretest probability of UTI is low, positive UC results greatly influence diagnosis and the decision to treat with antibiotics. A prior proof-of-concept study among hospitalised inpatients demonstrated that when positive UCs are no longer routinely reported, antimicrobial use for ASB drops significantly. Processing, yet not reporting UCs, however, still requires substantial microbiology resources and does not optimise cost savings. A process that allows for UCs to be collected pre-emptively, yet held until clinical probability of UTI can be determined, would be the preferred approach. The challenge in creating such a model has been that delaying the processing of urine specimens can reduce specimen quality, increase bacterial overgrowth and ultimately lead to false-positive results. In addition, due to the volume of UCs submitted from the ED, refrigerating held urine specimens to limit bacterial overgrowth is not a feasible strategy.

### Syndromic antibiograms and nursing home clinicians' antibiotic choices for urinary tract infections [^4742487d]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 85% of antibiotic treatment courses in nursing homes (NHs) are initiated empirically before results of cultures are available. Up to two-thirds of these empirical choices are inappropriate and may result in harms from not providing active coverage as well as providing too broad of activity. Harms of exposure to multiple antibiotic classes or overly broad therapy include increased risk of developing C difficile diarrheaand future infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, as well as spread of resistant bacteria to other NH residents. In NHs, over 90% of performed cultures are from urine samples, and urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common indication for antibiotic initiation. Improving the quality of empirical antibiotic decisions is a critical step toward improving antibiotic safety and effectiveness in NHs.

Cumulative susceptibility reports, commonly called antibiograms, summarize the susceptibility rates of bacteria recovered from cultures collected in a health care facility over a specific time frame. Clinicians can use these tools to guide empirical antibiotic choices, increasing the likelihood that the first prescribed antibiotic will provide adequate activity while awaiting culture and other diagnostic studies. Syndromic antibiograms, limited to cultures from a specific body site, can provide more targeted empirical antibiotic recommendations that only include antibiotic choices appropriate to the specific syndrome. The outcomes of antibiograms specific to bacteria isolated from urine on empirical antibiotics selected by NH clinicians has not been well characterized.

Our objective was to assess how urinary antibiograms may be associated with empirical antibiotics selected by NH clinicians treating clinically suspected UTIs. We hypothesized that NH clinicians using a urinary antibiogram would be more likely to select empirical antibiotics that were active against potential urinary pathogens. We further hypothesized that compared with a traditionally formatted urinary antibiogram, NH clinicians using a weighted-incidence syndromic antibiogram (WISCA)would be more likely to select antibiotics that were not only active but also optimal in the treatment of NH residents with clinically suspected UTI. To test our hypotheses, we asked NH clinicians to participate in an electronic survey that included 4 clinical vignettes describing NH residents with UTIs. Survey participants were randomized to use a traditional antibiogram (TA), a WISCA, or no antibiogram when selecting empirical antibiotics for each case.

Evaluation of suspected Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — When CDI is suspected, a disease-specific history should be performed emphasizing risk factors, symptoms, underlying comorbidities, and signs of severe or fulminant disease. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Symptoms typically manifest soon after starting antibiotic therapy for another disease process, but can be delayed for up to 3 months after discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. The strongest risk factor for developing CDI is recent antibiotic use (within 3 months), and increased duration of exposure and number of antibiotics used are associated with higher risk for developing CDI, with drugs such as clindamycin, ampicillin, penicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, and thirdgeneration cephalosporins more commonly associated with developing CDI.

### A study into the effect ofShirota in preventing antibiotic associated diarrhoea includinginfection in patients with spinal cord injuries: a multicentre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^96f16baa]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD), described as unexplained diarrhoea that occurs in association with antibiotic administration, is a common complication of antibiotic treatment. It is reported that about 30.3% of patients will develop AAD upon administration of antibioticsbut the frequency of AAD can be as high as 60% during hospital outbreaks.

Infection with the recently renamed Clostridioides Difficile (CDI) occurs most often as a consequence of disruption of the gut microbiota following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics, and is therefore considered the specific cause in a subgroup of AAD. C. difficile is a spore-forming, Gram-positive anaerobe. It is a particularly virulent pathogen because it produces an enterotoxin and a cytotoxin, both of which cause mucosal injury and damage to the colon. When antibiotic therapy disrupts this natural defence, C. difficile multiplies and produces toxins, causing diarrhoea. In some cases, severe inflammation (C. difficile associated colitis) can develop.

Probiotics, defined as ' live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host', have been proposed to prevent AAD/CDI by restoring or maintaining a healthy gut microbiome in hospitalized patients on antibiotic therapy, particularly those on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but it is still unclear whether specific probiotic strains reduce the overall incidence of AAD/CDI.

People with SCI (PWSCI) may be particularly vulnerable to diarrhoea and its consequences because of their long hospital stays for acute care and rehabilitation. In addition, neurogenic bladder dysfunction as a result of SCI often leads to enhanced risk of symptomatic urinary tract infections, due to defective urine storage, bladder stones, foreign bodies or residual urine in the bladder. The use of invasive devices such as urinary catheters further increases the need for antibiotics and the risks of their undesirable effects, including AAD and CDI. Newly injured PWSCI not only have a high risk of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, but also usually require anticoagulation therapy to prevent venous thromboembolism. Given these additive risks, most patients are prescribed gastric protection with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). However, PPI exposure is also a risk factor for AAD / CDI. Literature reports show that patients on PPIs have a relative risk of 1.69 of contracting CDI compared to patients who are not taking the medication. The prevalences of AAD and CDI in PWSCI are reported in the range 14.9 to 30.3%.

### How testing drives treatment in asymptomatic patients: level of pyuria directly predicts probability of antimicrobial prescribing [^c2fbf2da]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinalysis is a readily available test often used for screening. Pyuria is a common finding in asymptomatic patients; however, it is unknown how often identification of pyuria in the absence of confirmatory cultures leads to antimicrobial prescribing. The objective of this study was to measure the association between pyuria and antimicrobial initiation during the perioperative period and assess harms versus benefits of treatment.

Methods

A retrospective cohort of preoperative patients within the national healthcare system during the period 1 October 2008–30 September 2013 who had a urinalysis performed during the 30-day preoperative period was created; patients with positive urine cultures were excluded. The primary exposure was pyuria on preoperative urinalysis. The primary outcome was antimicrobial initiation. Secondary outcomes included postoperative surgical site (SSI), urinary tract (UTI), and Clostridioides difficile infections. Trend and logistic regression analyses were performed.

Results

Among 41 373 patients, 3617 had pyuria. 887 (24.5%) patients with pyuria received antimicrobials versus 1918 (5.1%) patients without pyuria. As the degree of pyuria increased, the odds of receiving antimicrobials also increased linearly (low, 14.7%; moderate, 24.0%; high pyuria, 37.4%). Preoperative pyuria was associated with postoperative C. difficile infections (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2–2.4); risk was higher in patients who received antimicrobials (aOR, 2.4; 1.7–3.4). Pyuria was not associated with SSI but was associated with increases in UTI after orthopedic and vascular procedures; this risk was not mitigated by antimicrobial therapy.

Conclusions

Urine screening during the preoperative period is a low-value intervention that increases antimicrobial exposure but does not improve postoperative outcomes.

### Trends in empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected community-onset sepsis in US hospitals [^95429d7c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The increasing mismatch between empiric prescribing and identified pathogens constitutes a patient-safety risk. Prior investigations suggest that overly broad antibiotics are associated with similarly poor outcomes as inappropriately narrow antibiotics. Among 17 430 adults treated for community-onset sepsis in 104 hospitals, for example, both overly broad and overly narrow antibiotics were associated with a 20% increase in the odds of hospital death; overly broad regimens were further associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury and Clostridioides difficile infections.

We stress that our results should not be interpreted as critical of prescription standards of front-line providers, nor should our description of certain antibiotics courses as unnecessary in retrospect be taken to mean inappropriate at the time of prescribing, because in many cases they were guideline compliant. Additionally, front-line clinicians often must make treatment decisions with incomplete information. This leads many to err on the side of broader coverage, particularly when patients are severely ill. Our analysis was also not designed to identify clinical factors or algorithms that clinicians can use to determine which patients can safely tolerate narrow-spectrum antibiotics and which require broad-spectrum treatment. Our study was rather designed to gather epidemiologic data to inform guideline and policy deliberations around finding the balance between minimizing undertreatment of patients with serious infections vs minimizing overuse of antibiotic at both the individual and population levels. Several professional societies, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America, have recently encouraged regulators and guideline developers to provide more specific direction about which patients with possible sepsis require immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can safely be managed with narrower spectrum regimens, and which can be managed without antibiotics while obtaining further data to clarify their diagnoses.

IDSA/SHEA 2021 focused update — rationale for fidaxomicin vs vancomycin states that the panel agrees the balance of benefits and harms favors using fidaxomicin over vancomycin for an initial episode of CDI, with moderate certainty of evidence; the panel also judges the use of fidaxomicin is likely cost-effective, acceptable to patients and providers, and feasible to implement when considering dosing and duration, and notes that achieving both initial and sustained clinical responses are key goals and that lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin are an important advantage.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^44adc5af]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Exposure

We compared residents with UTIs receiving potentially suboptimal antibiotic treatment with those receiving potentially optimal antibiotic treatment. Potentially suboptimal antibiotic treatment was defined as use of a suboptimal initial antibiotic drug choice, dose frequency, and/or excessive treatment duration. Initial drug choice was considered suboptimal based on resistance to the antibiotics used on day 1 of treatment, considering the resident's urine culture and susceptibility results in the previous 180 days. If no urine culture and susceptibility data were available, the initial agents used were considered suboptimal if they provided insufficient coverage (susceptibility < 80% based on the CLC urine antibiogram for the year prior). Dose frequency was considered suboptimal based on renal function. In the case of missing serum creatine, dose frequency was defined as suboptimal, as clinicians would be unable to perform renal dose adjustment without an estimate of creatine clearance. Antibiotic duration was considered excessive if was ≥ 14 days.

Outcomes

The primary outcome of interest was time to a composite measure of any of the following poor clinical outcomes within 30 days of antibiotic discontinuation: UTI recurrence, acute care hospitalization or emergency department (ED) visit, adverse drug event, Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), or death. For residents who experienced more than one of these poor clinical outcomes of interest we considered the event that occurred first. For secondary outcomes, we assessed time to each poor clinical outcome separately. We censored residents who were alive and without the event of interest after 30 days. Table 1 presents study definitions used for primary and secondary outcomes.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) values and preferences — The panel states that most patients would wish to receive antimicrobial therapy for ASB if benefits outweigh harms, but where treatment is unlikely to confer a benefit, risks including adverse drug effects, CDI, and antimicrobial resistance suggest most would not wish to receive antimicrobial treatment. From the societal perspective, avoidance of antimicrobial use where there is no benefit is preferred, and when the quality of evidence is low with no suggestion of potential harm, the panel "generally recommend against the treatment of ASB because of the high-quality evidence that antimicrobial therapy contributes to antimicrobial resistance". They also note costs are not offset by demonstrable benefits and that high-quality evidence shows no reduction in symptomatic UTI or other outcomes where there is no evidence of benefit with treatment of ASB.

### Antibiotic use and the risk of hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection [^43d27f0c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the hazard of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) between asymptomatic carriers compared with noncarriers of C difficile, and is this hazard associated with antibiotic exposure?

Findings

In this cohort study of 33 756 hospitalizations among 23 001 patients, asymptomatic carriers had a higher hazard of CDI. Antibiotic exposure, particularly to amoxicillin and clavulanate and piperacillin and tazobactam, was associated with an increased hazard of CDI, especially among noncarriers, with no additional hazard among carriers.

Meaning

These findings suggest that while antibiotic stewardship may be associated with a reduced hazard of CDI in asymptomatic carriers given their already elevated hazard, additional strategies may be warranted.

### Antimicrobial de-escalation strategies in hospitalized patients with pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, and bacteremia [^8f18d8be]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Increasing numbers of serious hospital/healthcare- or community-acquired infections are caused by resistant (often multi-drug resistant) bacterial pathogens. Because delayed or ineffective initial therapy can have severe negative consequences, patients at risk for these types of infections typically receive initial empiric antibiotic therapy with a broad-spectrum regimen covering the most likely pathogens, based on local surveillance data and risk factors for infection with a resistant microorganism. While improving the likelihood of a successful outcome, use of broad-spectrum, often high-dose, empiric antimicrobial therapy also creates pressure for the selection or development of resistant microorganisms, as well as increasing costs and possibly exposing patients to adverse events or collateral damage such as Clostridium difficile-associated disease. De-escalation is a strategy that attempts to balance the competing aims of providing initial empiric therapy that is appropriate and covers the likely pathogens, and limiting antimicrobial exposure and increased risk for emergence of resistant pathogens. More specifically, the de-escalation strategy involves collection of cultures for later microbiological assessment before initiating broad-spectrum empiric therapy covering the most likely pathogens, with the intention of streamlining or de-escalating to a more narrow-spectrum antimicrobial regimen 2–3 days later if warranted by clinical status and culture results. In some cases, negative culture results and subsequent clinical review may allow for termination of initial empiric therapy. In this manner, de-escalation enables more effective targeting of the causative pathogen(s), elimination of redundant therapy, a decrease in antimicrobial pressure for emergence of resistance, and cost savings. This article examines application of the de-escalation strategy to 3 case patients, one with healthcare-associated pneumonia, another with complicated intra-abdominal infection, and a third with central line-associated bacteremia.

### Trends in and risk factors for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, new haven county, Connecticut, USA, 2015–2020 [^cf231212]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Although nitrofurantoin is known to have minimal effect on bowel flora, given that it concentrates in the urinary tract and has low serum concentration, this study shows a significant relationship between nitrofurantoin use and increased risk for RCDI. This observation could be attributable to the higher rates of prescription of multiple antibiotics to older populations. Other studies have found a tendency for inappropriate antibiotic use in LTCFs. However, after controlling for overall antibiotic use, nitrofurantoin use remained a significant risk factor for RCDI. Further studies into possible explanatory factors are needed, because currently available clinical factors do not completely explain increased risk for RCDI.

The first limitation of this study is that the surveillance system does not collect information on antibiotic or other medication use once a patient with incident CDI is admitted, other than whatever treatment regimen was initiated for treatment of the incident CDI infection. The collected information on medication use was limited to the 12 weeks before incident CDI diagnosis, which does not account for possible effects of antibiotics taken before that period. Nitrofurantoin use, for example, could conceivably be a marker for patients with recurrent urinary tract infections who received multiple rounds of antibiotics in the past. Second, we were only able to look at the treatment regimen in a standardized way for the years 2018–2020, limiting our power to find significance, and then only for the initial treatment ordered, not changes to it. Third, because symptom information is not routinely collected for patients with recurrent cases, some of those cases could be misclassified if the reason for the patient's RCDI qualifying laboratory test were to assess test of cure or colonization status. In addition, the protocol for chart reviews used by HAIC allows for a limited random sampling of 1 in 10 HCFO cases, which could provide a potential point of bias given that information on CDI recurrence is unavailable for unsampled HCFO case-patients. Further, the review and modification of the CDI case report form over the years has helped improve reporting of patient-level characteristics of CDI cases. However, those changes have also produced variations in the case report form and the way information is collected, something particularly noticeable in the case report form change in 2019, which saw the inclusion of information such as route of medication for treatment of previous CDI and number of courses of treatment received, factors that could possibly be important predictors of recurrence. Last, we were unable to adjust for type of test; a previous study found that incident CDI case-patients identified by a common testing algorithm in which confirmation was done by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) were less likely to have RCDI than case-patients identified through toxin testing, presumably because NAAT may be more likely to detect colonization than toxin testing. If testing of index CDI case-patients that used algorithms that were less likely to be falsely positive (identifying colonization) over time, then the increase in RCDI risk we observed from 2019 to 2020 might be partly attributable to that tendency. However, stratifying the risk for RCDI by tests that included NAAT versus those that did not made no difference in the magnitude or statistical significance of the increase.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and antibiotic stewardship: using a systems engineering approach to maintain patient safety [^8588ebdc]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor — In the absence of effective treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many hospitalized COVID-19 patients receive antibiotics. Thus far, the literature does not indicate that antibiotics are effective in treating COVID-19, and the incidence of bacterial coinfections appears low. One analysis reported that while 8% of COVID-19 patients experienced a bacterial or fungal coinfection, 72% of COVID-19 patients received antibiotics.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics frequently used for COVID-19; CDI is thus a significant concern for COVID-19 patients. Patients at higher risk of severe COVID-19 frequently also have risk factors for CDI such as advanced age and weakened immune systems.COVID-19 treatments themselves, which often involve extended hospital stays, can also increase a patient's risk of developing healthcare-associated CDI.CDI has been identified in patients who received antibiotics as part of their COVID-19 treatment.

Given the patient safety risks posed by CDI, effective antibiotic stewardship remains critical throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. However, pandemic-related changes to healthcare delivery (eg, drug shortages, changing pharmacy workflows, and redeployed healthcare workers) have made antibiotic stewardship interventions even more challenging. We present a systems engineering approach to evaluate and modify antibiotic stewardship programs within the constraints of COVID-19 responses, with the overall goal of reducing CDI.

Severe CDI — metronidazole use and outcomes: Metronidazole should not be used for the treatment of severe CDI because it was shown to be inferior to vancomycin in multiple RCTs and cohort studies. Patients who received vancomycin only after failing metronidazole (≥ 48 hours) compared with those who received vancomycin at time of diagnosis had longer hospital stays, higher rates of acute kidney injury, and lower rates of cure, and in a large propensity-matched cohort of 3,130 patients with severe CDI, vancomycin compared with metronidazole reduced the 30-day all-cause mortality from 19.8% to 15.3% (P = 0.01).

### Antibiotic use and the risk of hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection [^d6bf2143]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of health care–associated infections. Patients with C difficile infection (CDI) endure considerable morbidity and mortality, while health care facilities face substantial costs related to treatment and infection control efforts. Despite various preventive strategies, the incidence of CDI remains high, necessitating further exploration of risk factors and targeted interventions.

C difficile infection occurs primarily in individuals with disrupted gut microbiota, and antibiotic exposure is a well-recognized risk factor. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and broad-spectrum cephalosporins, substantially increase CDI risk by altering the gut microbiome and creating conditions favorable for C difficile colonization and proliferation. Moreover, the risk of CDI is influenced by the duration and intensity of antibiotic exposure, with prolonged and multiple courses of antibiotics considered particularly hazardous. Other risk factors include advanced age, comorbidities, proton pump inhibitor use, and prior CDI events.

In addition to these general risk factors, asymptomatic carriers of C difficile, ie, individuals with positive test results for the bacterium without exhibiting symptoms, present unique challenges in health care settings. These carriers not only act as potential reservoirs for transmission but also are at an elevated risk of progressing to clinical CDI. However, the specific interactions among antibiotic use, type, and duration of treatment in this high-risk group remain poorly understood. The aim of our study was to address these knowledge gaps by quantifying the rate of hospital-onset CDI among carriers of C difficile compared with noncarriers and by evaluating the role of antibiotic exposure in shaping this risk.

Regarding medical management for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, non-severe disease, ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a risk stratification for selected use when access to fidaxomicin is limited. Administer fidaxomicin whenever the risk of recurrence is deemed high, recognizing that this can be supported by an older age of the patient (> 65 years) plus the presence of one or more additional risk factors:

- healthcare-associated CDI

- prior hospitalization in the last 3 months

- use of concomitant antibiotics

- PPIs started during/after CDI diagnosis

- prior CDI episode.

### Comparison of cefazolin and ceftriaxone enterobacterales susceptibilities for inpatient treatment of urinary tract infections and risk of hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection [^c343fcbb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second most common indication for antibiotic therapy among inpatients in the United States. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is habitually chosen to treat inpatient UTIs due to familiarity, cost, and perceived safety. However, third-generation cephalosporins increase the risk of health care facility-onset Clostridioides difficile infection (HOCDI) more than any other antibiotic group, while no statistical risk exists for first-generation cephalosporins. Recent evidence comparing Enterobacterales susceptibility for first- and third-generation cephalosporins in urinary specimens in the United States is limited. This analysis assessed the comparative activity of cefazolin and ceftriaxone for Enterobacterales urinary isolates and incidence of HOCDI to determine the usefulness of cefazolin as an empirical agent to manage inpatient UTI and limit ceftriaxone collateral damage.

Methods

This was a retrospective single-center observational study. Microbiologic susceptibility data were analyzed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis urinary specimens taken from adult inpatients admitted from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022. Primary outcome was incidence of E coli, K pneumoniae, and P mirabilis susceptibility to cefazolin in uncomplicated UTI (MIC < 16 µg/mL). Secondary outcomes include susceptibility for complicated UTI and HOCDI risk associated with cefazolin and ceftriaxone.

Findings

A total of 1150 urine samples were identified as E coli, K pneumoniae, and P mirabilis in 2022. Susceptibility to cefazolin was observed in 1064 (92.5%) of 1150 isolates using the MIC breakpoint for uncomplicated UTI and to ceftriaxone in 1115 (97.0%) of 1150 isolates (P < 0.001). From 2016 to 2022, either cefazolin or ceftriaxone was administered in 26,462 inpatient admissions, with HOCDI diagnoses occurring in 89 admissions. HOCDI developed in 78 admissions (0.40%) with ceftriaxone exposure, and 11 cases (0.15%) developed in cefazolin-exposed admissions (adjusted odds ratio, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.25–4.76; P < 0.001).

Implications

Cefazolin exhibits high susceptibility for uropathogens commonly implicated in cases of uncomplicated UTI, the most common UTI diagnosis among inpatients. Although ceftriaxone shows a higher susceptibility rate against these common uropathogens, it more than doubles the risk for HOCDI compared with cefazolin. For institutions evaluating opportunities to reduce ceftriaxone use to limit associated collateral damage such as HOCDI, use of cefazolin for uncomplicated UTI may be evaluated by using local susceptibility data.

Rationale for recommendation — The panel states that the balance of benefits and harms "favors adding bezlotoxumab to SOC antibiotics for patients with a CDI episode and at least 1 risk factor for recurrence (recurrent CDI episode within the last 6 months, age ≥ 65 years, immunocompromised host, and severe CDI on presentation)", and notes it "seems more favorable in patients with multiple risk factors for recurrent CDI and especially in patients with a prior CDI in the last 6 months". The certainty of evidence is described as "moderate overall, but very low in subpopulations at high risk of CDI recurrence".

Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — concurrent or recent non-CDI antibiotics and extended CDI therapy: Some patients need other antibiotics during or shortly after the end of CDI therapy and are at a higher risk of a recurrence and its attendant complications; many clinicians prolong CDI treatment in such cases and lower doses may be sufficient to prevent recurrence (eg, vancomycin 125 mg once daily), but whether this reduces CDI recurrence is unknown and one retrospective study suggested no benefit for extension beyond 10–14 days.

### Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in culture-proven sepsis and outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use [^76a3d479]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis, the syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction complicating severe infection, is a leading cause of death in hospitalized patients. Early active antibiotic therapy is associated with better outcomes. Therefore, national quality measures and international guidelines recommend immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for all patients with suspected sepsis.

However, it is unclear how many patients presenting with sepsis require coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other potentially resistant pathogens. Most existing epidemiologic studies present rates of resistance to selected antimicrobials per pathogen rather than quantifying overall resistance rates across all patients and syndromes associated with sepsis. These data are needed to inform the rational use of antibiotics, given that overuse of broad-spectrum therapy may also confer harm by selecting for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, increasing the risk of adverse events, such as Clostridioides difficile infections, and raising costs. Overtreatment has also been associated with higher mortality rates in some populations. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in patients with culture-positive community-onset sepsis and the risks of both inadequate and unnecessarily broad antibiotic treatments in US hospitals.

### Antimicrobial use for asymptomatic bacteriuria-first, do no harm [^07a5b3de]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Administration of antimicrobials to patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common error that can lead to worse outcomes. However, controlled analyses quantifying the commonality and impact of this practice are lacking. We analyzed the independent predictors for antimicrobials misuse in ASB and quantified the impact of this practice on clinical outcomes.

Design

Retrospective case-control and cohort analyses for calendar year 2017.

Setting

Tertiary-care, university-affiliated medical center.

Patients

The study included adult (> 18 years) patients with positive urine culture. Pregnant women, renal transplant recipients, and patients who underwent urologic procedures were excluded.

Methods

ASB was determined according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to analyze predictors and outcomes associated with antimicrobial use for patients with ASB.

Results

The study included 1,530 patient-unique positive urine cultures. Among these patients, 610 patients (40%) were determined to have ASB. Of the 696 isolates, 219 (36%) were multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Also, 178 (29%) patients received antimicrobials specifically due to the ASB. Independent predictors for improper administration of antimicrobials were dependent functional status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4–3.6) and male sex (aOR, 2; 95% CI, 1.25–2.6). Use of antimicrobials was independently associated with re-hospitalizations (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.6) and later, acute Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) in the following 90 days (aOR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2–10.6).

Conclusions

ASB is a common condition, frequently resulting from an MDRO. Male sex and poor functional status were independent predictors for mistreatment, and this practice was independently associated with rehospitalizations and CDI in the following 90 days.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^db173ac1]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotic resistance poses one of the most urgent and widespread threats to public health and is driven by antibiotic use. Antibiotics use is highly prevalent in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Antibiotics are used frequently in older residents for many reasons, including higher risk of infection due to immunosuppression, malnutrition, dehydration, presence of multiple comorbidities, and functional impairment. Several other issues such as diagnostic uncertainty, the atypical and/or subtle presentation of common infections, and the frequency of colonization with antibiotic-resistant pathogens also contribute to antibiotic use in this population. Approximately 10% of residents are on at least one antibiotic at any one time and between 50 and 75% of residents receive an antibiotic over the course of a year. Up to 75% of antibiotic treatment in LTCFs may be inappropriate, putting already vulnerable residents at risk for unintended consequences of antibiotic use, including selection for colonization or infection with resistant organisms and Clostridioides difficile, antibiotic allergies, and other adverse drug effects and drug toxicities.

The most common driver of antibiotic use and reason for inappropriate antibiotic use in LTCFs is urinary tract infection (UTI). A study which included one-day point prevalence surveys from nine nursing homes in four states demonstrated that one in three antibiotics given to residents are for UTI and at least half of these antibiotics are inappropriate with regards to the drug choice, dose, or duration given. Other studies have estimated that between 25 and 85% of antibiotic prescriptions for residents with UTIs are inappropriate.

Prior studies have assessed the harms associated with unnecessary antibiotic use. No previous studies have assessed the harms associated with suboptimal antibiotic use, whether or not the antibiotics were necessary or unnecessary. Suboptimal antibiotic treatment as assessed by drug choice, dose, and/or duration, in already frail, older residents could also be associated with other poor clinical outcomes such as infection recurrence, acute care hospitalizations, visits to the emergency department, or even mortality. The aims of this study were to compare rates of poor clinical outcomes among LTCF residents with UTI receiving suboptimal and optimal antibiotic treatment. Our study focused on suboptimal antibiotic treatment, which has previously been defined as use of antibiotics in the setting of established infection that can be improved. In clinical practice, the antibiotic-decision making process is complex and many factors need to be considered to ensure that optimal therapy is used. Therefore, we sought to assess the clinical impact of several domains of suboptimal antibiotic treatment, including the drug choice, dose frequency, and/or duration of therapy, all of which have the potential to be improved should a negative clinical impact be observed.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in culture-proven sepsis and outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use [^5ac565bd]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

There are several other potential explanations for the association between overtreatment and higher mortality. As many as 20% of hospitalized patients who receive antibiotics experience adverse effects. Even a single dose of antibiotics can increase the risk of C difficile; this risk is higher with broad- vs narrow-spectrum antibiotics. We found unnecessarily broad empiric therapy was associated with a 26% increased risk of C difficile infection in our study. Unnecessary antibiotics may also increase the risk of acute kidney injury. We observed a trend toward more acute kidney injury in patients treated with unnecessarily broad antibiotics. In particular, the combination of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, a common regimen during the study period, is associated with renal toxicity. Broad-spectrum antibiotics also disrupt the gut microbiome, an increasingly recognized modulator of the immune system and outcomes in sepsis. Lastly, broad-spectrum antibiotics may increase the risk of resistant hospital-acquired infections.

### The effect of antibiotic therapy for Clostridioides difficile infection on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0674fd15]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Current practice guidelines favour fidaxomicin over vancomycin and exclude metronidazole from the recommended standard regimen for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), based on lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin, giving little weight to mortality or the clinical implications of recurrences.

Objectives

To compile the effects of metronidazole, glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin), and fidaxomicin for CDI on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes.

Data Sources

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, conference proceedings, and Google Scholar, until August 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Participants

Adult patients experiencing primary or recurrent CDI.

Interventions

Glycopeptides versus fidaxomicin or metronidazole (comparators).

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

We used the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for randomized trials, focusing on the outcome of all-cause mortality.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Random effects meta-analyses were performed for dichotomous outcomes. Outcomes were summarized preferentially for all randomly assigned patients.

Results

Thirteen trials were included. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] < 1 favouring the comparator) between vancomycin and fidaxomicin (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64–1.14, 8 RCTs, 1951 patients) or metronidazole (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46–1.32, 4 RCTs, 808 patients), with low and very low certainty of evidence, respectively. No significant difference in initial treatment failure between fidaxomicin and vancomycin was found, however, initial treatment failure was higher with metronidazole (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.10–2.27, 5 RCTs, 843 patients). No study reported on symptomatic recurrence necessitating re-treatment among all randomly assigned patients. Among initially cured patients, symptomatic recurrence necessitating re-treatment was lower with fidaxomicin than with vancomycin (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.42–0.71, 6 RCTs, 1617 patients). None of the studies reported on other CDI complications or the burden of infection on daily activities.

Conclusions

Setting patient-relevant outcomes for CDI independently of the RCT definitions and results might lead to less confidence in the guidance for CDI management.

### Use of leading practices in US hospital antimicrobial stewardship programs [^9f747223]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Finally, only one-third of hospitals reported efforts to optimize diagnostic testing for C. difficile and UTIs and the subsequent prescribing of unnecessary antibiotics that results from inappropriate testing. This was the lowest overall percentage among the leading practices. This may be because optimizing diagnostic testing requires a multidisciplinary effort that involves adjusting infection control and/or microbiology laboratory protocols. Optimizing testing for C. difficile was slightly higher than for urine specimens, likely because CDI rates are publicly reported. Clinician education as an intervention to improve diagnostic testing was higher for C. difficile than for collecting urine specimens. This difference may be because there is more clarity on when and who to test for C. difficile and less clarity on when to obtain a urine specimen. This finding is consistent with an infection preventionist survey that found hospitals frequently rejected formed stool submitted for CDI testing but that the use of urine culture stewardship was much lower.

Variation by hospital characteristics

In this study, the implementation of 4 leading practices was less common among small hospitals. The first 2 practices were interactive prospective audit and feedback and diagnostic stewardship, which may reflect more dedicated roles and established expertise in antimicrobial stewardship at larger hospitals. Although hospitals with fewer providers sometimes have a more collaborative environment, they also have fewer ASP staff with ID training. In-person feedback may be more challenging in small hospitals where the physician is only present a small portion of the day. Small hospitals may also have less information technology (IT) surveillance capability to target review, although strategies to overcome these limitations have been recommended. – Two other practices less common in small hospitals were measurement of CDI and antibiotic use. This may be because CAHs are not yet required to participate in the CMS IQR program and are less likely to enroll in the NHSN Antimicrobial Use option.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^9e53e47e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Orthopedic implant surgery ASB — rationale and practice implications: The guideline states there is high certainty that any antimicrobial increases the risk of harm, and that screening for and treating ASB increases costs and probably contributes to CDI, adverse drug effects, and antimicrobial resistance at an individual and health system level. Regarding adjustment of perioperative prophylaxis to cover the urinary pathogen in patients undergoing orthopedic implants, the literature is insufficient and "we are unable to make a recommendation for or against this common practice because the magnitudes of benefits and harms are so uncertain".

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases: 2021 update on the treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^71bfd261]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^dbafa963]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial treatment for an initial episode: Oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is considered first-line treatment for an initial CDI, whereas metronidazole alone is no longer considered appropriate first-line treatment; Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. For nonfulminant CDI, the recommended oral vancomycin dose is 125 mg 4 times a day and the recommended fidaxomicin dose is 200 mg twice a day; a 10-day course of either medication resolves CDI diarrhea in > 90% of patients. Evidence synthesis shows vancomycin was more effective in achieving a cure (79%) than metronidazole (72%); relative risk (RR), 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97, and metronidazole was inferior to vancomycin in initial cure rate (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.98; P = 0.02) and sustained cure rate (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.96; P = 0.003). Combination therapy with both vancomycin and metronidazole is associated with a higher rate of adverse events compared with monotherapy and is not typically recommended unless patients have severe-complicated or fulminant CDI.

### Broad-spectrum antibiotic use at the end of life in patients with advanced cancer [^1543b5b4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with advanced cancer frequently receive antibiotics owing to a heightened risk of bacterial infections, which arises from functional decline, malnutrition, compromised host defenses, immunosuppression related to the disease and its treatment, and the presence of various vascular and drainage catheters. Physicians often prescribe antibiotics to alleviate inflammatory symptoms, such as fever, and as a temporary intervention to manage infections associated with advanced cancer in an attempt to prolong life. However, excessive antibiotic use in these patients may compromise the quality of end-of-life care by causing adverse effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, and Clostridioides difficile infection. In addition, intravenous administration of antibiotics may complicate the transition to a comfortable home environment during the dying process. Moreover, the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics contributes to the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms, posing a major public health concern.

Given these concerns, careful consideration of antibiotic prescribing and use is essential in this population. However, data on how broad-spectrum antibiotics are used across the end-of-life trajectory in patients with advanced cancer remain limited, making it difficult to establish appropriate clinical guidance. Understanding patterns of broad-spectrum antibiotics throughout the end-of-life trajectory could guide the development of antimicrobial stewardship protocols aimed at minimizing the adverse outcomes of excessive prescribing while ensuring alignment with patient goal-concordant care.

Functional decline in patients with advanced cancer follows a predictable trajectory, with a prolonged period of relative stability followed by a more-rapid deterioration in the last weeks of life. This progression is usually associated with an increased symptom burden and frequent hospitalizations, which, in turn, drives antibiotic use. Given the progressive nature of advanced cancer, it is important to characterize how broad-spectrum antibiotic use varies across the different phases of the disease trajectory. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze patterns of broad-spectrum antibiotic use in patients with advanced cancer using a nationwide database.

### Vital signs: improving antibiotic use among hospitalized patients [^e8753db0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

The data in this report confirm the findings of several previous studies demonstrating that antibiotic prescribing in hospitals is common and often incorrect. In particular, patients are often exposed to antibiotics without proper evaluation and follow-up. Misuse of antibiotics puts patients at risk for preventable health problems. These include immediate complications; antibiotics are among the most frequent causes of adverse drug events among hospitalized U.S. patients, and near-term complications, such as CDI, which can be severe and even deadly. The analysis of risk for CDI from exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics during hospitalization found an exposed patient was at three times greater risk than a patient without this exposure. Elevated risks of similar magnitude were observed in previous studies. An estimated 30% reduction in use of these broad-spectrum antibiotics (which would reduce overall antibiotic use by only 5%) would prevent 26% of CDI related to inpatient antibiotic use. Reductions in CDI of this magnitude could also have additional positive effects in reducing transmission of C. difficile throughout the community.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA/SHEA 2021 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) guideline — initial episode treatment with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin — recommendation and pooled outcomes: For patients with an initial CDI episode, the guideline states, "we suggest using fidaxomicin rather than a standard course of vancomycin (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence)". The comment notes implementation "depends upon available resources" and that "Vancomycin remains an acceptable alternative". Trials compared fidaxomicin with vancomycin "(125 mg orally 4 times daily for 10 days)", and one study used an extended regimen "(200 mg orally twice daily for 5 days, followed by once daily on alternate days on days 7–25)… rather than a standard regimen (200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days)". In pooled analysis, fidaxomicin increased sustained response at 4 weeks versus standard vancomycin with "risk ratio [RR]: 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09–1.24", while initial clinical cure was comparable "(RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.96–1.04)" and mortality was not reduced "(RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.66–1.23)". Drug-related adverse events were not increased "(RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.76–1.36)", and "The overall certainty in the evidence was rated as moderate" due to study design and imprecision.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) recurrence — pooled randomized trial subgroup data show that fidaxomicin increased sustained response at 30 days after end of therapy versus vancomycin (RR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.05–1.54; low certainty evidence), while no beneficial effect was shown at 90 days (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.9–2.44; very low certainty evidence); initial clinical cure was comparable (RR: 1.03, 95% CI: .94–1.14; low certainty evidence), no reduction in all-cause mortality was demonstrated (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.23–3.08; very low certainty evidence), and evidence for serious adverse events was very uncertain (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.35–1.29; very low certainty evidence). An ad hoc subgroup analysis separating patients with 1 prior CDI recurrence versus 2 or more found a sustained response at 30 days following end of therapy of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.01–1.49) for 1 prior recurrence and 2.0 (95% CI: .88–4.54) for 2 or more prior recurrences, with the latter based on data from 1 study judged at high risk of bias and a very small number randomized (n = 20).

Clinical definitions

We defined significant bacteriuria in women as two consecutive urine cultures with the same clinical isolate and in men as a single urine culture with a count of ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). AB was defined as the presence of significant bacteriuria without clinical manifestations. We considered symptomatic UTI any symptomatic episode (dysuria, frequency, bladder tenesmus, suprapubic pain and/or fever) plus a positive urine culture with ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL. Acute pyelonephritis was defined as fever, positive urine culture with ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL, with or without bacteremia, greater graft pain or urinary symptoms.

We considered bacteriological cure in the absence of the clinical isolate recovered from the urine culture prior to treatment. We defined MDR isolates as those resistant to at least one agent from three or more families of antibiotics.

RTRs requiring dialysis during the first week after RT were considered as cases with delayed graft function. We defined symptomatic UTI-related hospitalization as any episode of symptomatic UTI warranting hospital management or hospitalization for another reason along with simultaneous symptomatic UTI development.

Microbiological methods

The urine cultures were processed in the first hour after being obtained.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was a comparison of the mean number of symptomatic UTI or AB episodes per patient in both treatment groups during the first 7 weeks after RT. We chose the total number of episodes (new and recurrent) because recurrent episodes are associated with worse outcomes than single episodes.

Secondary outcomes were the time to the first symptomatic UTI or AB episode; the incidence of symptomatic UTI, AB, pyelonephritis, bacteremia, symptomatic UTI hospitalization, Clostridioides difficile infection and MDR bacterial infection. Safety outcomes were adverse events related to volume overload, hematological and gastrointestinal events, incidence of acute rejection, graft loss and death.

Sample size

The mean number of episodes per patient in the first 7 weeks after RT was 0.83 episodes/patient during the year prior to the study. With the hypothesis of a reduction to 0.40 episodes per patient in the experimental arm, using the comparison of means formula with a power of 80% and a type I error of 0.05, we calculated 40 subjects per treatment arm; assuming a 2% loss to follow-up, we estimated a total sample size of 82 subjects. An intermediate analysis to evaluate safety and efficacy was scheduled once half of the estimated sample size of patients was enrolled.

### Incidence and predictive biomarkers of Clostridioides difficile infection in hospitalized patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics [^49f2ee20]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) are considered the leading cause of infectious healthcare-related diarrhea worldwide and substantial costs have been attributed to its management –. Different medical interventions, including vaccines, probiotics, and agents neutralizing antibiotic residuals in the colon, are being developed to prevent CDI –. These interventions, however, require data from pivotal trials demonstrating clinical efficacy prior to approval by regulatory authorities. Given the relatively low incidence of CDI per individual patient in target populations, trials require large numbers of patients to demonstrate efficacy of a preventive measure. For example, a trial assessing the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of CDI included 2981 patients, assuming a 12-week incidence of 4%. As the incidence of CDI in the placebo group was only 1.2%, the trial failed to demonstrate efficacy, and would have required a more than threefold larger sample size to reach adequate power for a 50% reduction of CDI. The assumed incidence of the primary outcome is critical for successful execution of a trial and should be assessed in depth. Furthermore, the sample size can be reduced by enrichment of the RCT population with patients at a particularly high risk of CDI. Previous attempts to specify such a population identified advanced age, comorbidities, specific high-risk antibiotics (clindamycin, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, co-amoxiclav, carbapenems, and trimethoprim/sulfonamides), and previous colonization with C. difficile as potentially important predictive factors –. More recent findings suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota and their associated metabolites play an important role in the pathogenesis of CDI. Therefore, further assessment of these potential biomarkers is warranted.

Here, we demonstrate that the 90-day incidence of CDI and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in patients ≥ 50 years of age treated with predefined broad-spectrum antibiotic classes is 1.9% (95% CI: 1.1–3.0) and 14.1% (95% CI: 12.0–16.4), and that carbapenem treatment, toxigenic C. difficile carriage, and the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota predict CDI but not AAD.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) diagnosis — The diagnosis of CDI should include laboratory stool testing, and 2-step testing should be utilized to increase accuracy. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. Laboratory stool testing is the most accurate way to diagnose CDI, and 2-step testing is typically performed using 2 enzyme immunoassays highly sensitive for glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and highly specific for C difficile toxins (ie, antigen recognition), with assays that in general achieve a specificity and sensitivity of greater than 90%. In practice, a positive initial screening using highly sensitive GDH or NAAT testing is usually followed by a highly specific test for C difficile toxin; in places where 2-step testing or toxin-based testing is not available, NAAT alone may be used, but results should be interpreted in the context of risk factors and symptoms suggestive of CDI. Regardless of the specific study used, laboratory protocols recommend that only watery or loose stool samples (not swabs or formed stool) be sent, because patients with formed stool are unlikely to have CDI. Stool culture, although highly sensitive, does not differentiate between active infection and the presence of several nontoxigenic, nonpathogenic strains of Clostridioides that may grow in culture, and because stool cultures are also time consuming, they are impractical for clinical use in general. More than 30% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea is secondary to CDI, highlighting the importance of obtaining stool assays to evaluate for CDI.

### Critically ill health care-associated urinary tract infection: broad vs. narrow antibiotics in the emergency department have similar outcomes [^f37e1f8e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second most common infection requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission in emergency department (ED) patients. Optimal empiric management for health care-associated (HCA) UTI is unclear, particularly in the critically ill.

Objective

To compare clinical failure of broad vs. narrow antibiotic selection in the ED for patients presenting with HCA UTI admitted to the ICU.

Methods

Observational cohort of patients started on empiric antibiotic for UTI with at least one HCA risk factor (recurrent UTI, chronic urinary catheter or dialysis, urologic procedures, previous antibiotic exposure, hospitalization, or group facility residence). Broad antibiotics covered Pseudomonas spp. and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Clinical failure was a composite of multiorgan dysfunction (MODS) by day 2 and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of stay (LOS), readmission, recurrent infection, development of multidrug-resistant organisms, and Clostridium difficile infection. Associations were reported with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results

There were 272 patients included; 196 (72.1%) received broad and 76 (27.9%) received narrow therapy. There was no association between antibiotic selection and clinical failure (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.5–2.25, p = 0.89) or between antibiotic selection and number of HCA risk factors (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.73–1.31, p = 0.87). There was an association between clinical failure and MODS on ICU admission (OR 9.14, 95% CI 4.70–17.78, p < 0.001). Hospital LOS and readmission did not differ between antibiotic groups.

Conclusion

Initial empiric broad or narrow antibiotic coverage in HCA UTI patients who presented to the ED and required ICU admission had similar clinical outcomes.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^d0afc94b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Nonsevere Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial episode management includes the following and supporting evidence: "We recommend that oral vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 days be used to treat an initial episode of nonsevere CDI (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence)". "We recommend that oral fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days be used for an initial episode of nonsevere CDI (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)". "Oral metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 10 days may be considered for treatment of an initial nonsevere CDI in low-risk patients (strong recommendation/moderate quality of evidence)". In comparative trials, fidaxomicin showed similar clinical cure but lower recurrence than vancomycin: "cure rates with fidaxomicin (82.1%) were similar to vancomycin (88.6%). The rate of recurrence within 30 days, however, was significantly lower with fidaxomicin (13.0% vs 26.6%, P = 0.02)", and a second RCT found "no significant difference in clinical cure (76.2% vs 70.5%, P = 0.473), but lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin (8.3% vs 32.6%, P < 0.05)". A Veteran Administration analysis found "no statistically significant difference in the combined outcome of clinical failure or recurrence between 213 fidaxomicin treatment courses (31.9%) and 639 vancomycin treatment courses (25.5%)", with mortality "30-day (10.8% vs 11.7%), 90-day (22.5% vs 21.9%), and 180-day mortality rates (29.1% vs 29.1%)" similar. A Cochrane review concluded that "moderate quality evidence suggests that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole and fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin", while noting "The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost". For follow-on therapy, rifaximin trials used "400 mg t.i.d. for 20 days" with recurrence "decreased from 31% to 15%", and another trial used "400 mg t.i.d. for 14 days and then 200 mg t.i.d. for an additional 14 days" with recurrence "from 30% to 16% (P = 0.06)", but concerns include "30%–50% resistance rates", and the authors "do not currently recommend its routine use".

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) antimicrobial stewardship — evidence overview: fifteen quasi-experimental studies published between 1994 and 2013 were identified, with most considered moderate (n = 13) or low (n = 2) quality and no randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Predominant strategies were formulary restriction (n = 11) or prospective audit and feedback (n = 4), targeting fluoroquinolones (n = 7 studies), cephalosporins (n = 10), clindamycin (n = 5), amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate (n = 3), and others (n = 1 each), and many studies targeted more than one antibiotic (n = 6). Interventions decreased targeted antibiotic use by 50% to > 90% with a global decrease for all antibiotics in 5/9 studies, and CDI incidence rates decreased 33% to > 90% with post-intervention rates of 0.3–1.2 cases per 10 000 patient days. In patient-level analyses, use of multiple antibiotics (mean number of classes 1.8 vs 1.4 antibiotics) tended not to be an important risk factor in a prospective study (relative risk, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.23–1.81), while cumulative exposure showed adjusted hazard ratios 2.5 (95% CI, 1.6–4.0), 3.3 (95% CI, 2.2–5.2), and 9.6 (95% CI, 6.1–15.1) for 2, 3, or 4 or ≥ 5 antibiotics compared to 1.

### Outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use… [^58ba6dd3]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Anti–methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus antibiotics include vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin; anti–ceftriaxone-resistant gram-negative organism antibiotics include ceftazidime., cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, aztreonam, imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem; anti–vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus antibiotics include linezolid or daptomycin; and anti–extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing gram-negative organism antibiotics include carbapenems. Meaning In this study, broad-spectrum antibiotics were frequently administered to patients with community-onset sepsis without resistant organisms, and these therapies were associated with worse outcomes. Importance Broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for all patients with suspected sepsis to minimize the risk of undertreatment.

However, little is known regarding the net prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens across all patients with community-onset sepsis or the outcomes associated with unnecessarily broad empiric treatment. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, most patients with community-onset sepsis did not have resistant pathogens, yet broad-spectrum antibiotics were frequently administered. Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics were associated with higher mortality. These findings underscore the need for better tests to rapidly identify patients with resistant pathogens and for more judicious use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric sepsis treatment. We grouped P aeruginosa with other CTX-RO organisms because they share the need for treatment with β-lactams with anti-Pseudomonal coverage, which are an important class of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

More than two-thirds of patients received broad-spectrum therapy directed at resistant organisms, but MRSA was only isolated in 1 in 6 patients treated with vancomycin or linezolid, P aeruginosa or other ceftriaxone-resistant gram-negative organisms in 1 in 6 patients treated with anti-Pseudomonal agents, VRE in 1 in 16 patients treated with linezolid or daptomycin, and ESBLs in 1 in 70 patients treated with carbapenems. Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric therapy were associated with higher mortality after detailed risk adjustment.

Clinical Question

In adults and children prescribed antibiotics, is co-administration of a probiotic associated with a lower risk of symptomatic Clostridium difficile infection without an increase in adverse events?

Bottom Line

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with a lower risk of C difficile infection and very low-quality evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with fewer adverse events vs placebo or no treatment.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for an initial Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — summary of findings shows that for sustained response of CDI (follow-up: 4 weeks after EOT), the relative effect is 1.16 (1.09 to 1.24) with risk with vancomycin 631 per 1000 and risk difference with fidaxomicin 101 more per 1000 (57 more to 151 more); for CDI initial clinical cure (follow-up: 2 days after EOT), the relative effect is 1.00 (0.96 to 1.04) with risk with vancomycin 856 per 1000 and risk difference with fidaxomicin 4 fewer per 1000 (34 fewer to 30 more); for drug-related adverse events (follow-up: 4 to 12 weeks), the relative effect is 1.02 (0.76 to 1.36) with risk with vancomycin 95 per 1000 and risk difference with fidaxomicin 2 more per 1000 (23 fewer to 34 more); and for all-cause mortality (follow-up: 4 to 12 weeks), the relative effect is .90 (.66 to 1.23) with risk with vancomycin 87 per 1000 and risk difference with fidaxomicin 9 fewer per 1000 (30 fewer to 20 more).

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^4c09c0c8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to secondary prevention, ACG 2021 guidelines recommend to consider initiating long-term suppressive oral vancomycin to prevent further recurrences in patients with recurrent CDI ineligible for fecal microbiota transplantation, relapsed after fecal microbiota transplantation, or requiring ongoing or frequent courses of antibiotics.
