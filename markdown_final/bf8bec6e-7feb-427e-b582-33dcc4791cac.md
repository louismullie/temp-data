## Question

Nitrofurantoin dosage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about nitrofurantoin dosing across formulations, indications, special populations, and safety monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug formulations and their labeled dosing. Then, I should verify adult treatment regimens and durations. Next, I will review pediatric dosing and age restrictions. After that, I need to check prophylaxis dosing and duration. I will then examine renal function thresholds and pregnancy considerations. Finally, I should confirm administration instructions, adverse effects, and resistance stewardship, and close with a concise dosing summary that reconciles any discrepancies I might uncover along the way.

> Let me first confirm the formulations and their core dosing differences, because conflating macrocrystals with monohydrate/macrocrystals can lead to errors. Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals (Macrodantin) are dosed 50–100 mg four times daily for adults, whereas nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals (Macrobid) is an extended-release formulation dosed 100 mg twice daily for adults, and both should be taken with food to improve absorption and tolerance [^1169DDfk] [^111uW4bP] [^113YdfCi].

> Wait, let me verify adult treatment duration next, because I initially thought both formulations were uniformly 7 days; I need to check guideline-concordant durations. For uncomplicated cystitis, contemporary guidelines endorse nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg twice daily for 5 days, which has randomized trial support showing superior clinical and microbiologic resolution versus single-dose fosfomycin, whereas older labels sometimes describe 7 days; for macrocrystals, 50–100 mg four times daily for 7 days remains standard, so I should correct my earlier assumption that both are 7 days [^115GiqJ8] [^116hPLMo] [^1122cGCL] [^1169DDfk].

> I should confirm pediatric treatment dosing and age limits before moving on. For children aged 1 month and older, nitrofurantoin macrocrystals or suspension is dosed at 5–7 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours for 7 days, and it is contraindicated in infants under 1 month due to hemolytic anemia risk from immature erythrocyte enzyme systems; I need to ensure I state the age cutoff correctly as ≥ 1 month, not ≥ 12 years, which applies to a different formulation [^116bc8df] [^113E3pWc] [^114vNCKw].

> Hold on, I should verify the adolescent and older pediatric dosing for the extended-release product, because I recall a 12-year threshold. For patients older than 12 years, nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals can be used at 100 mg twice daily for 7 days, aligning with the adult regimen, which is distinct from the four-times-daily macrocrystal dosing used in younger children [^116PYSoS] [^111uW4bP].

> Next, I will examine prophylaxis dosing, and I need to be careful to separate adult from pediatric regimens. For adults with recurrent UTIs, continuous prophylaxis with nitrofurantoin 50–100 mg at bedtime is recommended, with 50 mg favored for better tolerability and similar effectiveness in observational data; for children, 1 mg/kg once daily or divided twice daily is used, and I should confirm that these suppressive doses are lower than treatment doses to minimize toxicity [^113a5pGG] [^113a5pGG] [^11183vng].

> I should double-check renal function thresholds, because this is a frequent source of confusion. Initially, I thought nitrofurantoin was contraindicated if CrCl is below 60 mL/min; wait, let me verify the current consensus. Updated guidance supports use when CrCl is greater than 30 mL/min, with avoidance below 30 mL/min due to reduced urinary concentrations and potential treatment failure; the historical 60 mL/min cutoff has been relaxed in contemporary reviews and geriatric guidance [^111xvQ1V] [^1156R7yV].

> Let me consider pregnancy next, and I need to ensure trimester-specific nuance. Nitrofurantoin is considered acceptable in the second and third trimesters for treatment and prophylaxis of lower UTIs, and use in the first trimester may be appropriate when alternatives are unsuitable; it should be avoided at term, during labor, or when labor is imminent due to neonatal hemolytic anemia risk, so I should explicitly state those timing restrictions [^1143tTfT] [^114vNCKw].

> I will now examine administration instructions and drug–drug interactions to avoid practical pitfalls. All nitrofurantoin formulations should be taken with food to enhance absorption and reduce GI upset, and antacids containing magnesium trisilicate can reduce absorption and should be separated in time; I should also remind myself to counsel on adherence to prevent subtherapeutic exposures that could foster resistance [^1169DDfk] [^115J855Z] [^112Lnoia].

> Next, I should review adverse effects and monitoring, and I need to ensure I balance common versus serious risks. Common effects include nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, which are dose-related and can be mitigated by dose reduction; serious but rare risks include pulmonary fibrosis, hepatotoxicity, and peripheral neuropathy, with risk rising with prolonged therapy, so shared decision-making and periodic reassessment are essential, especially during prophylaxis beyond 6–12 months [^112NjwPM] [^115Dpmh9] [^112X6s8H].

> But wait, what about resistance and stewardship; I should confirm that nitrofurantoin remains durable despite increased use. Nitrofurantoin achieves very high urinary concentrations with low systemic exposure, limiting off-target selection and preserving activity; nonetheless, adherence is critical because subinhibitory levels can select stepwise resistance, and prophylaxis can modestly increase resistance in surveillance isolates, so I need to emphasize culture-directed therapy when appropriate and reassess prophylaxis periodically [^1152xuRi] [^112Lnoia] [^115EfgMh].

> Let me synthesize a concise, formulation-specific dosing summary, and I should double-check that each line aligns with the references above. Adults with uncomplicated cystitis: macrocrystals 50–100 mg four times daily for 7 days, or monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg twice daily for 5 days; pediatric patients ≥ 1 month: 5–7 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours for 7 days; adults for prophylaxis: 50–100 mg at bedtime, preferably 50 mg; pediatric prophylaxis: 1 mg/kg once daily or divided twice daily; avoid use if CrCl < 30 mL/min; use with food and separate magnesium-containing antacids [^1169DDfk] [^112wNT3N] [^113a5pGG] [^11183vng] [^111xvQ1V] [^115J855Z].

> Finally, I should confirm that my duration recommendations are consistent with high-quality guidance and correct my earlier overgeneralization. The 5-day nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals regimen is supported by randomized data and contemporary guidelines, whereas macrocrystals remain labeled for 7 days; both are acceptable, but 5 days is preferred for adherence and stewardship when using the extended-release product, and I need to ensure I communicate that nuance clearly [^115GiqJ8] [^116hPLMo] [^1122cGCL] [^1169DDfk].

Nitrofurantoin dosing is **formulation-specific** and **indication-dependent**: for acute uncomplicated cystitis, use 100 mg PO BID for 5 days (Macrobid) [^111jYuyU] or 50–100 mg PO QID for 7 days (Macrodantin) [^1169DDfk]; for prophylaxis, use 50–100 mg PO QHS [^1158DyhN]. Pediatric dosing is **5–7 mg/kg/day divided QID** for treatment [^113E3pWc] and 1 mg/kg/day for prophylaxis [^11183vng]. Always give with food [^1169DDfk], avoid if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^111xvQ1V], and monitor for pulmonary, hepatic, and hematologic adverse effects with prolonged use [^112NjwPM] [^115J855Z].

### Insights into durability against resistance from the antibiotic nitrofurantoin [^1152xuRi]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

Properties of nitrofurantoin contributing to its durability against resistance

Rapid achievement of therapeutic concentrations specific to the site of infection

The favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of nitrofurantoin treatment likely aid the suppression of resistance evolution –, as resistance has been experimentally demonstrated to evolve faster at low concentrations. High therapeutic concentrations of nitrofurantoin are rapidly achieved, and specific to the site of infection in the urinary tract. After oral administration, nitrofurantoin is rapidly excreted unchanged in the urine, achieving concentrations of over 200 μg/ml 3 — well above the mutant prevention concentration of 64 μg/ml. This allows nitrofurantoin to effectively kill bacteria in the urinary tract before the emergence of de novo-resistant mutants. Exploiting collateral sensitivity could further enhance killing, as mutants resistant to several antibiotics have increased susceptibility to nitrofurantoin. In contrast, antibiotics that do not rapidly achieve high localised concentrations at the site of infection are more vulnerable to the development of resistance, as susceptible strains can proliferate and accumulate resistance mutations before the antibiotic reaches inhibitory concentrations. The rapid increase in concentrations impedes evolution particularly well when clinical resistance to a drug requires stepwise accumulation of multiple mutations — as is the case for nitrofurantoin.

Low off-target concentrations

Nitrofurantoin rapidly achieves therapeutic concentrations at the site of infection (i.e. the bladder), with low off-target concentrations. While it achieves concentrations of over 200 μg/ml in urine, concentrations in other bodily fluids are much lower; for example, typical plasma levels are less than 1 μg/ml, which is below the concentration needed to select for antimicrobial resistance mutations. Nitrofurantoin is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine, with only 2% of the dose recovered in faeces in a rat model. This low concentration in the gut reduces the selection pressure for resistance within the microbiome, which can otherwise serve as a reservoir for resistant strains. As a result, nitrofurantoin-resistant organisms are only rarely isolated from faeces. Nitrofurantoin also does not cause dysbiosis of the normal intestinal microbiome, a state that can result in increased colonisation by pathogenic organisms.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^111xvQ1V]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Patient considerations for selection of antimicrobial agent — renal function and nitrofurantoin use: Normal aging is associated with decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate and creatinine clearance, which impacts renally cleared drugs, and patients with decreased glomerular filtration rate are more likely to experience treatment failure. Nitrofurantoin is ineffective in patients with a CrCl of less than 30 mL/min, though updated guidelines support its use when CrCl is < 60 mL/min but > 30 mL/min; the American Geriatrics Society 2015 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel decreased the CrCl threshold for nitrofurantoin from 60 to 30 mL/min based on 2 retrospective studies. Although more than 25% of individuals at least 65 years old have an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min, changes in microbial agent or dose based on age alone are not recommended, and prescribers should be familiar with antibiotic clearance and renal dosing recommendations.

### Nitrofurantoin vs other prophylactic agents in reducing recurrent urinary tract infections in adult women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112iPqfE]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical and financial burden from bladder infections is significant. Daily antibiotic use is the recommended strategy for recurrent urinary tract infection prevention. Increasing antibiotic resistance rates, however, require immediate identification of innovative alternative prophylactic therapies. This systematic review aims to provide guidance on gaps in evidence to guide future research.

Objective

The objective of this review was to provide current pooled estimates of randomized control trials comparing the effects of nitrofurantoin vs other agents in reducing recurrent urinary tract infections in adult, nonpregnant women and assess relative adverse side effects.

Data Sources

Data sources included the following: MEDLINE, Jan. 1, 1946, to Jan. 31, 2015; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and web sites of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, and the National Guideline Clearinghouse from 2000 to 2015. Randomized control trials of women with recurrent urinary tract infections comparing nitrofurantoin with any other treatment were included.

Study Design

A protocol for the study was developed a priori. Published guidance was followed for assessment of study quality. All meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models with Stats Direct Software. Dual review was used for all decisions and data abstraction.

Results

Twelve randomized control trials involving 1063 patients were included. One study that had a serious flaw was rated poor in quality, one study rated good, and the remainder fair. No significant differences in prophylactic antibiotic treatment with nitrofurantoin and norfloxacin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, methamine hippurate, estriol, or cefaclor were found in clinical or microbiological cure in adult nonpregnant women with recurrent urinary tract infections (9 randomized control trials, 673 patients, relative risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–1.27; I², 65%; and 12 randomized control trials, 1063 patients, relative risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.26; I², 76%, respectively). Duration of prophylaxis also did not have a significant impact on outcomes. There was a statistically significant difference in overall adverse effects, with nitrofurantoin resulting in greater risk than other prophylactic treatments (10 randomized control trials, 948 patients, relative risk ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–3.50; I², 61%). Overall, the majority of nitrofurantoin adverse effects were gastrointestinal, with a significant difference for withdrawals (12 randomized control trials, 1063 patients, relative risk ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–3.56; I², 8%).

Conclusion

Nitrofurantoin had similar efficacy but a greater risk of adverse events than other prophylactic treatments. Balancing the risks of adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, with potential benefits of decreasing collateral ecological damage should be considered if selecting nitrofurantoin.

### Nitrofurantoin's efficacy and safety as prophylaxis for urinary tract infections: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of controlled trials [^112jTMuX]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Nitrofurantoin has been used for the prevention of urinary tract infection (UTI) for over 60 years. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess its efficacy and safety in the prophylaxis of UTI.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of all controlled trials in humans assessing nitrofurantoin for UTI prophylaxis published from 1946 to 2015. We further reviewed population-level cohort studies evaluating nitrofurantoin's toxicity. Meta-analyses assessing efficacy and adverse events were conducted on controlled trials.

Results

Twenty-six controlled trials including 3052 patients fulfilled entry criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis on efficacy and toxicity, and 16 population-level cohort studies were identified for review of toxicity. Overall quality was poor, with all studies at increased risk for various biases. When compared with no prophylaxis, nitrofurantoin is effective in the prevention of UTI (risk ratio 0.38 in favour of nitrofurantoin, 95% CI 0.30–0.48). Its prophylactic efficacy is superior to that of methenamine hippurate and comparable to that of other antibacterials. Compared with patients receiving other antibacterials, those receiving nitrofurantoin had an increased risk of 2.24 (95% CI 1.77–2.83) for a non-severe adverse effect. In all controlled trials, only one patient experienced a severe adverse effect (interstitial pneumonia). Cohort studies reported severe adverse effect frequencies of 0.02–1.5 per 1000 nitrofurantoin users.

Conclusions

Nitrofurantoin is effective in the prevention of UTI. Its use may be associated with increased non-severe adverse effects; severe adverse effects occur infrequently. The risk of severe toxicity seems to increase with the duration of nitrofurantoin prophylaxis.

### Nitrofurantoin 100 mg versus 50 mg prophylaxis for urinary tract infections, a cohort study [^113a5pGG]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Guidelines do not distinguish between 50 mg or 100 mg nitrofurantoin as daily prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), although 50 mg might have a better safety profile. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness and safety of both regimens.

Methods

Data were retrospectively collected from 84 Dutch GP practices between 2013 and 2020. Nitrofurantoin prescriptions of 100 mg and 50 mg every 24 hours in women were included. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios on first episode of UTI, pyelonephritis and (adverse) events. Patients were followed for the duration of consecutive repeated prescriptions, assuming non-informative right censoring, up to 1 year.

Results

Nitrofurantoin prophylaxis was prescribed in 1893 patients. Median lengths of follow up were 90 days (interquartile range (IQR) 37–179 days) for 100 mg (n = 551) and 90 days (IQR 30–146 days) for 50 mg (n = 1342) with few differences in baseline characteristics between populations. Under 100 mg and 50 mg, 82/551 (14.9%) and 199/1342 (14.8%) developed UTI and 46/551 (8.3%) and 81/1342 (6.0%) developed pyelonephritis, respectively. Adjusted HRs of 100 mg versus 50 mg were 1.01 (95% CI 0.78–1.30) on first UTI, 1.37 (95% CI 0.95–1.98) on first pyelonephritis episode, 1.82 (95% CI 1.20–2.74) on first consultation for cough, 2.68 for dyspnoea (95% CI 1.11–6.45) and 2.43 for nausea (95% CI 1.03–5.74).

Conclusion

Daily prophylaxis for recurrent UTI with 100 mg instead of 50 mg nitrofurantoin was associated with an equivalent hazard on UTI or pyelonephritis, and a higher hazard on cough, dyspnoea and nausea. We recommend 50 mg nitrofurantoin as daily prophylaxis.

### Effect of 5-day nitrofurantoin vs single-dose fosfomycin on clinical resolution of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women: a randomized clinical trial [^115GiqJ8]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The use of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin has increased since guidelines began recommending them as first-line therapy for lower urinary tract infection (UTI).

Objective

To compare the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin in women with uncomplicated cystitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multinational, open-label, analyst-blinded, randomized clinical trial including 513 nonpregnant women aged 18 years and older with symptoms of lower UTI (dysuria, urgency, frequency, or suprapubic tenderness), a positive urine dipstick result (with detection of nitrites or leukocyte esterase), and no known colonization or previous infection with uropathogens resistant to the study antibiotics. Recruitment took place from October 2013 through April 2017 at hospital units and outpatient clinics in Geneva, Switzerland; Lodz, Poland; and Petah-Tiqva, Israel.

Interventions

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to oral nitrofurantoin, 100 mg 3 times a day for 5 days (n = 255), or a single 3-g dose of oral fosfomycin (n = 258). They returned 14 and 28 days after therapy completion for clinical evaluation and urine culture collection.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was clinical response in the 28 days following therapy completion, defined as clinical resolution (complete resolution of symptoms and signs of UTI without prior failure), failure (need for additional or change in antibiotic treatment due to UTI or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy), or indeterminate (persistence of symptoms without objective evidence of infection). Secondary outcomes included bacteriologic response and incidence of adverse events.

Results

Among 513 patients who were randomized (median age, 44 years [interquartile range, 31–64]), 475 (93%) completed the trial and 377 (73%) had a confirmed positive baseline culture. Clinical resolution through day 28 was achieved in 171 of 244 patients (70%) receiving nitrofurantoin vs 139 of 241 patients (58%) receiving fosfomycin (difference, 12% [95% CI, 4%-21%]; p = 0.004). Microbiologic resolution occurred in 129 of 175 (74%) vs 103 of 163 (63%), respectively (difference, 11% [95% CI, 1%-20%]; p = 0.04). Adverse events were few and primarily gastrointestinal; the most common were nausea and diarrhea (7/248 [3%] and 3/248 [1%] in the nitrofurantoin group vs 5/247 [2%] and 5/247 [1%] in the fosfomycin group, respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among women with uncomplicated UTI, 5-day nitrofurantoin, compared with single-dose fosfomycin, resulted in a significantly greater likelihood of clinical and microbiologic resolution at 28 days after therapy completion.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^114R1CdB]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Short-course therapy for uncomplicated acute UTI — Three-day regimens of TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones have comparable effectiveness with 79%–100% and 85%–98% cure rates and are widely accepted when there are no complicating factors. These regimens are as effective for symptomatic relief as longer 5- to 10-day regimens and have improved compliance, decreased costs, and lower adverse reaction rates. The efficacy of 5 days of nitrofurantoin is comparable to 3 days of TMP-SMX, and five days of nitrofurantoin has better efficacy than a 3-day regimen.

OVERDOSAGE

Occasional incidents of acute overdosage of Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals have not resulted in any specific symptoms other than vomiting. Induction of emesis is recommended. There is no specific antidote, but a high fluid intake should be maintained to promote urinary excretion of the drug. It is dialyzable.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals should be given with food to improve drug absorption and, in some patients, tolerance.

Adults: 50–100 mg four times a day — the lower dosage level is recommended for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Pediatric Patients: 5–7 mg/kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses (contraindicated under one month of age).

Therapy should be continued for one week or for at least 3 days after sterility of the urine is obtained. Continued infection indicates the need for reevaluation.

For long-term suppressive therapy in adults, a reduction of dosage to 50–100 mg at bedtime may be adequate. For long-term suppressive therapy in pediatric patients, doses as low as 1 mg/kg per 24 hours, given in a single dose or in two divided doses, may be adequate.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals is specifically indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections when due to susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and certain susceptible strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter species.

Nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals and other antibacterial drugs, Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients who are treated with Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals are predisposed to persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals, other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected. In considering the use of Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals, lower eradication rates should be balanced against the increased potential for systemic toxicity and for the development of antimicrobial resistance when agents with broader tissue distribution are utilized.

### Insights into durability against resistance from the antibiotic nitrofurantoin [^112Lnoia]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

Insights into factors promoting nitrofurantoin resistance

Despite many properties favouring its durability against resistance evolution, nitrofurantoin resistance does emerge in both experimental and clinical contexts. Insight into how and why nitrofurantoin resistance does emerge can help ensure its continued efficacy.

While full nitrofurantoin resistance imposes a fitness cost in the absence of the drug, the acquisition of an initial inactivating mutation in nfsA or nfsB can be selectively advantageous at sub-inhibitory nitrofurantoin concentrations, even without significantly changing the MIC. Intriguingly, when resistance has been observed to arise in vitro, mutations tended to arise first in nfsA, followed by mutations in nfsB, due to the larger fitness benefits conferred by loss of nfsA under sub-inhibitory concentrations.

Treatment noncompliance could play a significant role in contributing to nitrofurantoin resistance. As subinhibitory nitrofurantoin concentrations can facilitate resistance, non-adherence with treatment regimens could allow these first-step mutants to proliferate and acquire second-step mutations. Ensuring consistent nitrofurantoin levels through full adherence is crucial to preventing the development of resistance. A patient-focused intervention emphasising the importance of adherence could help preserve the efficacy of nitrofurantoin, benefiting both the individual patient and the broader community by reducing the risk of resistance development and maintaining effective treatment options.

The use of antibiotics as prophylactics is a potential risk factor for increasing the prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Prophylactic use can expose bacteria to sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotics, promoting the selection and spread of resistant strains. Existing evidence suggests the risk of nitrofurantoin resistance developing during prophylaxis is relatively low. A meta-analysis of controlled trials has shown that rates of nitrofurantoin resistance reported during trials were low. In one study, nitrofurantoin prophylaxis did not increase resistance in children with urinary tract abnormalities. However, a second study observed that E. coli was often replaced by resistant Klebsiella spp. and (intrinsically) resistant Pseudomonas spp. Low-dose prophylaxis in adult women has generally shown low resistance rates, although one study found nitrofurantoin prophylaxis increased resistance frequency relative to control (24% vs. 9%). Generally, nitrofurantoin had lower resistance rates than alternative antibiotics –. While current evidence suggests prophylaxis poses a low risk for nitrofurantoin resistance, continued surveillance is recommended, given the emergence of new resistance mechanisms.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117RCSCu]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

First-line antimicrobial agents — IDSA-aligned options and nitrofurantoin regimen: In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for premenopausal women, 3 first-line antibiotics for UTI treatment are recommended — nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and fosfomycin — and recommendations are extrapolated for rUTI, older women, and women with urogynecologic disorders. Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and therapeutically active only in the lower urinary tract; it is effective against E. coli and many gram-negative species with low levels of resistance but is ineffective against some Proteus species and some strains of Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The duration of treatment is typically 7 to 10 days; a meta-analysis of women ranging from 12 to 70 years old concluded that 5-day regimens are as effective (not necessarily generalizable to women with rUTI), and the 2010 "International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women" recommends a 5-day regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and most gram-negative bacteria.

The evidence regarding an association between the nitrofuran and sulfonamide classes of antibiotics and birth defects is mixed. As with all patients, antibiotics should be prescribed for pregnant women only for appropriate indications and for the shortest effective duration. During the second and third trimesters, sulfonamides and nitrofurantoins may continue to be used as first-line agents for the treatment and prevention of urinary tract infections and other infections caused by susceptible organisms. Prescribing sulfonamides or nitrofurantoin in the first trimester is still considered appropriate when no other suitable alternative antibiotics are available. Pregnant women should not be denied appropriate treatment for infections because untreated infections can commonly lead to serious maternal and fetal complications.

### Insights into durability against resistance from the antibiotic nitrofurantoin [^111EJquY]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

Today nitrofurantoin is one of the most prescribed treatments for UTIs. Nitrofurantoin is included on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, and its empirical use is encouraged through inclusion in the Access group of The WHO AWaRe antibiotic book. In 2016, English prescribing guidelines switched from trimethoprim to nitrofurantoin as the first-choice antibiotic for the treatment of lower urinary tract infections in the community context. Prescription data in England shows a steady rise in nitrofurantoin prescription, climbing from 35.3% in 2016 to 73.1% in 2023, coupled with a reduction in trimethoprim use (Fig. 1A). In real terms, the average number of nitrofurantoin prescriptions effectively doubled between 2015 and 2020 (2.1 vs. 4.2 million prescriptions/year), remaining relatively constant since. Over the same period, there has been a slow but steady decline in the frequency of E. coli isolates with trimethoprim resistance without a corresponding increase in nitrofurantoin resistance, which has hovered around 2.5% for E. coli and coliform isolates sampled from community populations (Fig. 1B). A statistical model relating resistance to antibiotic, date and their interaction is a good fit to the data (overall fit of linear regression: adjusted R² = 0.98, F₃,₆₈ = 1307, p < 0.0001). There is only a significant relationship with date for trimethoprim resistance (interaction effect = −1.8 × 10⁻⁵ ± 0.37 × 10⁻⁵ S.E. t₁ = −4.9, p < 0.00001).

Dosing and duration of prophylactic antibiotics — women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) most commonly receive daily dosing; fosfomycin used prophylactically is dosed every 10 days. Intermittent versus daily prophylaxis showed no difference in risk of ≥ 1 UTI (2 studies; RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.50, I² = 0%); in individual trials, single-dose exposures versus daily antibiotics had RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.51, and single-dose ciprofloxacin after sexual intercourse versus daily dosing had RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.29 to 5.32. Reported prophylaxis duration ranged from 6 to 12 months, while in practice it can be from three to six months to one year with periodic assessment, and continuing prophylaxis for years is not evidence-based. Continuous prophylaxis dosing options include: TMP 100 mg once daily; TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg once daily; TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg thrice weekly; Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 50 mg daily; Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg daily; Cephalexin 125 mg once daily; Cephalexin 250 mg once daily; Fosfomycin 3 g every 10 days.

Procedures

For participants assigned to antibiotic prophylaxis, the drug used was chosen from nitrofurantoin (50 or 100 mg), trimethoprim (100 mg), or cefalexin (250 mg) given orally once daily, depending on previous urine culture results and individuals' history of allergy or intolerance. Methenamine hippurate was prescribed as a twice daily oral dose (1 g). Participants were allowed to switch between antibiotic drugs or between treatment strategies, however, the need to adhere to the allocated intervention was emphasised. Participants experiencing symptomatic UTI episodes were advised to seek discrete treatment courses of antibiotics in their usual way, typically via their general practitioner.

Follow-up assessments took place every three months until month 18. At each visit, participants were asked about the occurrence of any UTIs, treatment adherence, and adverse events. Information on UTI episodes was confirmed where necessary from healthcare records. Blood samples were taken to monitor kidney and liver function in all participants. Urine samples were submitted to the central laboratory at baseline, at scheduled three monthly visits and at the time of UTI episodes. Optional perineal swabs were submitted at baseline and at six monthly routine visits. Participants completed symptom questionnaires every three months and at the time of symptomatic UTI.

### Nitrofurantoin: friend or foe? [^114NPFb7]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Nitrofurantoin remains the gold standard treatment of uncomplicated cystitis as well as prophylactic treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections. Drug-induced hepatotoxicity presents in acute (3 in 1 000 000) and chronic (1 in 1500) forms. We present a patient with acute liver failure after 5 days of treatment. A 69-year-old man admitted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation 5days into treatment for cystitis with nitrofurantoin. On admission he was noted to be jaundiced with elevated liver enzymes and normal international normalised ratio. Investigation for infectious, autoimmune and cholestatic causes of hepatotoxicity was negative. The patient improved after discontinuation of the drug and 10 days of methylprednisolone. There are scant data on acute liver failure in the setting of short-term nitrofurantoin administration. The mechanism of toxicity remains unclear, but is hypothesised to be an autoimmune process in which steroids may play a role in treatment. Diagnosis is one of exclusion as the only definitive method of diagnosis is rechallenge.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — nitrofurantoin safety and monitoring are characterized by rare but potentially serious pulmonary and hepatic toxicity, with "The rate of possible serious pulmonary or hepatic adverse events has been reported to be 0.01% and 0.0003%, respectively", and a review reporting "no pulmonary or hepatotoxic events related to nitrofurantoin among 4,807 patients from 27 controlled trials". Observational data noted "0.7% of patients experienced possible serious pulmonary or hepatic adverse effects, and 0.15% (5/3,400 patients) were highly suspicious for having a serious lung or liver reaction". In older adults, the Beers Criteria "has been modified to recommend avoidance of nitrofurantoin when creatinine clearance is below 30 mL/min". Pulmonary reactions can present early or late, as "Acute pulmonary reactions appear after a mean of nine days" and subacute/chronic reactions "develop between one and six months of treatment", and chronic respiratory disease risk increases with prolonged exposure: "47% of cases of chronic respiratory disease occurred after more than 12 months of nitrofurantoin therapy". The guideline emphasizes that "Risk assessment, shared decision-making, and clinical monitoring is important to avoid the potential adverse events associated with nitrofurantoin".

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^115hPck2]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

A strength of our study was that we used routinely collected dispensing data from a majority of community pharmacies in the Netherlands, which enabled us to follow nearly 250 000 female users of guideline recommended antibiotics for uncomplicated UTI for 5 years. In the Netherlands all antibiotics for UTI treatment are only available through prescription and 90% of patients visit the same pharmacy. Because of this the medication was almost completely covered by the database. Another strength is that, although we lacked the reason for prescribing, uncomplicated UTI is the only indication for nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin and trimethoprim in the electronic GP prescription module. On the other hand, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim may also be used for UTI prophylaxis at different dosages and durations of use. In our study, only dispensings for women with a guideline recommended dosage and duration were counted as recurring dispensings. By doing so, we also excluded slightly different dosage regimens for pregnant women and other risk groups (for instance, diabetes comorbidity).

A limitation in our study was that women were coded within the community pharmacies and could not be followed for dispensing from another pharmacy. Therefore we included only those women who still had any dispensing within the same pharmacy at follow-up after 5 years. This, however, led to the exclusion of almost half of all women with a first dispensing in 2012. The youngest and oldest age groups were relatively more present in those women that could not be followed until the end of the study (Table 1). This may be due to moving or death. Statline, the National Statistics Database in the Netherlands provided yearly data on the proportions of people moving within municipalities and entering other municipalities per 1000 inhabitants, and the relative number of deceased. From these data 43% of the population moved within a municipality or into another municipality or died between 2012 and 2017. This proportion is comparable to the 48% lost to follow up in our study. Therefore, we conclude that the loss of follow-up is not related to our research question and thus is not likely to create bias to our results on the prevalence of recurring UTI dispensing in women.

Another limitation was that we did not analyse what proportion of the source population had recurrent UTI. We did not do this because our aim was to analyse recurrence of UTI in all women over a 5-year period.

We also may have missed some recurring dispensing in women who incidentally visited another pharmacy for out-of-hours services. This would lead to under-estimation of the proportion of women with recurring dispensing.

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^111zxeUU]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Data collection

We retrieved annual information on recurring dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin and trimethoprim. Nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim can be used in different dosages and treatment durations, as well as for UTI prophylaxis. The Dutch GP UTI guideline, recommends for an uncomplicated UTI treatment, first nitrofurantoin (ATC code: J01XE01) as a dose of 200 mg/day for 5 days, either 100 mg in a controlled release tablet twice daily for 5 days or 50 mg in a regular tablet four times per day, second, fosfomycin (J01XX01) as a one-off dose of 3 g, and third, trimethoprim (J01EA01) as a dose of 300 mg once daily for 3 days.

Data analysis

The number of women with dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin and trimethoprim in each year of follow-up was divided by the total number of included women with a first dispensing in 2012. The number of women with dispensing in 2012 and in the follow-up years was stratified for age categories. We used descriptive statistics to analyse the data with SPSS 23.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL).

### Oral gepotidacin versus nitrofurantoin in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection (EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3): two randomised, controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3, non-inferiority trials [^112NGYiE]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Gepotidacin is a novel, bactericidal, first-in-class triazaacenaphthylene antibiotic that inhibits bacterial DNA replication by a distinct mechanism of action and a unique binding site, providing well balanced inhibition of two type II topoisomerase enzymes. Oral gepotidacin is under investigation to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of oral gepotidacin with that of nitrofurantoin in adolescent and adult female individuals with uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Methods

EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 were phase 3, randomised, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority (10% margin) trials, in which patients were enrolled at 219 centres worldwide. Patients assigned female at birth, non-pregnant, aged 12 years or older, weighing 40 kg or more, with two or more symptoms of dysuria, frequency, urgency, or lower abdominal pain, and with evidence of urinary nitrite, pyuria, or both were eligible for inclusion. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally by interactive response technology to receive oral gepotidacin (1500 mg twice daily for 5 days) or oral nitrofurantoin (100 mg twice daily for 5 days), with randomisation stratified by age category and history of recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Patients, investigators, and the sponsor study team were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint, therapeutic response (success or failure) at test-of-cure (ie, day 10–13), was evaluated in randomly assigned patients with nitrofurantoin-susceptible qualifying uropathogens (≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU] per mL) and who received at least one dose of study treatment. Conforming to regulatory guidance, therapeutic success was defined as combined clinical success (ie, complete symptom resolution) and microbiological success (ie, reduction of qualifying uropathogens to < 10³ CFU/mL) without other systemic antimicrobial use. Safety analyses included patients who were randomly assigned and who received at least one dose of study treatment. The trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04020341 (EAGLE-2) and NCT04187144 (EAGLE-3), and are completed.

Findings

Studies were undertaken from Oct 17, 2019, to Nov 30, 2022 (EAGLE-2), and from April 23, 2020, to Dec 1, 2022 (EAGLE-3). 1680 patients in EAGLE-2 and 1731 patients in EAGLE-3 were screened for eligibility, of whom 1531 and 1605 were randomly assigned, respectively (767 in the gepotidacin group and 764 in the nitrofurantoin group in EAGLE-2, and 805 in the gepotidacin group and 800 in the nitrofurantoin group in EAGLE-3). After an interim analysis, which was prospectively agreed as a protocol amendment, both studies were stopped for efficacy. Thus, the primary analysis population included only patients who, at the time of the interim analysis data cutoff, had the opportunity to reach the test-of-cure visit or were known to not have attained therapeutic success before the test-of-cure visit. In EAGLE-2, 162 (50.6%) of 320 patients assigned gepotidacin and 135 (47.0%) of 287 patients assigned nitrofurantoin had therapeutic success (adjusted difference 4.3%, 95% CI -3.6 to 12.1). In EAGLE-3, 162 (58.5%) of 277 patients assigned gepotidacin and 115 (43.6%) of 264 patients assigned nitrofurantoin had therapeutic success (adjusted difference 14.6%, 95% CI 6.4 to 22.8). Gepotidacin was non-inferior to nitrofurantoin in both studies and superior to nitrofurantoin in EAGLE-3. The most common adverse event with gepotidacin was diarrhoea (observed in 111 [14%] of 766 patients in EAGLE-2 and in 147 [18%] of 804 patients in EAGLE-3), whereas the most common adverse event with nitrofurantoin was nausea (in 29 [4%] of 760 patients in EAGLE-2 and in 35 [4%] of 798 patients in EAGLE-3). Cases were mostly mild or moderate. No life-threatening or fatal events occurred.

Interpretation

Gepotidacin is an efficacious oral antibiotic with acceptable safety and tolerability profiles. As a first-in-class investigational oral antibiotic with activity against common uropathogens, including clinically important drug-resistant phenotypes, gepotidacin has the potential to offer substantial benefit to patients.

### Urinary tract infections: diagnosis and management in the emergency department [^116BApmD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

With the emergence of increasing resistance to common antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), including ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the choice of antibiotics for these infections has become more challenging. In this article, the authors review the evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of cystitis and pyelonephritis in the emergency department. They review the pathophysiology and describe the initial diagnostic workup, spending some time discussing the urine dipstick. The authors discuss whether hospital antibiograms are useful in making the initial antibiotic choice. The treatment section reviews the current recommendations and also highlights the use of nitrofurantoin in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. The authors also discuss the appropriate use of ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX in the treatment of UTIs.

### Nitrofurantoin contraindication in patients with a creatinine clearance below 60 mL / min: looking for the evidence [^1156R7yV]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the evidence leading to nitrofurantoin contraindication in patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 60 mL/min.

Data Sources

Literature was searched in PubMed (1965-June 2012) by using the key words and MeSH terms urinary tract infections-drug therapy, chronic kidney insufficiency, kidney diseases, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy, combined with nitrofurantoin. Articles were limited to the English language. References from the identified studies, Food and Drug Administration-approved product information packets, drug information resources, and pharmacology books were also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

The contraindication of nitrofurantoin in patients with a CrCl below 60 mL/min was included in the product information packets sometime between 1988 and 2003. The 1988 Macrodantin product information indicated a CrCl cutoff level of 40 mL/min, but the current contraindication of less than 60 mL/min is found in the 2003 Macrobid product information. It is unclear when and why this change occurred, but it may have followed the work of Sachs and colleagues in 1968, who reported very little drug recovery in the urine of patients with a CrCl below 60 mL/min. This and previous studies have several and severe limitations, such as the inclusion of a small number of patients, an undefined or poorly defined method to determine CrCl and renal impairment, measurement of amounts of nitrofurantoin excreted in the urine instead of urinary concentrations, and most importantly, a lack of clinical efficacy end points. More recently, a chart review on clinical cure of urinary tract infections treated with nitrofurantoin provided grounds for further investigations on the utility of this drug for patients with a CrCl of 60 mL/min or lower. Concerns of increased risks of serious adverse reactions in patients with reduced renal function have further limited the use of nitrofurantoin. However, although not completely clear, these complications seem to be linked most often to prolonged treatment, genetic variability, and predisposition to hypersensitivity.

Conclusions

Data supporting the contraindication of nitrofurantoin for patients with a CrCl less than 60 mL/min are nonexistent. Well-designed clinical trials with urinary concentration information and clinical end points on patients with various degrees of renal impairment are much needed. Until such a study becomes available, the limited data available would support considering using this drug in patients with a CrCl of 40 mL/min or higher.

### Nitrofurantoin monohydrate and nitrofurantoin, macrocrystalline (nitrofurantoin monohydrate / macrocrystals) [^115pYaWU]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Nitrofurantoin capsules, USP (monohydrate/macrocrystals) are indicated only for the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by susceptible strains of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus saprophyticus.

Nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of nitrofurantoin capsules (monohydrate/macrocrystals)and other antibacterial drugs, nitrofurantoin capsules (monohydrate/macrocrystals)should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients who are treated with nitrofurantoin capsules (monohydrate/macrocrystals) are predisposed to persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with nitrofurantoin capsules (monohydrate/macrocrystals), other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected. In considering the use of nitrofurantoin capsules (monohydrate/macrocrystals), lower eradication rates should be balanced against the increased potential for systemic toxicity and for the development of antimicrobial resistance when agents with broader tissue distribution are utilized.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: rapid evidence review [^1132xnmk]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^116nDe5A]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Randomisation and masking

Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either antibiotic prophylaxis (experimental) or no prophylaxis (control). Randomisation was done centrally by an internet-based system that used permuted random blocks of variable length (two, four, and six). A statistician that was not otherwise involved with the study produced the final allocation schedule, including stratification by three variables: previous frequency of UTIs (less than four episodes per year vs at least four episodes per year), a diagnosis of neurological dysfunction of the lower urinary tract, and sex. Clinical trial unit staff and central laboratory staff who were assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. By necessity, participants, treating clinicians, and local research staff were masked to block size but not to allocation. For those allocated to prophylaxis, the clinician started the patient on a study drug for UTI prophylaxis that was suitable to the individual. The drugs given were 50 mg nitrofurantoin, 100 mg trimethoprim, or 250 mg cefalexin. These drugs were prescribed to be taken once daily and were supplied by the standard NHS mechanisms and manufacturers licensed by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.

### Oral antibiotics to prevent postoperative urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^115rnjZa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether nitrofurantoin prophylaxis prevents postoperative urinary tract infection (UTI) in patients receiving transurethral catheterization after pelvic reconstructive surgery.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery were randomized to 100 mg nitrofurantoin or placebo once daily during catheterization if they were: 1) discharged with a transurethral Foley or performing intermittent self-catheterization; or 2) hospitalized overnight with a transurethral Foley. Our primary outcome was treatment for clinically suspected or culture-proven UTI within 3 weeks of surgery. Statistical analysis was performed by χ2 and logistic regression. Assuming 80% power at a P value of .05, 156 participants were needed to demonstrate a two-thirds reduction in UTI.

Results

Of 159 participants, 81 (51%) received nitrofurantoin and 78 (49%) received placebo. There were no significant differences in baseline demographics, intraoperative characteristics, duration and type of catheterization, or postoperative hospitalization, except a lower rate of hysterectomy in the nitrofurantoin group. Nitrofurantoin prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of UTI treatment within 3 weeks of surgery (22% UTI with nitrofurantoin compared with 13% UTI with placebo, relative risk 1.73, 95% confidence interval 0.85–3.52, P = 0.12). Urinary tract infection treatment was higher in premenopausal women, lower in diabetics, and increased with longer duration of catheterization. In logistic regression adjusting for menopause, diabetes, preoperative postvoid residual volume, creatinine clearance, hysterectomy, and duration of catheterization, there was still no difference in UTI with nitrofurantoin as compared with placebo.

Conclusion

Prophylaxis with daily nitrofurantoin during catheterization does not reduce the risk of postoperative UTI in patients receiving short-term transurethral catheterization after pelvic reconstructive surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114Wk6bV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnancy — duration and regimen considerations are summarized as follows: A Cochrane review included 13 studies enrolling 1622 women comparing single-dose to short-course (4–7 days) antimicrobials, and in one included moderate-quality study of nitrofurantoin, 714 women received 7 days or single-dose therapy; seven days was more effective than a single dose in preventing low birth weight (relative risk [RR], 1.65 95% CI, 1.06–2.57), with no differences in pyelonephritis or preterm delivery. The review concludes that current recommendations of 4 to 7-day duration of treatment for ASB during pregnancy are reasonable but based on low-quality evidence. The optimal duration of therapy will be antimicrobial-specific; nitrofurantoin and β-lactam antimicrobials (usually ampicillin or cephalexin) are preferred because of safety in pregnant women, but these agents are less effective as short-course therapy for acute cystitis. A single dose of fosfomycin is effective for clearance of bacteria in urine, but clinical evaluation in pregnancy is limited and outcomes such as pyelonephritis and preterm labor are not yet well studied. Research needs include studies evaluating the optimal duration for different regimens, including fosfomycin, and impacts on neonatal outcomes.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113bqtGg]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment — women with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI): Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence from a Cochrane review of studies published from 1977 to 2003 included 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 6,016) and found no differences between fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, or nitrofurantoin versus TMP-SMX in short-term (within two weeks of treatment) or long-term (up to 8 weeks) symptomatic or bacteriological cure, with risk ratio (RR) estimates close to 1.0; results were similar with treatment durations of 3 days or 7 to 10 days and across specific fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin). For harms, fluoroquinolones (2 trials; pooled RR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.43; I2 = 0%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.76; I2 = 0%) were associated with lower likelihood of rash than TMP-SMX, there was no difference in discontinuation due to adverse events though estimates favored fluoroquinolones (3 trials; RR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.12 to 1.14; I² = 39%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.41; I² = 0%), and there was no difference between β-lactams and TMP-SMX in rates of rash or other harms.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^115EfgMh]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

At baseline, the groups did not differ in frequency of antimicrobial resistance of urinary isolates to eight oral antibiotics that are commonly used for UTI treatment. During the 12-month trial, resistance appeared more common in isolates that were cultured from urine submitted during symptomatic UTIs by participants in the prophylaxis group than those in the control group (figure 2). In urine samples submitted during asymptomatic periods between months 9 and 12 of the trial, resistance to nitrofurantoin (12 [24%] of 51 participants with at least one isolate from the prophylaxis group vs six [9%] of 64 participants with at least one isolate from the control group; p = 0.038), trimethoprim (34 [67%] of 51 participants vs 21 [33%] of 64 participants; p = 0.0003), and co-trimoxazole (26 [53%] of 49 participants vs 15 [24%] of 62 participants; p = 0.002) was significantly more frequent in the prophylaxis group than the control group. Over baseline and subsequent 3-monthly intervals during the 12-month trial period, resistance to amoxicillin (38 [52%] of 73 participants, 25 [74%] of 34 participants, 31 [82%] of 38 participants, 32 [74%] of 43 participants, and 37 [76%] of 49 participants; p = 0.004), cephalexin (11 [14%] of 78 participants, ten [25%] of 40 participants, 13 [32%] of 41 participants, 17 [38%] of 45 participants, and 16 [31%] of 51 participants; p = 0.005), co-trimoxazole (18 [25%] of 73 participants, 23 [59%] of 39 participants, 14 [37%] of 38 participants, 21 [48%] of 44 participants, 26 [53%] of 49 participants; p = 0.006), and trimethoprim (32 [42%] of 77 participants, 31 [79%] of 39 participants, 25 [63%] of 40 participants, 27 [63%] of 43 participants, 34 [67%] of 51 participants; p = 0.016) also significantly increased in isolates from urine specimens that were submitted during asymptomatic periods by participants in the prophylaxis group. There was no evidence of increasing resistance over time in the control group. Resistance of urinary isolates that were submitted during asymptomatic periods appeared to decrease at 18 months. There was no evidence that E coli isolated from perianal swabs of participants in the prophylaxis group had significantly more frequent resistance against any of the eight antibiotics tested than did participants in the control group at 6–12 months of the trial.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114Eo57K]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in women who experience post-coital UTIs — prophylaxis taken before or after sexual intercourse has been shown to be effective and safe, with a significant reduction in recurrence rates, and intermittent dosing is associated with decreased risk of adverse events including gastrointestinal symptoms and vaginitis. Evidence includes a 1990 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 27 sexually active women with a median age of 23 showing post-coital antibiotics were more effective than placebo in reducing UTI recurrences, and a study of 135 women where post-coital dosing was as effective as daily dosing. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered to women with sexual activity-related rUTIs, with recommended instructions to take a single dose of an antibiotic immediately before or after sexual intercourse. Dosing options for prophylaxis include: TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg; TMP-SMX 80 mg/400 mg; Nitrofurantoin 50 to 100 mg; Cephalexin 250 mg.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^111DGJZF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, ranking as the second most frequent indication for antibiotic prescribing in the outpatient setting. The majority of UTIs are "uncomplicated", occurring in non-pregnant adult women who are not immunocompromised and have normal genitourinary structure and function. Each year, 12.6% of women will have a UTI, and half of all women will have at least one UTI by age 32. The standard of care for uncomplicated UTI is oral antibiotic therapy, which typically leads to rapid symptom resolution and reduces the risk of complications such as pyelonephritis.

In recent years, growing antibiotic resistance has led to efforts to use antibiotics more judiciously. Specifically for uncomplicated UTIs, these initiatives have sought to reduce the amount — either duration or frequency — and spectrum of antibiotics. – Interviews with women indicate willingness to delay or avoid antibiotic prescriptions when safe to do so. Furthermore, some UTIs are self-limited without treatment and thus may not require antibiotic therapy. For example, a randomized controlled trial comparing nitrofurantoin with placebo for uncomplicated UTI demonstrated spontaneous symptomatic cure or improvement in over half of participants receiving placebo who had UTIs as proven by a combination of symptoms/signs and positive laboratory testing. While a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials found placebo to be inferior to antibiotics for resolution of UTI symptoms, it is unclear whether non-antibiotic treatment regimens for uncomplicated UTIs may be feasible as an outpatient antibiotic stewardship strategy. For example, cranberry extract was initially considered a potential antibiotic-sparing option; however, subsequent research has not supported its use in the treatment of UTI over antibiotics.

Ciprofloxacin for uncomplicated cystitis is 400 milligrams IV every 12 h or 500 milligrams PO (enterally) every 12 h, and for all other infections is 400 milligrams IV every 8 h or 750 milligrams PO every 12 h. Levofloxacin for all infections is 750 milligrams IV/PO every 24 h. Nitrofurantoin is macrocrystal/monohydrate (Macrobid) 100 mg PO every 12 h or oral suspension 50 milligrams PO every 6 h. Fosfomycin for uncomplicated cystitis is 3 grams PO as a single dose. Minocycline is 200 milligrams IV/PO every 12 h, and eravacycline is 1 mg/kg per dose IV every 12 h. Tigecycline is 200 mg IV as a single dose, then 100 mg IV every 12 h. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for uncomplicated cystitis is 160 mg (trimethoprim component) IV/PO every 12 h, and for other infections is 10–15 mg/kg/day (trimethoprim component) IV/PO divided every 8 to 12 h.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114Tjjso]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

Next, a daily "post-process" was performed to generate the final recommendations presented to physicians. The daily recommendation preparation process included three steps: (1) filtering antibiotic recommendations based on clinical constraints in the patient's medical record and determining the recommended dose and duration (Supplementary Fig. 4); (2) selecting the commercial drug code for each antibiotic's main generic ingredient based on the current pharmaceutical HMO preference for generic agents available for prescription. (3) recommending the top two antibiotics as per descending sensitivity score.

Antibiotic prioritization framework (Fig. 5B): To balance between minimizing the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and optimizing treatment outcomes, a predetermined target ranking was created for antibiotics. The ranking was determined through a comprehensive evaluation of local guidelines for UTI management and local antibiotic susceptibility profiles, safety profiles, efficacy, and patient adherence to therapy. An agile frequency table, including six antibiotic regimens for treating UTIs, was built. The table provided target values for the percentage of each antibiotic prescribed for UTIs among MHS patients, assuming that all patients receive antibiotics on the same day. The designated target values for six antibiotics were as follows: Nitrofurantoin (40%), Fosfomycin (30%), Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (12%), Cefuroxime (9%), Cephalexin (5%), and Ciprofloxacin (4%). These values could be readily modified in response to changes in resistance patterns or further evaluation of the model performance to optimize treatment outcomes.

Regarding preventative measures for recurrent urinary tract infection in women, more specifically with respect to antibiotic prophylaxis, SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend to offer continuous daily antibiotic prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a quinolone for 6–12 months in patients with 2 UTIs in 6 months or 3 UTIs in 12 months.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### One-day compared with 7-day nitrofurantoin for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial [^114uJR9k]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether a 1-day nitrofurantoin regimen is as effective as a 7-day regimen in eradicating asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy.

Methods

A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled noninferiority trial was conducted in antenatal clinics in Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Argentina. Pregnant women seeking antenatal care between March 2004 and March 2007 who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. Those who consented were randomly allocated to receive either a 1-day or a 7-day course of 100 mg capsules of nitrofurantoin, which was taken twice daily. The primary outcome was bacteriologic cure on day 14 of treatment.

Results

A total of 1,248 of 24,430 eligible women had asymptomatic bacteriuria, making the overall prevalence of 5.1%. Of these 1,248 women, 778 women were successfully recruited, and 386 and 392 women were randomly allocated to 1-day and 7-day regimens, respectively. Escherichia coli was the most common potentially pathogenic bacteria detected, its prevalence approaching 50%. Bacteriologic cure rates at treatment day 14 were 75.7% and 86.2% for 1-day and 7-day regimens, respectively. The cure rate difference was -10.5% (95% confidence interval -16.1% to -4.9%). Mean birth weight and mean gestational age at delivery were significantly lower in the 1-day regimen group. There were fewer adverse effects in the 1-day regimen group, but the differences were not statistically significant.

Conclusion

A 1-day regimen of nitrofurantoin is significantly less effective than a 7-day regimen. Women with asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy should receive the standard 7-day regimen.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^115mC5vf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

IDSA 2023 ESBL-E uncomplicated cystitis — aminoglycoside and fosfomycin considerations are as follows: Treatment with a single IV dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative treatment option for uncomplicated ESBL-E cystitis, and a single IV dose is generally effective for uncomplicated cystitis, with minimal toxicity, but robust clinical trial data are lacking. Susceptibility of E. coli to fosfomycin is not routinely tested by most clinical microbiology laboratories but E. coli resistance to fosfomycin remains rare in the United States, and among gram-negative species, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints are only available for E. coli for fosfomycin. Fosfomycin is not suggested for the treatment of infections caused by K. pneumoniae and several other gram-negative organisms, which frequently carry fosA hydrolase genes that may lead to clinical failure. A randomized open-label trial indicated that a single dose of oral fosfomycin is associated with higher clinical failure than a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin for uncomplicated cystitis, and although this trial was not limited to E. coli cystitis, in a subgroup analysis exclusively of E. coli infections, outcomes remained poor in the fosfomycin group.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^117Y6SAC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — agents with expected activity and alternatives — includes nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, which all achieve high concentrations in urine and are expected to be effective for uncomplicated CRE cystitis if the isolate is susceptible. A single dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative option; oral fosfomycin is an alternative for uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli, including if carbapenem resistant; and colistin is an alternative agent that converts to its active form in the urinary tract. Treatment suggestions for CRE infections listed below assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

### Lower urinary tract infections: management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic Re-prescription in primary care [^116ceraK]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Overall, 86% of UTIs were treated with a same-day antibiotic prescription, reflecting routine clinical practice in primary care, with decisions likely based on the report of typical symptoms with or without findings of dipstick urine testing. The proportion of patients being offered delayed prescriptions or symptomatic treatment and follow-upwould seems to be low, and there may be more opportunity to reduce empirical therapy, as undertaken in the Netherlands. Initial treatment comprised just 2 antibiotics, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim, thus, prescribing in general follows national guidance for situation when the risk of resistance is considered to be low. NICE considers administration of antibiotic therapy in the previous 3 months as a risk factor for trimethoprim resistance. In our study, the median time since last prior antibiotic prescription was 4 months.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to human health and calls for action to address this threat are widespread. The UK Chief Medical Officer's (CMO's) annual report 2011 highlighted the importance of antimicrobial resistance and the need to reduce its impact. A five year antimicrobial resistance strategy was published in 2013 that proposed potential means of 'conserving and stewarding' the effectiveness of existing antimicrobial treatments. A theoretical way of reducing the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance is to introduce more variation (i.e. diversity) into antibiotic prescribing. We have confirmed that there is little diversity in prescribing for UTIs, but introducing greater variety would oppose current clinical guidelines and prescribing practice.

### The revival of old antibiotics for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the era of antibiotic stewardship [^113mosax]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the era of increasing antibiotic resistance worldwide, this review highlights the advantages of revival of old antibiotics for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs).

Recent Findings

Recent studies have shown that these four oral old antibiotics, fosfomycin trometamol, nitrofurantoin, nitroxoline and pivmecillinam, show no increasing antibiotic resistance against uropathogens causing uUTI, are still effective for the treatment of uUTI and exhibit only minimal or no collateral damage as compared with fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporines.

Summary

According to the principles of antibiotic stewardship, the prudent use of antibiotics is needed. Therefore, recent international and national guidelines already favour these old oral antibiotics as first-choice treatment of uUTI. Unfortunately, implementation of these guidelines is still suboptimal.

### Nitrofurantoin neuropathy: a forgotten adverse effect [^112X6s8H]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Nitrofurantoin is a widely prescribed antibiotic used to treat uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections. Unknown in the obstetric and gynecologic literature is the complication of peripheral neuropathy as an adverse effect.

Case

We describe a patient who developed a severe sensory neuropathy after taking nitrofurantoin intermittently and then continuously over a 7-year period. She recovered almost completely after its discontinuation.

Conclusion

Peripheral neuropathy is a rare and potentially reversible adverse effect, unreported in the obstetric and gynecologic literature, and commonly unrecognized by physicians who prescribe it.

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^11283MUr]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Daily dose and duration conformity

When the drug choice was appropriate, dose conformity was generally high, ranging from 71% to 100% according to the diagnosis. This is similar to the 2018 Lebanese studyand could be explained by the fact that most drugs, like Fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin or ertapenem, have one standard dosing regimen; thus, errors are inexistent in that case. Dose conformity was lowest in simple cystitis, mainly driven by prescriptions of Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin. While they are recommended as the second-line ATBs at low doses (250 mg two times per day), they were prescribed in 100% of cases at a standard daily dose of 500 mg two times per day.

Duration conformity, which is the lowest of all three conformities, follows the same trend. In most cases, treatment durations were too long. Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin, which should be prescribed for 3 days only in simple cystitis, were given for up to 7–15 days in many cases; nitrofurantoin was given for 7 days instead of 5 in two-thirds of cases. One notable exception is cefixime, which, in almost all cases (21 of 25 prescriptions), was given for a total of 6 days instead of 7 days. On looking into the brands available in Lebanon, it appeared to us that the most common brand is sold in boxes of six pills. Because in Lebanon, drugs are sold to the patient in full boxes and not as an exact number of pills like in other countries, it seems that physicians take this point into account and prefer giving the drug for 1 day less, instead of letting the patient buy an additional box to use one additional pill only.

### Insights into durability against resistance from the antibiotic nitrofurantoin [^117DGVRU]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

Nitrofurantoin has shown exceptional durability against resistance over 70 years of use. This longevity stems from factors such as rapid achievement of therapeutic concentrations, multiple physiological targets against bacteria, low risk of horizontal gene transfer, and the need to acquire multiple mutations to achieve resistance. These combined features limit resistance emergence and spread of nitrofurantoin resistance. We propose nitrofurantoin as an exemplar for developing other durable treatments.

Antibiotic treatment — Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics, clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion).

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117H4oaD]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

### New paradigms in the management of recurrent urinary tract infections [^111zyDyd]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) represent a large burden on the healthcare system. Recent guidelines from the AUA/CUA/SUFU and advancements in the field reflect a paradigm shift for clinician and patients, steering away from empiric antibiotic therapy towards judicious antibiotic use.

Recent Findings

Antibiotic stewardship, including increasing awareness of the collateral damage of antibiotics and the risks of bacterial resistance are a major focus of the new guidelines. Accurate diagnosis of rUTIs is imperative. Urine cultures are necessary to document rUTI and should be obtained prior to any treatment. First line treatment options (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin) should be used whenever possible. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated in these patients with rUTI. Although antibiotic prophylaxis methods are effective, nonantibiotic regimens show promise.

Summary

The management of rUTIs has evolved significantly with the goal of antibiotic stewardship. It is increasingly important to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis with a positive urine culture in the setting of cystitis symptoms, and standardize treatment with first-line therapies to minimize antibiotic side effects.

Nitrofurantoin is recommended for first line prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infections. Despite a number of side effects it is increasingly prescribed due to its high efficacy, low cost and minimal antimicrobial resistance. Nitrofurantoin-induced immune-mediated liver injury is a particularly serious complication, resulting in both acute hepatic failure and cirrhosis with continued use. We describe the course of two patients who recently presented to our hospital in order to highlight this.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1153i1uC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the current concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

Study Design

A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections at the age of 18 to 75 years were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The proportion of prescriptions for each antibiotic drug class were reported with 95% confidence intervals and compared with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Patient and physician characteristics were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of antibiotic selection and thereby guideline concordance.

Results

Of the visits that resulted in antibiotic treatment, the overall concordance rate was 58.4% (26.2 million visits of 44.9 million visits) and increased from 48.2% (3.9 million visits of 8.1 million visits) in 2015 to 64.6% (6.3 million visits of 9.8 million visits) in 2019. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents were fluoroquinolones (36.4%, 16.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), nitrofurantoin (31.8%, 14.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.3%, 11.8 million visits of 44.9 million visits). From 2015 to 2019, fluoroquinolone use decreased whereas nitrofurantoin and beta-lactam use increased. Based on the logistic regression, patients aged 18 to 29 years (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.88; P < .001) and 30 to 44 years (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.42; p = 0.020) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than patients aged 45 to 75 years (reference group). Obstetricians-gynecologists (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.91–4.37; P < .001) and urologists (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.45–5.13; P < .001) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of concordant treatment than all other specialties combined (reference group).

Conclusion

Guideline discordance continues in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections with the overuse of fluoroquinolones and the underuse of first-line antibiotic agents. Although improving, continued misuse of antibiotic agents may contribute to the growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Actions such as educating physicians about antibiotic resistance and clinical practice guidelines and providing feedback on prescription habits are needed to increase guideline concordance and therefore reduce the use of fluoroquinolones, especially for physicians in family and internal medicine.

### Reversible lung fibrosis in a 6-year-old girl after long term nitrofurantoin treatment [^117FGhuP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic medicament often used in the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections as the urinary excretion rate is high. Recent studies have questioned the efficacy of antibiotics in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections and secondary renal injury in children. In a recent paper in the Lancet, the authors concluded that "a trial using antimicrobial prophylaxis in children with several recurrent episodes of acute pyelonephritis is warranted".

In Denmark, the national paediatric society recently changed the national clinical guideline: Prophylactic antibiotics should only be prescribed by specialists and after treatment of relevant risk factors. The recommendation is trimethoprim (2 mg/kg once a day) as first line treatment of recurrent upper urinary tract infection in children (amoxicillin if the child is younger than 6 weeks). Second choice is nitrofurantoin, demanding regular anamnestic screening of pulmonary symptoms including lung function testing.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (clinical guidelines, latest reaffirmation in 2016) recommends "prompt" initiation of antibiotic treatment in case of symptoms rather than prophylactic antibiotic of recurrent urinary tract infection. Furthermore, the committee emphasizes the importance of treating bowl/bladder dysfunctions, as this is a major, but disregarded, risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections.

Different pathophysiological mechanisms have been suggested to cause the pulmonary toxitcity of long-term nitrofurantoin treatment. One leading theory is that oxidative stress by the production of free radicals might injure the lung tissue, as nitrofurantoin in its active form is highly reactive. In vivo studies showed reduced injury in tissue incubated with nitrofurantoin in combination with antioxidants compared to nitrofurantoin alone. Hypersensitivity to nitrofurantoin and thereby cytokine-initiated inflammation is another possible explanation. However, hypersensitivity is more likely to cause acute reactions after short-time nitrofurantoin treatment.

Adverse events for common urinary tract infection (UTI) antibiotics — Nitrofurantoin has reported adverse event rates of 5%–34% and should be avoided if CrCl < 30 mL/min, with pulmonary fibrosis and hepatotoxicity risk with long-term use. TMP-SMX has adverse event rates of 1.4%–38%, with hyperkalemia and AKI more likely with TMP-SMX use in patients taking ACE inhibitors and potassium supplements, and hemolysis can occur with G6PD deficiency. Fosfomycin has adverse event rates of 5.3%–8%, with half-life of single dose 30–40 h and serious adverse events rare. Ciprofloxacin has adverse event rates of 4%–28%, and risk of use outweighs benefit if an alternative is available; tendinopathy risk is increased if age > 60 y, with corticosteroid use, or prior heart, kidney, and lung transplant. β-Lactams have adverse event rates of 10%–27% and, compared with other UTI antimicrobials, typically have inferior efficacy and more adverse effects and are associated with higher risk of collateral damage including ESBL selection, multidrug-resistant S. aureus, and Clostridium difficile colitis.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^111kKdFX]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

We considered a 20% reduction in average UTI frequency from three to 2.4 episodes per year to represent the minimal clinically important difference. Use of the Poisson rate test (for the primary analysis) required 158 participants in each group (316 in total) to complete the study, giving 90% power at the 5% significance level for detection of superiority of prophylaxis over no prophylaxis, which we increased to 372 to allow 15% attrition.

The primary measure of effect was the relative difference in the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTIs between the two groups during the 12-month observation period. All participants who completed at least 6 months of follow-up were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, to report the comparative UTI incidence between groups, which we calculated as the incidence rate ratio (IRR) to allow for differing durations of follow-up.

The incidence of resistance over time to oral antibiotics that are commonly used against UTIs — amoxicillin, cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, co-amoxiclav, mecillinam, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim — were summarised graphically by group. A χ² test was used to compare bacterial resistance rates between prophylaxis and control groups by examination of all isolates from surveillance urine specimens collected between 9 and 12 months and in strains of E coli isolated from perianal swabs between 6 and 12 months. Tests for trend of change in antimicrobial resistance were done separately for each group for isolates from surveillance urine.

Univariate analysis of change in kidney and liver function was done with a two-sample t test with additional analysis of covariance that used the covariates identified during the primary outcome modelling.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^116m9DBF]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic Prophylaxis Choice, Duration and Resistance

The most common agents used for CAP are amoxicillin in neonates and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and nitrofurantoin in older children. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and cephalosporins lack data regarding efficacy and the development of antimicrobial resistance. Two RCTs showed that 6 months of nitrofurantoin was more effective at reducing recurrence than TMP-SMX, although nitrofurantoin resulted in more gastrointestinal side effects. Although both nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX are generally considered safe for long-term prophylaxis, nitrofurantoin can also cause cutaneous reactions, while TMP-SMX can cause nausea and loss of appetite, and more rarely bone marrow suppression, nephrotoxicity and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It is therefore recommended not to use TMP-SMX in some hematologic disorders, to dose adjust in renal failure and to monitor full blood count and electrolytes while taking it. The benefits of nitrofurantoin, in terms of efficacy, are counterbalanced by the side effects of the drug, so overall there is little to choose between recommending nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX for prophylaxis. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that nitrofurantoin had the greatest likelihood of antibiotic choices in reducing UTI in children but also showed daily cranberry products reduce symptomatic UTI by 59%, more than either TMP-SMX or trimethoprim. This finding included children with recurrent UTI and VUR. Given that all antibiotic use is associated to some degree with the development of antibiotic resistance, cranberry products offer a promising alternative.

There is a lack of evidence for prophylaxis duration or criteria for discontinuation. Pooled results from 3 observational studies showed that continuation of CAP did not prevent recurrent UTI after pyeloplasty, so this should be a reason to stop. There is insufficient evidence regarding the duration of CAP after ureteral reimplantation or endoscopic treatment of VUR. Most commonly, 3–6 months are recommended, followed by reassessment.

Multiple RCTs clearly show that while UTI is less common with prophylaxis, resistance to the prophylactic antibiotic is significantly higher. With resistance to either TMP-SMX or nitrofurantoin, switching to the other can be considered, although there is a lack of evidence to recommend a switch after a breakthrough UTI. In case of resistance to both agents, one might consider a CAP disruption, as broader-spectrum agents may lead to UTI with increasingly resistant organisms to remaining oral alternatives.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113UcpBW]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Policy, clinical, and research implications

Our findings detail global high level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first line treatments in many countries. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)recommend that an antibiotic should be selected for first line empirical treatment of urinary tract infection only if the local prevalence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these guidelines, our review suggests ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first line treatment options for urinary tract infection in many OECD countries and that as a result many guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating. In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first line antibiotics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess of 20% (appendix 5), suggesting that choices of first line treatment might need to be re-evaluated in less well developed countries. Our results also support the need for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local resistance and that, for many areas, nitrofurantoin might be the most appropriate first line treatment for lower urinary tract infection. That said, care is needed because ruling out the use of some first line antibiotics could lead clinicians to prescribe broad spectrum second line antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, and quinolones, resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial resistance.

### Insights into durability against resistance from the antibiotic nitrofurantoin [^116NTXgW]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

Other genomic and environmental factors affecting the evolvability of nitrofurantoin resistance warrant consideration. Recent experimental work has shown that "mutators" with defects in DNA replication fidelity can more easily acquire stepwise resistance mutations, and overcome fitness deficits through compensatory adaptation. Mutators pose a specific risk for nitrofurantoin resistance, increasing both the probability of resistance evolution and the specificity of resistance mutations. The increasing prevalence of OqxAB efflux pumps also provides a potential mechanism that may make high-level nitrofurantoin resistance easier to evolve. The case of OqxAB, which was selected for in response to a different compound, also emphasises the need to better test for potential cross-resistance between existing and new drugs and chemicals prior to their release on the market.

Despite an increasing frequency of usage, nitrofurantoin has remained a durable antibiotic option for treating urinary tract infections. This durability is likely due to a few key factors, including targeted delivery to the site of infection and favourable PK/PD properties, multitarget effects on bacterial physiology, a requirement for multiple independent mutations for resistance to be acquired, fitness costs associated with resistance in the absence of nitrofurantoin, and the near-absence of horizontally acquired resistance. Continued judicious use of nitrofurantoin will hopefully continue to preserve this important antibiotic option for treating UTIs in the face of increasing antimicrobial resistance. However, more insight needs to be gained about factors that can increase the evolvability of nitrofurantoin resistance, including treatment non-adherence, the use of nitrofurantoin as a prophylactic treatment for recurrent UTI, bacterial mutation rate evolution, and the horizontal acquisition of novel efflux pumps. More generally, insight into mechanisms favouring the durability of nitrofurantoin may prove useful in the development of other durable antibiotics and treatment options.

Acute cystitis first-line selection and safety — when antimicrobial therapies for UTI are compared by clinical and/or bacteriological cure there is relatively little to distinguish agents, so the IDSA Guideline emphasizes in vitro resistance prevalence and ecological adverse effects as key considerations; fluoroquinolones are not among the suggested first-line agents in the United States, the three first-line agents available are nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin shows exceptional durability against emergence of resistance, TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric use where local resistance rates exceed 20%, and with the exception of fosfomycin, single dose antibiotics should not be used in patients with UTI; fluoroquinolone agents have potential adverse side effects including QTc prolongation, tendon rupture, and increased risk of aortic rupture leading to FDA black box warnings.

Incoordination in use of antimicrobial drugs

A 2019 Chinese survey on more than 74,648 antibiotic prescriptions in 16 rural primary care centers have shown that more than 84% prescriptions were unnecessary. Nitrofurantoin use in older adults has been controversial. As per WHO, AUA and EAU guidelines, Nitrofurantoin is the first line drug for acute UTI in women with concern of potential serious risk of pulmonary, hepatic toxicity and peripheral neuropathy especially with its long-term use if other safe alternatives are available for use, whereas STOPP/START criteria are silent and it is listed as a PIM for older adults by Beers Criteria. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the first line drug for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women as per AUA, whereas according to Beers Criteria,® it should be used with caution in older adults using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. The dosage of the TMP-SMX is to be reduced in older adults having creatinine clearance of 30 ml/min and is to be avoided in patient having creatinine clearance of < 15 ml/min whereas STOPP criteria are silent on this issue. EAU guidelines recommend Co-trimoxazole/trimethoprim to be considered as drugs of first choice only in areas with known resistance rates of < 20% for E. coli and restrains the use of trimethoprim in the first trimester and sulfa-methoxazole in the last trimester of the pregnancy.(Table 1).

AF: The first page of the confidential personalised prescribing tool shows 2019–2020 first-line prescribing patterns for oral antibiotics used to treat uncomplicated lower UTI and the current recommendations for BC. The primary recommendation is to choose nitrofurantoin for empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTI. A second message recommends choosing fosfomycin as first-line therapy for patients who cannot tolerate nitrofurantoin due to allergy or have impaired renal function. A final recommendation advises against prescribing ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and other antibiotics as first-line empiric therapy due to bacterial resistance rates in BC and adverse effects associated with fluoroquinolones. Each message is accompanied by a bar chart depicting the physicians' individual prescribing compared with the average BC FP. The second page of the AF provides supporting evidence for why nitrofurantoin is recommended for empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTI including a graph of 10-year history of E. coli isolates resistance rates by an antibiotic agent from the BC Centre for Disease Control Antimicrobial Resistance Dashboard. It shows escalating resistance to cephalexin over 50%, relative stability of∼40% resistance to amoxicillin, ∼20% resistance to ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX and low or declining < 10% resistance to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin. This makes it visually obvious which antibiotic is least likely to be resisted.

The evidence summary describes antimicrobial best practices for the treatment of symptomatic, uncomplicated lower UTI in BC. It recommends diagnosing uncomplicated UTI based on patient symptoms and against routine use of a urine dipstick/urinalysis or urine culture for diagnosing as testing abnormalities increase with age. Empiric treatment with nitrofurantoin (Macrobid 100 mg two times a day or Macrodantin 50 mg four times a day) for 5–7 days is recommended with fosfomycin recommended as an alternative when there is an allergy or intolerance to nitrofurantoin. TMP-SMX, fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams are unsuitable for empiric therapy (unguided by susceptibility profile) in BC due to bacterial resistance. See onlinesupplemental files 1 2 for the sample AF and ES.

### Rare adverse effect of a common drug: nitrofurantoin-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis [^116DFKNQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Nitrofurantoin is commonly prescribed to treat urinary tract infections (UTI). Reported adverse effects include gastrointestinal, pulmonary, hepatic and neurological disorders. We report a case of a 67-year-old woman treated for UTI with nitrofurantoin who presented with antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated renal and skin vasculitis 3days after starting treatment. The symptoms resolved following withdrawal of the drug and treatment with steroids. This is the first reported case of nitrofurantoin causing ANCA-associated vasculitis.

- the lower dosage level is recommended for uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Pediatric Patients: 5 mg/kg to 7 mg/kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses. modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2. 1 Recommended Dosage and Administration in Adult Patients The recommended dosage is 50 mg to 100 mg of nitrofurantoin oral suspension four. times a day. For long-term suppressive therapy in adults, a reduction of dosage to 50 mg to 100 mg at bedtime may be adequate.

The benefits of long-term suppressive therapy should be balanced against the increased potential for systemic toxicity and for the development of antibacterial resistance. Administer nitrofurantoin oral suspension with food to improve drug absorption and, in some patients, tolerance.
2. 2 Recommended Dosage and Administration in Pediatric Patients The recommended dosage of nitrofurantoin oral suspension is 5 mg/kg to 7 mg/kg of. body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses in pediatric patients aged 1 month and older. Administer nitrofurantoin oral suspension with food to improve drug absorption and, in some patients, tolerance.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and institute surgical evaluation as clinically indicated. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, emesis, and anorexia occur most often. Abdominal pain and diarrhea are less common gastrointestinal reactions. These dose-related reactions can be minimized by reduction of dosage. Sialadenitis and pancreatitis have been reported. There have been sporadic reports of pseudomembranous colitis with the use of nitrofurantoin. The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment. Data Animal Data Several reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits and rats at doses up to six times the human dose and have revealed no harm to the fetus due to nitrofurantoin.

In a single published study conducted in mice at 68 times the human dose, growth retardation and a low incidence of minor and common malformations were observed. However, at 25 times the human dose, fetal malformations were not observed. The safety and effectiveness of nitrofurantoin oral suspension in pediatric patients aged 1 month of age and older for the treatment of urinary tract infections have been established. Incidents of acute overdosage of nitrofurantoin oral suspension have resulted in symptoms such as vomiting. Induction of emesis is recommended. There is no specific antidote, but a high fluid intake should be maintained to promote urinary excretion of the drug. Nitrofurantoin is dialyzable. In a cross-over study, the in vivo absorption characteristics of nitrofurantoin and nitrofurantoin-magnesium trisilicate combination were evaluated in 6 healthy males.

The administration of 5 g magnesium trisilicate with 100 mg nitrofurantoin reduced the rate and extent of nitrofurantoin excretion reflecting decrease in both rate and extent of its absorption. Use within 30 days. Administration Instructions Instruct the patients to: Serious Allergic Reactions Advise patients that allergic reactions, including serious allergic reactions, could occur with nitrofurantoin oral suspension and that serious reactions require immediate treatment. Advise patients to discontinue nitrofurantoin oral suspension at the first sign of allergic reactions.

Cases of hemolytic anemia of the primaquine-sensitivity type have been induced by nitrofurantoin. Hemolysis appears to be linked to a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in the red blood cells of the affected patients. This deficiency is found in 10 percent of Blacks and a small percentage of ethnic groups of Mediterranean and Near-Eastern origin. If hemolysis occurs, discontinue nitrofurantoin immediately; hemolysis ceases when the drug is withdrawn. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, emesis, and anorexia occur most often. Abdominal pain and diarrhea are less common gastrointestinal reactions. These dose-related reactions can be minimized by reduction of dosage. Sialadenitis and pancreatitis have been reported. There have been sporadic reports of pseudomembranous colitis with the use of nitrofurantoin. The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment.

The reported urinary recoveries of nitrofurantoin after a single 100 mg oral dose and 100 mg four times a day in patients with varying renal function showed approximate linear relationship between the amount of nitrofurantoin recovered and creatinine clearance. Drug Interaction Studies Antacids such as magnesium trisilicate. In a cross-over study, the in vivo absorption characteristics of nitrofurantoin and nitrofurantoin-magnesium trisilicate combination were evaluated in 6 healthy males. The administration of 5 g magnesium trisilicate with 100 mg nitrofurantoin reduced the rate and extent of nitrofurantoin excretion reflecting decrease in both rate and extent of its absorption.

There have been sporadic reports of pseudomembranous colitis with the use of nitrofurantoin. The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in pregnant women at term, during labor and delivery, or when the onset of labor is imminent because of the possibility of hemolytic anemia in the infant. Data Animal Data Several reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits and rats at doses up to six times the human dose and have revealed no harm to the fetus due to nitrofurantoin.
