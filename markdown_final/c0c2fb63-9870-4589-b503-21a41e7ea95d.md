## Question

Treatment for ischemic stroke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about prehospital recognition and stroke system activation. Then, I should verify the emergency department workflow and imaging strategy. Next, I will examine intravenous thrombolysis eligibility, dosing, and timing. After that, I need to check endovascular therapy indications and technique. Then, I will review supportive care and secondary prevention, including antiplatelet, anticoagulation, and lipid strategies. Finally, I should consider special populations, quality metrics, and emerging therapies, and I will double-check any areas where I initially misstated or overgeneralized to correct them explicitly with sources.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: stroke is a time-sensitive emergency where every minute counts, and outcomes improve with faster treatment, so activating a stroke system of care immediately is essential [^114MshkU] [^111UqQPL].

> I need to ensure prehospital steps are precise: use a validated stroke screen such as FAST or BEFAST, avoid delays by not waiting for improvement, and transport to the nearest facility capable of IV alteplase while arranging transfer to a thrombectomy-capable center if large-vessel occlusion is suspected, ideally with prenotification and direct-to-imaging protocols to minimize door-to-needle time [^115XfZhv] [^114jcaXy] [^113v4C4G].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about triage. I initially thought we should bypass the closest hospital for a thrombectomy center, but wait, I should verify the guideline nuance: the benefit of bypassing the closest IV alteplase–capable hospital to reach a higher-level stroke center is uncertain, so transport decisions should be aligned with local protocols and transfer agreements rather than a blanket bypass rule [^115XfZhv].

> Next, I should review the ED workflow: obtain a focused history, perform a rapid NIHSS, check vitals including oxygenation, and draw time-critical labs, but I need to ensure I do not delay alteplase for labs unless there is a specific concern. Critically, blood glucose must be checked before thrombolysis because hypo- or hyperglycemia can mimic stroke and must be corrected promptly [^111FuV7C] [^111hxvYi].

> I will now examine imaging strategy: noncontrast CT is mandatory to exclude hemorrhage and guide therapy, and I should obtain noninvasive vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) as early as possible without delaying IV alteplase if indicated. Advanced perfusion imaging (CTP or MR perfusion) is appropriate in the 6–24 hour window to select patients with favorable mismatch profiles for thrombectomy, but I should confirm that this does not delay time-sensitive reperfusion therapies [^112AxG94] [^112xS9ef] [^115ow5UQ].

> Let me think about IV thrombolysis next: standard-dose alteplase is 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg) with 10% given as a bolus over 1 minute and the remainder over 60 minutes. Treatment within 0–3 hours is Class I for selected patients, and between 3–4.5 hours it is also Class I with additional exclusion criteria, and I should double-check that benefit is time-dependent so faster administration yields better outcomes [^116UWU8K] [^113dzbKB] [^114CWjBg].

> Wait, I should verify the 3–4.5 hour exclusions: age over 80, history of both prior stroke and diabetes, NIHSS greater than 25, current oral anticoagulant use, and imaging showing more than one-third MCA territory involvement are the key exclusions in that window. I initially thought NIHSS > 25 was an absolute contraindication, but let me reconsider — guidelines describe uncertainty rather than a strict prohibition, so I should frame this as a relative exclusion with careful risk–benefit discussion rather than an absolute rule [^111pi77K] [^111pi77K].

> I need to check eligibility nuances: age over 80 is acceptable within 0–3 hours, and for patients on warfarin, an INR ≤ 1.7 in the 3–4.5 hour window may still allow alteplase. For mild strokes, I should confirm that nondisabling symptoms (NIHSS 0–5) are not recommended for alteplase, whereas mild but disabling deficits may still benefit, and I should not delay alteplase to observe for improvement because that worsens outcomes [^113rFhqB] [^116nb1fe] [^111hxvYi].

> Next, I should review endovascular therapy: mechanical thrombectomy is indicated for large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation within 6 hours from onset, and in selected patients with favorable imaging profiles, benefit extends to 24 hours. Stent retrievers are preferred over MERCI, and the procedural goal should be mTICI 2b/3 reperfusion achieved as early as possible, with observation after IV alteplase discouraged if thrombectomy is indicated [^112xS9ef] [^1115J8gK] [^117LmZJc].

> Hold on, I should verify device and technique details: stent retrievers are first-line, and intra-arterial fibrinolysis is generally not recommended as initial therapy but may be considered selectively within 6 hours when IV alteplase is contraindicated, acknowledging uncertain consequences. Collateral assessment can inform decision-making in some candidates, but I need to ensure this does't delay transfer or treatment [^114cFDvk] [^114rx166].

> I will now examine supportive care: maintain blood pressure below 185/110 mmHg before alteplase and at or below 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours after. Correct hypotension and hypovolemia to preserve cerebral perfusion. Manage hyperglycemia aggressively. And avoid routine prophylactic antibiotics, which do not improve functional outcomes despite reducing infections [^116Hcn7S] [^116Eo9uN] [^113sK684].

> Let me consider antithrombotic therapy timing carefully: aspirin should be initiated within 24–48 hours after onset, but if the patient received IV alteplase, I should generally delay aspirin until 24 hours and after imaging excludes hemorrhage. For minor stroke or high-risk TIA, short-course dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21–90 days) reduces early recurrence, but I should confirm that prolonged triple therapy is not recommended due to bleeding risk [^1118kyvh] [^111E6GYi] [^112xdDFL].

> I should confirm secondary prevention principles: for noncardioembolic strokes, antiplatelet therapy is preferred over anticoagulation. For cardioembolic stroke, particularly atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation is indicated. Statins should be continued if already prescribed and initiated in-hospital when indicated, with high-intensity regimens favored for atherosclerotic strokes. And I need to ensure that carotid stenosis is evaluated promptly for revascularization when appropriate [^115b3X9A] [^114Y36Xx] [^112xdDFL].

> But wait, what about neuroprotection and other adjuncts? I should double-check that no pharmacologic neuroprotective agents are currently recommended, and I should avoid hemodilution or vasodilator strategies that have not shown benefit, focusing instead on evidence-based supportive care and rehabilitation planning [^114neEki] [^112Vv4qR].

> Next, I should review special populations and scenarios: in patients with concurrent acute MI, IV alteplase followed by PCI is reasonable. In procedural stroke complicating angiography, alteplase may be considered if otherwise eligible. In pregnancy, case-by-case decisions are needed given limited data. And in patients with seizures at onset, I need to ensure the deficit is not postictal before labeling it as stroke [^115vw62h] [^111bC73A].

> I need to ensure quality metrics are embedded: track door-to-needle and door-to-puncture times, monitor onset-to-treatment intervals, and participate in regional stroke registries. Systems that consistently achieve faster treatment have better outcomes, reinforcing the "time is brain" imperative [^114MshkU] [^115fZL8U].

> Let me reconsider emerging directions: tenecteplase is increasingly used as an alternative fibrinolytic in select settings, and advanced imaging to identify tissue at risk supports extending reperfusion windows. However, I should confirm that these advances are applied within trial-informed frameworks and local protocol pathways to maintain safety and efficacy [^113VYrZj] [^112xS9ef].

> Finally, I should confirm that the care pathway is coherent: rapid recognition and EMS activation, immediate ED assessment with early imaging, prompt IV alteplase when eligible, parallel evaluation for thrombectomy with early transfer if LVO is suspected, meticulous supportive care, and early initiation of secondary prevention together constitute the standard of care that maximizes functional recovery after acute ischemic stroke [^11543jnT] [^111UqQPL].

The cornerstone of ischemic stroke treatment is **rapid reperfusion** with IV alteplase within 4.5 hours [^114mTS7e] and mechanical thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion up to 24 hours in selected patients [^112xS9ef] [^114MshkU]. Early aspirin (24–48 hours) [^1118kyvh] and statins are essential for secondary prevention [^112xdDFL]; **blood pressure control** and stroke unit care reduce complications and improve outcomes [^116Eo9uN] [^111EagiB]. Tenecteplase is an emerging alternative to alteplase in large-vessel occlusion [^113VYrZj], and neuroprotective agents remain under investigation [^114neEki].

## Acute reperfusion therapies

### Intravenous thrombolysis

- **IV alteplase (tPA)**: 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg) within 4.5 hours of onset [^114mTS7e]; 10% bolus, remainder over 60 minutes [^113dzbKB].
- **Benefit**: Strongly time-dependent; earlier treatment improves outcomes [^114CWjBg] [^114MshkU].
- **Contraindications**: Exclude hemorrhage, recent major surgery, active bleeding, or INR > 1.7 on warfarin [^111pi77K].
- **Tenecteplase**: 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus for large-vessel occlusion; noninferior to alteplase in some trials [^notfound].

---

### Mechanical thrombectomy

- **Indication**: Large-vessel occlusion (internal carotid, MCA, basilar) within 6 hours; extended to 24 hours with advanced imaging [^112xS9ef] [^117U3hwv] [^113VYrZj].
- **Technique**: Stent-retriever or aspiration; aim for mTICI 2b/3 reperfusion [^1115J8gK].
- **Outcomes**: Substantial reduction in disability; earlier treatment yields better results [^114MshkU] [^111BkSvw].

---

## Antiplatelet therapy

Aspirin is recommended within **24–48 hours** after onset, typically 160–325 mg daily [^1118kyvh]. Dual antiplatelet therapy (**aspirin plus clopidogrel**) is used for minor stroke or high-risk TIA for 21–90 days, then monotherapy [^111E6GYi] [^112xdDFL].

---

## Anticoagulation

Anticoagulation is indicated for **atrial fibrillation or cardioembolic stroke**; start after 24–48 hours if no hemorrhage. DOACs (**dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban**) are preferred over warfarin for most patients.

---

## Blood pressure management

- **Acute phase**: Allow permissive hypertension unless > 220/120 mmHg or thrombolysis is planned.
- **Post-thrombolysis**: Maintain < 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours [^116Hcn7S].
- **Long-term**: Target < 130/80 mmHg to reduce recurrence risk.

---

## Lipid management

High-intensity statins (**atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg**) should be initiated within 24–48 hours [^notfound]. The **LDL-C goal** is < 70 mg/dL for atherosclerotic stroke.

---

## Supportive care and stroke unit

- **Stroke unit**: Admission to a specialized stroke unit reduces mortality and disability [^111BkSvw].
- **Glucose control**: Treat hyperglycemia > 180 mg/dL with insulin.
- **Swallowing screening**: Prevent aspiration pneumonia.
- **DVT prophylaxis**: Use intermittent pneumatic compression or anticoagulation if indicated.

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Tenecteplase**: Alternative to alteplase in large-vessel occlusion [^notfound].
- **Extended thrombectomy windows**: Advanced imaging enables treatment up to 24 hours [^112xS9ef].
- **Neuroprotection**: Agents targeting ischemic cascades are under investigation [^111EagiB].

The risk of recurrent stroke during the first few days after a transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke is much higher than previously estimated. However, there is substantial variation worldwide in how patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke are investigated and treated in the acute phase: some health-care systems provide immediate emergency inpatient care and others provide non-emergency outpatient clinical assessment. This review considers what is known about the early prognosis after transient ischaemic attack and minor ischaemic stroke, what factors identify individuals at particularly high early risk of stroke, and what evidence there is that urgent preventive treatment is likely to be effective in reducing the early risk of stroke.

Hospital stroke systems — It is recommended that stroke systems of care be developed so that fibrinolytic‑eligible patients and mechanical thrombectomy–eligible patients receive treatment in the fastest achievable onset‑to‑treatment time. Supporting data note IV tissue‑type plasminogen activator may be given up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset, and in alteplase‑treated cohorts, treatment started more rapidly was associated with reduced in‑hospital mortality, reduced symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, increased independent ambulation at discharge, and increased discharge to home. For endovascular therapy, pooled trials found the odds of improved disability outcomes declined with longer time from symptom onset to arterial puncture, and to ensure access for those presenting in the 6‑ to 24‑hour window, evaluation and treatment should be as rapid as possible.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to intravenous alteplase, timing, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to administer IV alteplase in otherwise eligible patients with mild but disabling stroke symptoms able to be treated within 3 hours of ischemic stroke symptom onset or last known well or at baseline state.

### Management of acute ischemic stroke [^111UqQPL]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Stroke is the leading cause of long term disability in developed countries and one of the top causes of mortality worldwide. The past decade has seen substantial advances in the diagnostic and treatment options available to minimize the impact of acute ischemic stroke. The key first step in stroke care is early identification of patients with stroke and triage to centers capable of delivering the appropriate treatment, as fast as possible. Here, we review the data supporting pre-hospital and emergency stroke care, including use of emergency medical services protocols for identification of patients with stroke, intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke including updates to recommended patient eligibility criteria and treatment time windows, and advanced imaging techniques with automated interpretation to identify patients with large areas of brain at risk but without large completed infarcts who are likely to benefit from endovascular thrombectomy in extended time windows from symptom onset. We also review protocols for management of patient physiologic parameters to minimize infarct volumes and recent updates in secondary prevention recommendations including short term use of dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent recurrent stroke in the high risk period immediately after stroke. Finally, we discuss emerging therapies and questions for future research.

Acute ischemic stroke — vascular imaging for endovascular therapy candidates: For patients who otherwise meet criteria for endovascular therapy (EVT), a noninvasive intracranial vascular study is recommended during the initial imaging evaluation of the acute stroke patient, but should not delay IV alteplase if indicated. For patients who qualify for IV alteplase according to guidelines from professional medical societies, initiating IV alteplase before noninvasive vascular imaging is recommended for patients who have not had noninvasive vascular imaging as part of their initial imaging assessment for stroke. Noninvasive intracranial vascular imaging should then be obtained as quickly as possible.

IV alteplase pretreatment deliberation and timing — The potential risks should be discussed during thrombolysis eligibility deliberation and weighed against the anticipated benefits during decision making. It is reasonable that urgent IV alteplase treatment not be delayed while waiting for hematologic or coagulation testing if there is no reason to suspect an abnormal test. Treating clinicians should be aware that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may mimic acute stroke presentations and determine blood glucose levels before IV alteplase initiation. IV alteplase is not indicated for nonvascular conditions. Because time from onset of symptoms to treatment has such a powerful impact on outcomes, treatment with IV alteplase should not be delayed to monitor for further improvement.

Acute ischemic stroke — other endovascular therapies: Initial treatment with intra-arterial thrombolysis is beneficial for carefully selected patients with major ischemic strokes of < 6 hours' duration caused by occlusions of the MCA. However, a clinically beneficial dose of intra-arterial alteplase is not established, alteplase does not have US Food and Drug Administration approval for intra-arterial use, and as a consequence mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers is recommended over intra-arterial thrombolysis as first-line therapy. Intra-arterial thrombolysis initiated within 6 hours of stroke onset in carefully selected patients who have contraindications to the use of IV alteplase might be considered, but the consequences are unknown.

### Treatment and intervention for stroke… [^113SwQnN]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview If someone you know shows signs of stroke, call 9–1–1 right away. Your stroke treatment begins the moment emergency medical services arrive to take you to the hospital. Once at the hospital, you may receive emergency care, treatment to prevent another stroke, rehabilitation to treat the side effects of stroke, and/or all three. Treating ischemic stroke If you get to the hospital within 3 hours of the first symptoms of an ischemic stroke, you may get a type of medicine called a thrombolytic to break up blood clots. Tissue plasminogen activator is a thrombolytic. tPA improves the chances of recovering from a stroke. Studies show that patients with ischemic strokes who receive tPA are more likely to recover fully or have less disability than patients who do not receive the drug. Patients treated with tPA are also less likely to need long-term care in a nursing home.

Recognizing the signs and symptoms and seeking immediate medical attention is essential to prevent stroke related disability or death. Doctors may also treat ischemic stroke with other medicines, such as blood thinners, as well as surgery to remove the clot. Ischemic Stroke Most strokes are ischemic strokes. An ischemic stroke occurs when blood clots or other particles block the blood vessels to the brain. Fatty deposits called plaque can also build up in the blood vessels causing blockages. Treating hemorrhagic stroke Other medicines, surgery, or procedures may be needed to stop the bleeding from hemorrhagic stroke and save brain tissue. For example: Endovascular procedures. Endovascular procedures, which can help repair a weak spot or break in a blood vessel, may be used to treat certain hemorrhagic strokes. Learn more about the procedure. Surgical treatment. Hemorrhagic strokes may be treated with surgery.

If the bleeding is caused by a ruptured aneurysm, a metal clip may be put in place to stop the blood loss. What is stroke rehabilitation. Rehab can include working with speech, physical, and occupational therapists.
- Speech therapy helps people who have problems producing or understanding speech.
- Physical therapy uses exercises to help you relearn movement and coordination skills you may have lost because of the stroke.
- Occupational therapy focuses on improving daily activities, such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, reading, and writing.

Economic impact and cost-effectiveness — Multiple studies evaluating fibrinolytic therapy and mechanical thrombectomy, alone or in combination, have demonstrated substantial cost-effectiveness of acute stroke treatment across multiple countries; in the United States, pre–mechanical thrombectomy era data indicate cost savings of approximately US $30 million if the proportion of all ischemic stroke patients receiving thrombolysis was increased to 8%, and before the implementation of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services diagnosis-related group 559 payment in 2005 treatment of acute stroke was economically discouraged at a hospital level because of a hospital cost-reimbursement ratio; in a single-hospital study, this ratio decreased from 1.41 (95% CI, 0.98–2.28) before diagnosis-related group 559 to 0.82 (95% CI, 0.66–0.97) after diagnosis-related group 559.

### Novel treatments for transient ischemic attack and acute ischemic stroke [^113HA9QA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment of acute ischemic stroke is one of the most rapidly evolving areas in medicine. Like all ischemic vascular emergencies, the priority is reperfusion before irreversible infarction. The central nervous system is sensitive to brief periods of hypoperfusion, making stroke a golden hour diagnosis. Although the phrase "time is brain" is relevant today, emerging treatment strategies use more specific markers for consideration of reperfusion than time alone. Innovations in early stroke detection and individualized patient selection for reperfusion therapies have equipped the emergency medicine clinician with more opportunities to help stroke patients and minimize the impact of this disease.

### Ischemic stroke: advances in diagnosis and management [^114csNgH]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke carries the risk of morbidity and mortality. Since the advent of intravenous thrombolysis, there have been improvements in stroke care and functional outcomes. Studies of populations once excluded from thrombolysis have begun to elucidate candidates who might benefit and thus should be engaged in the process of shared decision-making. Imaging is evolving to better target the ischemic penumbra salvageable with prompt reperfusion. Availability and use of computed tomography angiography identifies large-vessel occlusions, and new-generation endovascular therapy devices are improving outcomes in these patients. With this progress in stroke treatment, risk stratification tools and shared decision-making are fundamental.

Thrombophilia testing for secondary prevention — the usefulness of screening for thrombophilic states in patients with ischemic stroke is unknown; current evidence suggests that there is little, if any, contribution of the inherited thrombophilias to the development of arterial thrombotic events, and therefore tests for inherited thrombophilia should not be ordered for the evaluation of MI, stroke, or peripheral arterial thrombosis.

Mechanical thrombectomy technique — device selection, reperfusion target, and timing are specified as follows: Use of stent retrievers is indicated in preference to the Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia (MERCI) device. The technical goal of the thrombectomy procedure should be reperfusion to a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grade 2b/3 angiographic result to maximize the probability of a good functional clinical outcome; the mTICI score is the current assessment tool of choice, with proven value in predicting clinical outcomes, and in HERMES, 402 of 570 patients (71%) were successfully reperfused to mTICI grade 2b/3. To ensure benefit, reperfusion to mTICI grade 2b/3 should be achieved as early as possible within the therapeutic window, and in the 6- to 24-hour thrombectomy window evaluation and treatment should proceed as rapidly as possible to ensure access to treatment for the greatest proportion of patients.

EARLY DETECTION

Ischemic stroke can occur both in the community and in the hospital and must be recognized by bystanders and/or providers. Early recognition activates a stroke-specific chain of survival (Table 1). Stroke is a clinical diagnosis and several features of the patient's clinical presentation can be used to identify stroke patients (Table 2). Emergency Medical Systems are key in detection, triaging, and transport of stroke patients to receiving facilities.

### Identifying and treating acute ischemic stroke… [^116HtjFb]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Effective treatment of acute ischemic stroke requires rapid assessment and early intervention. Currently, the only effective therapy is thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator within three hours after the onset of stroke. However, a number of potential delays make early diagnosis and treatment difficult. Kasner and Grotta review the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia and the implications for treatment, identify some of the potential delays that commonly occur in diagnosing stroke and offer ways to expedite diagnosis and treatment. Stroke occurs as a result of a specific sequence of events that happen after abrupt interruption of blood flow to the brain. The level of brain injury depends on the severity and duration of ischemia. In the hours after stroke, cytokines and cell adhesion molecules stimulate local inflammation, which further impairs blood flow.

Reperfusion must occur within three hours of the onset of symptoms to preserve a substantial portion of the brain tissue at risk. Treatment of acute stroke focuses on restoring cerebral perfusion and protecting neural tissue. Thrombolysis with tPA has demonstrated a positive effect on reperfusion since tPA converts plasminogen to plasmin, which causes cleavage of fibrin and ultimately results in rapid lysis of the clot. At this time, neuro-protective therapies and streptokinase are not effective in the treatment of acute stroke. For tPA to be effective, however, early diagnosis and rapid intervention are essential; patients targeted for tPA intervention must meet very specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to reduce the risk of hemorrhage.

Within the hospital, the use of a "stroke team" composed of neurologists, emergency physicians and nurses, along with radiologists and pharmacists, is appropriate to streamline diagnostic testing and emergency care of patients with signs and symptoms of stroke. If the criteria for thrombolysis are met, tPA infusion should be initiated in the emergency department, and the patient should be monitored closely for 24 hours. The authors conclude that time is the most critical element in the successful treatment of an acute ischemic stroke. Since neural tissue is extremely sensitive to ischemic injury, thrombolysis with tPA should occur within three hours of the onset of symptoms if the patient meets the criteria for this therapy. Care of acute stroke must parallel that of acute myocardial infarction in ensuring early diagnosis and rapid intervention. A door-to-drug interval of 60 minutes is recommended as part of successful management.

Antiplatelet treatment — Administration of aspirin is recommended in patients with AIS within 24 to 48 hours after onset. For those treated with IV alteplase, aspirin administration is generally delayed until 24 hours later but might be considered in the presence of concomitant conditions for which such treatment given in the absence of IV alteplase is known to provide substantial benefit or withholding such treatment is known to cause substantial risk, and supporting trials administered doses between 160 and 300 mg.

### Current evidence for endovascular therapy in stroke and remaining uncertainties [^112m1B8b]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Class 1 level A evidence now supports endovascular thrombectomy as best practice in the management of large vessel occlusion acute ischaemic stroke. However, significant questions pertaining to initial imaging, radiological assessment, patient selection and therapeutic limits remain unanswered. A specific cohort of patients who benefit from endovascular thrombectomy has been established, although current uncertainties regarding selection of those not meeting top-tier evidence criteria may potentially deny certain patients the benefit of intervention. This is of particular relevance in patients presenting in a delayed manner. Whilst superior outcomes are achieved with reduced time to endovascular reperfusion, denying patients intervention based on symptom duration alone may not be appropriate. Advanced understanding of ischaemic stroke pathophysiology supports an individualized approach to patient evaluation, given variance in the rate of ischaemic core progression and the extent of salvageable penumbra. Physiological imaging techniques may therefore be utilized to better inform patient selection for endovascular thrombectomy and evidence suggests that a transition from time-based to tissue-based therapeutic thresholds may be of greater value. Multiple ongoing randomized controlled trials aim to further define the benefit of endovascular thrombectomy and it is hoped that these results will advance, and possibly broaden, patient selection criteria to ensure that maximum benefit from the intervention may be achieved.

Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of recommendations in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Guidelines and are an update of the 2018 AIS Guidelines. Methods- Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. An update of the 2013 AIS Guidelines was originally published in January 2018. This guideline was approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and the AHA Executive Committee. In April 2018, a revision to these guidelines, deleting some recommendations, was published online by the AHA. The writing group was asked review the original document and revise if appropriate. In June 2018, the writing group submitted a document with minor changes and with inclusion of important newly published randomized controlled trials with > 100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS. The document was sent to 14 peer reviewers. The writing group evaluated the peer reviewers' comments and revised when appropriate. The current final document was approved by all members of the writing group except when relationships with industry precluded members from voting and by the governing bodies of the AHA. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/AHA 2015 Class of Recommendations and Level of Evidence and the new AHA guidelines format. Results- These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care in both the prehospital and hospital settings. Conclusions- These guidelines provide general recommendations based on the currently available evidence to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. In many instances, however, only limited data exist demonstrating the urgent need for continued research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

Management of acute stroke

State of the art

Acute stroke is a medical emergency. The benefit of recanalisation therapies in patients with acute ischaemic stroke is strongly time-dependent, with earlier intervention achieving better outcomes. Stroke care systems should therefore minimise the time to assessment and initiation of treatment, before brain injury becomes irreversible. All patients with ischaemic stroke or intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) benefit from specialist attention and organised care within a designated stroke unit (number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent poor outcome, 18) including rapid diagnostic imaging, probably due in part to the prevention or early treatment of complications such as infections and fever. Randomised trials testing strategies to prevent complications are ongoing.

For ischaemic stroke, aspirin ‒ started within two days of the onset of symptoms ‒ has a small benefit (NNT 79) but is suitable for a large number of patients. Although unproven, the benefit of early treatment with clopidogrel is probably comparable. In selected patients with acute ischaemic stroke or TIA, dual antiplatelet therapy in the first weeks confers additional benefit. Selected interventions, including intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) and hemicraniectomy, offer greater benefit but are applicable to fewer patients than antiplatelet therapy. Timely restoration of blood flow through intravenous thrombolysis (IVT, NNT 5‒9) or EVT (NNT 3) is the first priority. The earlier the treatment with IVT is initiated, the greater the benefit, irrespective of age or stroke severity. In patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of a proximal intracranial artery of the anterior circulation, EVT strongly increases the chance of a good outcome and, like alteplase, improves global functional outcomes. The initial evidence of benefit with EVT was largely limited to patients in whom treatment could be started within 6 h of symptom onset, but recent evidence suggests that, in highly selected patients with acute ischaemic stroke and considerable residual mismatch between perfusion deficit and infarct volume, EVT can offer benefit when used up to 24 h of symptom onset. In recent trials, EVT was associated with a 19% absolute reduction in the risk of a poor outcome, but nevertheless 29‒67% of the patients randomised to the intervention arm were dead or dependent at three months. –

Treat and Recover from Stroke Your stroke treatment begins the moment emergency medical services arrive to take you to the hospital. Once at the hospital, you may receive emergency care, treatment to prevent another stroke, rehabilitation to treat the side effects of stroke, or all three. Learn more about recovering from a stroke. Treating ischemic stroke If you get to the hospital within 3 hours of the first symptoms of an ischemic stroke, you may get a type of medicine called a thrombolytic to break up blood clots. Tissue plasminogen activator is a thrombolytic. tPA improves the chances of recovering from a stroke. Studies show that patients with ischemic strokes who receive tPA are more likely to recover fully or have less disability than patients who do not receive the drug. 2, 3 Patients treated with tPA are also less likely to need long-term care in a nursing home.
4.

Unfortunately, many stroke victims don't get to the hospital in time for tPA treatment. This is why it's so important to recognize the signs and symptoms of stroke right away and call 9–1–1. Doctors may also treat ischemic stroke with other medicines, such as blood thinners, as well as surgery to remove the clot. Treating Hemorrhagic Stroke Other medicines, surgery, or procedures may be needed to stop the bleeding from hemorrhagic stroke and save brain tissue. For example, Medicine, surgery, or other procedures may be needed to stop the bleeding and save brain tissue. For example: Endovascular procedures. Endovascular procedures, which can help repair a weak spot or break in a blood vessel, may be used to treat certain hemorrhagic strokes. Learn more about the procedure. Surgical treatment. Hemorrhagic strokes may be treated with surgery. If the bleeding is caused by a ruptured aneurysm, a metal clip may be put in place to stop the blood loss.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Organization and integration of stroke systems of care — All hospitals caring for patients within a stroke system of care should develop, adopt, and adhere to care protocols that reflect current care guidelines as established by national and international professional organizations and state and federal agencies and laws. Different services within a hospital that may be transferring patients through a continuum of care, as well as different hospitals that may be transferring patients to other facilities, should establish hand-off and transfer protocols and procedures that ensure safe and efficient patient care within and between facilities, and protocols for interhospital transfer of patients should be established and approved beforehand so that efficient patient transfers can be accomplished at all hours of the day and night. Mechanical thrombectomy requires the patient to be at an experienced stroke center with rapid access to cerebral angiography, qualified neurointerventionalists, and a comprehensive periprocedural care team, and systems should be designed, executed, and monitored to emphasize expeditious assessment and treatment and outcomes for all patients should be tracked with facilities encouraged to consider preestablished criteria for credentialing. It may be useful for primary stroke centers and other healthcare facilities that provide initial emergency care, including administration of IV alteplase, to develop the capability of performing emergency noninvasive intracranial vascular imaging to most appropriately select patients for transfer for mechanical thrombectomy and to reduce the time to mechanical thrombectomy.

### Diagnosis and management of acute ischaemic stroke [^111EagiB]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute ischaemic stroke is a major public health priority and will become increasingly relevant to neurologists of the future. The cornerstone of effective stroke care continues to be timely reperfusion treatment. This requires early recognition of symptoms by the public and first responders, triage to an appropriate stroke centre and efficient assessment and investigation by the attending stroke team. The aim of treatment is to achieve recanalisation and reperfusion of the ischaemic penumbra with intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular thrombectomy in appropriately selected patients. All patients should be admitted directly to an acute stroke unit for close monitoring for early neurological deterioration and prevention of secondary complications. Prompt investigation of the mechanism of stroke allows patients to start appropriate secondary preventative treatment. Future objectives include improving accessibility to endovascular thrombectomy, using advanced imaging to extend therapeutic windows and developing neuroprotective agents to prevent secondary neuronal damage.

Acute ischemic stroke — mild stroke: For otherwise eligible patients with mild but disabling stroke symptoms, IV alteplase is recommended for patients who can be treated within 3 hours of ischemic stroke symptom onset or patient last known well or at baseline state. For otherwise eligible patients with mild disabling stroke symptoms, IV alteplase may be reasonable for patients who can be treated within 3 and 4.5 hours of stroke symptom onset or patient last known well or at baseline state. For otherwise eligible patients with mild nondisabling stroke symptoms (NIHSS score 0–5), IV alteplase is not recommended for patients who could be treated within 3 hours of ischemic stroke symptom onset or patient last known well or at baseline state. For otherwise eligible patients with mild non-disabling stroke symptoms (NIHSS 0–5), IV alteplase is not recommended for patients who could be treated within 3 and 4.5 hours of ischemic stroke symptom onset or patient last known well or at baseline state.

### National stroke association guidelines for the management of transient ischemic attacks [^1152cNyM]. Annals of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Transient ischemic attacks are common and important harbingers of subsequent stroke. Management varies widely, and most published guidelines have not been updated in several years. We sought to create comprehensive, unbiased, evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with transient ischemic attacks.

Methods

Fifteen expert panelists were selected based on objective criteria, using publication metrics that predicted nomination by practitioners in the field. Prior published guidelines were identified through systematic review, and recommendations derived from them were rated independently for quality by the experts. Highest quality recommendations were selected and subsequently edited by the panelists using a modified Delphi approach with multiple iterations of questionnaires to reach consensus on new changes. Experts were provided systematic reviews of recent clinical studies and were asked to justify wording changes based on new evidence and to rate the final recommendations based on level of evidence and quality. No expert was allowed to contribute to recommendations on a topic for which there could be any perception of a conflict of interest.

Results

Of 257 guidelines documents identified by systematic review, 13 documents containing 137 recommendations met all entry criteria. Six iterations of questionnaires were required to reach consensus on wording of 53 final recommendations. Final recommendations covered initial management, evaluation, medical treatment, surgical treatment, and risk factor management.

Interpretation

The final recommendations on the care of patients with transient ischemic attacks emphasize the importance of urgent evaluation and treatment. The novel approach used to develop these guidelines is feasible, allows for rapid updating, and may reduce bias.

### The future of ischemic stroke diagnosis and a review of underrecognized ischemic stroke etiologies [^113ymuFk]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Accurate ischemic stroke etiologic determination and diagnosis form the foundation of excellent cerebrovascular care as from it stems initiation of the appropriate secondary prevention strategy as well as appropriate patient education regarding specific risk factors for that subtype. Recurrent stroke rates are highest among those patients who receive an incorrect initial stroke diagnosis. Patient distrust and patient reported depression are also higher. The cause of the ischemic stroke also informs predicted patient outcomes and the anticipated recovery trajectory. Finally, determining the accurate cause of the ischemic stroke provides the patient the opportunity to enroll in appropriate research studies studying mechanism, or targeting treatment approaches for that particular disease process. Advances in ischemic stroke research, imaging techniques, biomarkers, and the ability to rapidly perform genetic sequencing over the past decade have shown that classifying patients into large etiologic buckets may not always be appropriate and may represent one reason why some patients are labeled as cryptogenic, or for whom an underlying etiology is never found. Aside from the more traditional stroke mechanisms, there is new research emerging regarding clinical findings that are not normative, but the contributions to ischemic stroke are unclear. In this article, we first review the essential steps to accurate ischemic stroke etiologic classification and then transition to a discussion of embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) and other new entities that have been postulated as causal in ischemic stroke (i.e., genetics and subclinical atherosclerosis). We also discuss the limitations that are inherent in the current ischemic stroke diagnostic algorithms and finally review the most recent studies regarding more uncommon diagnoses and the future of stroke diagnostics and classification.

Objectives:

Concise "synthetic" review of the state of the art of management of acute ischemic stroke.

Data Sources:

Available literature on PubMed.

Study Selection:

We selected landmark studies, recent clinical trials, observational studies, and professional guidelines on the management of stroke including the last 10 years.

Data Extraction:

Eligible studies were identified and results leading to guideline recommendations were summarized.

Data Synthesis:

Stroke mortality has been declining over the past 6 decades, and as a result, stroke has fallen from the second to the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. This trend may follow recent advances in the management of stroke, which highlight the importance of early recognition and early revascularization. Recent studies have shown that early recognition, emergency interventional treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and treatment in dedicated stroke centers can significantly reduce stroke-related morbidity and mortality. However, stroke remains the second leading cause of death worldwide and the number one cause for acquired long-term disability, resulting in a global annual economic burden.

Conclusions:

Appropriate treatment of ischemic stroke is essential in the reduction of mortality and morbidity. Management of stroke involves a multidisciplinary approach that starts and extends beyond hospital admission.

3 When choosing an anti-hypertensive medication, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and thiazide diuretics have been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. 3 Although calcium channel blockers are first-line treatment options for hypertension, their effectiveness for the secondary prevention of stroke is unproven.
3. The AHA/ASA guidelines recommend atorvastatin, 80 mg per day, or rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day, to decrease the risk of recurrent stroke for patients with an atherosclerotic ischemic stroke and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level greater than 100 mg per dL. 3 Aspirin, clopidogrel, and the combination of aspirin, 25 mg, and extended-release dipyridamole, 200 mg, are indicated for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Short-term dual antiplatelet therapy can reduce the recurrence of some mild strokes. greater, the AHA/ASA guidelines recommend short-term treatment with aspirin, 81 mg per day, and clopidogrel, 75 mg per day, following initial loading doses of aspirin, 325 mg, and clopidogrel, 300 mg. Anti-platelet monotherapy or combination aspirin/dipyridamole therapy should be resumed indefinitely after 21 to 90 days. 3 A shorter 10- to 21-day course of dual antiplatelet therapy before monotherapy may provide a similar benefit while minimizing bleeding risk. 18 Use of dual antiplatelet therapy beyond 90 days confers no further risk reduction for prevention of recurrent stroke compared with single antiplatelet therapy but significantly increases bleeding risk.
18. Long-term antiplatelet therapy regimens can include aspirin, 50 to 325 mg once per day; clopidogrel, 75 mg once per day; or combination aspirin, 25 mg, and extended-release dipyridamole, 200 mg, twice per day. 19–21 Triple antiplatelet therapy should be avoided.

3 It is unclear whether patients already taking aspirin at the time of noncardioembolic stroke or TIA benefit from increasing the dosage or changing to a different antiplatelet therapy. 3.

### Initial assessment and triage of the stroke patient [^117Rtqo9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Nearly 800,000 strokes occur in the United States each year, and stroke is the leading cause of preventable permanent disability. Timely recognition and treatment are imperative to reduce stroke-related morbidity and mortality. Given the evidence supporting intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy for ischemic stroke, stroke symptoms must be rapidly identified and mimics quickly excluded prior to therapeutic decisions. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is recommended for all qualified patients and patients with presentations suggesting large vessel occlusion should be evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy. Time to treatment is the most important prognostic factor for clinical outcome, highlighting the importance of reliable and efficient local and regional systems of care.

### Advances in treatments for acute ischemic stroke [^113VYrZj]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke is a leading global cause of death and disability. Intravenous thrombolysis was the first acute treatment developed for ischemic strokes. First with alteplase and now with tenecteplase, intravenous thrombolysis has remained a cornerstone of acute ischemic stroke management. In large vessel occlusions, endovascular thrombectomy has become the standard of care in acute stroke management for anterior and posterior circulation strokes. The boundaries for these treatments have expanded, which has improved outcomes in patients who were previously ineligible. This review summarizes the latest advances in interventions for acute ischemic stroke, extending beyond existing guidelines and review articles to explore emerging strategies and treatments currently under investigation.

Although stroke declined from the third to fifth most common cause of death in the United States, the annual incidence and overall prevalence continue to increase. Since the available US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options are time dependent, improving early stroke care may have more of a public health impact than any other phase of care. Timely and efficient stroke treatment should be a priority for emergency department and prehospital providers. This article discusses currently available and emerging treatment options in acute ischemic stroke focusing on the preservation of salvageable brain tissue, minimizing complications, and secondary prevention.

Conclusion

Stroke medicine has evolved rapidly in the past 30 years, epitomised by the considerable difference that mechanical thrombectomy has made to the lives of patients. In the early 2000s, the emphasis was on proving that thrombectomy was safe and possible. The HERMES collaboration justified its superiority and use in a tightly selected cohort of patients. In the past seven years, we have come a long way in expanding the initial selection criteria. As our technology, infrastructure, and understanding improves, the most pressing priority now is equal access for all appropriate patients, for this ground breaking treatment.

Questions for future research

Is mechanical thrombectomy effective in comparison to best medical treatment in patients presenting with minor stroke syndromes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale < 6)?
Is mechanical thrombectomy effective in comparison to best medical treatment in patients identified to have either primary or secondary medium vessel occlusion?
Is mechanical thrombectomy effective in patients who have moderate to severe disability before stroke?
What are the most effective interventions for patients presenting with tandem occlusions?

### Treatment of acute ischemic stroke [^117E6hPN]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of adult disability. The direct and indirect costs of stroke care exceed $51 billion annually. In 1996, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first treatment for acute ischemic stroke, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. Later that year, the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (a branch of the National Institutes of Health) convened a consensus conference on the Rapid Identification and Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke, setting goals for stroke care in the United States. Since then, it has become imperative that emergency physicians understand the pathophysiology of stroke, the basis and rationale for treatment, and the therapeutic approaches. This article reviews the state of the art of acute stroke treatment, its foundation, as well as its future.

Even though stroke presents as a variety of clinical syndromes, neuroimaging is the most important biomarker to help differentiate between stroke subtypes and assess treatment eligibility. Therapeutic advances have led to intravenous thrombolysis with tissue-type plasminogen activator and endovascular treatment for proximal vessel occlusion in the anterior cerebral circulation being standard care for acute ischaemic stroke. Providing access to this care has implications for existing systems of care for stroke and their organisation and has reintroduced the possibility of adjuvant and neuroprotective treatment strategies in acute ischaemic stroke. The use of neuroimaging for patient selection and speed of diagnosis and delivery of treatment are the dominant themes of modern ischaemic stroke care.

Acute ischemic stroke — IV alteplase general principles state that in patients eligible for IV alteplase, benefit of therapy is time dependent, and treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible (I A). In patients undergoing fibrinolytic therapy, physicians should be prepared to treat potential emergent adverse effects, including bleeding complications and angioedema that may cause partial airway obstruction (I B-NR). The potential risks should be discussed during IV alteplase eligibility deliberation and weighed against the anticipated benefits during decision-making (I C-EO). Treating clinicians should be aware that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may mimic acute stroke presentations and determine blood glucose levels before IV alteplase initiation, and IV alteplase is not indicated for nonvascular conditions (III: No Benefit B-NR). Because time from onset of symptoms to treatment has such a powerful impact on outcomes, treatment with IV alteplase should not be delayed to monitor for further improvement (III: Harm C-EO).

Early stroke management, and early initiation of secondary stroke prevention, may improve outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, < 10% of patients with acute ischemic stroke arrive at the receiving hospital within 3 hours of symptom onset. Factors such as poor public awareness of symptoms, lack of rapid detection by emergency medical services (EMS), poor coordination between EMS and the hospital emergency department, or delay of diagnosis on arrival at the emergency department are all contributing factors in the failure to provide prompt diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke. This article focuses on the critical steps in diagnosing ischemic stroke, starting at the initial patient evaluation by emergency personnel. Stroke mimics and different imaging techniques that may be used in the differential diagnosis and evaluation of acute ischemic stroke are also discussed.

### Management of ischemic stroke: part 1. emergency room management [^113Rxj6E]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute ischemic stroke is commonly encountered by the hospitalist. There have been dramatic changes in our ability to care for these patients acutely. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) primary stroke center certification has become progressively more important to institutions nationally and includes many aspects of initial evaluation and treatment.

Purpose

Acute treatment involves the rapid assimilation of patient characteristics, laboratory results, and imaging results. There are a growing number of potential acute therapies with a range of risk, benefit, necessary time windows, and specific eligibility criteria.

Data Sources

Primary trials, current guidelines.

Conclusions

The hospitalist is well-positioned to play a major role in the treatment of stroke patients as well as the systems work that aids in the management of this population.

Acute ischemic stroke — statin therapy implementation recommendations include the following: A clinician-patient risk discussion is recommended before initiation of statin therapy to review net clinical benefit, weighing the potential for ASCVD risk reduction against the potential for statin-associated side effects, statin-drug interactions, and safety, while emphasizing that side effects can be addressed successfully. In patients with indication for statin therapy, identification of potential predisposing factors for statin-associated side effects, including new-onset diabetes mellitus and statin-associated muscle symptoms, is recommended before initiation of treatment. In patients with statin-associated side effects that are not severe, it is recommended to reassess and to rechallenge to achieve a maximal LDL-C lowering by modified dosing regimen, an alternate statin or in combination with nonstatin therapy. In patients at increased ASCVD risk with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms or recurrent statin-associated muscle symptoms despite appropriate statin rechallenge, it is reasonable to use RCT-proven nonstatin therapy that is likely to provide net clinical benefit.

Evidence-based medicine has emerged as a valuable tool to guide clinical decision-making, by summarizing the best possible evidence for both diagnostic and treatment strategies. Imaging plays a critical role in the evaluation and treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke, especially those who are being considered for thrombolytic or endovascular therapy. Time from stroke-symptom onset to treatment is a strong predictor of long-term functional outcome after stroke. Therefore, imaging and treatment decisions must occur rapidly in this setting, while minimizing unnecessary delays in treatment. The aim of this review was to summarize the best available evidence for the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Acute ischemic stroke — eligibility for IV alteplase includes time windows, dosing, age and clinical criteria, and physiologic/imaging thresholds. Within 3 h, IV alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (maximum dose 90 mg over 60 min with initial 10% of dose given as bolus over 1 min) is recommended for selected patients; among otherwise medically eligible patients ≥ 18 y of age, administration within 3 h is equally recommended for patients ≤ 80 and > 80 y of age; for severe stroke, IV alteplase is indicated within 3 h; and for otherwise eligible patients with mild but disabling symptoms, IV alteplase is recommended if they can be treated within 3 h of symptom onset or last known well/baseline state. Between 3 and 4.5 h, the same dosing is recommended for selected patients, and in this window treatment is recommended for those ≤ 80 y of age, without a history of both diabetes mellitus and prior stroke, NIHSS score ≤ 25, not taking any OACs, and without imaging evidence of ischemic injury involving more than one-third of the MCA territory. Treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible within these time frames. IV alteplase is recommended in patients with BP < 185/110 mm Hg or when BP can be lowered safely to this level, in otherwise eligible patients with initial glucose levels > 50 mg/dL, and when noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) shows early ischemic changes of mild to moderate extent other than frank hypodensity.

### Stroke intervention: catheter-based therapy for acute ischemic stroke [^115e5M2t]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The majority (> 80%) of the three-quarters of a million strokes that will occur in the United States this year are ischemic in nature. The treatment of acute ischemic stroke is very similar to acute myocardial infarction, which requires timely reperfusion therapy for optimal results. The majority of patients with acute ischemic stroke do not receive any form of reperfusion therapy, unlike patients with acute myocardial infarction. Improving outcomes for acute stroke will require patient education to encourage early presentation, an aggressive expansion of qualified hospitals, and willing providers and early imaging strategies to match patients with their best options for reperfusion therapy to minimize complications.
