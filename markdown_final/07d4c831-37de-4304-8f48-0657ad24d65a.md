## Question

What is the appropriate workup for low back pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate workup for low back pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and examination that triage risk. Then, I should verify which red flags genuinely change pretest probability. Next, I will classify the back pain phenotype to guide imaging decisions. After that, I need to lay out the imaging strategy, including immediate versus delayed indications. Then, I will review first-line conservative management and prognostic stratification. Finally, I should confirm follow-up checkpoints, special scenarios, and known evidence gaps that could alter decisions along the way, with citations supporting each step.

> Let me first confirm the focused initial assessment that anchors everything, because if I miss this, downstream choices about imaging and treatment will be off. I need onset and duration (acute, subacute, chronic), pain location and radiation, red-flag symptoms, trauma and osteoporosis risks, cancer and infection risks, past episodes, functional impact, and psychosocial drivers like fear-avoidance and catastrophization that shape prognosis and care pathways. On examination, I should check vitals, spinal inspection and palpation, gait, and a targeted neurologic exam including strength, sensation, reflexes, and straight leg raise when radiculopathy is suspected. I should remember that several commonly cited exam maneuvers and localization heuristics have insufficient diagnostic accuracy and should not be over-weighted in isolation, so I need to be cautious about overinterpreting them at baseline [^115G2Ryv] [^112zscUj] [^115AUe5N] [^112xTTUU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about red flags; I should verify which ones truly shift post-test probabilities for serious pathology. Severe or progressive neurologic deficits, cauda equina features, infection risk (fever, immunosuppression, IVDU), cancer history or systemic signs, and fracture risk factors (older age, trauma, chronic steroids, osteoporosis) warrant immediate imaging pathways, but wait, I need to emphasize that individual red flags often have limited accuracy and are best considered in combinations and in context. For example, a history of malignancy meaningfully raises the probability of spinal cancer, and steroid use or contusion substantially raises fracture risk, whereas "night pain" alone is weak and often misleading. I should double-check that my threshold for action reflects the aggregate risk, not any single nonspecific red flag [^113o9wQM] [^115fawnV] [^1176v4Lu] [^111YZq4y].

> Next, I will classify the presentation, because management hinges on this triage. The three broad groups are nonspecific low back pain, back pain with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, and back pain with a specific spinal cause such as fracture, infection, malignancy, or inflammatory spondyloarthritis. Let me verify that this categorization flows directly from the targeted history and physical, since most patients fall into the nonspecific category and should not be imaged routinely unless the phenotype or risk profile evolves or treatment decisions demand it [^111fPrGs] [^115G2Ryv] [^112BNubN].

> I will now examine the imaging strategy, and I need to ensure I do not overuse imaging in uncomplicated cases. For acute nonspecific low back pain without red flags, routine imaging offers no clinical benefit and can cause harm through incidental findings and downstream procedures, so I should avoid it. Immediate MRI is indicated when red flags are present, especially suspected cancer, infection, cauda equina syndrome, or substantial/progressive neurologic deficits. For fracture risk in older adults, those on chronic steroids, osteoporosis, or low-velocity trauma, plain radiographs may be reasonable adjuncts, but MRI clarifies occult fracture and neural element compromise. For subacute or chronic symptoms persisting beyond about six weeks despite optimal management in a patient who might undergo intervention, MRI without contrast is appropriate. But wait, let me verify postoperative scenarios and immunosuppression: in prior lumbar surgery with new or progressive deficits, or with suspected infection or cancer, MRI with or without contrast is justified early. These thresholds align across ACR, NICE, ACP/APS, AAFP, and Choosing Wisely consensus [^113sgg8c] [^1151j7Un] [^116BxmRG] [^114UwfEa] [^1132T4Ju] [^116NfdxE] [^112xTTUU] [^1163LDmg] [^112TNJNZ].

> Let me consider thoracic pain briefly, because I should confirm when back pain above the lumbar region changes the plan. If myelopathy or thoracic radiculopathy is suspected, MRI without contrast is the first imaging step; in older adults or those with osteoporosis, chronic steroids, or low-velocity trauma, radiographs and often CT or MRI are appropriate. With suspected thoracic cancer, infection, or immunosuppression, MRI with or without contrast is indicated early, and CT may be added for bony detail when needed. I need to ensure the thoracic algorithm mirrors the same principle: no routine imaging unless red flags or neurologic signs are present or specific management depends on it [^113oyNgG] [^113YVuoR] [^111xBR72] [^114Lq71v] [^115WBXRw].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative management for nonspecific low back pain, and I need to check that I prioritize nonpharmacologic options. Education with reassurance, activity as tolerated, heat, and exercise-based therapies are foundational, and mind-body and psychological therapies are appropriate for persistent symptoms. If medication is necessary, NSAIDs are first-line, and opioids should be avoided or used sparingly for very short durations if absolutely required, as prolonged early opioid use worsens disability risks. Let me verify that this matches ACP 2017 and contemporary primary care guidance, emphasizing early mobilization and avoiding routine imaging while symptoms improve with conservative care [^112osGiQ] [^115crRCd] [^112xTTUU] [^111u7ABT].

> I should double-check prognostic stratification because it can refine care and timing of escalation. Early identification of high-risk patients via validated tools and clinical judgment supports targeted psychosocial and functional interventions to reduce chronicity. The STarT Back tool and similar prognostic instruments can help segment risk, and NASS highlights psychosocial and workplace factors as prognostic indicators for return to work. But wait, I should verify that risk tools complement, not replace, clinical assessment, and that follow-up is used to recalibrate risk as the clinical course unfolds [^117G6wyg] [^117FJhD2] [^116yVXPS].

> Now, I need to ensure follow-up checkpoints are explicit. At about 4 to 6 weeks, if symptoms have meaningfully improved, I should continue self-management and graded activity. If they have not improved or have progressed, I should re-screen for red flags, reconsider the phenotype, and, in patients who are candidates for intervention, obtain lumbar MRI without contrast to guide next steps. For persistent symptoms at three months, I should pivot to a multidisciplinary plan emphasizing function, psychosocial contributors, and work participation, escalating to specialty referral as indicated. Let me verify that these thresholds are consistent with ACR and AAFP recommendations on delayed imaging tied to management decisions [^1151j7Un] [^112xTTUU].

> But wait, what about the harms of imaging and patient expectations, since these can derail high-value care. Routine imaging in uncomplicated cases does not improve pain or function and can promulgate unnecessary procedures and anxiety due to incidental findings; addressing expectations with clear education is necessary to avoid low-value testing. I should confirm that selective imaging is a patient-safety and stewardship strategy, not simple rationing, and cite the RCT meta-analysis showing no benefit from immediate imaging in uncomplicated low back pain [^112TNJNZ] [^114hvKiN] [^11581kLH] [^111AMUxe].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios that warrant deviation from routine pathways. Suspected cauda equina syndrome requires emergent MRI and surgical consultation. New or progressive neurologic deficits, suspected spinal infection or malignancy, and postoperative patients with worsening neurologic status also require prompt MRI with or without contrast and expedited specialty input. I need to ensure this remains aligned with ACR 2021 criteria for urgent imaging triggers and not delay imaging while conservative measures are attempted in these high-risk profiles [^116BxmRG] [^114UwfEa] [^116NfdxE].

> Let me summarize the clinical flow in prose so I can check for gaps. Start with targeted history and exam to categorize phenotype and screen for red flags; if no red flags and acute nonspecific pain, proceed with education, activity, and nonpharmacologic care, reserving medications for symptom relief and avoiding routine imaging. Reassess at 4 to 6 weeks; if improved, continue; if persistent or progressive and the patient is a candidate for intervention, obtain MRI and consider referral. At any point, if red flags for serious pathology emerge or deficits progress, pivot to immediate imaging and disease-specific pathways. Throughout, address psychosocial risks and functional goals to reduce chronicity, using validated tools to guide intensity of care [^115G2Ryv] [^1132T4Ju] [^1151j7Un] [^112osGiQ] [^112xTTUU] [^1163LDmg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should acknowledge evidence limitations and places where my confidence should be tempered. Many individual red flags have limited or untested diagnostic accuracy, so I should avoid binary yes/no thresholds and instead weigh cumulative risk and combinations, with "history of malignancy" and "strong clinical suspicion" among the more informative features. Likewise, several diagnostic maneuvers and tests, including axial-loaded MRI and various diagnostic blocks, have insufficient evidence to guide routine use. The absence of red flags does not entirely exclude serious pathology, so persistent or atypical courses require clinical vigilance and sometimes reevaluation of pretest probabilities over time [^113o9wQM] [^1176v4Lu] [^117XjGNi] [^115AUe5N] [^111xCq7q] [^117VrR4S].

> I should confirm one common pitfall and self-correct it explicitly: it is tempting to treat "night pain" as a strong malignancy signal and to image immediately on that basis alone, but wait, let me verify accuracy data. The empirical support for "night pain" as a standalone red flag is weak, with high false positive rates in the absence of corroborating features such as history of cancer, systemic symptoms, or focal neurologic deficits, so I should not elevate it above more predictive red flags or combinations without context. This course correction prevents unnecessary imaging and ensures that when imaging is pursued, it is justified by a materially increased probability of serious disease [^113o9wQM] [^114cbAFE] [^111YZq4y].

The low back pain workup begins with a **focused history and physical exam** to identify **red flags** (malignancy, infection, fracture, cauda equina) and neurologic deficits [^112zscUj] [^112BNubN]. Routine imaging is **not indicated** for nonspecific low back pain; obtain MRI for red flags, severe or progressive neurologic deficits, or persistent symptoms after 6 weeks of conservative care [^112xTTUU] [^1151j7Un]. Use **X-ray or CT only** when fracture is suspected or MRI is contraindicated [^113sgg8c]. Reserve **laboratory testing** for suspected infection, malignancy, or inflammatory disease. Most cases are managed **conservatively** with reassurance, activity, and nonpharmacologic therapies; refer to specialists for persistent or severe cases [^112xTTUU] [^112osGiQ].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A **focused history and physical examination are essential** to categorize patients into the following broad groups:

- **Nonspecific low back pain**: Most common, no identifiable specific cause [^112zscUj].

- **Radiculopathy or spinal stenosis**: Nerve root involvement or spinal canal narrowing [^112zscUj].

- **Specific spinal causes**: Malignancy, infection, fracture, or inflammatory disease [^112BNubN].

---

### Red flags indicating serious underlying conditions

Red flags are **critical** for identifying patients with potentially serious underlying conditions that require immediate attention:

| **Condition** | **Red flags** |
|-|-|
| Malignancy | - History of cancer <br/> - Unexplained weight loss <br/> - Age > 50 years <br/> - Failure to improve after 4–6 weeks [^112BNubN] [^113o9wQM] |
| Infection | - Fever <br/> - Recent infection <br/> - Immunosuppression <br/> - IV drug use [^112BNubN] |
| Fracture | - Significant trauma <br/> - Osteoporosis <br/> - Prolonged corticosteroid use <br/> - Age > 65 years [^112BNubN] [^113o9wQM] |
| Cauda equina syndrome | - Saddle anesthesia <br/> - Bowel/bladder dysfunction <br/> - Severe or progressive neurological deficits [^112BNubN] |

---

### Physical examination components

**Inspection** assesses posture, gait, and deformities, while palpation evaluates tenderness and muscle spasm. Range of motion is tested in flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation. The **neurologic examination** includes motor strength, sensory testing, reflexes, and the straight-leg raise test.

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Imaging is **not routinely recommended** for nonspecific low back pain without red flags or neurologic deficits and should be **reserved for specific clinical indications**:

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** |
|-|-|
| MRI | - Suspected malignancy <br/> - Infection <br/> - Cauda equina syndrome <br/> - Severe or progressive neurological deficits <br/> - Persistent symptoms after 6 weeks of conservative treatment [^112xTTUU] [^1151j7Un] |
| X-ray | - Suspected fracture <br/> - Significant trauma <br/> - Osteoporosis <br/> - Chronic corticosteroid use [^113sgg8c] |
| CT scan | - Suspected fracture <br/> - MRI contraindicated [^113sgg8c] |

---

## Laboratory tests

Laboratory tests are **not routinely indicated** for nonspecific low back pain and should be considered only when specific conditions are suspected:

- **Infection**: CBC, ESR, CRP, blood cultures.

- **Malignancy**: CBC, ESR, CRP, specific tumor markers.

- **Inflammatory disease**: HLA-B27, rheumatoid factor, ANA.

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause and symptom severity**:

- **Nonspecific low back pain**: Conservative management, reassurance, activity modification, physical therapy, analgesics.

- **Radiculopathy or spinal stenosis**: Conservative management initially; consider epidural steroid injections or surgery if symptoms persist.

- **Specific spinal causes**: Immediate referral to specialists, surgical intervention, or specific medical treatment.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is **essential** to monitor progress, assess treatment response, and identify any emerging red flags or complications. Persistent or worsening symptoms despite conservative management warrant further evaluation and possible specialist referral.

---

The low back pain workup emphasizes a **focused history and physical examination** to identify red flags and neurologic deficits. Imaging and laboratory testing are reserved for specific indications, and most cases are managed conservatively.

Acute back pain is a common presenting complaint in the emergency department, leading to significant resource utilization. The differential diagnosis is extensive, with most cases caused by benign pathology that resolves independently. Imaging is often overused and rarely beneficial. This article presents an algorithmic approach using red flags in the history and physical examination. This approach assists physicians in better identifying the small subset of patients with serious conditions that, if untreated, could result in significant neurological damage.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain [^116Lmq5o]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This article presents an evidence-based algorithm to assist primary care providers with the diagnosis and management of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. It is part of a series that focuses on coexisting pain patterns and contributors to chronic low back pain (CLBP) in the aging population. The objective of the series is to encourage clinicians to take a holistic approach when evaluating and treating CLBP in older adults.

- **Methods**: A content expert panel and a primary care panel collaboratively used the modified Delphi approach to iteratively develop an evidence-based diagnostic and treatment algorithm. The panelists included physiatrists, geriatricians, internists, and physical therapists who treat both civilians and veterans. The algorithm was developed so that all required resources are available within the Veterans Health Administration system. An illustrative patient case was chosen from one of the author's clinical practices to demonstrate the reasoning behind principles presented in the algorithm.

- **Results**: An algorithm was developed which logically outlines evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. A case is presented which highlights the potential complexities of identifying the true pain generator and the importance of implementing proper treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults can contribute to and coexist with CLBP. Distinguishing the true cause(s) of pain from potentially a myriad of asymptomatic degenerative changes can be challenging.

### The need for multidimensional stratification of chronic low back pain (LBP) [^116uhMhf]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

To enable stratified management, easily identifiable group-specific factors, with potentially unique underlying etiology, may inform pragmatic changes to assessment, clinical diagnosis, and treatment approaches for LBP patients in primary care. For example, classification systems associated with easy-to-identify patient epidemiologic factors such as age, sex, body mass index, and concurrent medical and/or psychological conditions may enable or enhance subclassification of LBP patients. The primary objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess which existing simple primary care LBP stratification schema is associated with distinct subpopulations as characterized by these easily identifiable primary epidemiological factors. With a schema identified, we further investigated whether the alternative stratification systems contributed independently to grouping in this schema.

### Can screening instruments accurately determine poor outcome risk in adults with recent onset low back pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117G6wyg]. BMC Medicine (2017). High credibility.

A trend in health service delivery towards the provision of stratified models of care offers potential to optimize treatment benefits, reduce harms, and maximize healthcare efficiency. Stratified approaches aim to match patients to the most appropriate care pathways based on their presentation. A common approach bases stratification on patients' prognostic profile, which requires early, accurate screening using a valid and reliable instrument. By doing so, care decisions aim to offer treatment to those who need it most and avoid over-treatment of those who need it least.

Better matching of patients to care is particularly important for a condition as burdensome as low back pain (LBP). The prognosis of chronic LBP — when symptoms persist beyond three months — is poor. This warrants a focus on the potential for intervention to be appropriately targeted prior to the development of chronic pain. Improved understanding of factors associated with chronic LBP has led to the development of self-report questionnaires containing multiple variables known to have prognostic relevance.

- **Prognostic screening instruments (PSIs)**: Also referred to as predictive tools, these assess certain characteristics of an individual's pain experience (including pain intensity and functional impairment) and certain psychosocial factors (e.g. beliefs, catastrophization, anxiety, and depression). These prognostic variables have been shown to be associated with specific outcome measures and timeframes.

PSIs are widely recommended to inform the management of LBP, with updated international guidelines suggesting their use early in the treatment process.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® low back pain: 2021 update [^116NfdxE]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for low back pain, specifically in relation to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2021 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a lumbar spine X-ray and MRI, with or without IV contrast, as the initial imaging in patients with low back pain (with or without radiculopathy) who have a history of lumbar surgery and present with new or progressing symptoms or clinical findings.

### Cost-effectiveness of guideline-endorsed treatments for low back pain: A systematic review [^116QxTEg]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) is a common health condition that affects most adults at some point during their lifetime. For most patients in primary care, the source of symptoms cannot be specified, and the patient receives the label of non-specific LBP. Exceptions include those with back pain associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis and the rare patients whose LBP can be attributed to a disease or condition such as fracture, tumor, or infection. Recently, the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society published a joint clinical guideline recommending treatments for non-specific LBP:

- **Evidence-based information**: Provide information on prognosis and advise patients to remain active while offering effective self-care options. This is referred to as advice for the rest of the paper.

- **Medications with proven benefits**: Consider using medications only if they have demonstrated benefits.

- **For patients who do not improve**:
	- **Acute LBP**: Consider the addition of spinal manipulation.
	- **Sub-acute or chronic LBP**: Consider interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise, acupuncture, massage, spinal manipulation, yoga, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or relaxation.

These recommendations largely align with other international guidelines and are based on extensive research concerning the effectiveness of treatments for LBP. For instance, the latest issue of The Cochrane Library contains over 30 Cochrane systematic reviews of interventions for LBP. In contrast, until the 2009 British guideline, LBP guidelines contained little information on treatment effectiveness.

### Management of children presenting with low back pain to emergency department [^116Q7AJs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

We aimed to describe characteristics, etiology, and health care use in children with low back pain (LBP) presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED) and to develop an algorithm to design a diagnostic approach.

- **Methods**: We conducted a 7-year cohort study of children admitted to the ED with a primary complaint of LBP. They were classified into diagnostic groups: visceral LBP, traumatic LBP, and non-visceral/non-traumatic LBP. To identify high-risk factors (red flags) associated with severe prognosis conditions (SPCs), we analyzed the non-visceral/non-traumatic group comparing the SPC children with those without SPCs.

- **Results**: Our population comprised 140 females (52.6%) and 126 males (47.4%), with a median age of 10.5 years. Eighty children (30.3%) were hospitalized, with an average length of stay of 8.53 ± 9.84 days. SPCs accounted for 28 patients (18.9%) of the overall 148 with non-traumatic/non-visceral LBP. In this group, SPCs presented with earlier onset and longer duration of symptoms than non-SPCs. The presence of red flags was more significant in the SPCs group, 28 vs 18; 100% vs 15% (p < 0.001); sensitivity 100%, specificity 85%. Among SPCs, 78.6% were hospitalized vs non-SPC (16.8%) (p < 0.001). Within the SPC group, two patients returned because of the onset of red flags.

- **Conclusion**: Our study identified significant high-risk factors (red flags) associated with serious outcomes (SPC group) compared to the non-SPC group, thereby ensuring specific treatment. We developed an algorithm based on previous literature and the findings of our study, which will need future validation.

### Clinical management and the duration of disability for work-related low back pain [^1136uFAR]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend a conservative approach to the management of acute low back pain (LBP). The present study sought to determine whether healthcare utilization and the physician's initial management of work-related LBP were associated with disability duration. Clinical management information was obtained for 98 randomly selected workers' compensation claimants with acute, uncomplicated, disabling work-related LBP. The length of disability was based on indemnity (wage replacement) payments. Disability was significantly associated with increased utilization of specialty referrals (P = 0.013) and provider visits (P < 0.001), use of magnetic resonance imaging (P = 0.003), and use of opioids for more than 7 days (P = 0.013).

- **Effects of early diagnostic imaging**: Effects on length of disability were observed (P = 0.001). Patients whose treatment course did not involve extended opioid use and early diagnostic testing were 3.78 times more likely (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 8.9) to have gone off disability status by the end of the study. The nature of the association between these initial clinical management aspects and LBP disability duration merits further exploration.

### Diagnostic imaging for low back pain: Advice for high-value health care from the American College of Physicians [^114hvKiN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging is indicated for patients with low back pain only if they have severe progressive neurologic deficits or signs or symptoms that suggest a serious or specific underlying condition. In other patients, evidence indicates that routine imaging is not associated with clinically meaningful benefits but can lead to harms. Addressing inefficiencies in diagnostic testing could minimize potential harms to patients and have a large effect on the use of resources by reducing both direct and downstream costs. In this area, more testing does not equate to better care. Implementing a selective approach to low back imaging, as suggested by the American College of Physicians and American Pain Society guideline on low back pain, would provide better care to patients, improve outcomes, and reduce costs.

### Triage for nonspecific lower-back pain [^112QNZGQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unremitting lower-back pain has long been a costly and personally devastating problem in society. Guidelines for the treatment of lower-back pain have provided evidence-based recommendations to help identify patients who will benefit from specific types of treatment in an effort to reduce costs and human suffering. However, there is little evidence that these guidelines are being applied in the daily practice of health care providers. Practical information is required to assist health care providers in triaging patients for specific treatments so that interventions can be targeted only to those who need them. In this way, iatrogenic complications and unnecessary costs can be contained. This chapter provides information on how to triage the patient with nonspecific lower-back pain for optimal care. The recommendations are supported by evidence-based guidelines, and when these are not available, best practice principles. Because appropriate treatment varies depending on the length of time a patient is suffering from lower-back pain, the chapter is divided into recommendations for acute, subacute, chronic, and recurrent phases of lower-back pain.

- **Level of evidence**: Level V (expert opinion). See the guidelines for authors for a complete description of the levels of evidence.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain [^115fawnV]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

What are the best red flags to indicate the possibility of fracture or malignancy in patients presenting with low back pain in primary, secondary, or tertiary care?

Older age, prolonged corticosteroid use, severe trauma, and the presence of a contusion or abrasion increase the likelihood of spinal fracture. The likelihood is higher with multiple red flags. Additionally, a history of malignancy increases the likelihood of spinal malignancy.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: Systematic review [^113o9wQM]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence regarding the diagnostic accuracy of red flag signs and symptoms in screening for fractures or malignancies in patients with low back pain across primary, secondary, and tertiary care settings.

Data sources for this review included Medline, OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL, covering publications available up to October 1, 2013. The inclusion criteria focused on primary diagnostic studies that compared red flags for fractures or malignancies against an accepted reference standard, regardless of language.

The review methods involved three independent assessors who evaluated study quality and extracted data. They also calculated diagnostic accuracy statistics and post-test probabilities for each red flag.

Results from the review incorporated 14 studies: eight from primary care, two from secondary care, and four from tertiary care that assessed a total of 53 red flags. Only five studies examined combinations of red flags. Data pooling was not possible due to heterogeneity of the index tests. Many red flags mentioned in guidelines either do not significantly alter the probability of detecting fractures or malignancies or have unverified diagnostic accuracy. Red flags linked with the highest post-test probability for fracture detection included:

- **Older age**: 9% (95% confidence interval 3% to 25%).
- **Prolonged use of corticosteroid drugs**: 33% (10% to 67%).
- **Severe trauma**: 11% (8% to 16%).
- **Presence of a contusion or abrasion**: 62% (49% to 74%).

The likelihood of a spinal fracture increased with multiple red flags present, reaching a probability of 90% (34% to 99%). The red flag associated with the highest post-test probability for identifying spinal malignancy was a history of malignancy, estimated at 33%.

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^111XafBa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Low back pain is a common symptom affecting individuals of all ages and socioeconomic statuses. In 2017, the worldwide point prevalence of low back pain — covering acute, subacute, and chronic conditions — was 7.83% (95% CI 7.04 to 8.64), equating to 577 million people affected at any given time. That same year, low back pain accounted for approximately 65 million years lived with disability, marking a deteriorative increase of about 17.5% since 2007, primarily due to population growth and ageing. This increase was most significant in low-income and middle-income countries. Individuals are more often compelled to leave their jobs because of low back pain than due to diabetes, hypertension, neoplasms, asthma, or heart and respiratory diseases combined. In the United States, about one in four adults experienced low back pain for at least 24 hours in the previous three months, with 7.6% reporting at least one episode of severe acute low back pain over a one-year period. Moderate-to-severe pain, alongside the impairment of motor and psychological functions caused by low back pain, frequently prompts individuals to seek medical consultations from general practitioners.

Despite its high prevalence, low back pain generally has a good prognosis. While identifying a specific cause for low back pain is rare, mechanical, non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP) is the most prevalent form. Most episodes of acute and subacute NS-LBP show significant improvement within six weeks, with average pain intensity reducing to moderate levels (6 on a 100-point scale; 95% CI 3 to 10) by 12 months. Nevertheless, two-thirds of individuals with low back pain continue to experience pain three months post-onset (67%, 95% CI 50% to 83%) and even after 12 months.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for low back pain, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2021 guidelines recommend considering obtaining lumbar spine MRI with or without IV contrast as initial imaging in patients with LBP (with or without radiculopathy) and ≥ 1 of the following:

- **Suspicion of cancer**: This warrants careful evaluation using advanced imaging techniques.
- **Infection**: Prompt imaging can assist in the diagnosis and management of potential infectious processes.
- **Immunosuppression**: Special considerations should be made in immunocompromised patients to rule out serious underlying conditions.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^112YxJqA]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This article presents an evidence-based algorithm to assist primary care providers with the diagnosis and management of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. It is part of a series that focuses on coexisting pain patterns and contributors to chronic low back pain (CLBP) in the aging population. The objective of the series is to encourage clinicians to take a holistic approach when evaluating and treating CLBP in older adults.

- **Methods**: A content expert panel and a primary care panel collaboratively used the modified Delphi approach to iteratively develop an evidence-based diagnostic and treatment algorithm. The panelists included physiatrists, geriatricians, internists, and physical therapists who treat both civilians and Veterans. The algorithm was developed so that all required resources are available within the Veterans Health Administration system. An illustrative patient case was chosen from one of the author's clinical practices to demonstrate the reasoning behind principles presented in the algorithm.

- **Results**: An algorithm was developed which logically outlines evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. A case is presented which highlights the potential complexities of identifying the true pain generator and the importance of implementing proper treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults can contribute to and coexist with CLBP. Distinguishing the true cause(s) of pain from potentially a myriad of asymptomatic degenerative changes can be challenging.

### Evaluating and managing acute low back pain in the primary care setting [^115fTqge]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Acute low back pain is a common reason for patient calls or visits to a primary care clinician. Despite a large differential diagnosis, the precise etiology is rarely identified, although musculoligamentous processes are usually suspected. For most patients, back symptoms are nonspecific, meaning that there is no evidence for radicular symptoms or underlying systemic disease. Because episodes of acute, nonspecific low back pain are usually self-limited, many patients treat themselves without contacting their primary care clinician. When patients do call or schedule a visit, evaluation and management by primary care clinicians is appropriate.

The history and physical examination usually provide clues to the rare but potentially serious causes of low back pain, as well as identify patients at risk for prolonged recovery. Diagnostic testing, including plain x-rays, is often unnecessary during the initial evaluation. For patients with acute, nonspecific low back pain, the primary emphasis of treatment should be conservative care, reassurance, and education. Recommendations focus on activity as tolerated (though not active exercise while pain is severe) and minimal if any bed rest. Referral for physical treatments is most appropriate for patients whose symptoms are not improving over 2 to 4 weeks. Specialty referral should be considered for patients with a progressive neurologic deficit, failure of conservative therapy, or an uncertain or serious diagnosis. The prognosis for most patients is good, although recurrence is common. Thus, educating patients about the condition and its management is essential.

### Red flags to screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting with low-back pain [^117VrR4S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Low-back pain (LBP) is a common condition seen in primary care. A principal aim during a clinical examination is to identify patients with a higher likelihood of underlying serious pathology, such as vertebral fracture, who may require additional investigation and specific treatment. All evidence-based clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of red flags to screen for serious causes of back pain. However, it remains unclear if the diagnostic accuracy of red flags is sufficient to support this recommendation.

- **Editorial note**: See https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD014461.pub2/full for a more recent review that covers this topic and has superseded this review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of red flags obtained in a clinical history or physical examination to screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting with LBP.

- **Search methods**: Electronic databases were searched for primary studies between the earliest date and 7 March 2012. Forward and backward citation searching of eligible studies was also conducted.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were considered if they compared the results of any aspect of the history or test conducted in the physical examination of patients presenting for LBP or examination of the lumbar spine with a reference standard (diagnostic imaging). The selection criteria were independently applied by two review authors.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently conducted risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Risk of bias was assessed using the 11-item QUADAS.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: Systematic review [^112a24AB]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

To review the evidence on diagnostic accuracy of red flag signs and symptoms to screen for fracture or malignancy in patients presenting with low back pain to primary, secondary, or tertiary care, a systematic review was conducted.

- **Data sources**: Medline, OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL from the earliest available up to 1 October 2013.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Primary diagnostic studies comparing red flags for fracture or malignancy to an acceptable reference standard, published in any language, were included.

- **Review methods**: Assessment of study quality and extraction of data were conducted by three independent assessors. Diagnostic accuracy statistics and post-test probabilities were generated for each red flag.

- **Results**: The review included 14 studies (eight from primary care, two from secondary care, four from tertiary care) evaluating 53 red flags. Only five studies evaluated combinations of red flags. Data pooling was not possible due to index test heterogeneity. Many red flags in guidelines provide virtually no change in probability of fracture or malignancy or have untested diagnostic accuracy. The red flags with the highest post-test probability for detection of fracture were:
	- Older age (9%, 95% confidence interval 3% to 25%)
	- Prolonged use of corticosteroid drugs (33%, 10% to 67%)
	- Severe trauma (11%, 8% to 16%)
	- Presence of a contusion or abrasion (62%, 49% to 74%)

	- The probability of spinal fracture was higher when multiple red flags were present (90%, 34% to 99%). The red flag with the highest post-test probability for detection of spinal malignancy was a history of malignancy.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: Systematic review [^114DVPnJ]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Of the four red flags endorsed in the American College of Physicians guideline, we could find data only on older age, trauma, and corticosteroid use, but not on history of osteoporosis. In general, the presence of these red flags increased the likelihood of fracture by up to 15% (older age, trauma). The exception was the red flag "prolonged corticosteroid use", which, when present, suggested a post-test probability of 33% (95% confidence interval 10% to 67%) when positive. By contrast, the American College of Physicians guideline uses the red flag "corticosteroid use", as studied by Deyo and Diehl, which, when present, results in a post-test probability of 4% (0% to 44%).

Figure 3 shows the red flags not endorsed in the American College of Physicians guideline. In general, when present, these produce trivial increases in probability of fracture; few produced a precise estimate beyond the pre-test prevalence. The exceptions are contusion or abrasion reported by Patrick and colleagues (62%, 95% confidence interval 49% to 74%, post-test probability); the combination of red flags — any four of leg or buttock pain, female, older age, BMI 70, severe trauma, prolonged use of corticosteroids — reported by Henschke and colleagues (90%, 34% to 99%, post-test probability); and trauma with neurological signs reported by Gibson and Zoltie (43%, 11% to 82%, post-test probability).

### Low back pain [^116MmT2N]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Low back pain is a common problem that is the leading cause of disability and is associated with high costs. Evaluation focuses on identifying risk factors indicating a serious underlying condition and increased risk for persistent disabling symptoms to guide selective use of diagnostic testing (including imaging) and treatments. Nonpharmacologic therapies, including exercise and psychosocial management, are preferred for most patients with low back pain and may be supplemented with adjunctive drug therapies. Surgery and interventional procedures are options for a minority of patients who do not respond to standard treatments.

### Evaluation and treatment of acute back pain in the emergency department [^117BAync]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Back pain is a common presenting complaint to the emergency department. The key to proper evaluation is a history and physical examination focused on determining if any red flags for serious disease are present. If no red flags are present, the patient most likely has nonspecific back pain, and their symptoms will resolve in 4 to 6 weeks. No diagnostic testing is required. For patients with red flags, a focused history and examination in conjunction with diagnostic laboratory tests and imaging determine whether the patient has an emergent condition such as herniated disc, epidural compression, or spinal infection.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: Systematic review [^116csVFz]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: For the Cochrane diagnostic test accuracy reviews, we searched Medline, OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL (Ebsco) for eligible studies from the earliest record up to 7 March 2012. The search was updated to include studies up to 1 October 2013. The searches used combinations of terms related to the patient population, history taking, physical examination, and the target condition, and were developed in collaboration with a medical information specialist. Forward and backward citation searches were completed.

- **Study selection**: Primary diagnostic studies were considered if they looked at the results of history taking or physical examination compared with those of an acceptable reference standard to identify spinal fracture or spinal malignancy in adult patients presenting with low back pain. Examples of reference standards include diagnostic imaging to confirm the presence of spinal fracture, primary malignancy, or metastases in the spine. Long-term follow-up (more than six months) of patients after the initial consultation was also considered an appropriate reference standard for both fracture and malignancy if suspected cases identified during the follow-up period were confirmed by medical review. Cohort and cross-sectional studies of a consecutive series of patients that presented sufficient data to allow estimates of diagnostic accuracy (such as sensitivity and specificity) were considered for eligibility. We considered studies reported in abstracts or conference proceedings and full journal publications in all languages and excluded studies in which "gl"

### Red flags for low back pain are not always really red: A prospective evaluation of the clinical utility of commonly used screening questions for low back pain [^113ryCnT]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

Low back pain has a high prevalence and morbidity and is a source of substantial health-care spending. Numerous published guidelines support the use of so-called red flag questions to screen for serious pathology in patients with low back pain. This paper examines the effectiveness of red flag questions as a screening tool for patients presenting with low back pain to a multidisciplinary academic spine center.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of the cases of 9,940 patients with a chief complaint of low back pain. The patients completed a questionnaire that included several red flag questions during their first physician visit. Diagnostic data for the same clinical episode were collected from medical records and corroborated with imaging reports. Patients who were diagnosed as having a vertebral fracture, malignancy, infection, or cauda equina syndrome were classified as having a red flag diagnosis.

- **Results**: Specific individual red flags and combinations of red flags were associated with an increased probability of underlying serious spinal pathology. For example, recent trauma and an age of > 50 years were associated with vertebral fracture. The presence or absence of other red flags, such as night pain, was unrelated to any particular diagnosis. For instance, for patients with no recent history of infection and no fever, chills, or sweating, the presence of night pain was a false-positive finding for infection > 96% of the time. In general, the absence of red flag responses did not meaningfully decrease the likelihood of a red flag diagnosis; 64%…

### Barriers and progress in the treatment of low back pain [^116Eejvs]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There is an almost endless list of treatment options currently available to patients with low back pain (LBP), each supported by different theories, potential mechanisms, underpinning rationales, and research evidence. Some treatments come with extravagant claims of complete pain relief, often advertised via the internet. However, most of these claims and unusual treatment approaches have not been proven effective when subjected to rigorous and independent evaluation.

Treatments include oral medications, topical medications, exercise, manual therapy, traction, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), spinal cord stimulators, mattresses, orthotics, back supports, biofeedback, spinal injections, and surgery. In other words, LBP patients may be offered interventions from the full range of conservative, pharmacological, non-pharmacological, traditional, and complementary healthcare interventions, as well as invasive interventions.

Given this almost limitless array of options, it is not uncommon for patients with similar LBP signs and symptoms to receive different interventions from healthcare professionals. Key reasons for such variation in practice include:

- **Provider preferences**: The close commitment of different intervention providers to their respective favorite treatments.
- **Clinical uncertainty**: The clinical uncertainty associated with LBP, in terms of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection. Evidence for this reason is provided by studies that show the association between practitioners' attitudes and beliefs and their clinical approaches.

### Recurrence of an episode of low back pain: An inception cohort study in emergency departments [^1117Ndcj]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

The study aimed to (1) determine the 1-year estimate of recurrence of low back pain (LBP) in a cohort of people presenting to emergency departments who have recently recovered from an episode of acute LBP in a middle-income country, (2) estimate a recurrence of LBP stratified by the STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST), and (3) determine prognostic factors for the recurrence of LBP.

This was a prospective inception cohort study. We included 238 patients who presented to emergency departments with recent-onset nonspecific LBP in São Paulo, Brazil. The outcome was the recurrence of an episode of LBP, assessed using two definitions: (1) 12-month recall alone and (2) pain measurements at follow-up. Prognostic factors were determined by logistic regression.

Within 1 year, the estimated recurrence of an episode of LBP ranged from 35% (79/225 events) using the first definition to 44% (100/226 events) using the second definition. When patients were stratified by the SBST, the estimate of recurrence ranged from 29% to 37% (21–27/73 events) for low-risk patients, from 33% to 39% (24–28/72 events) for medium-risk patients, and from 43% to 56% (34–45/80 events) for high-risk patients. Age, perceived risk of persistent LBP, and disability were independent prognostic factors associated with LBP recurrence within 1 year.

After recovering from a previous episode of acute LBP, 4 in every 10 patients experienced a recurrence within 1 year. This estimate varied depending on the classification used in the SBST. Within 1 year, age, perceived risk of persistent LBP, and baseline disability were significant prognostic factors.

### Prevention and treatment of low back pain: evidence, challenges, and promising directions [^111BRq5w]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Many clinical practice guidelines recommend similar approaches for the assessment and management of low back pain. Recommendations include the use of a biopsychosocial framework to guide management, with initial non-pharmacological treatment. This includes education that supports self-management, resumption of normal activities and exercise, and psychological programs for those with persistent symptoms. Guidelines recommend prudent use of medication, imaging, and surgery. These recommendations are based on trials conducted almost exclusively in high-income countries and focus mainly on treatments rather than prevention, with limited data on cost-effectiveness.

Globally, gaps between evidence and practice exist, with limited use of recommended first-line treatments and inappropriately high use of imaging, rest, opioids, spinal injections, and surgery. Continuing with the same approaches will not reduce back-related disability or its long-term consequences. Advances with the greatest potential are those that align practice with the evidence, reduce the focus on spinal abnormalities, and ensure the promotion of activity and function, including work participation.

Effective, promising, or emerging solutions that could offer new directions have been identified but need greater attention and further research to determine if they are appropriate for large-scale implementation. These potential solutions include focused strategies to implement best practices, the redesign of clinical pathways, integrated health and occupational interventions to reduce work disability, and changes in compensation models.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for low back pain, particularly with respect to history and physical examination, ACP/APS 2007 guidelines recommend eliciting a focused medical history and performing a physical examination to categorize patients with low back pain into one of the following broad categories:

- **Nonspecific low back pain**: Focus on traditional back pain not attributed to specific causes.

- **Back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis**: Assess for nerve root involvement or spinal canal narrowing.

- **Back pain potentially associated with another specific spinal cause**: Identify other particular spinal conditions that may be causing the pain.

### Low back pain investigations and prognosis: A review [^116pcDrz]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Low back pain is reviewed in terms of when investigations are useful and its clinical course. Despite the extensive evaluation of the accuracy of investigations such as radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and myelography, there is a surprising dearth of research to inform their use in primary care. There is no clear evidence to base judgments for selecting appropriate tests to confirm or exclude low back pain pathology. It appears that investigations are rarely necessary for low back pain.

Specific investigations should be ordered to identify a particular pathology but should not be ordered routinely for general screening. In the absence of pathology, low back pain and its associated disability improve rapidly in the first weeks after onset. However, in contradiction to all guidelines, both commonly persist, and the best evidence suggests that recurrences are common.

### Initial management decisions following a new consultation for low back pain: Implications of the usage of physical therapy for subsequent health care costs and utilization [^115GA9dg]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

The study aimed to describe the utilization of physical therapy following a new primary care consultation for low back pain (LBP) and to examine the relationships between physical therapy utilization and other variables with health care utilization and costs in the year after consultation.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort obtained from electronic medical records and insurance claims data.

- **Setting**: Single health care delivery system.

- **Participants**: Individuals (N = 2184) older than 18 years with a new consultation for LBP from 2004 to 2008.

- **Interventions**: Patients were categorized as receiving initial physical therapy management if care occurred within 14 days after consultation.

- **Main outcome measures**: Total health care costs for all LBP-related care received in the year after consultation were calculated from claims data. Predictors of the utilization of emergency care, advanced imaging, epidural injections, specialist visits, and surgery were identified using multivariate logistic regression. The generalized linear model was used to compare LBP-related costs based on physical therapy utilization and identify other cost determinants.

Results indicated that initial physical therapy was received by 286 of the 2184 patients (13.1%) and was not a determinant of LBP-related health care costs or utilization of specific services in the year after consultation. However, older age, mental health or neck pain comorbidity, and initial management with opioids were determinants of cost and several utilization outcomes.

In conclusion, initial physical therapy management was not associated with increased health care costs.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: Systematic review [^111YZq4y]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Unnecessary imaging is a concern in many settings, with adverse consequences for the patient and society. Our review shows that the advice provided in some guidelines to refer all patients with a single positive red flag for imaging is unwise. Given that 80% of patients in primary care might have at least one positive red flag, such a course would mean that most patients with low back pain would receive diagnostic imaging. In contrast, our review aligns with the approach of the American College of Physicians guideline and others, which suggests considering the probability of serious disease (given the specific red flags present) when making decisions about the need for and timing of imaging. Our results suggest that many guidelines will need revision to provide advice for practice that is more firmly grounded in relevant diagnostic research.

- **Unanswered questions and future research**: Our review has highlighted the need for more high-quality diagnostic research on the topic. Much of the existing research has evaluated single clinical features, and our results suggest it might be more useful to evaluate combinations of clinical features, as is done with decision rules such as the Ottawa Ankle Rule and Canadian C-Spine Rule. While some decision rules are available, all are at the derivation stage and await external validation. There is a need for systematic reviews of red flags to screen for other conditions such as infection and ankylosing spondylitis.

### Analgesia for non-specific low back pain [^111u7ABT]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

Low back pain (synonymous with "primary" low back pain) is pain felt between the lower ribs and the buttocks. This differs from radicular low back pain, which occurs when a spinal nerve root is affected, resulting in pain that extends down the legs. Approximately 90% of cases are non-specific, meaning a specific cause has not been identified. The causes of the remaining 10%, affecting around fewer than 1 in 100 in primary care and about 5 in 100 in emergency departments, include fractures, infections, malignancies, inflammatory disorders such as spondylarthritis, spinal stenosis, or non-spinal problems such as kidney issues or menstrual-related pain.

The prognosis for a new episode of non-specific low back pain is good. Most people recover from acute low back pain within a few weeks irrespective of any treatment. Some individuals, however, develop chronic low back pain (typically defined as symptoms lasting for over three months), either as a fluctuating/recurring or continuous problem. Of those who present to primary care with acute low back pain, a quarter will have some ongoing pain or functional impairment at three months (chronic pain), although the estimates from individual studies range widely from 2% to 48%.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: Systematic review [^114LwQnw]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Low back pain is a major cause of disability, leading to considerable healthcare expenditure around the world, especially in high-income countries. The difficulty in providing a definitive diagnosis for most presentations of back pain has given rise to the term "non-specific low back pain", which is generally considered to be benign and can be managed in a primary care setting. Some patients, however, present with low back pain as the initial manifestation of a more serious pathology, such as malignancy, spinal fracture, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. Spinal fracture and malignancy are the most common serious pathologies affecting the spine. In patients with low back pain presenting to primary care, between 1% and 4% will have a spinal fracture, and in less than 1%, malignancy, whether primary tumor or metastasis, will be the underlying cause.

Multiple reports indicate that uncomplicated acute low back pain or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not necessitate imaging studies. Guidelines for recognizing patients with more complex conditions can help identify those who require further evaluation due to suspicion of more serious issues, thereby promoting appropriate imaging utilization.

### Do not routinely offer imaging for uncomplicated low back pain [^11581kLH]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Clinicians often report that they order imaging when patients specifically request it. Systematic reviews of surveys and interviews suggest that about half of patients expect imaging from their health provider because they believe it can help rule out a sinister cause for the pain. Some patients also believe that imaging can identify the cause better than the clinician's physical exam and facilitate a more tailored approach to treatment. There is still considerable uncertainty as to what alternatives to imaging would convey the diagnosis of non-specific LBP satisfactorily from the patient's perspective. Future research should focus on this area to develop strategies for explaining LBP to patients.

### Pain one week after an emergency department visit for acute low back pain is associated with poor three-month outcomes [^116yVXPS]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) is responsible for more than 2.5 million visits to U.S. emergency departments (EDs) annually. Nearly 30% of patients who present to an ED with acute LBP report functional impairment or pain three months later. These patients are at risk of chronic LBP, a highly debilitating condition. In this study, we assessed whether three variables assessable shortly after symptom onset could independently predict poor three-month outcomes among LBP patients who present to an ED.

- **Methods**: This was a planned analysis of data from two randomized comparative effectiveness studies of patients with acute, nontraumatic, nonradicular LBP. Patients were enrolled during an ED visit, contacted by telephone 1 week after the ED visit, and then followed up by telephone three months later. The co-primary three-month outcomes were LBP-related functional impairment and persistent moderate or severe LBP. Two of the three hypothesized predictor variables were assessed during the index visit: 1) the STarT Back Screening Tool score, a nine-item, multidimensional tool validated and widely used in the outpatient setting, and 2) the patient's own anticipated duration of LBP. The third hypothesized predictor was presence of pain assessed by phone 1 week after the ED visit. We then determined whether these three predictor variables were independently associated with poor outcomes at three months, after controlling for medication received, age, and sex.

- **Results**: A total of 354 patients were enrolled. Of these, 309 (87%) provided three-month impairment data, and 311 (88%) provided three-month pain data.

### Low back pain [^114GS117]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2018). Low credibility.

Low back pain affects individuals of all ages and is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide. Despite advancements in assessment and treatment methods, the management of low back pain remains a challenge for researchers and clinicians alike. One reason for the limited success in identifying effective treatments is the large variation in the manifestations, possible causes, precipitating and maintaining factors, course, prognosis, and consequences in terms of activity interference and quality of life. However, despite these challenges, steady progress has been achieved in the understanding of back pain, and important steps in understanding the psychological and social risk factors, genetics, and brain mechanisms of low back pain have been made. These new findings have given impetus to the development of new diagnostic procedures, evidence-based screening methods, and more targeted interventions. This underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of low back pain that integrates biological, psychological, and social aspects.

### Can screening instruments accurately determine poor outcome risk in adults with recent onset low back pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114hedtW]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Following the removal of duplicate articles, two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search for eligibility. AW assessed all the articles, while EK and LG each assessed 50% of the articles. All reviewers applied a checklist of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. The full paper was obtained for further assessment when necessary. Full texts of studies potentially meeting the eligibility criteria were retrieved, with subsequent independent assessment of all articles undertaken by EK and LG. Reasons for study exclusion were noted on a checklist, and any disagreements were resolved by discussion.

EK, along with either LG or LR, independently reviewed the full text of eligible studies and extracted relevant data using a standardized spreadsheet. The extracted data included details of the healthcare setting, recruitment, study population, number of participants, loss to follow-up, symptom duration, low back pain history, compensability, concomitant treatments, outcome measurement, statistical analyses, and reporting quality. Discrepancies in extracted data were identified and checked. If the required data could not be extracted, authors were emailed with specific inquiries. If no response was received, authors were re-emailed after 2 weeks, and finally following a further week.

Predictive validity is conventionally assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, with the area under the curve (AUC) statistic being the most routinely reported measure of performance.

### Imaging strategies for low-back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112TNJNZ]. Lancet (2009). Low credibility.

Some clinicians perform lumbar imaging routinely or in the absence of historical or clinical features suggestive of serious low-back problems. We investigated the effects of routine, immediate lumbar imaging versus usual clinical care without immediate imaging on clinical outcomes in patients with low-back pain and no indication of serious underlying conditions.

- **Methods**: We analyzed randomized controlled trials that compared immediate lumbar imaging (radiography, MRI, or CT) versus usual clinical care without immediate imaging for low-back pain. These trials reported pain or function (primary outcomes), quality of life, mental health, overall patient-reported improvement (based on various scales), and patient satisfaction in care received. Six trials (n = 1804) met inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed by two independent reviewers with criteria adapted from the Cochrane Back Review Group. Meta-analyses were performed using a random effects model.

- **Findings**: We did not record significant differences between immediate lumbar imaging and usual care without immediate imaging for primary outcomes at either short-term (up to 3 months, standardized mean difference 0.19, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.39 for pain and 0.11, -0.29 to 0.50 for function, negative values favor routine imaging) or long-term (6–12 months, -0.04, -0.15 to 0.07 for pain and 0.01, -0.17 to 0.19 for function) follow-up. Other outcomes did not differ significantly. Trial quality, use of different imaging methods, and duration of low-back pain did not affect the results, but analyses were limited by small numbers.

### Do not routinely offer imaging for uncomplicated low back pain [^111AMUxe]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Less than 5–10% of all low back pain is due to a specific underlying spinal pathology. The remaining 90–95% has no indication of a serious cause and should be managed with conservative treatments such as advice and reassurance, exercise, physical therapy, chiropractic care, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or pain management. Diagnostic triage based on clinical history and examination can help distinguish between non-specific or more serious low back pain. Imaging may do more harm than good when serious conditions are not suspected and is likely to prolong recovery in patients with non-specific low back pain. Patients' primary concerns of whether their pain is caused by something serious and what they should do to aid recovery can be addressed by sound education and reassurance, without the need for imaging.

### Pain and the brain: Lower back pain [^117ULrRc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic lower back pain is a common and frequently disabling problem, but an organic cause cannot always be identified. Pain often co-occurs with mood and anxiety disorders, but when patients present with somatic symptoms in the primary care setting, clinicians often overlook mood and anxiety symptoms. Because appropriate treatment includes both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies, a team approach that includes both mental health and primary care professionals is warranted to alleviate the patient's pain, manage psychiatric comorbidities, and improve the patient's functioning and quality of life. Additionally, when prescribing pain medication, clinicians should monitor patients for substance misuse.

The clinical problem

Over the past two decades, there has been a significant paradigm shift in the use of imaging for managing low back pain (LBP). Imaging, once a routine part of the diagnostic process for most LBP cases, is now deemed useful only in a small subgroup of patients where there is suspicion of red flag conditions. These conditions include cancer, infection, inflammatory disease, fracture, and severe neurological deficits, which together account for only 5–10% of LBP presentations in primary care. For the remaining 90–95% of LBP cases, known as non-specific or uncomplicated LBP, imaging does not guide management and may cause more harm than benefit.

International guidelines and the "Choosing Wisely" campaigns now promote a diagnostic triage approach to identify patients who require imaging. Despite these advances in knowledge, imaging rates for LBP should be decreasing. However, recent systematic reviews show the opposite trend, indicating that imaging has increased over the past 20 years and that at least a third of all images are unnecessary.

- **Choosing Wisely statements**: From different countries, aimed at avoiding routine imaging for low back pain:
	- "Don't routinely image patients with low back pain regardless of the duration of symptoms unless: (a) there are clinical reasons to suspect serious underlying pathology (i.e. red flags), or (b) imaging is necessary for the planning and/or execution of a particularly evidence-based therapeutic intervention on a specific spinal condition". — Canadian Spine Society, Choosing Wisely Canada.

Back and neck pain are symptoms often presented as complaints and can sometimes lead to disability; however, they are not considered diseases. Distinguishing between these aspects is critical for understanding the personal and societal impact of back and neck pain. It also highlights opportunities to discover new ways to mitigate their effects. This article briefly describes the diagnosis and treatment of spinal pain, examines the relationship between pain and disability, and addresses the challenges of allocating resources effectively between curing pain problems and reducing disability.

### Can screening instruments accurately determine poor outcome risk in adults with recent onset low back pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116FnFfq]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

ROC analyses are recommended for discriminative accuracy studies but come with some limitations. A ROC analysis requires dichotomization of outcomes, meaning that the definition of 'poor outcome' can affect findings. In the absence of a general consensus on the definition of 'poor outcome', we followed previous studies and recommendations. The selected cut-off score of ≥ 3/10 on a pain NRS was based on the understanding that many people with pain scores of < 3 consider themselves to be 'recovered'. Boonstra et al. support that people with pain NRS scores of ≤ 3 describe themselves to be experiencing only 'mild' symptoms. We classified participants who were 'not recovered' at follow-up (or those experiencing more than mild symptoms) as having a 'poor outcome'.

Since the outcome classification can influence discriminative performance, it would have been interesting to evaluate alternative cut-off points for poor outcome for each of the outcomes considered; this could be explored in further research. The definitions we applied were used by several included studies. In addition, AUC values, derived from the ROC analysis, are a function of sensitivity and specificity — both of which are influenced by cohort characteristics (e.g. symptom severity and psychological profile). Variations are therefore expected for the same instrument among different populations.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: Systematic review [^1176v4Lu]. BMJ (2013). High credibility.

Identification of serious pathologies, when they exist, is important in the clinical assessment, and further assessment and specific treatment is usually required, particularly for malignancy. For instance, early detection of spinal malignancy could prevent further spread of metastatic disease. Identification of a spinal fracture will prevent the prescription of treatments such as manual therapy, which is contraindicated, as well as progress the patient towards further testing and treatment of underlying disease, such as osteoporosis. Despite the potential consequences of a late or missed diagnosis of these serious pathologies, their low prevalence in primary care settings does not justify routine ancillary testing of patients presenting with low back pain. For this reason, accurate screening tools to aid clinical decisions about when to refer for further testing are paramount.

Most clinical practice guidelines for back pain recommend the use of red flags to help identify those patients with a higher likelihood of spinal fracture or malignancy, who then become candidates for more extensive diagnostic investigations. There is confusion, however, as the guidelines have produced different lists of red flags to screen for spinal fracture and malignancy. Eight of the guidelines investigated by Koes and colleagues, in their review of back pain guidelines, endorsed 26 red flags for fracture and 27 for malignancy. None of the eight guidelines endorsed the same set of red flags for either condition, so it is unclear what clinicians should use in clinical care.

### Red flags presented in current low back pain guidelines: A review [^117Wnmmx]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to identify and descriptively compare the red flags endorsed in guidelines for the detection of serious pathology in patients presenting with low back pain to primary care.

We searched databases, the World Wide Web, and contacted experts aiming to find the multidisciplinary clinical guideline in low back pain in primary care, and selected the most recent one per country. We extracted data on the number and type of red flags for identifying patients with a higher likelihood of serious pathology. Furthermore, we extracted data on whether or not accuracy data (sensitivity/specificity, predictive values, etc) were presented to support the endorsement of specific red flags.

We found 21 discrete guidelines all published between 2000 and 2015. One guideline could not be retrieved, and after selecting one guideline per country, we included 16 guidelines in our analysis from 15 different countries and one for Europe as a whole. All guidelines focused on the management of patients with low back pain in a primary care or multidisciplinary care setting. Five guidelines presented red flags in general, i.e. not related to any specific disease. Overall, we found 46 discrete red flags related to the four main categories of serious pathology: malignancy, fracture, cauda equina syndrome, and infection. The majority of guidelines presented two red flags for fracture ('major or significant trauma' and 'use of steroids or immunosuppressors') and two for malignancy ('history of cancer' and 'unintentional weight loss'). Most often, pain at night was also highlighted as a potential indicator of malignancy.

### Most red flags for malignancy in low back pain guidelines lack empirical support: A systematic review [^114cbAFE]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are cautious not to overlook underlying serious pathology, yet uncertainty remains about which red flags are relevant. We aimed to evaluate the origin and evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of red flags for malignancy in the management of low back pain (LBP) in primary care. A comprehensive overview was performed, and the literature was searched using snowballing techniques and reference checking for evidence on red flags endorsed in clinical guidelines for identifying patients with a higher likelihood of malignancy. Studies included participants with LBP without any restriction on study design. Data on prevalence and diagnostic accuracy were extracted. Furthermore, the methodological quality of studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy was assessed.

We identified 13 red flags endorsed in a total of 16 guidelines and 2 extra red flags not endorsed in any guideline. A total of 33 publications were included, ranging from systematic reviews to case reports. The origin of many red flags was unclear or derived from case reports. The incidence of malignancy in patients presenting with LBP in primary care varied between 0% and 0.7%. Seven studies provided diagnostic accuracy data on red flags. Five red flags with accuracy data from 2 or more studies were found, with 2 ("history of malignancy" and "strong clinical suspicion") considered informative. In conclusion, the origin and diagnostic accuracy of many red flags endorsed in guidelines are unclear. "History of malignancy" and "strong clinical suspicion" are the only red flags with empirical evidence of acceptably high diagnostic accuracy.
