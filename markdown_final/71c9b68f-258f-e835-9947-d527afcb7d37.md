## Question

whats the approach to patient with microproteinuria, urine protein of 257 mg/day

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the approach to a patient with "microproteinuria" at 257 mg/day. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the proteinuria and characterizing it correctly. Then, I should verify the underlying etiology with targeted history, exam, and labs. Next, I will assess kidney function and risk stratify. After that, I need to decide on initial management, including blood pressure targets and renin–angiotensin system blockade. Finally, I will plan monitoring, thresholds for escalation, and when to refer to nephrology, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the proteinuria and get the terminology right. Wait, let me verify the category: 257 mg/day of total protein sits just above the conventional threshold for "microalbuminuria" (30–300 mg/day of albumin) and below "overt proteinuria" (> 300 mg/day of albumin or> 500 mg/day total protein), so this is low-level proteinuria rather than true microalbuminuria; I should double-check this with KDIGO and KDOQI definitions to avoid misclassification [^f19793e2] [^40ebdfd3]. I need to ensure the measurement is valid: if this was a 24-hour collection, I should confirm adequacy by comparing total creatinine to expected 24-hour creatinine excretion (about 15–25 mg/kg/day), and if it was a spot protein-to-creatinine ratio, I should repeat with a first-morning sample to reduce variability and confirm persistence, because KDIGO emphasizes confirming positive screens and preferring first-morning ACR/PCR when feasible [^1788b93c] [^ed1546a4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I gather context. I should review risk factors and symptoms: diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, family history of CKD, recent infections, and medications such as NSAIDs or ACEi/ARBs; I also need to check for orthostatic proteinuria, which is common in adolescents and young adults and typically benign, using split first-morning versus daytime collections if suspected [^3b1af121]. On exam, I will look for blood pressure, edema, and signs of systemic disease; on labs, I should obtain serum creatinine with eGFR, electrolytes, and consider fasting glucose or HbA1c if diabetes is not established, because KDIGO recommends concurrent assessment of albuminuria/proteinuria and GFR in people at risk for CKD [^f8e886b5] [^07247710].

> Next, I should review the urinalysis carefully. I need to check for hematuria, dysmorphic RBCs, and RBC casts, which would suggest glomerular disease and push me toward earlier nephrology referral; I should also consider urine albumin-to-protein ratio to estimate the albumin fraction, where a higher ratio supports glomerular proteinuria and a lower ratio suggests tubular or mixed sources, although this is a screening tool rather than a definitive diagnostic test [^f77e1997] [^51b3b5d2]. But wait, what if the dipstick was used to screen? I should confirm any dipstick positives with quantitative ACR or PCR because dipsticks are semiquantitative and can mislead, especially at low protein levels [^661cacf2].

> I will now examine kidney function and stage CKD if present. I should calculate eGFR from serum creatinine using CKD-EPI and, if accuracy is questionable (e.g., extremes of body composition, malnutrition, or borderline results), add cystatin C and use the combined eGFRcr-cys equation; if decisions hinge on precise GFR, I should consider measured GFR with an exogenous marker when available [^02fbc0e4]. Let me reconsider the risk implications: even low-level albuminuria/proteinuria is associated with higher risks of CKD progression and cardiovascular events, so I should document the GFR and albuminuria category to guide follow-up intensity and risk counseling [^f8e886b5] [^16f7b6c2].

> For initial management, I should confirm blood pressure control and optimize it toward< 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, especially if albuminuria is present, because BP lowering is foundational and ACE inhibitors or ARBs provide additional antiproteinuric and renoprotective effects beyond BP control; I need to ensure there is no contraindication such as bilateral renal artery stenosis or hyperkalemia before initiating or uptitrating these agents [^notfound]. I should also counsel on lifestyle measures: sodium restriction to< 2 g/day, weight optimization, smoking cessation, and moderation of protein intake to about 0.8 g/kg/day in non-dialysis CKD, while avoiding over-restriction in those without advanced CKD [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I am not missing reversible drivers. If diabetic, I should intensify glycemic control with attention to agents that reduce albuminuria and are safe in CKD; if hypertensive, I should maximize RAAS blockade to the highest tolerated dose and monitor potassium and creatinine within 1–2 weeks after changes; if there is intercurrent illness, AKI, or high protein intake, I should repeat testing after resolution because these can transiently elevate protein excretion and confound interpretation [^f1ca73e2] [^824fb5ea]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not inadvertently worsening proteinuria with nephrotoxic drugs like NSAIDs; if present, I will discontinue them and choose alternatives when possible [^notfound].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and thresholds. For someone with confirmed low-level proteinuria and preserved eGFR, repeating ACR or PCR in 3–6 months is reasonable, with more frequent checks if clinical status changes or if I initiate or uptitrate RAAS blockade; a doubling of ACR warrants evaluation for progression or new pathology, whereas small fluctuations up to about 50% can reflect biological variability [^6d001dd6] [^3abb3d48]. I should double-check that I am aligning follow-up with CKD stage: annual monitoring for G1–G2, every 6 months for G3, and every 3 months for G4 is a practical framework, adjusting based on risk and treatment changes [^29625532].

> I should confirm referral triggers. Indications include diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., hematuria with proteinuria, systemic features), rapidly rising proteinuria, eGFR< 30 mL/min/1.73 m², or a sustained fall in eGFR> 20% on therapy; in terms of albuminuria, consistent ACR≥ 300 mg/g with hematuria, ACR> 700 mg/g, or a≥ 2-fold rise in ACR in someone already under surveillance should prompt nephrology referral for further evaluation and management [^eca625fc] [^cd6e2a1b]. Let me verify that I am not overcalling a single abnormal value; I should confirm persistence and exclude transient causes before escalating care [^ed1546a4].

> Finally, I should synthesize the plan and communicate clearly. The patient has low-level proteinuria at 257 mg/day, which exceeds normal but remains below overt proteinuria; I will confirm with a first-morning ACR or PCR, assess eGFR, screen for diabetes and hypertension, evaluate urinalysis for hematuria or casts, initiate or optimize RAAS blockade if indicated, target BP< 130/80 mmHg, implement lifestyle measures, and arrange follow-up in 3–6 months with a low threshold to repeat testing sooner if clinical status changes; I will refer to nephrology if proteinuria rises, hematuria with proteinuria appears, eGFR declines, or the etiology remains unclear after initial workup [^1788b93c] [^f8e886b5] [^eca625fc].

---

A urine protein excretion of 257 mg/day is **microalbuminuria** (30–300 mg/day) and indicates early kidney damage, most often from diabetes or hypertension. Confirm with a **first-morning ACR** [^1788b93c] and repeat if abnormal to account for variability [^ed1546a4]. Evaluate for diabetes, hypertension, and other causes; check eGFR, electrolytes, and urinalysis for hematuria or casts [^f8e886b5]. If confirmed, start an ACE inhibitor or ARB [^67aac4cd], target blood pressure< 130/80 mmHg, optimize glycemic control, and address cardiovascular risk. Monitor ACR and eGFR every 6–12 months; refer to nephrology if ACR rises, eGFR declines, or the cause is unclear [^eca625fc].

---

## Confirming microalbuminuria

- **Initial testing**: Use a first-morning urine ACR [^1788b93c]; if unavailable, use a random sample [^b50cd884].
- **Confirmation**: Repeat ACR if the initial test is abnormal to account for biological variability [^ed1546a4].
- **Factors affecting interpretation**: Consider hematuria, menstruation, exercise, infection, and variability in urinary creatinine concentration [^f1ca73e2] [^824fb5ea].

---

## Clinical significance of microalbuminuria

Microalbuminuria reflects **early glomerular injury** and is a strong, independent risk marker for CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^8b89a32e]. Common causes include diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and primary glomerular diseases.

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

| **Step** | **Evaluation** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | History and physical examination | Identify risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, family history) |
| 2 | Laboratory tests | - Confirm microalbuminuria<br/> - Assess kidney function<br/> - Identify underlying causes |
| 3 | Urinalysis | Detect hematuria, casts, or infection |
| 4 | 24-hour urine collection (if needed) | Quantify total protein excretion and assess creatinine clearance |

## Management strategies

### General measures

General measures include optimizing **blood pressure** to a target of< 130/80 mmHg [^notfound] and implementing lifestyle modifications — dietary sodium restriction, weight management, smoking cessation, and regular physical activity [^notfound]. Address cardiovascular risk by managing lipids and glycemic control [^8b89a32e].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **ACE inhibitors or ARBs**: First-line therapy to reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression [^67aac4cd].
- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Consider in diabetic patients to reduce proteinuria and cardiovascular risk.
- **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists**: Consider in resistant cases with careful monitoring of potassium.

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **ACR and eGFR every 6–12 months** [^notfound], with more frequent checks if CKD progresses or interventions are made [^29625532]. Track blood pressure, glycemic control, and cardiovascular risk factors at each visit.

---

## Indications for nephrology referral

- **Progression**: Rising ACR or declining eGFR despite optimal management.
- **Uncertainty**: Diagnostic uncertainty or suspected glomerular disease [^eca625fc].
- **Advanced disease**: eGFR< 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or rapid decline in kidney function [^cd6e2a1b].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause**, response to therapy, and cardiovascular risk. Early detection and intervention can slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events [^16f7b6c2].

---

A urine protein excretion of 257 mg/day indicates **microalbuminuria** and early kidney damage. Confirm with a first-morning ACR, evaluate for underlying causes, and initiate ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy with risk-factor modification. Monitor ACR and eGFR regularly, and refer to nephrology if progression occurs or the cause is unclear.

### Management of glomerular proteinuria: a commentary [^67aac4cd]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

It is widely accepted that proteinuria reduction is an appropriate therapeutic goal in chronic proteinuric kidney disease. Based on large randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT), ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy have emerged as the most important antiproteinuric and renal protective interventions. However, there are numerous other interventions that have been shown to be antiproteinuric and, therefore, likely to be renoprotective. Unfortunately testing each of these antiproteinuric therapies in RCT is not feasible. The nephrologist has two choices: restrict antiproteinuric therapies to those shown to be effective in RCT or expand the use of antiproteinuric therapies to include those that, although unproven, are plausibly effective and prudent to use. The goal of this work is to provide the documentation needed for the nephrologist to choose between these strategies. This work describes 25 separate interventions that are either antiproteinuric or may block injurious mechanisms of proteinuria. Each intervention is assigned a level of recommendation (Level 1 is the highest; Level 3 is the lowest) according to the strength of the evidence supporting its antiproteinuric and renoprotective efficacy. Pathophysiologic mechanisms possibly involved are also discussed. The number of interventions at each level of recommendation are: Level 1, n = 7; Level 2, n = 9; Level 3, n = 9. Our experience indicates that we can achieve in most patients the majority of Level 1 and many of the Level 2 and 3 recommendations. We suggest that, until better information becomes available, a broad-based, multiple-risk factor intervention to reduce proteinuria can be justified in those with progressive nephropathies. This work is intended primarily for clinical nephrologists; therefore, each antiproteinuria intervention is described in practical detail.

KDIGO 2024 CKD—preferred measurement modality: Because creatinine excretion in the urine is fairly constant throughout the 24-hour period, the measurement of ACR (or PCR) allows correction for variations in urinary concentration, and measurement of urinary albumin is now recommended because it is relatively standardized and because it is the single most important protein lost in the urine in most CKDs; commonly used reagent strip devices measuring total protein are insufficiently sensitive for the reliable detection of proteinuria, do not adjust for urinary concentration, and are only semiquantitative, and when used, reagent strip results should be confirmed by laboratory testing.

Assessment of kidney function—proteinuria measurement: Key measures for diagnosis, evaluation of prognosis, and management decisions in glomerular disease include measurement (or estimation) of proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate, and assessment of urine total protein excretion rate (PER) using timed urine collections is the preferred method for patients with glomerular disease, particularly when marked proteinuria is present on qualitative testing, because it averages variation due to circadian rhythm, physical activity, and posture and avoids errors of a random spot protein–creatinine ratio (PCR). However, 24-hour urine collection can also be subject to error due to overcollection or undercollection, and simultaneous measurement of urine creatinine and protein in an aliquot of an intended 12–24-hour urine collection is a good compromise.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease—urine albumin versus total protein measurement notes limitations and variability. It is possible that replacing urinary total protein measurement with albumin measurement may cause nonalbuminuric (effectively tubular and overproduction) proteinuria to be missed, and the significance of this issue is thought to be low in adults. In health, relatively small amounts of albumin (<30 mg/24 hours) are lost in the urine. Total protein measurement is problematic in urine due to imprecision and insensitivity at low concentrations, most laboratories currently use either turbidimetry or colorimetry to measure total protein, and these methods do not give equal analytical specificity and sensitivity for all proteins, with a tendency to react more strongly with albumin than with globulin and other non-albumin proteins, and many have significant interferences causing falsely high results. There is no reference measurement procedure and no standardized reference material for urinary total protein measurement, and the variety of methods and calibrants in use means that there is inevitably significant between-laboratory variation.

Instead, monitor first morning protein–creatinine ratio (PCR).” Practice Point 1.2.3 notes “Random “spot” urine collections for PCR are not ideal as there is variation over time in both protein and creatinine excretion.” Practice Point 1.2.4 adds “First morning urine collections may underestimate 24-hour protein excretion in orthostatic proteinuria.” Practice Point 1.2.5 advises “When feasible, a reasonable compromise is to collect an “intended” 24-hour urine sample and measure PCR in an aliquot of the collection.”

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) urine albumin/protein testing—specimen selection and confirmation: Untimed urine samples are a reasonable first test for ascertainment of albuminuria, a first morning void sample is preferred, and a random urine sample is acceptable if no first morning void sample is available. Because creatinine excretion is fairly constant over 24 hours, albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) allows correction for urinary concentration; ACR is a suitable alternative to timed measurement and PCR on random or early morning untimed samples shows good diagnostic performance and correlation with 24-hour collection. Although the accurately timed 24-hour specimen remains a reference point, it is a difficult procedure to control; hydration affects urine concentration, and reporting albumin or protein to creatinine ratio will correct for urinary concentration and reduce intraindividual variability. Measurement of urinary albumin is recommended, positive tests should be confirmed and large changes repeated, and if more accurate quantification is required, measure urine albumin or total protein in a timed collection under supervised conditions. Commonly used reagent strip devices measuring total protein are insufficiently sensitive and only semiquantitative; the use of such strips should be discouraged in favor of quantitative laboratory measurements or validated point-of-care devices, and when used, reagent strip results should be confirmed by laboratory testing.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease—Table 16 factors causing biological variation in urine albumin or urine protein identifies causes of falsely elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) and causes of false decreases. Hematuria, menstruation, and exercise increase albumin and protein in the urine, symptomatic urinary infection can cause production of protein from the organism, and for nonalbumin proteins other proteins may be missed by albumin reagent strips. Variability in urinary creatinine concentration modifies ACR and PCR: females have lower urinary creatinine excretion, therefore higher ACR and PCR, while males have higher urinary creatinine excretion, therefore lower ACR and PCR; low urinary creatinine excretion consistent with low weight can cause high ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion, while high urinary creatinine excretion consistent with high weight can cause low ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion; lower urinary creatinine excretion with AKI or low-protein intake contrasts with high urinary creatinine excretion with high-protein intake or exercise.

Albuminuria assessment for living donor evaluation—measurement method and thresholds are recommended as follows: We recommend measurement of albumin rather than total protein, and albumin excretion rate (AER) in a timed urine collection rather than albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot specimen if possible. We recommend an AER threshold of less than 30 mg/d to routinely accept a donor candidate and an intermediate range of AER 30 to 100 mg/d in which to individualize decisions based on other risk factors. We acknowledge that AER of 30 to 100 mg/d meets the criteria for CKD, yet candidates have not been excluded solely on this basis. We do not require tests of total urine protein in addition to albumin because normal ranges for nonalbumin protein excretion are not accepted.

### Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on the KDIGO clinical practice guideline for CKD evaluation and management [^4d0cd0c1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

We congratulate the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) work group on their comprehensive work in a broad subject area and agreed with many of the recommendations in their clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. We concur with the KDIGO definitions and classification of kidney disease and welcome the addition of albuminuria categories at all levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the terminology of G categories rather than stages to describe level of GFR, the division of former stage 3 into new G categories 3a and 3b, and the addition of the underlying diagnosis. We agree with the use of the heat map to illustrate the relative contributions of low GFR and albuminuria to cardiovascular and renal risk, though we thought that the highest risk category was too broad, including as it does people at disparate levels of risk. We add an albuminuria category A4 for nephrotic-range proteinuria and D and T categories for patients on dialysis or with a functioning renal transplant. We recommend target blood pressure of 140/90mm Hg regardless of diabetes or proteinuria, and against the combination of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We recommend against routine protein restriction. We concur on individualization of hemoglobin A1c targets. We do not agree with routine restriction of sodium intake to <2g/d, instead suggesting reduction of sodium intake in those with high intake (>3.3g/d). We suggest screening for anemia only when GFR is <30mL/min/1.73m(2). We recognize the absence of evidence on appropriate phosphate targets and methods of achieving them and do not agree with suggestions in this area. In drug dosing, we agree with the recommendation of using absolute clearance (ie, milliliters per minute), calculated from the patient's estimated GFR (which is normalized to 1.73m(2)) and the patient's actual anthropomorphic body surface area. We agree with referral to a nephrologist when GFR is <30mL/min/1.73m(2) (and for many other scenarios), but suggest urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 60mg/mmol or proteinuria with protein excretion > 1g/d as the referral threshold for proteinuria.

Evaluation of albuminuria—definition and initial testing—states that albuminuria refers to abnormal loss of albumin in the urine defined as albumin ≥30 mg/g [≥3 mg/mmol]. Practice Point 1.3.1.1: Use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of preference). In all cases, a first void in the morning midstream sample is preferred in adults and children: urine ACR, or reagent strip urinalysis for albumin and ACR with automated reading. If measuring urine protein, use the following measurements: urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading, or reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading.

Microscopic hematuria—prevalence, risk, and general evaluation shows that prevalence varies widely (0.18% to 16%), a population study of 1.2 million persons aged 16 to 25 years in Israel found persistent microscopic hematuria in 0.3% of individuals, and long-term renal risk in young persons with persistent asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria included ESKD rates of 34.0 versus 2.05 per 100 000 person-years; participants in that study had serum creatinine values “within the normal range” and 24-hour urine protein less than 200 mg, and the study does not provide information on ESKD risk after comprehensive evaluation and selection including measured kidney function. Urine cytology and urine biomarkers are not recommended as a part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria.

KDIGO 2024—Factors affecting interpretation of urine albumin or protein—Understand factors that may affect interpretation of measurements of urine albumin and urine creatinine and order confirmatory tests as indicated. Hematuria, menstruation, exercise, and infection can falsely elevate albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) by increasing albumin and protein in urine, while nonalbumin proteins can cause a false decrease because other proteins may be missed by albumin reagent strips. Variability in urinary creatinine concentration also affects ratios: females have lower urinary creatinine excretion therefore higher ACR and PCR, whereas males have higher urinary creatinine excretion therefore lower ACR and PCR; low weight with low urinary creatinine excretion can cause high ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion, whereas high weight with high urinary creatinine excretion can cause low ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion; lower creatinine excretion with acute kidney injury or low-protein intake, and higher creatinine excretion with high-protein intake or exercise, also influence results.

### Detection and measurement of urinary protein [^e46b325f]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The measurement of urine total protein and albumin is central to the diagnosis and management of subjects with kidney disease and in assessing cardiovascular risk. Accurate assessment is vital to enable detection and management of the patient with proteinuria.

Recent Findings

The spot urine protein has been suggested as an acceptable alternative to 24-h urine collections. Recent studies suggest that this holds true for screening to exclude significant proteinuria (>1 g/day) but data are lacking for the quantification of proteinuria and in assessing response to therapy. For albuminuria, while 24-h urinary albumin excretion remains the gold standard, spot urine samples are appropriate for screening. The optimal technique for the laboratory determination of urinary albumin has been questioned with the high-performance liquid chromatography-based method demonstrating significantly more albumin in the urine. Population-based studies have found dramatic increases in the prevalence of microalbuminuria with the new high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Whether this extra immunounreactive albumin detected by high-performance liquid chromatography is clinically important remains to be established.

Summary

Twenty-four-hour urine collection remains the gold standard for the accurate determination of both total urinary protein and albumin. Spot urine samples can be used for screening patients for albuminuria and proteinuria. The optimal method for measuring urinary albumin concentration remains to be established.

### Urinary protein excretion and expectant management of early onset, severe pre-eclampsia [^e6255f1a]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the importance of proteinuria in the expectant management of early onset, severe pre-eclampsia.

Methods

In this prospective series of 340 women, 24-h urine collections were performed and monitored twice weekly in a high-care ward.

Results

Seventy-four women with at least two 24-h urine collections were grouped into women with a proteinuria increase of > or =2 g (n=29) and with women whose proteinuria decreased, or increased by <2 g (n=45). Major maternal complications, prolongation of gestation, and perinatal outcomes were comparable. Fifty-six (75%) women experienced an increase in proteinuria. When patients with heavy proteinuria (n=83) were compared to those with moderate proteinuria (n=257), maternal and perinatal outcomes were comparable. More days were gained before delivery in the heavy proteinuria group than in the moderate (12 vs. 9; P<0.001).

Conclusion

Most patients experienced increased proteinuria. Neither the rate of increase nor the amount of proteinuria affected maternal and perinatal outcomes.

### How to measure proteinuria? [^860ad84a]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To examine the use of urine total protein compared with albumin measurements to assess and monitor patients with chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Urine albumin or total protein-to-creatinine ratio measurements on a single-voided specimen provide a convenient and reliable alternative to 24-h urine measurements. The majority of studies that inform current renoprotective strategies have relied upon urine total protein measurements. Urine albumin measurements are required to detect microalbuminuria. The proportion of urinary protein composed of albumin is variable and may depend on the underlying renal disease.

Summary

Urine protein-to-creatinine measurements should continue to be used for the assessment and monitoring of patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. Urine albumin-to-creatinine measurements should be reserved for detecting microalbuminuria and monitoring patients with diabetic nephropathy. Further research is required to investigate the relationship between urine total protein and albumin in different renal diseases and to compare the prognostic significance of urine total protein with that of albumin.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the Hiv Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^e6587716]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Albuminuria and proteinuria assessment in HIV-infected persons—detection of albuminuria or proteinuria is the most common method of detecting kidney damage, and KDIGO guidelines recommend albuminuria as the preferred marker for staging CKD. Urine dipstick provides a semiquantitative measure but can substantially underestimate or overestimate true protein excretion depending on hydration status. Twenty-four–hour urine collections are the reference standard for measuring urinary excretion of albumin or protein; the adequacy of a 24-hour collection can be assessed against expected creatinine excretion of 20–25 and 15–20 mg/kg/day in men and women, respectively. The most clinically useful methods for quantifying excretion are the albumin-to-creatinine and the protein-to-creatinine ratios performed on random urine samples; albumin-to-creatinine ratios from random samples (ideally first morning) correlate closely with 24-hour collections. On average, humans excrete approximately 1 g of creatinine in the urine each day, so albumin or protein to creatinine ratios correspond to total daily excretion.

### Should proteinuria reduction be the criterion for antihypertensive drug selection for patients with kidney disease? [^10864d8a]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Proteinuria, that is, more than 200 mg/day of urinary albumin, is associated with the presence of kidney disease. Its increase over time is strongly correlated with progression of nephropathy. Retrospective analyses of nephropathy outcome trials show that proteinuria reduction of 30% or more after initiation of blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapy is associated with slower nephropathy progression than lowering BP without its reduction.

Recent Findings

Retrospective analyses of five large nephropathy outcome trials demonstrate that nephropathy progression slowed by an additional 28-39% over the control or placebo group when proteinuria was reduced in concert with BP. Two separate trials demonstrate that nephropathy progression was slowed to a lesser degree when BP was reduced to a similar degree, but proteinuria reduced less than 30%. These associations do not hold for those with microalbuminuria, in which BP reduction is the key element to slowing nephropathy progression. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials fail to show a relationship between reductions in proteinuria and nephropathy outcomes. This large cardiovascular endpoint trial, however, was not only powered for nephropathy outcomes but also failed to show a benefit between proteinuria reduction and cardiovascular events, a previously established observation.

Summary

All patients with a history of hypertension and either kidney disease or diabetes should have an annual check for albuminuria. If albumin is present in amounts of more than 200 mg/day, strategies for BP-lowering therapy should also focus on a reduction of more than 30% of urinary protein.

This approach needs to be systematically compared with other techniques before it can be universally recommended to replace the time-honored 24-hour urine collection.

B. Prognosis.

Albuminuria values >30 mg/g creatinine [and lower values if the eGFR is <60 mL/min (Table 8)] have prognostic significance. Multiple epidemiologic studies have shown it to be an independent risk marker for cardiovascular death. In 80% of patients with type 1 diabetes and low levels of albuminuria, urinary albumin excretion can increase by as much as 10%–20%/year, with the development of clinical proteinuria (>300 mg albumin/day) in 10–15 years in more than half the patients. After clinical-grade proteinuria occurs, >90% of patients develop a decreased GFR and, ultimately, end-stage renal disease. In type 2 diabetes, 20%–40% of patients with stage A2 albuminuria (Table 8) progress to overt nephropathy, but by 20 years after overt nephropathy, approximately 20% develop end-stage renal disease. In addition, patients with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) and stage A2 albuminuria are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Of note is that low levels of albuminuria alone indicate neither an increased risk for progression to end-stage kidney disease nor kidney disease per se; hypertension needs to be present for the risk of progression. Moreover, about 20% of people progress to end-stage kidney disease without an increase in low levels of albuminuria. Another factor that indicates progression is an increase in albuminuria from stage A2 to A3 over time despite achievement of blood pressure goals.

C. Monitoring.

The roles of routine urinalysis and albumin measurements are less clear in patients with stage A2 albuminuria. Some experts have advocated urine protein testing to monitor treatment, which may include improved glycemic control, more assiduous control of hypertension, dietary protein restriction, and therapy with blockers of the renin angiotensin system. Several factors are known to slow the rate of urinary albumin excretion or to prevent its development. They include reducing blood pressure (with a blocker of the renin angiotensin system as part of the regimen), glycemic control, and lipid-lowering therapy (,–).

Early detection of any chronic disease, including CKD, provides greater opportunities to reduce morbidity as treatments can be initiated earlier in the disease course, and knowledge of level of albuminuria and GFR also helps guide clinical decisions beyond initiating treatments specifically for CKD. Thus, initial testing of blood and urine to detect CKD is important, with confirmatory testing if initial findings indicate the presence of abnormalities of creatinine/eGFR or albuminuria.

### Urinary protein and enzyme excretion as markers of tubular damage [^30ad3750]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In this review we intend to evaluate the clinical usefulness of measurement of urinary excretion of microproteins and tubular enzymes.

Recent Findings

Studies of patients with acute tubular necrosis showed that the excretion of some well known enzymes and of new markers such as kidney injury molecule-1 has higher value than classic renal function tests for the early detection of the disease as well as for the prediction of the development of overt acute renal failure. Tubular dysfunction may be detected by measurement of the excretion of tubular enzymes and microproteins not only in workers chronically exposed to heavy metals but also in population exposed to low environmental level below the limits set by the WHO. In chronic glomerulonephritis the excretion of alpha1-microglobulin is significantly associated with the extent of tubulo-interstitial damage and predicts outcome better than proteinuria/day; in the same diseases NAG excretion is significantly dependent on immunoglobulin G and alpha1-microglobulin excretion and predicts remission, progression and response to therapy.

Summary

The measurement of urinary excretion of tubular enzymes and microproteins may be clinically useful in several different kidney diseases (such as acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis) both for diagnosis and prediction of fractional outcome.

### Urine protein: creatinine ratio vs 24-hour urine protein for proteinuria management: analysis from the phase 3 REFLECT study of lenvatinib vs sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma [^38799b67]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria is a class effect of antiangiogenic agents,and a well-documented lenvatinib-associated adverse effect.– Rates of any-grade/grade ≥3 proteinuria observed in lenvatinib-treated patients were 25%/6% in the phase 3 REFLECT study in unresectable HCC,31%/10% in the phase 3 SELECT in patients with RR-DTC,and 31%/19% in a phase 2 study in patients with advanced/metastatic RCC.

Patients receiving lenvatinib are monitored regularly for proteinuria using a urine sample dipstick method. The current standard management requires a 24-hour urine protein test if a dipstick proteinuria result of ≥2+ is detected, with the recommendation that lenvatinib treatment should be withheld if a proteinuria level of ≥2 g/24 h is detected.This 24-hour urine protein test relies on patient collection of urine overnight, which is burdensome and may be influenced by patient compliance. However, the single (“spot”) urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) is a simple and convenient alternative test that is often used to detect proteinuria associated with certain medical conditions, e.g. chronic kidney disease and diabetes. UPCR is calculated by dividing the level of protein (mg/dl) in a spot urine test by the creatinine level (mg/dl).This approach was first validated in 1983 by Ginsberg and colleagues.It is based on the premise that urinary creatinine excretion and the protein excretion rate in the presence of a stable glomerular filtration rate are fairly constant in a given patient. Thus, a simple ratio of the 2 in a single-void urine sample would reflect cumulative protein excretion over a day (because the ratio of 2 stable rates would cancel out the time factor).

To determine whether UPCR could be a useful and more convenient assessment for proteinuria in patients receiving lenvatinib, we evaluated the correlation between proteinuria assessment by UPCR and 24-hour urine protein in patients with HCC from the REFLECT study.

Pediatric albuminuria/proteinuria testing—Practice Point 1.3.1.4: In children, obtain a first morning urine sample for the initial testing of albuminuria and proteinuria in descending order of preference as follows: both urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR); reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with automated reading; or reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with manual reading. PCR is advised and preferred as initial screening for children because many have congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and a higher proportion have tubular proteinuria, and testing for ACR may miss tubular proteinuria.

Table 18—impact of albuminuria/proteinuria on CKD progression in pediatrics—higher proteinuria or albuminuria and early reductions correlate with large differences in progression risk and kidney survival. A 50% reduction of proteinuria within the first 2 months more than halved progression risk over 5 years; in a cohort of over 7 million children, ≥1+ dipstick proteinuria doubled CKD progression risk and proteinuria with hypertension quadrupled it over a median 5 years; ACR of >300 mg/g (>30 mg/mmol) was associated with an 84% higher risk over 3 years versus ACR 30 mg/g (3 mg/mmol); PCR of 630 mg/g (71 mg/mmol) was associated with an 87% higher risk versus PCR 140 mg/g (16 mg/mmol); each log higher ACR was linked to a 50% higher risk of kidney failure or a 50% eGFR decline over 3 years; after RASi cessation, a 15% increase in albuminuria was associated with faster progression; compared with PCR >900 mg/g (>102 mg/mmol), baseline PCR <200 mg/g (<23 mg/mmol) or 200–900 mg/g (23–102 mg/mmol) had higher 5‑year kidney survival (97% and 94% vs. 45%); in an Indian cohort, 2‑year progression risk was tripled for proteinuria >2000 mg/g (226 mg/mmol), and in a Japanese cohort proteinuria >2000 mg/g (>226 mg/mmol) conferred risk 7 times as high after adjustment.

CKD IN MEN AND WOMEN

Although it is becoming increasingly clear that CKD is more common among women than men, at least in part to their longer life expectancy, there still appear to be major differences in terms of detection, monitoring, referral and therapy-related adverse event rates. In a North European study, women with newly detected CKD were less likely to be monitored for their kidney function, receive a clinical diagnosis, be referred to nephrologist care or initiate antiproteinuric treatment compared with equal men. Such differences are worrisome and should be further investigated (and if present corrected) in other countries.

Chapter 4: Nephrotic syndrome in children—diagnostic definitions and thresholds include the following: Nephrotic-range proteinuria is first morning or 24-h PCR ≥ 2 g/g (or 200 mg/mmol or ≥3+ dipstick). Nephrotic syndrome requires nephrotic-range proteinuria plus either hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin <30 g/l (3 g/dl)) or edema when albumin is not available. Complete remission is first morning or 24-h PCR ≤ 200 mg/g (or 20 mg/mmol or negative or trace dipstick) on three or more consecutive occasions, while partial remission is first morning or 24-h PCR >200 mg/g but <2 g/g (or >20 and <200 mg/mmol) and, if available, serum albumin ≥30 g/l (3 g/dl). Relapse is defined in children as dipstick 3+ for 3 consecutive days. Typical urine dipstick protein ranges are Negative: 0 to <15 mg/dl; Trace: 15 to <30 mg/dl; 1+: 30 to <100 mg/dl; 2+: 100 to <300 mg/dl; 3+: 300 to <1000 mg/dl; and 4+: ≥1000 mg/dl. For children aged 1–18 years, to rule out orthostatic proteinuria, the first morning urine should be collected separately for assessment.

### Chronic kidney disease: detection and evaluation [^faf88577]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects 47 million people in the United States and is associated with significant health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Because this disease can silently progress to advanced stages, early detection is critical for initiating timely interventions. Multiple guidelines recommend at least annual screening with serum creatinine, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and urinalysis for patients with risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of cardiovascular disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chronic kidney disease in the general population, and the American College of Physicians recommends against screening asymptomatic adults without risk factors. Persistently elevated serum creatinine and albuminuria are diagnostic and prognostic hallmarks of chronic kidney disease. Lower levels of albuminuria are associated with adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Serum cystatin C is a novel biomarker that is most useful when a false-positive decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated from serum creatinine is suspected. New guidelines incorporate albuminuria into the classification framework for chronic kidney disease and elaborate on identification of the disease, the frequency of follow-up, and recommendations for nephrology referral. Nephrology consultation is indicated for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2, persistent urine albumin/creatinine ratio greater than 300 mg per g or urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg per g, or if there is evidence of a rapid loss of kidney function. A multidisciplinary approach between primary care physicians, nephrologists, and other subspecialists for implementing early interventions, providing education, and planning for advanced renal disease is key for effective management.

Donor candidates—albuminuria screening, confirmation, and selection thresholds—Initial evaluation of donor albuminuria (screening) should be performed using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a random (untimed) urine specimen, and donor albuminuria should be confirmed using albumin excretion rate (AER, mg/day [mg/d]) in a timed urine specimen or by repeat ACR if AER cannot be obtained. Urine AER less than 30 mg/d should be considered an acceptable level for donation. The decision to approve donor candidates with AER 30 to 100 mg/d should be individualized based on demographic and health profile in relation to the transplant program’s acceptable risk threshold. Donor candidates with urine AER greater than 100 mg/d should not donate.

KDIGO Living Kidney Donor Work Group—albuminuria assessment and initial testing approach: Urine albumin is the preferred measure of urine protein for assessment of kidney damage, and the KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline for the evaluation of albuminuria in the general population recommends 2-stage testing (initial testing followed by confirmatory testing) that the Work Group concluded was applicable to kidney donor candidates; in all cases an early morning urine sample is preferred to minimize diurnal variation. For measurement, the rationale for preferring urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) to albumin concentration is that urine concentration and dilution can vary by more than 10-fold among individuals and during the day, and the KDIGO CKD guideline therefore recommends that clinical laboratories measure creatinine when albumin is requested and express the results as ACR in addition to albumin concentration; indexing albumin to creatinine overcomes dilution effects but introduces variation by creatinine generation. Additional notes include that some investigators have proposed estimating creatinine excretion rate and multiplying this quantity by ACR to estimate albumin excretion rate (AER), and that the lower limit of detection for urine albumin may be used for computation of urine ACR if the laboratory reports “below the detectable limit.” AER is widely accepted as a marker of kidney damage and in diabetic kidney disease and other glomerular diseases, increased AER generally occurs before the decline in GFR.

Laboratories should ensure that they are enrolled and demonstrate satisfactory performance in an EQA scheme for urine albumin, creatinine, and ACR, and ACR results should be expressed to one decimal place (mg/mmol) or whole numbers (mg/g). Both enzymatic and Jaffe assays are generally suitable for the measurement of creatinine in urine but should be validated for each intended use.

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: does one answer fit all? [^65a417ee]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts. In this mini review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations for choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.

Proximal tubular dysfunction—urine and derived indices are characterized by diagnostic glycosuria and specific fractional excretion and ratio thresholds. Urine glucose on dipstick is defined as glycosuria in the absence of diabetes, or in diabetics with well-controlled blood glucose and is diagnostic of renal tubular injury. Fractional excretion of phosphate is interpreted as <10% is normal and >20% is abnormal, and an upward trend in urinary phosphate wasting is suggestive of tubular injury. Tubular maximum for phosphate corrected for glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) is lower than reference value (normal, 2.8–4.4 mg/dL) to assess renal phosphate handling independent of plasma phosphate and renal function. For purine handling, the fractional excretion of uric acid is <15% is normal and >20% is abnormal, and an upward trend in urinary uric acid wasting is strongly suggestive of proximal tubular dysfunction. Protein selectivity can be screened with the urine albumin-to-protein ratio, where uAPR <0.4 suggests predominantly tubulointerstitial disease, whereas uAPR >0.4 suggests predominantly glomerular disease, and it is only evaluated in individuals with urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥200 mg/g.

Laboratory assessment of urine albumin—“Implement the laboratory reporting and handling standards outlined in Table 17 to ensure accuracy and reliability of the findings when assessing urine samples,” and “Implementation of an external quality assessment scheme/program for urine albumin and creatinine, including calculation of the ACR, is a preferred practice for laboratories.” Between-laboratory results “may vary by greater than 40%,” so consistent collection is important; “the assessment of ACR from a single void is a common and convenient clinical practice… preferably using the first morning void specimen.” Storage guidance includes that albumin is “stable in urine stored at 2°–8 °C for 7 days,” but losses occur “from freezing and storage below −80 °C,” and “samples should be warmed to room temperature and mixed before analysis”; “refrigerated storage and processed samples … within 7 days” should be feasible. Table 17 standards specify: analyze fresh or store at “4 °C for up to 7 days”; “should not be stored frozen at −20 °C”; “Report ACR in untimed urine samples… rather than the concentrations alone”; use “1 decimal place for ACR whether mg/mmol or mg/g”; and “Analytical CV … should be <15%.” Given biological variability, “The biological variation of urine albumin exceeds 60%,” and target analytical variation is “<0.25 biological variation, approximately 15%.”

Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children—urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and albumin thresholds: The substitution of spot UPCR for the 24-hour urine collection has been established as the standard of care for children, with nephrotic-range proteinuria defined as first morning UPCR of ≥2 g/g. Whereas the 2012 KDIGO guideline maintained albumin ≤2.5 g/dL, the current guideline suggests serum albumin ≤3 g/dl; however, we suggest continuing to use the definition of nephrotic syndrome for children in the absence of evidence to support a change to a higher cutoff. It is unknown whether children with nephrotic-range proteinuria and less severe hypoalbuminemia (albumin of 2.6-2.9 g/dL) have similar pathology or treatment responses, and this has not been studied in prospective clinical trials.

### Microalbuminuria constitutes a clinical action item for clinicians in 2021 [^16f7b6c2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 10% of the population or 800 million people globally, with diabetes being the leading cause. The presence of chronic kidney disease with impaired kidney function or with albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of a progressive loss of renal function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and excess mortality. Screening for chronic kidney disease is critically important because during the initial stages patients often have no symptoms and because we now have available recently approved multiple interventions that can reduce the high risks dramatically. Screening should be performed with regular measurement of albumin in the urine and creatinine or cystatin C in blood for estimation of kidney function. Regretfully recent data indicates that screening for albuminuria is conducted in only 20%-50% of people at risk depending on the setting. Clinicians need to perform regular screening and concomitant management of risk factors. Recent therapeutic options must be implemented to improve outcomes. Finally, a reduction in albuminuria after initiation of intervention constitutes a treatment target because it indicates improved prognosis.

In this guideline, children are defined as those aged <18 years, and although postpubertal children may in some respects have a similar course and response to treatment as adults with IgAN, there are insufficient data currently to recommend that they be managed as adults with IgAN. Visible hematuria is more frequent in children than in adults, and children generally have higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), lower urine protein excretion, and more hematuria than adults at diagnosis. A kidney biopsy is usually performed at presentation of symptoms (hematuria, proteinuria, and normal C3) to confirm the diagnosis and assess the degree of inflammation/presence of necrosis.

Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences”; and policy implication is “The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined.” The additional category “Not Graded” is used “to provide guidance based on common sense or where the topic does not allow adequate application of evidence,” with examples including “monitoring intervals, counseling, and referral to other clinical specialists,” and such statements are “not meant to be interpreted as being stronger recommendations than Level 1 or 2 recommendations.” Evidence quality meanings are: A “High”—“We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect”; B “Moderate”—“The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different”; C “Low”—“The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect”; and D “Very low”—“The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often will be far from the truth.”
