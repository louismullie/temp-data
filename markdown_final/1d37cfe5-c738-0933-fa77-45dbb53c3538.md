## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which retail format is designed to "kill off the competition" and is characterized by a narrow but very deep product assortment, low prices, and limited customer service. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and whether any of the options match it precisely. Then, I should verify how each alternative (specialty stores, limited-line retailers, superstores) differs from that definition. Finally, I will confirm the correct terminology and why it fits the competitive strategy described.

> Let me first confirm the definition. The phrase "designed to kill off the competition" signals a deliberate strategy of dominating a product category through scale, price, and assortment depth, which is the classic category-killer model. Category killers concentrate on a single category, carry a very deep selection within that category, use low pricing to undercut competitors, and often provide minimal service to keep costs down, thereby driving smaller specialists out of business [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the alternatives so I don't jump to conclusions. Specialty stores focus on a narrow assortment but typically do not pursue a "kill the competition" strategy; they emphasize curated selection, expertise, and often higher service rather than rock-bottom pricing, so they don't match the aggressive, low-price, deep-assortment profile here. Limited-line retailers are narrow but not necessarily deep in a single category, and they don't inherently embody the predatory pricing and dominance strategy implied by the question. Superstores, by contrast, are broad-assortment, one-stop formats with large footprints and extensive services, which is the opposite of the narrow, deep, low-service model described [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the terminology one more time. The description — narrow category focus, very deep assortment, low prices, and limited service — maps directly to the category-killer concept, which is explicitly about category domination and competitive displacement of smaller players through scale and price leadership. None of the other options capture both the narrowness and the aggressive competitive stance as precisely as category-killer stores do [^notfound].

> Therefore, the correct answer is C. Category-killer stores, because they are intentionally designed to dominate a product category with deep selection and low prices, often at the expense of customer service, to outcompete and "kill off" smaller rivals [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **C. Category-killer stores**. These retailers dominate a single product category with a narrow but deep assortment, low prices, and minimal customer service, enabling them to outcompete smaller specialty stores and consolidate market share [^notfound].

---

## Characteristics of category-killer stores

Category-killer stores exhibit several **distinct characteristics** that differentiate them from other retail formats:

- **Narrow but deep product assortment**: Category-killer stores focus on a specific product category (e.g. electronics, home improvement, toys) and offer an extensive range of products within that category, often far exceeding the variety available in smaller specialty stores [^notfound].

- **Low prices**: These stores leverage economies of scale, efficient supply chain management, and bulk purchasing to offer significantly lower prices than their competitors, attracting price-sensitive consumers [^notfound].

- **Minimal customer service**: Category-killer stores typically provide limited customer service, relying on self-service models to reduce operational costs and maintain low prices [^notfound].

- **Large store formats**: These retailers often operate in large warehouse-style stores, allowing them to stock a vast array of products and create a one-stop shopping experience within their chosen category [^notfound].

---

## Examples of category-killer stores

Several well-known retailers exemplify the **category-killer model**:

| **Retailer** | **Product category** |
|-|-|
| Best Buy | Electronics and appliances |
| Home Depot | Home improvement and construction supplies |
| Toys "R" Us (historically) | Toys and baby products |
| Staples | Office supplies |
| Barnes & Noble | Books and media |

## Competitive strategy of category-killer stores

Category-killer stores employ a **competitive strategy** centered on market dominance through specialization and cost leadership. By focusing on a single product category, these retailers achieve economies of scale, negotiate favorable terms with suppliers, and streamline operations to minimize costs. This allows them to offer lower prices than smaller competitors, ultimately driving many specialty stores out of business [^notfound].

---

## Impact on competition and market dynamics

The emergence of category-killer stores has significantly **altered retail competition and market dynamics**. Their aggressive pricing strategies and extensive product offerings have forced many smaller specialty retailers to close or adapt their business models. This consolidation of market share has led to increased concentration within specific product categories, raising concerns about reduced competition and consumer choice [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other retail formats

Category-killer stores differ from other retail formats in several **key ways**:

- **Specialty stores**: While specialty stores also focus on a specific product category, they typically offer higher levels of customer service, curated product selections, and premium pricing. In contrast, category-killer stores prioritize low prices and extensive product variety over personalized service [^notfound].

- **Limited line retailers**: Limited line retailers offer a narrow range of products across multiple categories, whereas category-killer stores concentrate on a single category with a deep assortment [^notfound].

- **Superstores**: Superstores provide a broad range of products across multiple categories, often including groceries, clothing, and household items. Category-killer stores, on the other hand, specialize in a single category and offer a more extensive selection within that category [^notfound].

---

## Challenges and criticisms

Despite their success, category-killer stores face several **challenges and criticisms**:

- **Impact on small businesses**: Category-killer stores have been criticized for driving smaller specialty retailers out of business, reducing diversity in the retail landscape [^notfound].

- **Labor practices**: These retailers have faced scrutiny regarding labor practices, including low wages, limited benefits, and poor working conditions [^notfound].

- **Environmental concerns**: The large store formats and extensive product offerings of category-killer stores contribute to environmental concerns, including increased energy consumption, waste generation, and carbon emissions [^notfound].

---

## Evolution and adaptation

In recent years, category-killer stores have evolved and adapted to changing consumer preferences and market conditions. Many have **invested in e-commerce platforms**, enhanced customer service, and expanded their product offerings to remain competitive. Additionally, some category-killer stores have diversified into new product categories or adopted hybrid retail models to attract a broader customer base [^notfound].

---

Category-killer stores are retail establishments designed to dominate a specific product category by offering a narrow but deep assortment, low prices, and minimal customer service. This strategy enables them to outcompete smaller specialty stores and consolidate market share, significantly impacting retail competition and market dynamics [^notfound].

### Causal loop diagramming the dynamics that shape food environments in Dutch supermarkets [^457858ac]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The final loop, S1B5 (Fig. 3 B), explains that retailers aim for a diverse product-mix, to be able to serve and attract customers with different preferences. When one product (type) dominates the assortment, this lowers the product-mix diversity that is needed to attract a diverse range of consumers. Therefore, retailers choose to add products that improve diversity, while reducing products that are already dominant in the product-mix. This mechanism counteracts the tendency of popular products to increase in availability.

Several dynamics act upon the discussed feedback loops. S1D3 (Fig. 3 B) shows how popular products attract consumers to a store (especially when competitors do not offer them), which grants these products secondary value to the retailer, as attracted consumers often buy multiple products. This explains why stores will offer popular but relatively unprofitable products (often major brands such as Coca Cola and Heineken). S1D4 (Fig. 3 B) shows how lower product prices can attract, or higher prices can repulse consumers, adding secondary value to products with a low price, despite lower profit margins. Retailer price rankings help consumers to be aware of price differences. Finally, S1D5 (Fig. 3 B) describes the ongoing competition between retailers over consumers. This provides an ongoing incentive for retailers to ensure that they remain attractive (e.g. low prices, varied and popular products). Notably, different retailers use different strategies. Some have optimised their business model around limited diversity but lower prices, whereas other have aimed for greater variety with higher prices.

### How tobacco companies ensure prime placement of their advertising and products in stores: interviews with retailers about tobacco company incentive programmes [^0abc7eac]. Tobacco Control (2003). Low credibility.

Background

About 81% of cigarette manufacturers' marketing expenditures in the USA is spent to promote cigarette sales in stores. Relatively little is known about how these expenditures help the manufacturers achieve their marketing goals in stores. A better understanding of how tobacco companies influence the retail environment would help researchers and tobacco control activists to monitor industry presence in stores.

Objective

To describe the types of tobacco company incentive programmes offered to retailers, how these programmes impact the store environments, and possible visual indicators of retailer participation in incentive programmes.

Study Design

In-depth qualitative interviews with a convenience sample of 29 tobacco retailers were conducted in 2001.

Setting

USA.

Main Outcome Measures

The types and requirements of retailer incentive programmes provided by tobacco companies, and how participation in a programme alters their stores.

Results

The retailers provided insights into how tobacco companies convey promotional allowances and special offers to them and how these incentives shape the retail environment. Retailers noted that tobacco companies exert substantial control over their stores by requiring placement of products in the most visible locations, and of specific amounts and types of advertising in prime locations in the store. Retailers also described how tobacco companies reduce prices by offering them volume based discounts, "buy two, get one free" specials, and "buying down" the price of existing product.

Conclusions

Tobacco companies are concentrating their marketing dollars at the point-of-sale to the extent that the store is their primary communication channel with customers. As a result, all shoppers regardless of age or smoking status are exposed to pro-smoking messages. Given the financial resources spent by tobacco companies in stores, this venue warrants closer scrutiny by researchers and tobacco control advocates.

### The quarter that changed the world [^3bf4ee8f]. Tobacco Control (2010). Low credibility.

As CTCP considers the future, decreasing smoking rates and narrowing disparities across population subgroups is a priority. Expanding partnerships with those that serve the socially and economically disadvantaged is essential for these efforts to succeed. Using the social norm change strategy to increase the price of tobacco products, decrease exposure to secondhand smoke, increase the availability and use of cessation services and capitalising on the opportunities provided by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Actare part of the future agenda. This will be done by considering and exploring the strategies described in box 1.

Box 1
Future considerations for tobacco control in California

Establish a tobacco tax indexed to inflation and establish a minimum retail price for tobacco products set at the manufacturer's level to prevent price manipulation by geography, store type and season in order to reduce tobacco industry targeting of populations and markets.
Restrict time, place and manner of tobacco advertising or marketing consistent with the First Amendment and Food and Drug Administration tobacco control legislation.
Develop a population-based quit plan for California that expands coverage of and utilisation of tobacco cessation benefits especially among the socially and economically disadvantaged.
Strengthen and conduct a health and human services partnership campaign among organisations and agencies serving the most socially and economically disadvantaged populations such as mental health system, alcohol and drug treatment providers, licensed child and adult housing, food assistance programmes, housing assistance programme and employment assistance. Seek to establish uniform policies regarding secondhand smoke, acceptance of tobacco industry philanthropy and tobacco cessation support.
Establish policies that prohibit the distribution of free or low-cost tobacco products, coupons, coupon offers, rebate offers, gift certificates, gift cards or other similar offers for tobacco products consistent with the First Amendment and Food and Drug Administration tobacco control legislation.
Establish a 100% smoke-free indoor workplace standard for all workplaces under the jurisdiction of state, county, city and tribal governments.
Use local tobacco retail licensing and permits to eliminate retail tobacco sales wherever direct healthcare services are provided and decrease the density of tobacco retailers.
Establish policies to restrict smoking in individual units of multi-unit housing including balconies and patios.
Establish an anti-tobacco advertising fairness doctrine standard for tobacco product buydowns, promotions and other retail marketing which would establish a 1:1 or 3:1 placement of anti-tobacco advertising for each pro-tobacco advertisement.
Establish sunshine or disclosure requirements (similar to political campaign disclosure requirements) to require disclosure of tobacco manufacturer/wholesalers/distributor payments to retailers (eg, incentives, buydowns and promotions).

### How to implement new diagnostic products in low-resource settings: an end-to-end framework [^64128c6f]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

During this phase, the developer also prepares clinical and regulatory, manufacturing and marketing and sales plans to meet development and implementation milestones. The marketing and sales plan addresses the target countries or geographies in which the product will be rolled out; develops sales and distribution strategies, including customer-service options (eg, user training, external quality-assurance programmes, installation and maintenance of instrumentation, calibration and repair)and defines the overall marketing strategy including advocacy and stakeholder engagement plans.

Various factors influence how a product is brought to market, such as available funding, market size, probability of success, infrastructure, policy guidelines and willingness of countries to adopt the product; there is no one-size-fits-all sales and distribution strategy. Products might be sold directly to governments, global funders or procurers (eg, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, commonly referred to as the "Global Fund") or to NGOs that manage a network of health facilities. In formulating the roll out, sales and distribution and marketing plans, it is particularly useful to develop partnerships with key opinion leaders and implementers in countries that might be early adopters of the product. A comprehensive community engagement plan covering communication strategies with global and national policy makers, procurers and funders can aid in better defining in-country implementation strategies, translating policy into practice and assuring financial support.

The initial intellectual property (IP) review can help identify third-party patent rights that might hinder commercialisation opportunities. Mitigation strategies might involve altering design requirements or looking into licensing agreement options. In certain cases for which the developer receives funding for development, funders might stipulate that this type of IP information, including the developer's patent rights, are shared and managed by the funder. This ensures global access to the diagnostic product — broad accessibility of the product to target populations on appropriate price terms and in a timely manner. In such cases, developers might work together with a funder to define a global access plan in order to address factors such as IP, royalties and pricing structures that prevent access to products. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is one example of a funder that works closely with developers to create global access strategies.

### Socioeconomic inequalities in the healthiness of food choices: exploring the contributions of food expenditures [^d6cfc4ae]. Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

A body of evidence shows that purchasing and consumption of unhealthy diets, in particular, eating fewer fruits and vegetables, is strongly patterned by socioeconomic status (SES). One likely contributor to the socioeconomic patterning in healthy diets is the cost of food: less nutritious, energy-dense foods are often cheaper sources of calories, and higher diet quality has been associated with higher diet cost. Moreover, given most research to date has estimated diet cost by linking dietary intake data to prevailing food price data, the socioeconomic inequalities in expenditure may have been underestimated by assuming a constant price for particular foods (i.e. only accounting for differences between types of foods purchased and not variation between brands). Even so, dietary cost explains some of the relationship between SES and nutrient density of consumed foods, and estimated diet cost has also been shown to mediate the pathway between socioeconomic status (income) and diet quality in a US sample.

A potentially related avenue of research has suggested that consumers who patronize low-priced supermarkets are more likely to have lower-quality diets and higher BMI. Yet even within the same store, more educated households have been found to make healthier purchases. One contributing factor may be the prioritization of low cost, which may lead to preferences for certain supermarkets and also limit food choices within store. As such, concerns about cost may be driving some of the association between supermarket price tier and healthiness of diet. Conversely, if individuals choose to patronize a particular supermarket for reasons other than price (for example, believing a store to offer a wider range of healthy products), this choice may still contribute to subsequent diet cost, given expenditure is a consequence of customers' product choices. Both choice of products within store and choice of the store itself are likely to depend in part on individuals' motivations (e.g. price, health, convenience), which may vary by SES. As such, the relationship between diet cost and diet quality may be bi-directional. Although the extent of this bi-directionality cannot be determined in cross-sectional analyses, reverse mediation analyses offer an initial exploration of the potential contributions of each factor to socioeconomic inequalities.

### Dollar stores as food retailers in the United States: a scoping review [^baf4f80b]. Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aims to examine the role of dollar stores as food retailers in the United States and to identify gaps in existing research regarding dollar stores' impact on food access and healthy eating.

Methods

Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, this study reviewed PubMed, Web of Science, EconLit, Scopus, and AgEcon databases to identify research on dollar stores, capturing literature from May 2009 to October 4th, 2023. Only peer-reviewed U.S.-based articles were included.

Results

Few studies focused on dollar stores alone until recently. Dollar stores were often grouped together with other small storefronts. We identified 63 articles that describe dollar stores' role as food retailers. The literature pertaining to dollar stores as food retailers shifted, with the focus shifted from product offerings in the early 2010s to the business landscape recently. The business landscape theme covered the widest array of topics, while the consumer behavior theme comprised the largest number of published studies (~40%). The most consistent results were found in the product offerings theme, as studies overwhelmingly found that foods offered in dollar stores were less healthy. The health outcome theme had the fewest number of studies, and these findings were inconsistent.

Conclusions

Dollar stores are becoming key players in the U.S. foodscape but remain limited in the availability of healthy food choices, particularly fresh produce. The evidence space of dollar stores and food access is still evolving. Further research is needed to inform public health action.

### Price promotions for food and beverage products in a nationwide sample of food stores [^a9eb74c8]. Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Food and beverage price promotions may be potential targets for public health initiatives but have not been well documented. We assessed prevalence and patterns of price promotions for food and beverage products in a nationwide sample of food stores by store type, product package size, and product healthfulness. We also assessed associations of price promotions with community characteristics and product prices. In-store data collected in 2010–2012 from 8959 food stores in 468 communities spanning 46 U.S. states were used. Differences in the prevalence of price promotions were tested across stores types, product varieties, and product package sizes. Multivariable regression analyses examined associations of presence of price promotions with community racial/ethnic and socioeconomic characteristics and with product prices. The prevalence of price promotions across all 44 products sampled was, on average, 13.4% in supermarkets (ranging from 9.1% for fresh fruits and vegetables to 18.2% for sugar-sweetened beverages), 4.5% in grocery stores (ranging from 2.5% for milk to 6.6% for breads and cereals), and 2.6% in limited service stores (ranging from 1.2% for fresh fruits and vegetables to 4.1% for breads and cereals). No differences were observed by community characteristics. Less-healthy versus more-healthy product varieties and larger versus smaller product package sizes generally had a higher prevalence of price promotion, particularly in supermarkets. On average, in supermarkets, price promotions were associated with 15.2% lower prices. The observed patterns of price promotions warrant more attention in public health food environment research and intervention.

### An overlooked market: loose cigarettes, informal vendors and their implications for tobacco taxation [^8c789398]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

We structure our results around three themes: the proliferation of loose cigarette sales, consumer profiles and prices.

While there are little systematic data on the markets for loose cigarettes, what is available is sufficient to note that, in many LMICs, they are a large market, both with respect to consumption and to retail. In five of the LMICs covered by the ITC survey — Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Thailand and Zambia — at least one-third of consumers in the most recent wave reported that their last purchase was loose cigarettes. Notably, there is substantial variation: the proportion ranges from just under 34% in Thailand to 77% in India and over 80% in Zambia and Kenya. The REEP price data give an indication of how many stores sell loose cigarettes, with table 1 providing an overview by country and seller type. Even though stores are not randomly sampled and do not translate to proportional estimates of market shares, we get a clear sense that, across many African countries, the market for loose cigarettes is substantial, although with significant variation. Table 1 also shows at the proportion of brands sold as both sticks and packs in at least some stores in each country, presenting a partially overlapping and partly segmented market. Aside from Tanzania and Kenya, there are no countries where all brands sold in packs are also sold in single sticks. However, in all cases except Botswana, at least one-third of the brands sold as packs are also sold as single sticks. Countries marked with an asterisk have passed some legislation that bans the sale of single-stick cigarettes, reflected in lower proportions of formal stores selling them.

Table 1
Loose cigarettes supply structure across sub-Saharan Africa

The data also suggest that street vendors are much more likely to have loose cigarettes on offer than formal retail stores. This is not surprising, as street vendors typically operate informally and therefore are less likely to follow regulation on the sale of cigarettes. Similarly, they might have a poorer consumer base or provide the sale of loose cigarettes as an additional service for customers.

With respect to consumers, there are reasons to expect that buyers of loose cigarettes will on average have lower incomes. We know that people on lower incomes typically make routine purchases in smaller quantities despite higher unit costs because of irregular cash flows. Furthermore, they may already purchase other products from the informal vendors who are most likely to sell loose cigarettes.

### National trends in sales and price for commercial tobacco and nicotine products, 2018–2022 [^03cab2a5]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Although cigarettes remained the dominant product sold during the study period, their market share decreased, leading to a more diverse marketplace at a range of price points. The fastest growing and only price-stable products were MON. The most expensive products were ENDS, yet prices decreased in 2019, coinciding with the emergence of cheap, flavored disposable vapes. The subsequent price increase may reflect a shrinking ENDS market given US Food and Drug Administration enforcement against illegal disposables. Cigars, which are largely flavored, remained the cheapest product, driven by low cost and small pack sizes, which is concerning given that flavored products and low prices are appealing to young people. A limitation of this study is that Nielsen data are obtained from convenience stores and may not be generalizable to all store types. However, most tobacco product sales occur in convenience stores.

Faced with many products, consumers may be influenced by price differences to purchase products with varying levels of harm. In particular, the cheapness of cigars, which are combustible tobacco products with many of the same health risks as cigarettes, may perpetuate use. Policies that impact price (ie, taxation and minimum pack size) can discourage use of the most dangerous products and should be considered.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^81af00b9]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Some countries are increasingly interested in developing tiered or differential pricing, whereby different prices are charged to buyers according to their income levels. In theory, it offers the possibility of simultaneously increasing profits and expanding access to a medicine for a larger population. Several criticisms have been raised about tiered pricing, particularly the potentially arbitrary nature of determining tiers, whether it will improve access in lower income countries or small markets, and the lack of transparency or public input into pricing primarily set by sellers — a phenomenon known as price discrimination.

An alternative case has been made for expensive medicines offsetting longer term costs, leading to the development of value based pricing. Value based pricing follows the principle that price should reflect the value to the buyer rather than the actual costs of production plus a margin. It has emerged as a way of agreeing what will be considered during negotiations. Two stages are common: firstly, an agreement of what is included in the value assessment and secondly, how it is valued. Definitions of value can vary across stakeholders and contexts, however, with some arguing that the design of such models can be manipulated to demonstrate a desired outcome. Some countries have experimented with permitting several prices for a single medicine with multiple indications according to the value of each indication. Others, such as Germany, account for such potential differences in value across indications by setting its price according to an average weighted by the population treated in each indication. This strategy, however, may disincentivise applications for new indications with minimal added benefit over comparators, instead relying on off-label prescribing or reformulation of medicines.

Pooled procurement, or joint purchasing, can reduce the power of a monopoly. This allows several buyers to agree to purchase certain medicines exclusively through the group. Joint purchasing increases buyers' power because it provides access to several markets and increases the volume of product included in the tender. Pooled procurement has been shown to reduce the price of medicines drastically and improve access globally and regionally as suppliers and buyers both benefit from economies of scale. For example, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States Pharmaceutical Procurement Service negotiated an average cost savings of 37% for 25 selected pharmaceuticals over a five year period (1998–2002). Pooled procurement is not a perfect solution, however, as constraints owing to differences in national process or legislation may need to be resolved before implementation and may exceed the expected savingsor lead to unintended consequences for the supply.

### Causal loop diagramming the dynamics that shape food environments in Dutch supermarkets [^2481e110]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Loop S1B2 (Fig. 3 B) illustrates that producers (in particular major brands) can use out-of-store promotion campaigns (e.g. commercials, advertisements, sponsoring events) to increase a product's visibility to incite consumer interest and increase sales. Generally, these campaigns are used when sales are (expected to be) lower than desired and only employed for a limited time because promotion campaigns pose a substantial cost to the producer S1D2 (Fig. 3 B).

Loop S1B3 (Fig. 3 B) describes a balancing mechanism to the negotiating power of producers of popular products. Although powerful producers can negotiate higher prices, there is a ceiling where this becomes detrimental to sales, or the retailer's profit margin becomes too narrow. In both cases, the product loses its value to the retailer, which reduces the negotiating power of the producer. Therefore, retailers and producers are incentivised to seek a mutually profitable price point. Another notable loop S1B4 (Fig. 3 B) shows how producers, similar to retailers, aim for a minimum profit margin and will negotiate a higher supply price if it becomes too low, while allowing for lower prices (to boost sales) if it is high enough.

### Scale-up of routine viral load testing in resource-poor settings: current and future implementation challenges [^d9f17458]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

HOW LOW CAN WE GO: DECREASING PRICES

Although prices have continued to come down for VL testing, with the entry of new products and manufacturers to the market, there is still considerable room for price decreases and numerous price-decreasing mechanisms that could and should be adopted. The market is still dominated by a handful of suppliers, and incentives and/or procurement flexibility will be needed to ensure new manufacturers can enter the market to drive prices down. There remains a considerable gap between the real costs of manufacture and the actual prices paid by countries for reagents and consumables — as well as shipment, customs charges, tax, service, and maintenance, etc — demonstrating the potential for further price decreases. One study found that the costs associated with intellectual property are significant, with royalty payments for some VL technologies accounting for a considerable portion (19%–63%) of the total manufacturing costs. Intellectual property should, ideally, be licensed at low or no cost when the final products are sold to LMICs, and any cost saving should be passed on to purchasers. Global health actors will need to better support strategies, such as pooling patents from third parties, royalty-free patents, or reasonable royalties, to ensure affordability.

### Marketing IQOS in a dark market [^0bbc0c9e]. Tobacco Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Phillip Morris International (PMI) is pushing hard to promote IQOS heat-not-burn cigarettes in Ontario, Canada. Canada regulates IQOS as a tobacco product so that the robust tobacco marketing ban creates challenges to its promotion.

Methods

We collected data on IQOS promotion in 49 retail outlets, and through interviews with clerks and observations outside an IQOS store.

Results

The dominant marketing channel is the visible availability of IQOS in a large number of tobacco retail outlets-1029 across Ontario. Several stores display the price of 'heated tobacco' on one of three price signs which are permitted despite Ontario's total display ban. IQOS boutique stores are the locus of aggressive promotion including exchanging a pack of cigarettes or lighter for an IQOS device, launch parties, 'meet and greet' lunches and after-hour events. Outside the store, promotion includes a prominent IQOS sign, a sandwich board sign reading 'Building a Smoke-Free Future' and sales representatives regularly smoking IQOS. Membership services: Upon acquiring an IQOS device one can register to access the IQOS website store5 and receive customer support services, a map of retail locations and a product catalogue. Members receive regular email invitations to complete surveys with opportunities to win prizes.

Conclusions

These promotion activities have undoubtedly made substantial numbers of Ontarians aware of IQOS. Yet, the government has not provided guidance as to absolute and relative potential harms. Our observations of tactics to promote a new tobacco product in a dark market may inform government regulatory policy and non-governmental organisation efforts wherever heat-not-burn products are introduced.

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^ff523ca1]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Increasing access to healthy, affordable foods — community food retail strategies detail partners and store-level actions. The food retail environment has a significant impact on the health of communities, and a healthy food retail environment is one in which it is easier to make healthy choices by encouraging the purchase of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and other nutritious items, rather than energy-dense foods and beverages of low nutritional value. Community partners, including public health agencies, retailers and vendors, business leaders, health care systems and providers, local farmers, food pantries and banks, community development organizations, community members, and other stakeholders, can collaborate in a variety of ways to develop and maintain a healthy retail environment. Both full-service and smaller grocery stores can market and promote healthier choices through leveraging shelf labeling systems to help consumers identify healthier choices and place these items at eye level, in-store promotions of healthy options and recipes, and healthy checkout aisles that limit foods and beverages of low nutritional value. A store can also apply to become an approved vendor for federal nutrition assistance programs funded and administered through the USDA, which provides financial incentives to participants in federal nutrition assistance programs for the purchase of healthier options. Smaller stores face unique challenges, including difficulty meeting distributors' minimum order requirements to receive reasonable prices on healthy options, and working collaboratively, smaller stores can establish group purchasing collectives to increase purchasing power to facilitate the provision of healthier food and beverage options.

### Food insecurity, neighborhood food environment, and health disparities: state of the science, research gaps and opportunities [^e2c59f98]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Neighborhood Food Environments and Health Outcomes

The workshop explored associations between retail food store environments and their diet and chronic disease. Despite the assumption that building new large food stores in underserved neighborhoods would contribute to healthier diets and lower obesity rates, research assessing the impact of retail interventions has yielded inconsistent results. Furthermore, there is limited evidence showing a consistent association between local food environments and obesity; however, reviews suggest that these findings should be interpreted with caution because of the low quality of available studies. Workshop presenters highlighted that considering urban–rural distinction, neighborhood ownership of food stores, price/cost, and cultural relevance may be important factors in study design and when interpreting results. A review of restaurant and food service environments underscored that ∼20% of calories are currently consumed from restaurant food, which tends to be high in calories and low in nutrient density. The example of the Silver Diner study, where a full-service regional chain restaurant offered more prominent healthy kids' menu options by default, illustrated how menu changes and labeling interventions can increase sales of healthier items for children and adults.

### Price promotions on healthier compared with less healthy foods: a hierarchical regression analysis of the impact on sales and social patterning of responses to promotions in great britain [^5b93e07d]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background: There is a growing concern, but limited evidence, that price promotions contribute to a poor diet and the social patterning of diet-related disease.

Objective: We examined the following questions: 1) Are less-healthy foods more likely to be promoted than healthier foods? 2) Are consumers more responsive to promotions on less-healthy products? 3) Are there socioeconomic differences in food purchases in response to price promotions?

Design: With the use of hierarchical regression, we analyzed data on purchases of 11,323 products within 135 food and beverage categories from 26,986 households in Great Britain during 2010. Major supermarkets operated the same price promotions in all branches. The number of stores that offered price promotions on each product for each week was used to measure the frequency of price promotions. We assessed the healthiness of each product by using a nutrient profiling (NP) model.

Results: A total of 6788 products (60%) were in healthier categories and 4535 products (40%) were in less-healthy categories. There was no significant gap in the frequency of promotion by the healthiness of products neither within nor between categories. However, after we controlled for the reference price, price discount rate, and brand-specific effects, the sales uplift arising from price promotions was larger in less-healthy than in healthier categories; a 1-SD point increase in the category mean NP score, implying the category becomes less healthy, was associated with an additional 7.7–percentage point increase in sales (from 27.3% to 35.0%; P < 0.01). The magnitude of the sales uplift from promotions was larger for higher–socioeconomic status (SES) groups than for lower ones (34.6% for the high-SES group, 28.1% for the middle-SES group, and 23.1% for the low-SES group). Finally, there was no significant SES gap in the absolute volume of purchases of less-healthy foods made on promotion.

Conclusion: Attempts to limit promotions on less-healthy foods could improve the population diet but would be unlikely to reduce health inequalities arising from poorer diets in low-socioeconomic groups.

### UK government's new placement legislation is a' good first step': a rapid qualitative analysis of consumer, business, enforcement and health stakeholder perspectives [^51e7c7fa]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

2c. Differences in resource availability and capacity

Understanding the legislation, determining which businesses qualify and making changes to shop infrastructure has been time-intense and costly for retailers. Larger businesses have had better access to legal support (i.e. through primary authority links) and will be less affected by short-term profit loss and implementation costs than smaller stores. The quote below from an independent retailer illustrates this point clearly:

We do promotions because of attracting customers in the shop, to come to buy stuff. If we can't do it, they have that mentality to go to a supermarket. Obviously we're losing customers. Prices going up, wages going up, electricity bills going up. Everything's going up, if we're not getting customers the way we used to be getting, how are we going to survive? (11086, Business, Retailer).

Generally you can be pretty sure that an independent's due diligence procedures won't be anywhere near as robust as a national supermarket, particularly regarding training They're focused very much on the business, [the] sale of products and less so on diligence. And that reflects in the kind of problems that we [environmental health] get. (13015, Enforcer, Environmental Health).

Enforcement stakeholders clearly described how resource issues will mean the majority of local authorities cannot prioritise this legislation. Limited staff and funding cuts result in prioritisation of immediate risks to health (e.g. allergens, crime, safety).

And when you're making the decision between do we try and deal with this unsafe chainsaw that could kill somebody today, or do we deal with these products that contribute to obesity, that is a long term issue, it's very difficult to get priority for long term issues over immediate short term issues. You've got limited resources, you have to target those at stuff that has probably the most imminent risk. And this (legislation) doesn't fall into that category. (13011, Enforcer, Trading standards).

### Implications of large language models for quality and efficiency of neurologic care: emerging issues in neurology [^ce7c6b0c]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Business challenges in implementing LLMs — beyond model bias, business implementation is a significant challenge because "off-the-shelf" products typically do not meet proliferating regulatory requirements, especially those related to data privacy, and generally lack robust functionality such as additional training on health care–specific sources. Health care providers must decide whether to obtain functionality from an existing EHR vendor at additional cost or purchase a stand-alone product; while less mature vendors may carry greater risks such as inability to deliver on sales promises (the so called "vaporware" risk), vendors with smaller customer bases may be nimbler with greater interest in codevelopment and commercialization, and may offer pricing incentives such as no-cost pilots in exchange for marketing references. However, these opportunities often come with restrictions and expected obligations such as significant limitations in the number of users or the extent of the services offered.

### How to implement new diagnostic products in low-resource settings: an end-to-end framework [^dd99e0a3]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Key stakeholders involved in introducing diagnostic products to low-resource settings

Market research is conducted to better understand the projected growth, size and share of the market(s) in which the product will be sold, how the product will be distributed to the end user, customer needs and preferences and the product's competitive advantage. These activities inform others, such as development of the marketing plan, user-requirements document and the business case. The business case provides evidence to justify the need for the new diagnostic product and why pursuing its development will be a viable business opportunity. Developers also prepare a financial model that provides details around the initial investment cost, projected sales, payback period and breakeven point and other investment performance considerations, such as whether the efforts of developers, are likely to yield an acceptable return on investment. Typically, the business case and financial model are updated throughout the development process as more information becomes available and the decision to continue with development is re-evaluated at the end of each development phase.

### Price promotions on healthier compared with less healthy foods: a hierarchical regression analysis of the impact on sales and social patterning of responses to promotions in great britain [^70afd122]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is a growing concern, but limited evidence, that price promotions contribute to a poor diet and the social patterning of diet-related disease.

Objective

We examined the following questions: 1) Are less-healthy foods more likely to be promoted than healthier foods? 2) Are consumers more responsive to promotions on less-healthy products? 3) Are there socioeconomic differences in food purchases in response to price promotions?

Design

With the use of hierarchical regression, we analyzed data on purchases of 11,323 products within 135 food and beverage categories from 26,986 households in Great Britain during 2010. Major supermarkets operated the same price promotions in all branches. The number of stores that offered price promotions on each product for each week was used to measure the frequency of price promotions. We assessed the healthiness of each product by using a nutrient profiling (NP) model.

Results

A total of 6788 products (60%) were in healthier categories and 4535 products (40%) were in less-healthy categories. There was no significant gap in the frequency of promotion by the healthiness of products neither within nor between categories. However, after we controlled for the reference price, price discount rate, and brand-specific effects, the sales uplift arising from price promotions was larger in less-healthy than in healthier categories; a 1-SD point increase in the category mean NP score, implying the category becomes less healthy, was associated with an additional 7.7-percentage point increase in sales (from 27.3% to 35.0%; P < 0.01). The magnitude of the sales uplift from promotions was larger for higher-socioeconomic status (SES) groups than for lower ones (34.6% for the high-SES group, 28.1% for the middle-SES group, and 23.1% for the low-SES group). Finally, there was no significant SES gap in the absolute volume of purchases of less-healthy foods made on promotion.

Conclusion

Attempts to limit promotions on less-healthy foods could improve the population diet but would be unlikely to reduce health inequalities arising from poorer diets in low-socioeconomic groups.

### Causal loop diagramming the dynamics that shape food environments in Dutch supermarkets [^0a0af893]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Food-retail environments are often dominated by unhealthy products, which facilitates unhealthy diets. Limited insight into the factors in the commercial food system that cause this issue makes effective health interventions in retail settings difficult. This study explores the factors and dynamics of the Dutch commercial food system that determine the availability of healthy and unhealthy food in Dutch supermarkets.

Methods

The study developed and analysed a causal loop diagram (CLD) of the factors and dynamics that determine in-store food availability. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with food system professionals (n = 14) and a focus group with academic experts (n = 6), based on the leading question 'what determines the in-store availability of a product?' Transcripts were qualitatively coded to identify factors and their interactions. These were visualised in a CLD and subsequently examined to identify causal loops and other dynamics.

Results

The CLD revealed a core feedback loop between in-store product availability, sales, and pricing, and how this interacted with consumer behaviour and production and supply. Products that sell well and have large profit margins are made more available. Consumers generally buy products that are tasty and affordable, while products with low production and supply costs have better profit margins. These factors favour abundant availability of products consisting of cheap and highly palatable unhealthy ingredients, leading to a reinforcing feedback loop that disadvantages availability of more costly and perishable healthy products. Competition and innovation further emphasise this dynamic, as producers strive to reduce costs and increase palatability in a race to the bottom. Societal interest in health presents a minor feedback loop that favours healthy products due to their positive public image.

Conclusions

Our findings show that the prevalence of unhealthy products compared to healthy ones is deeply ingrained in the current system dynamics. Policy recommendations include facilitating sustainable corporate governance models, adjusting financial incentives via taxes and subsidies, and enforcing a 'level playing field' for healthier business practices.

### Opportunities and barriers for smaller portions in food service: lessons from marketing and behavioral economics [^c171aee9]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Change default to smaller portion of less-healthy foods and add healthier ones

Another way to reduce the default sizes of less-healthy foods is to serve them with additional portions of complementary healthy items. For example, some restaurants offer customers French fries, salad, or half-and-half. Half-and-half could be made the new default at places like Applebee's. McDonald's has experimented with something similar in its Happy Meals, replacing its traditional small French fries with a small serving of French fries (100 calories) plus apple slices.

The advantages of this approach are that it allows customers to satisfy their craving for French fries while reducing energy intake, and not undermining value perception (because the smaller portion of fries is made up with something else). Still, risks remain.

If consumers do not like the virtue item (salad or apples) they may throw it out, not only leading to unnecessary waste, but also leading the customer to perceive a value loss. Even if they eat the virtue item, many consumers may not enjoy it very much, at least compared to the French fries, leading to reduced satisfaction. This tradeoff is one that many 'eager' health customers will like, but reluctant customers will be more resistant to. So the opportunity is biggest with chains that have a large eager segment.

The approach will not work for all menu categories. For example, it will not work straightforwardly for things that cannot be mixed or put on the same plate, like beverages. Still, beverages can be served in separate glasses or bottles. In addition, some blends may work better than previously thought. The Mushroom Council is now working with food operators to market a blended burger that is 60% beef and 40% mushroom. If something like that became the default, higher-calorie beef portions would effectively be reduced.

The main cost barrier in most of these mixed offerings is that in most cases it adds to product and operational costs. Generally, the operator will need more of the healthier items, which tend to be more expensive (although perhaps not in the case of beef versus mushrooms), and adding two items to a side dish instead of one involves operational costs in cooking, serving and communicating.

Still this is one of the best opportunities because it limits the major threat of value erosion. And operational innovation can reduce the cost of most complicated processes. The question is will any operators invest the research and development dollars to make this happen?

### Causal loop diagramming the dynamics that shape food environments in Dutch supermarkets [^fc2e4a30]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using a system dynamics approach, we identified the main dynamics underlying the availability of healthy and unhealthy food products in supermarkets as summarised in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5
Summary of dynamics driving product availability. Shown is a simplified CLD of notable drivers of the availability of unhealthy products (highlighted in red, in A) and healthy products (highlighted blue in B) in supermarkets. Straight lines show a synergistic interaction, dashed lines show an inversed interaction. prod. = producer; ret. = retailer

A key quality of commercially successful food products is the ability to incite consumer interest. This is most strongly driven by low cost and good taste, with health being less important. As a result, unhealthy products, which are generally cheaper and tastier, tend to outperform healthy ones in terms of sales, leading to greater availability in supermarkets due to higher commercial value. Likewise, product innovation is mostly used to further increase product value through tastiness and reduced costs, because these characteristics are most likely to result in commercial success. Healthiness in contrast is commercially more challenging to leverage, because it raises cost and potentially negatively influences taste. This reinforces the abundance of unhealthy, cheap, and tasty products in food-retail environments. Competition over consumers' limited budgets further disincentivises the development and innovation of healthier products, because the first producer to do so takes a commercial risk (healthiness is less likely to lead to commercial success), while competitors (other producers and retailers' private labels) can simply copy 'what works' (a so-called first-mover disadvantage). The same dynamic disincentivises retailers from replacing unhealthy products with healthier products, at the risk of consumers moving to competitors who only copied the 'popular' replacements. The negotiating power of producers plays a balancing role: Powerful producers can negotiate higher supply prices, making the product less profitable for retailers, although in practice, such products would also likely have greater sales volumes and attract customers. In reverse, less powerful producers would likely offer products that are unlikely to become substantially more popular for one reason or another (e.g. vegetables).

### Using point-of-sale data to examine tobacco pricing across neighbourhoods in scotland [^3e2cd763]. Tobacco Control (2021). Medium credibility.

This study has several strengths including being the first to assess the relationship between neighbourhood characteristics and tobacco price using comprehensive store-level information on tobacco sales. The results may however be limited in that the data were restricted to convenience stores and studies comparing retailer types have found that tobacco price varies by retailer type and that the relationship between price and area-level characteristics may do also. Our analysis did not find a strong or consistent association between tobacco retail outlet density and price. There may be numerous reasons for this, including the possibility that no such relationship exists, but it may also be due to measurement issues, including collinearity between the area variables in the analysis. This analysis found cigarette and RYO brands were more expensive in large urban areas. The high costs of operating retail businesses in premium city retail sites may obscure the effects of price competition. Our measure of outlet density also may not be a precise indicator of retail competition experienced by the convenience store retailers because it included all retail types, while price competition may be primarily between similar retailer types. Future research could include price data for all retail types.

Despite these limitations this study has important findings that add to current policy discussions regarding tobacco retail interventions, both in Scotland and internationally. One potential policy response to tobacco industry brand segmentation is to broaden future price interventions beyond product duties. A combination of both MUP and a price cap at the upper end would limit the ability of the industry to absorb tax rises and segment the market, thus deterring the continuing supply of subvalue brands. Tobacco MUP has already been implemented elsewhere, and in New York, the minimum price per cigarette pack has been set at $13, the highest price in the USA. In 2017, a minimum excise tax (MET) (equivalent to £5.60 per pack of 20 cigarettes) was introduced in the UK aiming to increase the price of cheap cigarettes. While such an intervention may narrow the price gap between the market segments, it does not prevent the price shifting mentioned earlier and as such the cheapest brands may shift closer to the MET, with prices increasing in the premium brands.MUP is therefore an alternative that would limit this price shifting. Examining the potential effect of minimum pricing of tobacco in the USA research concluded that a national minimum price strategy would have a significant impact on sales and significant benefits for public health.

### Across the world availability of flavour accessories for tobacco products [^1370bda5]. Tobacco Control (2025). Medium credibility.

Marketing

In many cases, target users, mostly smokers and sometimes menthol smokers, were mentioned explicitly on the website promoting the accessory. In two cases, local informants reported that youth were explicitly mentioned as a target group. Websites often contained colourful images of the products and flavours they came in. Some websites had a professional and sleek design or showed positive customer reviews and/or high ratings (eg, five stars). A (menthol) flavour ban was mentioned on the website for many of the products reported in the UK, but not or rarely for products in other countries (with data on this topic lacking for Italy). Websites also often reported (practical) advantages of using these products, such as having the opportunity to choose when to enjoy flavoured smoke, adjustable flavour strength, the variety of flavours available and ease of use. In some cases, special price offers were reported, including two types of gift sets.

### Committee opinion no. 709: commercial enterprises in medical practice [^3baad8f0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Medical goods and services — under most circumstances, the direct sale of products by obstetrician–gynecologists to patients in clinical settings represents an apparent financial conflict of interest, and the sale of prescription or nonprescription medication or devices directly to patients from obstetrician–gynecologists' offices is discouraged when reasonably convenient, alternative vendors exist. ACOG recognizes that in-office availability of medical goods and services may improve clinical care and that the obstetrician–gynecologist's office may sometimes be the only point of access; in these cases, or when medically indicated products are not covered by insurance, direct-to-patient sales may be permissible. When offering sales, obstetrician–gynecologists should ensure the product is clinically indicated and consistent with current medical practice, should not restrict access to equally effective alternatives or imply office products are the best or only options, should not coercively suggest that continued care is contingent on purchasing from the physician or clinic, and the selling price should not exceed fair market value; if these safeguards are not in place, the therapeutic focus of the patient–physician relationship may be significantly weakened.

### The irony of a rich country: issues of financial access to and availability of healthy food in the republic of Ireland [^e12bb41f]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the weekly financial cost of a diet as recommended by national policy in two parents with two children, single parents with one child and single old people with low income, and begin to identify, in a rich country context, variation in food item availability, price and household purchasing capacity.

Design

Food baskets were developed based on national dietary recommendations and purchasing patterns of these household groups. National-level prices of each food were identified, as well as pricing across a representative selection of Irish retail outlet types. Basket costs were assessed relative to the financial capacity of household type.

Results

The types of retail outlets in which low-income groups tend to shop do not carry many own brand items and is less likely to stock healthy options, but when they do, they are more expensive than in other outlets. Single parents with one child, two adults with two children and single older people would have to spend 80%, 69% and 38%, respectively, of their weekly household income to purchase the food basket based on economy-line products.

Conclusions

Financial access to and availability of healthy food options must be considered through a national policy cognisant of basic human needs for healthy living. This research provides evidence on the direct costs of healthy eating for policy and planning to ensure not only financial capacity but also to guarantee that affordable healthy food choices are physically available to all groups in society.

### Global challenges in preparedness and response to epidemic infectious diseases [^93bdc60b]. Molecular Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Last but not least: Ensuring availability and access

Too often, the battle about access is unsuitably centered on the final product, when in reality it starts much upstream.

A key characteristic of market failure is that market demand-and-supply dynamics do not leverage R&D, availability, and access when the purchasing power of those affected is too small to attract commercial interest. Fixing the market failure for R&D — for instance, through public funding or other market incentives — does not guarantee that the resulting interventions will be registered, available, and accessible in countries where outbreaks occur. Outside an ongoing outbreak, there may be little urge for companies to seek product registration, or for countries or public health authorities to purchase (for stockpiling) the new product if registered — unless motivated by reasons like health security. As a result, critical health technologies that have been developed are not necessarily available where and when an outbreak occurs.

Since licensure is granted to pharmaceutical companies, even if the research was done by broad consortia of public and private partners, the control over product availability — how much is being manufactured and sold to whom and at what price — is essentially in the hands of the private sector. A company typically holds both IP rights via patents on products and technologies and retains exclusivity on the use of data contained in the regulatory dossier, precluding others to produce and sell the products. Such monopolies compound the fragility of an already precarious supply chain. Reliance on a single source for the supply of critical health technologies is a recipe for scarcity, high prices, or both, with major impact on equitable access. The inequalities in COVID-19 vaccine access in Africa for instance are explained in part to the lack of vaccine manufacturing capacity on the continent (currently importing 99% of all vaccines used).

Too often, companies will prioritize licensure in markets of interest, primarily the United States, Europe, and a handful of other countries that may be interested in establishing strategic stockpiles for certain diseases of epidemic potential. For products that are eligible to receive a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) priority review voucher, an incentive to stimulate the development of drugs or vaccines against neglected tropical diseases, filoviruses (including Ebola), rare pediatric indications, and medical countermeasures for certain global health security threats, the financial reward is obtained upon registration at the US FDA. Unfortunately, obtention of the reward is not linked to any obligation for availability or access where needed.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^1e954da5]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Improving strategies for price benchmarking

An important factor in determining a fair price for a medicine is the price a buyer is willing to pay for a given clinical benefit. Buyers have used several different methods to benchmark medicine prices and facilitate purchasing. None of these strategies alone will achieve lower prices, but the recent drive for additional transparency and collaboration has made buyers more active purchasers in determining what is fair in their goal of achieving access for their populations.

Setting a benchmark using price information from other countries, with similar socioeconomic status, is one method that buyers have used to control costs — known as external reference pricing. This method generally uses a declared list price that can differ substantially from the actual price paid, given confidential discounts and rebates. The widespread use of external reference pricing, particularly in Europe, has been criticised because of its reliance on list price. The interconnected web of countries referencing each other's prices has potentially affected launch sequencing across countries, thereby directly affecting patient access.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^b99cc5e7]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Improving strategies for selection and coverage

Buyers have developed several tools to ensure that a new single source medicine reaches appropriate patients. Budget and systems planning can ensure that price negotiations begin with an accurate forecast of the need for, and potential benefit of, a new medicine within a population. Many clinical benefits of a new medicine are common across countries, although their manner of use may need to be adapted to national situations. Thus, strategies for selection and coverage are an area ripe for improvement through additional collaboration and transparency.

Many health systems use horizon scanning for early awareness of medicines that could enter a market. In this way, buyers gain sufficient lead time to analyse the potential effect of a new medicine on the health system and develop strategies to cope with its introduction. Medicines can be prioritised for further review based on criteria such as potential health benefit, potential to trigger system changes, and unit cost or effect on the budget. Horizon scanning is administratively burdensome, but information gathering can be a collaborative effort. For example, nine European countries to date are collaborating in establishing the International Horizon Scanning Initiative.

The World Health Organization recommends that countries use health technology assessment as a tool to support decision making about reimbursement, price setting, and negotiation. The assessment is a multidisciplinary process that uses explicit and scientifically robust methods to weigh up the value of using a health technology, such as at launch, when additional real world evidence about its use is available, and once competitor products reach the market. However, health technology assessment requires significant resources, including staff with training in health economics who can critically assess technical dossiers. Countries looking to introduce such assessment should take a stepwise approach to developing legislative and technical capacity to take full advantage of it in pharmaceutical price setting and reimbursement. National academic institutions can help in developing capacity and can serve as external reviewers and train health technology assessors.

Buyers can extract larger discounts from manufacturers by threatening to offer only limited coverage for a medicine, or to leave it out of a benefit package, national list, or formulary. Without an agreement there is no market. In the US, both the Veterans Health Administration and the Department of Defense negotiate lower prices directly with manufacturers, using formularies to manage which medicines they cover.

### Food insecurity, neighborhood food environment, and health disparities: state of the science, research gaps and opportunities [^59cf4eec]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Neighborhood Food Environment Measurement

Develop research to better characterize the current food retail environment and consumer behavior through additional measures and new technologies. For example, crowdsourced data can complement direct observation data, add variables of interest, fill content gaps, and classify food stores by category and price of products for sale. Direct observation studies using Global Positioning System (GPS) and GIS data can predict food environment interactions and inform intervention development. Eye tracking data can also help to identify mechanisms of behavioral choice within food store environments.

Investigate online food shopping environments and consumer shopping patterns to better understand their role in influencing diet and diet quality, given the growing use of the online food retail space. Online food environments are often characterized by personalized messaging and frequent change using digital algorithms, which introduces challenges for measurement and interpretation. Because many shoppers who use online shopping combine that method with in-store shopping, research to understand "hybrid" food environments will be critical.

Integrate rigorous food choice and diet outcome measures in research study designs. Additional neighborhood characteristics may influence the effects of interventions, and these relationships and pathways are part of understanding the link between neighborhood food environments and health. Furthermore, using store sales data at both the aggregate (store) and individual (shopper) levels to estimate food choices may be useful.

### How pooled procurement can expand access to novel antibacterial therapeutics globally [^736f5473]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is among the most significant threats to modern medicine. Because of limited returns on investment, the development of novel antibacterial products has shifted toward smaller innovators. When these developers only have resources to seek regulatory approval in select high-income countries, they often cannot sell enough of their product to avoid bankruptcy because of the low number of patients with susceptible infections. A qualitative case study was conducted to assess the factors necessary for an existing global health pooled procurement strategy to expand its scope to include novel antibacterial therapeutics. Market access expansion would bring new products to patients where they are needed, while ensuring financial viability for innovators who struggle to retain financial solvency-ensuring that these critical medicines can be available for patients globally and the antimicrobial resistance pipeline can support the demand for new antibacterials for decades to come.

### Tobacco mythbusting-tobacco is not a major driver of foot traffic in low socio-economic small retail stores [^f72d3bda]. Tobacco Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Regulations governing the retail availability of tobacco products are variable across Australian States and Territories, and WA is one of five jurisdictions that requires a retail licence to sell tobacco products (this includes cigarettes, cigars and loose tobacco). Larger retailers and major supermarkets may hold both retail and wholesale tobacco licences. In WA the price of tobacco products tends to be higher at smaller stores that hold only retail licences, compared with stores that have wholesale licences. The number of retailers selling tobacco in WA has remained relatively constant over the last 5 years, and equates to 139 tobacco retailers per 100 000 people. Licensing schemes provide a mechanism for potentially reducing the availability of tobacco products, but the perception that small retailers rely on tobacco sales for business viability is a substantial barrier to policy change. Retailer associations that are affiliated with the tobacco industry perpetuate the perception of negative economic consequences for small retailers, such as loss of tobacco sales revenue and customers. However, findings from the USA, UKand New Zealandchallenge this assumption. Using direct observation, Lawman et al found that the majority of consumers who visited corner stores in low socioeconomic areas of Philadelphia did not purchase tobacco products and that the amount spent on non-tobacco products was similar between consumers who purchased tobacco and those who did not. An analysis of electronic point of sale data from small retailers in the UK yielded consistent findings; 79% of consumers did not purchase tobacco and spending on non-tobacco products was similar between consumers who did and did not purchase tobacco. A study of purchases from convenience stores in New Zealand found that only 14% of transactions involved tobacco products and that consumers who purchased tobacco made slightly fewer purchases of non-tobacco products. A recently published US study of convenience store purchases by young people suggests those who had ever used tobacco were significantly more likely to make a tobacco purchase, highlighting that susceptibility to unplanned purchasing in convenient stores can vary.

To our knowledge there have been no studies that examine consumers' purchases of tobacco and non-tobacco products from small retail stores selling tobacco in the Australian context, and few that examine this through the lens of socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods. This study was designed to objectively assess the extent to which tobacco is a driver of consumer visits to small retailers, and whether purchasing tobacco in these retail environments is associated with planned and unplanned purchases of non-tobacco products.

### Tobacco company agreements with tobacco retailers for price discounts and prime placement of products and advertising: a scoping review [^336a7af6]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Incentives, requirements and impact on the retail environment

Of the 27 studies included, 26 reported requirements expected of and incentives given to retailers. We report the requirements and incentives associated with these contracts using the four P's: placement, promotion, price, and product. Examples from real-world contracts between manufacturers and retailers were made public as part of the US Department of Justice litigation initiated in 1999, US v Philips. See figure 2 and three full contracts (Contract 1 — Philip Morris USA 2015 Retail Leaders Program Agreement; Contract 2 — ITG Brands Retail Partnership Plan Description; Contract 3 — RAI Trade Marketing Services ('RAITMS') Retail Partners Marketing Plan Contract, 2017 Menthol Outlet Plan) found on Open Science Framework online.

Figure 2
Examples of the four 'P's' in contracts between manufacturers and retailers. Excerpts are exact quotes from two tobacco contracts: RAI Trade Marketing Services (RAITMS) Retail Partners Marketing Plan Contract and Philip Morris USA Retail Leaders Program Agreement. The plan-o-gram in the Philip Morris 2015 Retail Leaders Program Agreement was blank and thus replaced with a completed RJ Reynolds plan-o-gram from 2002.

Placement

The most reported requirements described how tobacco products and advertising must be displayed in the store. For example, one retailer interviewed in the UK reported reserving two-thirds of their tobacco unit space for a contracted manufacturerand another in the USA recounted that manufacturer representatives required 45% of the tobacco retail space to be dedicated to that particular manufacturer. Studies also reported that representatives regularly visited retailers and, to varying degrees, had control over the store design, layout, and placement of tobacco products and advertisements. Slotting fees (ie, payments from the manufacturer to the retailer in exchange for shelf space) were also commonly reported as an incentive in different contracts, particularly in the USA. The value of this incentive type varied and was reported to exceed the equivalent of thousands of US dollars by a study in South Korea. The Philip Morris 2015 Retailer Leaders Program Agreement specifically stipulates that the plan-o-gram layout of the store indicating exactly where both products and advertisements go, must be followed. In addition to the plan-o-gram, the manufacturer specifies that Philip Morris products must be clearly visible and close to potential customers, at the top of display cases, and can occupy up to 65% of the display space (figure 2).

### Rapid-response surveillance of the first US test market for VLN cigarettes [^01e11c03]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

VLN King menthol and non-menthol are the first combustible cigarettes to receive US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorisation as modified risk tobacco products. Focusing on the first retail test market, this study characterised VLN advertising, product placement, discounts and price.

Methods

All Chicago-area Circle K stores (n = 133) were telephoned to assess whether they sold VLN. Single-pack price of non-menthol was obtained in 57 of 100 stores that sold VLN. In fall 2022, trained data collectors visited those 57 stores to assess VLN product placement, advertising, discounts and prices. Paired t-tests compared observed VLN price with telephone price and to price of other cigarette brands.

Results

Nearly all stores (91.1%) displayed exterior advertisements for VLN, and 41.1% displayed interior advertising, with 8.9% of stores advertising VLN in the power wall but never in the header row. VLN cigarettes were displayed in the power wall exclusively and among high-nicotine cigarettes. Some VLN marketing claims were not FDA-authorised. VLN advertised a sweepstakes offer and rewards programme. Most stores (85.7%) offered VLN discounts. VLN was priced like a premium brand (mean = $10.90, SD = $1.53), and prices obtained by telephone did not differ from observed prices several months later.

Conclusions

Retail marketing strategies for VLN mimic those for high-nicotine cigarettes. Deviations from FDA-authorised marketing claims were evident. Surveillance in future test markets is recommended to assess compliance with marketing claims and examine relative price and discount offers. Of interest is how premium-priced, low-nicotine cigarettes stand to compete in a market dominated by cheaper high-nicotine cigarettes.

### Disparities in tobacco marketing and product availability at the point of sale: results of a national study [^c45ec4e4]. Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Neighborhood socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities exist in the amount and type of tobacco marketing at retail, but most studies are limited to a single city or state, and few have examined flavored little cigars. Our purpose is to describe tobacco product availability, marketing, and promotions in a national sample of retail stores and to examine associations with neighborhood characteristics.

Methods

At a national sample of 2230 tobacco retailers in the contiguous US, we collected in-person store audit data on: Availability of products (e.g., flavored cigars), quantity of interior and exterior tobacco marketing, presence of price promotions, and marketing with youth appeal. Observational data were matched to census tract demographics.

Results

Over 95% of stores displayed tobacco marketing; the average store featured 29.5 marketing materials. 75.1% of stores displayed at least one tobacco product price promotion, including 87.2% of gas/convenience stores and 85.5% of pharmacies. 16.8% of stores featured marketing below three feet, and 81.3% of stores sold flavored cigars, both of which appeal to youth. Stores in neighborhoods with the highest (vs. lowest) concentration of African-American residents had more than two times greater odds of displaying a price promotion (OR = 2.1) and selling flavored cigars (OR = 2.6). Price promotions were also more common in stores located in neighborhoods with more residents under age 18.

Conclusions and Relevance

Tobacco companies use retail marketing extensively to promote their products to current customers and youth, with disproportionate targeting of African Americans. Local, state, and federal policies are needed to counteract this unhealthy retail environment.

### Beyond excise taxes: a systematic review of literature on non-tax policy approaches to raising tobacco product prices [^c72e5b05]. Tobacco Control (2016). Low credibility.

Policy descriptions, recommendations, political factors and legal issues

Regardless of policy type, more than one-quarter of the articles (n = 15) recommended combining non-tax price policies with taxes to prevent the use of price minimising strategies. Nearly half of all articles (n = 26) described political or legal issues related to price-related policies, including: tobacco industry opposition to, or efforts to circumvent, price-related policies; the importance of considering rules related to commerce, free speech and policy pre-emption by a higher level of government; the value of consulting legal counsel in legislation design; and concerns about the implications of price policies for low income consumers. Recommendations, political factors and legal concerns specific to each of the most cited non-tax policy types are outlined in table 1, and summarised below.

Price promotion restrictions and bans

The review highlighted two different strategies for restricting the ability of tobacco companies, wholesalers or retailers to use price promotions to reduce tobacco prices: comprehensive tobacco marketing legislation that includes price promotion restrictions or standalone legislation restricting price promotions only. Specific price promotion policy components include banning or restricting: tobacco product coupons; value-added promotions like multipack discounting or cross-product promotions; and/or buy-down or master-type programmes in which manufacturers offer price discounts to retailers or wholesalers.

Nearly all of the articles discussing price promotions as part of comprehensive marketing bans reference Article 13 of the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which recommends marketing bans on both direct and indirect advertising, including the distribution of promotional discounts. Several authors argued that few countries implement truly comprehensive marketing bans, often because the bans fail to include point-of-sale or price promotion bans. Throughout the marketing ban papers, authors noted the importance of implementing comprehensive bans to ensure advertising opportunities were not simply moved to different channels following partial bans. For example, Moodie et al documented an increase in pack-based marketing, including price-related offers on the pack, following the passage of the British Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act which eliminated many other forms of marketing. In addition to moving into new marketing venues, authors cautioned that the tobacco industry would maximise marketing where restrictions are non-existent, work to weaken any marketing regulation that is introduced and use cross-border advertising to their advantage.

### Price promotions on healthier compared with less healthy foods: a hierarchical regression analysis of the impact on sales and social patterning of responses to promotions in great britain [^20270ccc]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

METHODS

Data

We used a secondary data source, the Kantar WorldPanel survey, which includes purchase records of 26,986 households in the United Kingdom throughout 2010. Households were recruited by a data company (Kantar WorldPanel), and the authors were not involved in the data collection. Data-collection procedure was as follows: the United Kingdom Office of National Statistics census information and the United Kingdom Broadcasters' Audience Research Board Establishment survey were used to determine quotas for recruitment. The data company purchased potential participant lists from another company and recruited participants by sending postal mails and e-mails. Recruited participants received vouchers for high-street retailers and/or vouchers for leisure activities [in total for an average monetary equivalent of £100 (∼$160) per household per year]. Recruited households were nationally representative in terms of region, age group, and household size.

The survey includes purchase records of all foods and beverages that were taken home from supermarkets and similar stores in 2010. Sampled households were asked by the data company to record all purchases using barcode scanners and to send digital images of cash-register receipts to the company. The data contain rich information on purchases, including the price at which they were bought, whether they were bought on promotion, the number of packets purchased, and the retail chain from which the product (Stock Keeping Unit) was purchased. The data also include detailed information on product characteristics, including information on the brand, manufacturing company, and nutritional content.

We constructed a cross-sectional data set of 11,323 individual products in 135 food and drink categories, which were purchased by panel households in leading United Kingdom supermarket chains [i.e. the "main parties" as defined by the United Kingdom Competition Commission]. The food and drink categories reflected those used in the retailing sector (Kantar WorldPanel; see Supplemental Table 1 for more information). With the use of transaction records in the data, we calculated the total number of units of each product sold to panel households across the country over 52 wk. In keeping with common practice in the related literature (,–), we restricted the set of products to the more-popular items; in particular, we included only products that were purchased at least once in each of the 52 wk by any of the panel households, irrespective of whether the products were on promotion or not.

### Follow the money: a closer look at US tobacco industry marketing expenditures [^9afdf3f5]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

A parallel literature focuses primarily on cigarette price promotions. Industry documents and studieshave identified five types of price discounting practices: (1) couponing, whereby a consumer is provided a voucher that may be used to directly reduce the price of a tobacco product, (2) free samples, (3) quantity discounts (eg, lower prices per pack when more than one pack is purchased), (4) reducing the price of brands used by more price-sensitive consumers (such as youth and those of low socioeconomic status (SES)), and (5) geographically targeting price-sensitive, less mobile customers in particular areas (eg, poorer neighbourhoods or near schools). A recent study found that, between 2011 and 2016, 11.3% of cigarettes, 3.4% of large cigars, 4.1% of little cigars and 3.9% of cigarillo sales were price discounted. Among the top-selling cigarette brands, 9% of Marlboro (46% market share), 10% of Newport (11% market share) and 36% of Camel (9% market share) were discounted. In a 2012 representative sample of US tobacco retailers, 75.1% advertised price promotions on tobacco products, and among the two major brands purchased, 31.7% of Marlboro and 14.7% of Newport packs included promotional offers. In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned free samples and some states and localities restrict coupon redemption and/or establish minimum prices in an effort to minimise price reduction strategies.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^aeb815d1]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

The case for collaboration

Achieving fair pricing of medicines is particularly important for medicines that are only available from a single source (a monopoly). Price negotiations can deliver mixed results where negotiations are based on discounts from a "list price" ceiling set by the seller, rather than a negotiating floor that reflects the cost of production.

No single strategy or policy can lead to a fair price for medicines. Each policy has its benefits and drawbacks, and thus it is important that it is not used in isolation. For buyers a robust strategy would make use of elements of each policy and be adapted to country characteristics.

In the absence of transparent data, buyers need to maximise their market power (monopsony power) to rival the monopoly they are confronting, otherwise an imbalance in market forces can lead to market failure. By imposing some of the strategies outlined above, payers have asserted their buying power and come closer to achieving a fair price.

Buyers seeking fairer prices benefit from both transparency and collaboration, but this requires strong commitment from decision makers. International commitment is emerging, with a recent World Health Assembly resolution on improving the transparency of markets. Ultimately, a successful strategy to achieve fair pricing necessitates cooperation, both among buyers and among other stakeholders.

Key messages

Achieving fair pricing of medicines is particularly acute for single source medicines — that is, medicines lacking an alternative with a similar indication (monopoly)
Price negotiations deliver mixed results, particularly when anchored by discounts from a "list price" ceiling set by the seller, with no transparency about the true costs of development and production that could anchor a negotiating floor
In the absence of transparent data, the closest that buyers can get to fairer pricing is to impose regulations and policies that attempt to assert their buying power
Ultimately, a successful strategy to achieve fair pricing necessitates cooperation, both among buyers and among other stakeholders

### Sodium in store and restaurant food environments-Guam, 2015 [^c7f00f96]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Compared with the United States overall, Guam has higher mortality rates from cardiovascular disease and stroke (1). Excess sodium intake can increase blood pressure and risk for cardiovascular disease (2,3). To determine the availability and promotion of lower-sodium options in the nutrition environment, the Guam Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) conducted an assessment in September 2015 using previously validated tools adapted to include sodium measures. Stores (N = 114) and restaurants (N = 63) were randomly sampled by region (north, central, and south). Data from 100 stores and 62 restaurants were analyzed and weighted to account for the sampling design. Across the nine product types assessed, lower-sodium products were offered less frequently than regular-sodium products (p < 0.001) with < 50% of stores offering lower-sodium canned vegetables, tuna, salad dressing, soy sauce, and hot dogs. Lower-sodium products were also less frequently offered in small stores than large (two or more cash registers) stores. Reduced-sodium soy sauce cost more than regular soy sauce (p < 0.001) in stores offering both options in the same size bottle. Few restaurants engaged in promotion practices such as posting sodium information (3%) or identifying lower-sodium entrées (1%). Improving the availability and promotion of lower-sodium foods in stores and restaurants could help support healthier eating in Guam.

### Public health emergency archetypes: a framework to guide efforts to ensure equitable access to medical countermeasures [^83b72ca9]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

We highlight some conclusions from this analysis:

For pathogens that cause rare and historically small outbreaks, creating competitive commercial markets for MCMs is not a realistic goal. Instead, we should use grant or other forms of push funding to bring at least one product through to regulatory approval and to fund production for a small stockpile. Where these products have been shown to be safe in humans, creation and maintenance of a ready reserve of investigational drugs or vaccines is critical both to allowing rapid launch of efficacy trials when an outbreak begins and, where appropriate, use in controlling the outbreak under relevant protocols.
For pathogens such as cholera causing more frequent and larger outbreaks, our main recommendation is that stockpiles, which in some cases already exist, should be restructured so that they serve to smooth and solidify demand as well as their current purpose of ensuring rapid availability. This might entail making the stockpiles larger, with a commitment to regular replenishment. This should help make these markets more commercially sustainable.
For true pandemics, the international community should build — and be willing to pay for — the capacity to use a wide range of tools to secure supply, including (1) APAs, (2) expertise, funding and incentives for technology transfer to rapidly expand supply, (3) strengthened regional manufacturing capacity and (4) infrastructure for managing donations, should they materialise. The relative importance of different approaches to supply will depend on characteristics of future pandemics that cannot be predicted in advance, including R&D success rates.
Broadening the arsenal of supply levers, especially for future pandemics, requires preparedness investments now, including in capacity of regional suppliers and in technology transfer, without which we will find ourselves again with limited options.
For all potential outbreak pathogens for which adequate MCMs are not available, public investment in R&D is essential, not only to develop and advance product candidates but also to facilitate clinical trials, develop expedited regulatory pathways, and to support simplified and more transferable manufacturing processes. Attaching appropriate conditions to these public investments can help to ensure equitable access to resulting products.
Investment by international agencies in R&D during pandemics should focus on rapid response and on specific gaps, as any such investment will likely be dwarfed by spending by the USA and other HICs once they engage.
Rapid access to funding for MCM purchase may be important in pandemics, where LMICs are in competition with HICs for limited supply. For small and rare outbreaks, however, financing may not be the binding constraint if no product is ready for use, as the recent outbreak of Sudan Ebola demonstrated.
Dose donations are only useful in limited circumstances, especially pandemics, where HIC buying drives commercial supply and may create excess supply. Donations cannot be relied on and can also impede development and use of products more suited to LMICs needs.

### Brand placement on price boards after tobacco display bans: a point-of-sale audit in melbourne, Australia [^22f52dce]. Tobacco Control (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aims to explore how cigarette brands are arranged on boards listing tobacco products and/or prices following the 1 January 2011 ban on point-of-sale tobacco displays in Victoria, Australia.

Methods

An audit undertaken in late 2011 gathered information on the prevalence and contents of tobacco product information displays ('price boards'). We examined how often all or most of the brands listed at the top of price boards were owned by the same tobacco company, and whether premium, mainstream and value brands were listed in prominent positions more frequently in different store types and socio-economic areas (SES).

Results

Of the 281 stores audited, 64% (179) had legible price boards. Of the 178 with factory-made products, 11% arranged brands alphabetically, 2% by price and 87% did so in some other way. In 65% of stores where brands were arranged in some other way, at least three of the top four positions were devoted to brands owned by the same tobacco company. Premium brands were given greater prominence than would be expected by market share. Neighbourhood SES was significantly related to the representation in the most prominent price board positions of brands from the most appropriate market segment.

Conclusions

Price boards are being used to target brands to consumers. Jurisdictions should also prohibit price board display when they ban tobacco product display; prices might instead be itemised in alphabetical order on a list only viewable upon customer request.

### Placement and promotion strategies to increase sales of healthier products in supermarkets in low-income, ethnically diverse neighborhoods: a randomized controlled trial [^a30b5601]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The greater presence of supermarkets in low-income, high-minority neighborhoods has the potential to positively affect diet quality among those at greatest risk of obesity. In-store marketing strategies that draw attention to healthier products may be effective, sustainable, and scalable for improving diet quality and health. Few controlled studies of in-store marketing strategies to promote sales of healthier items in low-income, high-minority neighborhoods have been conducted.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of in-store marketing strategies to promote the purchase of specific healthier items in 5 product categories: milk, ready-to-eat cereal, frozen meals, in-aisle beverages, and checkout cooler beverages.

Design

The design was a cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted from 2011 to 2012. Eight urban supermarkets in low-income, high-minority neighborhoods were the unit of randomization, intervention, and analysis. Stores were matched on the percentage of sales from government food-assistance programs and store size and randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The 4 intervention stores received a 6-mo, in-store marketing intervention that promoted the sales of healthier products through placement, signage, and product availability strategies. The 4 control stores received no intervention and were assessment-only controls. The main outcome measure was weekly sales of the targeted products, which was assessed on the basis of the stores' sales data.

Results

Intervention stores showed significantly greater sales of skim and 1% milk, water (in aisle and at checkout), and 2 of 3 types of frozen meals compared with control store sales during the same time period. No differences were found between the stores in sales of cereal, whole or 2% milk, beverages, or diet beverages.

Conclusions

These data indicate that straightforward placement strategies can significantly enhance the sales of healthier items in several food and beverage categories. Such strategies show promise for significant public health effects in communities with the greatest risk of obesity.

### Committee opinion no. 709: commercial enterprises in medical practice [^7a3c3f69]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Nonmedical goods and services — obstetrician–gynecologists should not sell or promote agents or devices as being therapeutic without an adequate evidence base for medical benefit, and should not use their professional influence or clinical environment to sell or promote nonmedical products or services or to enroll participants into multilevel marketing schemes; such practices may compromise public trust in physicians' clinical advice and it is manipulative for physicians to exploit patients' trust to leverage personal financial gain.

### Retailer participation in cigarette company incentive programs is related to increased levels of cigarette advertising and cheaper cigarette prices in stores [^a653b5e4]. Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

The retail outlet is the cigarette companies' major marketing channel to reach present and future customers. Of the $11.2 billion spent by them to market their products in 2001, approximately 85% was spent on retailer and consumer incentives to stimulate sales. This study examines the extent of retailer participation in these incentive programs, and the relationship between participation and the amount and placement of cigarette marketing materials and products, and prices in stores.

Methods

Observational assessments of cigarette marketing materials, products, and prices were conducted in 468 stores in 15 U.S. states. Telephone interviews were conducted with store owners or managers of these stores to determine the details of their participation in incentive programs.

Results

Cigarette companies engaged 65% of retailers in an incentive program. Nearly 80% of participating retailers reported cigarette company control over placement of marketing materials in their stores. Stores that reported receiving over $3,000 from incentive programs in the past 3 months averaged 19.5 cigarette marketing materials, and stores receiving no money averaged only 8.2 marketing materials. In multivariate analyses, participation in incentive programs offered by Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds was positively related to the number of cigarette marketing materials for each of these companies' brands in stores and the placement of their cigarettes on the top shelf. The price of Newports was significantly lower in stores that received incentives; no price difference was found for Marlboro.

Conclusions

Stores that participate in cigarette company incentive programs feature more prominent placement of cigarettes and advertising, and may have cheaper cigarette prices.

### Variation in cannabis potency and prices in a newly legal market: evidence from 30 million cannabis sales in Washington state [^10157bdb]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

To (1) assess trends and variation in the market share of product types and potency sold in a legal cannabis retail market and (2) estimate how potency and purchase quantity influence price variation for cannabis flower.

Design

Secondary analysis of publicly available data from Washington State's cannabis traceability system spanning 7 July 2014 to 30 September 2016. Descriptive statistics and linear regressions assessed variation and trends in cannabis product variety and potency. Hedonic regressions estimated how purchase quantity and potency influence cannabis flower price variation.

Setting

Washington State, USA.

Participants

(1) A total of 44482176 million cannabis purchases, including (2) 31052123 cannabis flower purchases after trimming price and quantity outliers.

Measurements

Primary outcome measures were (1) monthly expenditures on cannabis, total delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration and cannabidiol (CBD) concentration by product type and (2) excise tax-inclusive price per gram of cannabis flower. Key covariates for the hedonic price regressions included quantity purchased, THC and CBD.

Findings

Traditional cannabis flowers still account for the majority of spending (66.6%), but the market share of extracts for inhalation increased by 145.8% between October 2014 and September 2016, now comprising 21.2% of sales. The average THC-level for cannabis extracts is more than triple that for cannabis flowers (68.7% compared to 20.6%). For flower products, there is a statistically significant relationship between price per gram and both THC [coefficient = 0.012; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.011–0.013] and CBD (coefficient = 0.017; CI = 0.015–0.019). The estimated discount elasticity is -0.06 (CI = -0.07 to -0.05).

Conclusions

In the state of Washington, USA, the legal cannabis market is currently dominated by high-THC cannabis flower, and features growing expenditures on extracts. For cannabis flower, both THC and CBD are associated with higher per-gram prices, and there are small but significant quantity discounts.

### Improving the affordability of prescription medications for people with chronic respiratory disease. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^fb21208c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 1 — U.S. pharmaceutical policy governance — The U.S. government should establish and financially support a politically independent, impartial expert advisory committee tasked with making evidence-based recommendations on pharmaceutical policy, with an overarching goal to ensure affordable access to life-preserving medications while retaining consumer choice, promoting future innovation, and respecting our market-based economy. The rationale cites that, without a single entity to coordinate and/or regulate the activities of the various parties in the pharmaceutical supply chain, broad adoption of evidence-based policies has fallen behind, patients are unduly burdened by high treatment costs and experience greater morbidity due to cost-related nonadherence, and although numerous policy proposals exist, lacking any clear agenda these recommendations have been largely ignored; the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine recently recommended numerous targeted, evidence-based reforms based on the best available evidence to address inefficiencies in the pharmaceutical supply chain.

### Excise taxes and pricing activities of e-liquid products sold in online vape shops [^a844039f]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, we checked tax compliance based on a single e-liquid product for each store in our sample, which is not comprehensive. We are currently developing new tools to scrape excise tax data for all e-liquid products in each online store and will reassess tax compliance in future analyses. Second, we used a convenience sampling strategy and chose online stores based on simple Google and Reddit search results, which may be subject to curation based on viewer locations, browsing histories and Google advertising. Nonetheless, we did not intend to collect representative samples of online stores.

Furthermore, to address the data quality issues, we cross-verified stores from Google and Reddit searches, and one store (store 2) appeared in both searches, suggesting a consensus on store popularity. In addition, the number of e-liquid products sold in each store was quite large, and the five stores together cover 241 unique brands, which provides some assurance that our sampling covered a significant proportion of products. We also find that the e-liquid price distribution was similar across the five stores, further indicating that the price data we scraped reflect the common pricing strategies in the online market.

Lastly, we scraped e-liquid prices from each online store on a rather arbitrary date and did not track e-liquid pricing activities over time. However, with continuing effort, in future studies we will be able to track prices, check consistency over time, plot the time trend of e-liquid pricing, and assess how taxes are passed to prices as the rates and structures change.

Despite the limitations, our study is the first in-depth investigation of the pricing and taxing strategies of e-liquid products sold online. The evidence suggests that online e-liquid products are sold at a relatively low price, and that tax compliance is inconsistent and low. The choice of e-cigarette tax bases such as existing state-level taxes based on wholesale prices may leave room for retailers and wholesalers to manipulate tax levels. Policy innovations and compliance checks may be needed to regulate products sold online. In addition, future studies will benefit from rapid surveillance of the characteristics and sales of e-cigarette products sold online.

### Productive ecosystems and the arrow of development [^98cbfc43]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Economic growth is associated with the diversification of economic activities, which can be observed via the evolution of product export baskets. Exporting a new product is dependent on having, and acquiring, a specific set of capabilities, making the diversification process path-dependent. Taking an agnostic view on the identity of the capabilities, here we derive a probabilistic model for the directed dynamical process of capability accumulation and product diversification of countries. Using international trade data, we identify the set of pre-existing products, the product Ecosystem, that enables a product to be exported competitively. We construct a directed network of products, the Eco Space, where the edge weight corresponds to capability overlap. We uncover a modular structure, and show that low- and middle-income countries move from product communities dominated by small Ecosystem products to advanced (large Ecosystem) product clusters over time. Finally, we show that our network model is predictive of product appearances.

### Features of disposable e-cigarettes and their association with pricing and consumer preference: evidence from web data of US online stores [^fa21c27c]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

MEASURES

Outcome measures

There are two sets of outcome variables: prices and consumer ratings. For prices, there are two different standardized measures: a) price per ml: sales price divided by volume, in the unit of US cents per milliliter (ml); b) price per puff: sales price divided by total number of puffs, in the unit of US cents per puff.

The outcome measures of consumer rating are: a) total number of reviews for each product (zero or positive); and b) conditional on receiving positive reviews, the average consumer ratings ranging from one (lowest) to five (highest) stars.

Product features ‐ (explanatory variables)

We coded attributes that may have relationships with product costs and consumer preferences, including volume sizes, battery capacity, and nicotine features (concentration, claims of nicotine salt, claims of synthetic nicotine). For volume sizes, we generated two continuous measures a) product volume in ml; and b) number of puffs in hundreds. Both puffs and mls have been reported to measure product volumes. For product battery capacity, we generated categorical variables due to the wide range and clustering in values. Specially, there are five categories: ≤ 500 mAh, > 500 to < 1000 mAh, exactly 1000 mAh, > 1000 mAh, and missing. The cutoffs were chosen based on the distribution of battery capacity (see Appendix).

There are three nicotine features: concentration, claims of nicotine salt, and claims of synthetic nicotine. Given that a majority (94%) of disposables have a concentration level of 50 mg/ml, we categorized concentration into three groups: < 50 mg/ml, exactly 50 mg/ml, and > 50 mg/ml. For claims, we used a binary indicator for whether a product is explicitly marketed as containing nicotine salt in store description and an indicator for whether a product is explicitly marketed as containing "synthetic" or "tobacco‐free" nicotine.

The primary flavor of each disposable product is categorized into the following: fruit, tobacco, sweet, menthol, alcohol, non‐alcoholic beverage, nuts/spice, concept flavor (i.e. concept fruit, concept menthol or concept tobacco), or missing. Flavor categories were grouped using published e‐cigarette flavor wheel with additional updates to identify concept flavors. The details of flavor taxonomy and grouping logics are presented in the Appendix.

### CBD retailers in NC promote CBD online to treat pain violating FDA rules about medical claims and offer low-CBD / high-price products [^db51cdb3]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cannabidiol (CBD) products are available nearly nationwide in the US and can coexist with medical or recreational programs. North Carolina (NC) is an example of a state with a program dedicated to integrating hemp cultivation and medicinal CBD exclusively, containing a multitude of retailers selling it as a primary product. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates that non-FDA approved CBD products cannot be marketed using medical or health-related claims and has sent warning letters to retailers violating these terms. We aim to characterize the online content of the NC CBD market by analyzing retailers' websites to determine whether hemp/CBD shops comply with FDA regulations in terms of medical claims and analyze the claimed CBD content and price of products offered online.

Methods

We randomly selected three CBD retailers from the ten most populated cities of NC. We analyzed their website content: product type, medical claims, other disclaimers, price, and CBD content.

Results

We found that edible, oral, inhalable, and topical products are offered in similar proportions. Word analysis of product description revealed that "pain" and "pain relief" were the most common medical claim, followed by inflammation and anxiety. Health claims were mostly related to wellbeing. Other attributes indicate that products are associated with pleasant flavors or sensations (ie, cool, lavender, delicious, honey, menthol), which resembles the strategies used for tobacco advertisement. Most products (61%) claimed to contain less than 1000 mg of CBD. The median price of products ranged from $15–30 per 300 mg. We found a positive correlation between CBD content and price.

Discussion

Our data demonstrate that the NC online CBD market does not comply with FDA regulations, primarily targets patients with pain, inflammation, or anxiety, and offers products with low CBD concentration and high prices. New policies should limit the access and online promotion of non-pharmaceutical grade CBD products.

### Improving the nutritional resource environment for healthy living through community-based participatory research [^69fdc0ef]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To build health promotion capacity among community residents through a community-based participatory model, and to apply this model to study the nutritional environment of an urban area to better understand the role of such resources in residents' efforts to live a healthy life.

Design

A multiphase collaborative study that inventoried selected markets in targeted areas of high African-American concentration in comparison with markets in a contrasting wealthier area with fewer African Americans.

Setting

A community study set in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

Participants

African-American community organizations and community residents in the target areas.

Interventions

Two surveys of market inventories were conducted. The first was a single-sheet form profiling store conditions and the availability of a small selection of healthy foods. The second provided detailed information on whether the store offered fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, dried goods and other items necessary for residents to consume a nutritious diet.

Results

The targeted areas were significantly less likely to have important items for living a healthier life. The variety and quality of fresh fruit and vegetable produce was significantly lower in the target areas. Such products as 1% milk, skim milk, low-fat and nonfat cheese, soy milk, tofu, whole grain pasta and breads, and low-fat meat and poultry items were significantly less available.

Conclusions

Healthy food products were significantly less available in the target areas. The authors conclude from these results that the health disparities experienced by African-American communities have origins that extend beyond the health delivery system and individual behaviors inasmuch as adherence to the healthy lifestyle associated with low chronic disease risk is more difficult in resource-poor neighborhoods than in resource-rich ones.

### Marijuana as a' concept' flavour for cigar products: availability and price near California schools [^257c130d]. Tobacco Control (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the retail availability of cigar products that refer to marijuana and the largest package size of cigarillos available for ≤ $1.

Methods

Trained data collectors conducted marketing surveillance in a random sample of licensed tobacco retailers that sold little cigars/cigarillos (LCCs) (n = 530) near a statewide sample of middle and high schools (n = 132) in California. Multilevel models examined the presence of marijuana co-marketing and cigarillo pack size as a function of school/neighbourhood characteristics and adjusted for store type.

Results

Of stores that sold LCCs, approximately 62% contained at least one form of marijuana co-marketing: 53.2% sold cigar wraps marketed as blunt wraps, 27.2% sold cigarillos marketed as blunts and 26.0% sold at least one LCC with a marijuana-related 'concept' flavour. Controlling for store type, marijuana co-marketing was more prevalent in school neighbourhoods with a higher proportion of young residents (ages 5–17 years) and with lower median household income. Nearly all stores that sold LCCs (87.9%) offered the products for ≤ $1. However, significantly larger packs at similarly low prices were available near schools in lower-income neighbourhoods and with a lower percentage of Hispanic students.

Conclusions

Understanding how the tobacco industry manipulates cigar products and marketing to capitalise on the appeal of marijuana to youth and other priority populations is important to inform regulation, particularly for flavoured tobacco products. In addition, the retail availability of five and six packs of LCCs for ≤ $1 near California schools underscores policy recommendations to establish minimum prices for multipacks.

### Using point-of-sale data to examine tobacco pricing across neighbourhoods in scotland [^f8edc0b4]. Tobacco Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Tobacco price data describing purchases of tobacco products from a group of convenience stores across Scotland were provided by The Retail Data Partnership (TRDP). In the UK, convenience stores are smaller stores selling a variety of grocery items, including tobacco products. These stores are the most common type of tobacco retail outlets in Scotland, accounting for 37.5% of the total 9042 tobacco outlets registered in 2016 and 55%–60% of total tobacco sales.TRDP supply an electronic point-of-sale until to 275 convenience stores in Scotland, capturing information on every item purchased within these outlets. TRDP provided a data extract on all products in 'tobacco baskets' (ie, baskets containing one or more tobacco, smoking accessory or e-cigarette vaping products) purchased over a 7 day period (16–22 April 2018). One store with very low sales (< 50 products in tobacco baskets in the study week) was excluded, leaving 274 shops in the analysis.

The focus of this research was on the prices of factory made packets of 20 cigarettes and 30 g of roll your own (RYO) tobacco. Each brand was allocated into a price segment category based on a combination of the categorisation used by Hiscock et al, recent wholesaler recommended sales price (RSP) and sales prices. For cigarettes, these categories were subvalue, value, midprice and premium. For roll-your-own (RYO) cigarettes, the categories were value, midprice and premium, later combined to value and midprice/premium due to a lack of distinction between sales prices within the latter two categories. For cigarette and RYO 30 g brand variants, 4.3% and 16.7% of brands respectively, were not classified within a price segment because information from Hiscock et al, wholesaler RSP and shop prices was absent or inconsistent. In our sample, they accounted for very low sales, 0.0005% of total cigarette 20 pack sales and 0.205% of total RYO 30 g pack sales.

### The availability and cost of healthier food alternatives [^43e13e45]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Many people, especially low-income consumers, do not successfully follow dietary recommendations to eat more whole grains and less fat and added sugar. The food environment may have a significant impact on the choice by low-income consumers to eat healthier foods, as both the availability and price of healthier food items may limit their ability to eat a healthier diet. We investigated the cost and availability of a standard market basket of foods, and a healthier basket that included low-fat meat and dairy and whole grain products.

Methods

Market-basket surveys were conducted in 25 stores in Los Angeles and Sacramento. Stores were selected from neighborhoods that were varied by income and surveyed three times from September 2003 to June 2004. The average cost of a standard market basket (based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Thrifty Food Plan [TFP]) and a healthier market basket was calculated from these prices and compared using a standard t-test to determine if they were significantly different from each other. The analysis was conducted in 2005.

Results

In neighborhoods served by smaller grocery stores, access to whole-grain products, low-fat cheeses, and ground meat with < 10% fat is limited. Among all items that were unavailable, 64% were in small grocery stores. For the 2-week shopping list, the average TFP market-basket cost was $194, and the healthier market-basket cost was $230. The average cost of the healthier market basket was more expensive by $36 due to higher costs of whole grains, lean ground beef, and skinless poultry. The higher cost of the healthier basket is equal to about 35% to 40% of low-income consumers' food budgets of $2410 a year.

Conclusions

The lack of availability in small grocery stores located in low-income neighborhoods, and the higher cost of the healthier market basket may be a deterrent to eating healthier among very low-income consumers. Public policies should take the food environment into account in order to develop successful strategies to encourage the consumption of healthier foods.

### Laboratory business models and practices: implications for availability and access to germline genetic testing [^7c397992]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Business practices

Topics identified regarding laboratory business practices are shown in Table 2. Providing high quality services was a theme for all three types of laboratories. The provider-focused practice of offering assistance with the prior authorization process was mentioned by all laboratory types but to varying degrees. PGLs typically take on the entire prior authorization process. Low- and no-cost pricing, consumer/patient-focused strategies (e.g. free laboratory-based genetic counseling), marketing and communication characterize the business practices of PGLs. One PGL key informant commented about the websites of PGLs, "Because they're driven by the need for engagement, and to delight the consumer, their interface is very playful".

Table 2
Laboratory business practice characteristics.

a Meets payers' criteria for genetic testing enabling the laboratory to avoid prior authorization requirements with possible auditing by the payer periodically.

b Only one PGL key informant mentioned premium pricing.

c Low-cost with cash/self-pay, no-cost options for research testing or hardship cases, or no cost for cascade testing in family members.

d Examples: sales team differentiates products from competitors; marketing to nongenetics providers; payers market division for contracting.

e Examples: media/news releases; communicating with technology assessment groups; communicating with payers about their coverage policies.

### The Australian cigarette brand as product, person, and symbol [^afc59784]. Tobacco Control (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine, for dominant Australian cigarette brands, brand identity (overriding brand vision), brand positioning (brand identity elements communicated to the consumer), brand image (consumers' brand perceptions) and brand equity (financial value).

Design

Tobacco industry documents, articles from retail trade publications since 1990, and current brand advertising from retail trade publications were searched for information about Australian brands.

Results

Cigarette manufacturers benefit from their competitors' brand equity as well as their own. The industry sees Australian smokers as far less brand loyal and strongly oriented to "low tar". A few predominantly local brands dominate the market, with variation by state. Successful Australian brands exist in one of three categories: premium, mainstream, and supervalue. Their brand identity essence is as follows. Premium: quality. Mainstream: a good humoured "fair go" for ordinary Australians. Supervalue: value for money. All supervalue brand identities also include freedom, escape, mildness, an aspirational attitude, blue tones, and waterside scenes. Brand image and brand identity is frequently congruent, even when marketing is restricted, and brand image is generally more positive for a smoker's own brand.

Conclusions

Tobacco control activities have undermined cigarette brand equity. Further research is needed regarding brand loyalty, low tar, and brand categories. Smokers may respond more positively to tobacco control messages consistent with the identities of their chosen brand, and brand-as-organisation elements may assist. Further marketing restrictions should consider all elements of brand identity, and aim to undermine brand categories.

### An analysis of purchase price of legal and illicit cigarettes in urban retail environments in 14 low-and middle-income countries [^2ef6a296]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Strengths of the present study include the use of a common protocol throughout many countries and data from a broad sample of packs. Further, prices were obtained by actual purchase of cigarette packs from retailers and do not rely upon consumers' self‐report of how much they paid for their cigarettes which introduces recall bias and potential rounding of numbers. Retailers were instructed explicitly not to pass on any bulk discounts, coupons or other price promotions which were not offered to the regular consumer; this served to ensure that retail conditions were standard across packs and countries.

Results from this study focus upon the range of illicit cigarette prices, reporting on both premium brands as well as low‐priced products. Studies conducted in Europe have used extremely low prices to identify packs as illicit 17 Our study suggests that this criterion may not be valid for use in LMICs where illicit cigarettes are often sold at higher prices than legal cigarettes.

There are a number of potential reasons for our finding that in many countries examined, the average purchase price of illicit cigarettes was higher than legal cigarettes. In countries where a limited number of domestically manufactured brands are sold, smokers may be willing to pay a premium for foreign brands if they are deemed to be higher quality or are viewed as aspirational although this was not directly verifiable in our data. It is also possible that different brands of illicit cigarettes, i.e. cheap brands versus international brands, target different market segments. Additional explanations advanced in the literature but not directly verifiable with our data include differences in level of enforcement, the presence of organized crime 6 and tobacco industry involvement in smuggling operations as a way to penetrate new markets and reduce their tax liability 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. The exception that we found in cities where the price difference was the opposite sign relative to the difference in median prices found in corresponding countries may be due to their proximity to country borders and a tax‐free zone.

Our finding in six countries that illicit cigarette packs cost more than legal packs, at the median, should not be interpreted as a reason to maintain illicit tobacco in a market. In many of these countries, tobacco taxes are very low 36 and this results in extremely low prices for legal cigarettes. Tobacco taxes need to be increased in these countries while at the same time implementing the strategies outlined in the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control's Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products.

### Forest management in Southern China generates short term extensive carbon sequestration [^88e4a856]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

While the increase in C stocks over the period studied is significant, in absolute terms as well as relative to the CO 2 emissions of the eight provinces, it is evident that further enhancement of this sink in the future is unlikely. The sloping lands that offer the best opportunity for new forest plantations replacing low productivity croplands are now to a great extent already converted and further increase in C storage will require improved management of currently planted areas to reach a higher C density. Whether this may be seen as a viable option for the region is determined by a range of biophysical, economic and political factors. Further conversions from low to high C density forest types are unlikely, unless economic incentives (e.g. in the form of compensation payments, high market prices, or 'Payments for Environmental Services') are provided. Thus, future sustainable development will notably depend on the extent to which management strategies and economic factors will be able to combine substantial and increasing C stocks with a favourable economic output. This requires a more refined analysis including different rotation cycles, plantation types (that is species and harvest purpose) and price/demand scenarios.

Although our study found a large increase in C sequestration of which about half was caused by newly planted and managed forests, our numbers also show that storing fossil CO 2 emissions from forest plantations alone is not a viable strategy for mitigating anthropogenic carbon emissions, due to the sheer amount of land areas needed. It should be kept in mind, however, that a substantial part of the industrial CO 2 emissions in southern China are caused by the production of goods that are not consumed in this area, but are likely nationally and globally traded. Additionally, large-scale forestation programmes can have an adverse impact on the ecosystem by decreasing SM and thus water availability for local organisms, showing that carbon sequestration and economic benefits should not be the only aspects considered when debating the sustainability of land and forest management.

### Evaluation of a national supermarket intervention supporting vulnerable families in healthy meal practices: a natural experiment [^05d48758]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the study's strengths, some limitations should be mentioned. First, food consumption itself is not captured by purchasing data, but it seems to be a good indicator of overall diet quality. Also, analyzing food purchase data does have advantages too. It is a more objective measure and thus not affected by socially desirable answers, nor by participants' memories. Second, including a control group in the present study was not possible due to the lack of information on sociodemographic data of the participants and customers. Hence, it was not possible to match the intervention group with a control group of customers (i.e. customers who were not subscribed to the intervention). Still, as written in the Study design, control mechanisms have been applied: Different entry points in the intervention ensure a sort of control for external variables, and using a time variable and proportions as outcome measures control for seasonality and inflation. For example, Gallup and Cookpad's study found an increase in home-cooking in Belgium during the COVID-19 crisis, which may have influenced the study's effects. However, it remains unclear whether the observed effect was due to this external factor, or may have been along the lines of the intervention's impact. A third limitation might be that the outcome measures were based on money spent, and not on the exact weights of products bought. This was because we could not receive the accurate weights from the retailer. Even though the weights of the products bought would have given more detailed information on the outcomes, the original price of the products as outcome measure also gave an indication of the intervention effects. Finally, the family size was unclear, so the outcomes represented purchasing behavior of a whole family and not necessarily of one member of the family. We corrected for this by measuring the outcome in proportion to the total budget.

### Cigarette brand diversity and price changes during the implementation of plain packaging in the United Kingdom [^a797a4a9]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Design

We used Nielsen Scantrack cigarette sales data from March 2013 to June 2017 to analyse product diversification, volume of cigarette sales and pricing descriptively, and a regression model to estimate the association between plain packaging and cigarette prices.

Data

Nielsen Scantrack cigarette sales data include monthly volume of sales, value of sales, units sold and average retail price for products scanned from more than 75 000 megastores, superstores, high street stores and convenience stores in the United Kingdom. The total volume of sales by year obtained in Nielsen Scantrack data represents approximately 76% of government figures on annual cigarette consumption in the United Kingdom 17.

Measures

Cigarette products

We defined cigarette products as unique combinations of the following characteristics:
Brand (for example: Allure, Berkeley or Benson & Hedges)
Brand variant (for example: slim, king size, silver, gold, menthol, capsule)
Pack size (the number of cigarettes per pack)
Multi‐pack size (the number of packs sold together in a multi‐pack)

Thus, for example, one product would be a single pack of 20 Marlboro Gold King Size cigarettes; another might be a multi‐pack of five packs of 19 John Player Special Blue Superkings cigarettes. Product diversification was defined by the number of brands, brand variants and products (combination of brand, brand variants, pack size and multi‐pack size) available each month during the study period.

Price

Monthly average retail prices were computed by Nielsen, by dividing the value of sales by the number of units sold using total coverage (all store types) data for each product. Prices of products sold in branded packs were defined as either standard or promotional, the latter applying if the retail price was reduced by 5% or more from the second highest price for the same product observed in the preceding 6 weeks. From July 2016 a separate price category was introduced for products sold in plain packs.

Two price outcomes were defined for the regression analysis: the average retail price per cigarette, which included all available products in all pack sizes, and the average retail price for products sold in 20‐cigarette packs, which were the most common and the only legal pack size available after plain packaging implementation.

### Counseling customers: emerging roles for genetic counselors in the direct-to-consumer genetic testing market [^5d0e40d2]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2013). Low credibility.

Individuals now have access to an increasing number of internet resources offering personal genomics services. As the direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC GT) industry expands, critics have called for pre- and post-test genetic counseling to be included with the product. Several genetic testing companies offer genetic counseling. There has been no examination to date of this service provision, whether it meets critics' concerns and implications it may have for the genetic counseling profession. Considering the increasing relevance of genetics in healthcare, the complexity of genetic information provided by DTC GT, the mediating role of the internet in counseling, and potential conflicts of interest, this is a topic which deserves further attention. In this paper we offer a discourse analysis of ways in which genetic counseling is represented on DTC GT websites, blogs and other online material. This analysis identified four types of genetic counseling represented on the websites: the integrated counseling product; discretionary counseling; independent counseling; and product advice. Genetic counselors are represented as having the following roles: genetics educator; mediator; lifestyle advisor; risk interpreter; and entrepreneur. We conclude that genetic counseling as represented on DTC GT websites demonstrates shifting professional roles and forms of expertise in genetic counseling. Genetic counselors are also playing an important part in how the genetic testing market is taking shape. Our analysis offers important and timely insights into recent developments in the genetic counseling profession, which have relevance for practitioners, researchers and policy makers concerned with the evolving field of personal genomics.

### Comparison of strength and adulteration between illicit drugs obtained from cryptomarkets versus off-line [^f4eaf36f]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

For methamphetamine, no association was found between source and adulteration, despite higher strength when sourced from cryptomarkets. This may be partly attributable to the small overall sample size available for methamphetamine, which restricts the diversity of samples and the ability to detect potential differences between source markets. By contrast, LSD showed similar strength but higher adulteration when sourced from cryptomarkets. Based on the current data, the reason for this discrepancy in adulteration but not strength is unclear.

Limitations

Cryptomarkets, while intertwined with off‐line markets, represent a minority of the broader global drug market. A relevant contextual factor is that a small number of highly successful vendors can account for a large proportion of cryptomarket sales. The samples analysed in the current study probably reflect the practices of these dominant vendors. However, smaller vendors with potentially more variable quality may be under‐represented. Future research could aim to capture greater diversity by sampling smaller vendors to complement the current findings.

Cryptomarkets are increasingly used for larger, wholesale drug transactions, raising questions concerning the interplay between purchase size and product quality on these market‐places. One hypothesis is that higher initial drug quality attracted larger buyers to cryptomarkets. Alternatively, the shift towards wholesale trade may incentivize vendors to maintain quality standards for bulk buyers. While further research is required, this phenomenon highlights the need to examine the potential impact of increased wholesale trade on product quality and vendor practices on these market‐places.

### A theory of power-law distributions in financial market fluctuations [^172c985a]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Insights into the dynamics of a complex system are often gained by focusing on large fluctuations. For the financial system, huge databases now exist that facilitate the analysis of large fluctuations and the characterization of their statistical behaviour. Power laws appear to describe histograms of relevant financial fluctuations, such as fluctuations in stock price, trading volume and the number of trades. Surprisingly, the exponents that characterize these power laws are similar for different types and sizes of markets, for different market trends and even for different countries — suggesting that a generic theoretical basis may underlie these phenomena. Here we propose a model, based on a plausible set of assumptions, which provides an explanation for these empirical power laws. Our model is based on the hypothesis that large movements in stock market activity arise from the trades of large participants. Starting from an empirical characterization of the size distribution of those large market participants (mutual funds), we show that the power laws observed in financial data arise when the trading behaviour is performed in an optimal way. Our model additionally explains certain striking empirical regularities that describe the relationship between large fluctuations in prices, trading volume and the number of trades.

### Nutrition environment measures survey in stores (NEMS-S): development and evaluation [^a471843d]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Eating, or nutrition, environments are believed to contribute to obesity and chronic diseases. There is a need for valid, reliable measures of nutrition environments. This article reports on the development and evaluation of measures of nutrition environments in retail food stores.

Methods

The Nutrition Environment Measures Study developed observational measures of the nutrition environment within retail food stores (NEMS-S) to assess availability of healthy options, price, and quality. After pretesting, measures were completed by independent raters to evaluate inter-rater reliability and across two occasions to assess test-retest reliability in grocery and convenience stores in four neighborhoods differing on income and community design in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Data were collected and analyzed in 2004 and 2005.

Results

Ten food categories (e.g., fruits) or indicator food items (e.g., ground beef) were evaluated in 85 stores. Inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability of availability were high: inter-rater reliability kappas were 0.84 to 1.00, and test-retest reliabilities were .73 to 1.00. Inter-rater reliability for quality across fresh produce was moderate (kappas, 0.44 to 1.00). Healthier options were higher priced for hot dogs, lean ground beef, and baked chips. More healthful options were available in grocery than convenience stores and in stores in higher income neighborhoods.

Conclusions

The NEMS-S tool was found to have a high degree of inter-rater and test-retest reliability, and to reveal significant differences across store types and neighborhoods of high and low socioeconomic status. These observational measures of nutrition environments can be applied in multilevel studies of community nutrition, and can inform new approaches to conducting and evaluating nutrition interventions.

Industry payments and prescribing behavior — health care clinicians represent a target audience for industry marketing efforts, and physicians who receive payments for services rendered to the industry tend to prescribe more brand-name drugs than do their colleagues who do not receive such payments. Health care clinicians have an ethical duty to recognize the situations and marketing strategies that are designed to influence their choice of therapeutic options for their patients, and at a minimum, health care clinicians should be aware of the methods used to attempt to affect their behavior and develop strategies to address them.

### Using artificial intelligence and computer vision to detect and monitor unhealthy child-directed food and beverage marketing: a data-driven study [^391f325b]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the annotated dataset food and beverage products in this study, while substantial and targeted toward child-relevant categories, does not encompass the full food supply and may not fully capture the diversity of packaging designs or marketing strategies across all product categories. As such, interpreting results beyond the selected product categories or to other food environments (e.g. restaurants, convenience stores) should proceed with caution. Second, while the machine learning models achieved high performance overall, the classification of more abstract or subtle marketing features, such as fun fonts or colorful shapes, remains challenging due to their variability, subjectivity, and lower frequency in the training data. Moreover, misclassifications between visually similar categories suggest that distinguishing complex and nuanced design elements remains a key challenge for the model. Third, although this study focused on static packaging images, children are increasingly exposed to marketing across digital and dynamic media, including video advertisements and in-app content, which may require different detection strategies and model architectures. Fourth, the use of data from 2017 to 2020 may not reflect the most current marketing practices, especially post-pandemic; although the methods can be applied to future datasets, real-time implementation would benefit from continual updates and retraining. Finally, the association analyses were cross-sectional and observational in nature, limiting causal inference about relationships between marketing, nutrition quality, and price. Future work should explore longitudinal data and integrate behavioral measures to strengthen causal claims.

The development of AI-enhanced food marketing assessment methodologies enables the integration of food marketing data with existing purchasing data and packaged food composition data (e.g. nutrition information, price, etc.), offering insights into how child-directed food marketing influences affordability, dietary quality, and health inequities. For example, unhealthy child-directed food products may disproportionately impact children in low-income households, exacerbating disparities in dietary patterns and childhood obesity. This AI automated approach helps evaluate whether policies effectively reduce these disparities and protect children's health. Additionally, this research provides a useful strategy for assessing other related food marketing techniques that influence consumer food choices (e.g. front-of-package labeling, health claims, nutrition symbols), linking these strategies to product healthfulness and overall health and well-being of the population.

### Scientists' warning on affluence [^8bfdbb83]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Super-affluent consumers and growth imperatives

Growth imperatives are active at multiple levels, making the pursuit of economic growth (net investment, i.e. investment above depreciation) a necessity for different actors and leading to social and economic instability in the absence of it. Following a Marxian perspective as put forward by Pirgmaier and Steinberger, growth imperatives can be attributed to capitalism as the currently dominant socio-economic system in affluent countries, although this is debated by other scholars. To structure this topic, we will discuss different affected actors separately, namely corporations, states and individuals, following Richters and Siemoneit. Most importantly, we address the role of the super-affluent consumers within a society, which overlap with powerful fractions of the capitalist class. From a Marxian perspective, this social class is structurally defined by its position in the capitalist production process, as financially tied with the function of capital. In capitalism, workers are separated from the means of production, implying that they must compete in labour markets to sell their labour power to capitalists in order to earn a living.

Even though some small- and medium-sized businesses manage to refrain from pursuing growth, e.g. due to a low competition intensity in niche markets, or lack of financial debt imperatives, this cannot be said for most firms. In capitalism, firms need to compete in the market, leading to a necessity to reinvest profits into more efficient production processes to minimise costs (e.g. through replacing human labour power with machines and positive returns to scale), innovation of new products and/or advertising to convince consumers to buy more. As a result, the average energy intensity of labour is now twice as high as in 1950. As long as a firm has a competitive advantage, there is a strong incentive to sell as much as possible. Financial markets are crucial to enable this constant expansion by providing (interest-bearing) capital and channelling it where it is most profitable. If a firm fails to stay competitive, it either goes bankrupt or is taken over by a more successful business. Under normal economic conditions, this capitalist competition is expected to lead to aggregate growth dynamics.

### Improving the affordability of prescription medications for people with chronic respiratory disease. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^5158b00d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society policy priorities for pharmaceutical policy reform to support affordability and access outline actions across formularies, generics, pricing, value assessment, and research. Key priorities include: expand flexibility of formulary design to mitigate cost burdens to patients; ensure essential respiratory medicines with established clinical benefit are available in Tier 1 formularies; reduce barriers to timely generic drug availability and foster competition; promote expeditious market entry of international providers of generic and novel medicines; establish uniform and meaningful negotiation with producers and suppliers and establish price transparency of financial flows through the pharmaceutical supply chain. Additional priorities include establishing a cost-effectiveness research agenda and action plan with a uniform pharmaceutical value framework; expanding value-based pricing and benefit design, including demonstration projects to test alternative payment models on outcomes and costs; incentivizing development of truly new medicines; ensuring that financial incentives for rare diseases are not extended to widely sold drugs; expanding stock albuterol programs in schools within all 50 states; establishing infrastructure for ongoing examination of patient affordability and availability and access to assistance programs; defining and routinely examining a list of essential medicines; establishing policies to reduce academic detailing, lobbying, direct-to-consumer drug advertising, and anticompetitive deals; comparing expenses and processes of early-stage drug development research between NIH, small industry, and large pharmaceutical manufacturers; and modifying requirements for the award and extension of exclusivity rights.

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^5e2dff2e]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To examine the effect of over-harvesting on the natural resource and on the discount rate, we compare scenarios in which over-harvesting occurs to scenarios in which it does not. We consider two approaches. First, we consider a competitive market approach in which we compare the optimal solution that maximizes social welfare with the solution that emerges in a model of a perfectly competitive market with externalities (Figs. 2 and 3). Specifically, the competitive market includes managed regions that have a single manager (e.g. landowner, government), and shared regions in which multiple managers are free to harvest (e.g. open-access) (see Methods). Second, we consider a more general approach in which we compare the dynamics that emerge when the harvest is entirely sustainable with the dynamics that emerge following various ad hoc choices of non-sustainable harvest functions (Theorem and Fig. 4).

### "Australia is one of the darkest markets in the world": the global importance of Australian tobacco control [^51d1ecca]. Tobacco Control (2003). Low credibility.

"Australia is one of the darkest markets in the world… it probably is the darkest, I mean ourselves and Canada fight every month for who's got the darkest conditions to do tobacco manufacturing and marketing. And one of the things we can offer the world is what we do best, which is how to work, maximize, proactively drive our market position in a market that's completely dark. Now that takes a different skillset… a different type of learning. We need to export that… we know we have a lot of expatriates who come down to Australia for learning. they can come here and learn these techniques and take them back to Europe or Latin America or to the United States or to Africa… But the other thing that is really good for us is that we are also a huge net exporter of Australian talent. about 30 or 40 people currently off-shore… We do things really differently here than most other BAT organizations".

### Prices, availability, and affordability of adult medicines in 54 low-income and middle-income countries: evidence based on a secondary analysis [^f1388bd6]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Medication shortages are a pressing concern throughout the world. To gain insight into this issue, WHO and Health Action International (HAI) have constructed a validated method to survey medicine prices, availability, and affordability in low-income and middle-income countries. This paper aims to present an updated analysis of medicine affordability, availability, and pricing across 54 countries using the WHO-HAI method, highlighting disparities between public and private sectors.

Methods

A search was conducted using the HAI Essential Medicines Access Database and four electronic databases to locate studies using the WHO-HAI method. A total of 71 surveys were included, spanning 54 countries. Data concerned with availability, affordability, and pricing were extracted and synthesised. Availability was defined as the average percentage of outlets stocking a medicine on the survey day; affordability was defined as the days' wages of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker required for a standard treatment; and prices were defined as the medicine's median price relative to the Management Sciences for Health international reference median price. Results are presented for the 15 most reported medicines that were included in at least 75% of surveys. Results are also presented for four commonly used medicines selected to facilitate comparison with previous secondary analyses.

Findings

The average availability of generic medicines across WHO regions ranged from 37.8% to 68.3% in the public sector and from 42.3% to 77.4% in the private sector. The availability of originator brand medicines in the private sector ranged from 18.0% to 47.6% across these regions. Neither the public nor the private sector in any region met WHO's recommended availability target of 80%. Medicine prices were consistently high across all WHO regions, requiring patients to pay 3.0–11.5 times international reference prices for lowest-priced generic medicines and over 25 times international reference prices for originator products across WHO regions. Treatment of both acute and chronic illnesses remained unaffordable in many regions, requiring patients to pay 0.2–37.0 days' wages to purchase a single course of medicine.

Interpretation

Access to essential medicines remains a global challenge. Medicines consistently display high prices, low affordability, and poor availability. Although there have been some advancements, the overall accessibility of essential medicines remains a substantial global concern. Innovative and targeted strategies are essential to enhance access, requiring a concerted effort from governments, health-care organisations, and international bodies to implement solutions that address both economic and logistical barriers.

### Policy recommendations to promote prescription drug competition: a position paper from the American College of Physicians [^bc0d352e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The prescription drug market in the United States relies on competition to keep prices reasonable. Although many policies have been implemented to spur competition and decrease costs for patients, these policies may be outdated and should be redesigned and updated to achieve success in the current prescription drug market. In this paper, the American College of Physicians (ACP) proposes that new policies should be implemented to prevent market manipulation, help lower-cost alternatives make it to the market faster, and ensure a robust and competitive market for generic and biosimilar drugs. The ACP believes these changes will have a meaningful effect on patients without shifting costs to other areas of the health care system.

### Patterns of manufacturer coupon use for prescription drugs in the US, 2017–2019 [^efd75136]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

When and how frequently do patients use manufacturer-sponsored coupons for their prescription drugs during a treatment episode?

Findings

In this cohort analysis of 35 352 individuals receiving pharmaceutical treatment for chronic diseases, nearly all of the first coupon use occurred with the first prescription fills. The frequency of manufacturer drug coupon use was associated with drugs operating in competitive environments but not with patient's out-of-pocket costs or the characteristics of neighborhoods where the patients reside.

Meaning

These findings suggest that manufacturer-sponsored coupons were more likely used to initiate the treatment, and the frequency of coupon use was associated with market competition but not patients' out-of-pocket costs.

### Longitudinal study of the effects of price and promotion incentives on purchases of unhealthy foods: evidence for restricting food promotions [^37dc2ecf]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2022). High credibility.

Objectives

Taxes and restrictions on promotions have recently been proposed as policy instruments to reduce consumption of unhealthy foods. The objective of this study is to add to the limited evidence on the comparative effectiveness of price changes, price promotions and volume promotions in changing household purchasing of unhealthy foods, using biscuits, crisps and savoury snacks as examples.

Design

Longitudinal regression analysis of consumer microdata.

Setting

Secondary data on itemised household purchases of biscuits, crisps and savoury snacks from 2006 to 2012.

Participants

Sample of 3024 households in Scotland.

Main Outcome Measures

Changes in the number of calories (kcal) purchased in the product category by a household caused by changes in the price for the product category, any temporary in-store price promotions and any temporary in-store volume promotions. Changes are measured at the mean, median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile of the household purchasing distribution for the full sample. Subgroup analyses were conducted by household income band and for households with and without children.

Results

Between product categories, the scale of purchasing response to incentives varies significantly. Within product categories, the mean calories (kcal) purchased by a household are more responsive to any volume promotion than to price or any price promotion for all product categories. As the volume of items purchased increases, households are less responsive to price, less responsive to any volume promotion and more responsive to any price promotion. Statistically significant differences are observed between household income groups in their response to price and promotion incentives within the biscuits category only. In cases where statistically significant differences are observed, households with children are more responsive to promotion and price incentives than households without children.

Conclusions

For all product categories analysed (biscuits, crisps and savoury snacks), household purchasing is most responsive to any volume promotion. Therefore, assuming the response of consumers to incentives remains constant following legislation, the most effective policy instrument to reduce the calorie intake from these products may be a ban on volume promotions.

### Comparison of strength and adulteration between illicit drugs obtained from cryptomarkets versus off-line [^2c2efc01]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

The higher strength of MDMA powder, cocaine and methamphetamine aligns with previous research, suggesting that cryptomarkets may provide higher‐quality substances due to market competition and user reviews. Cryptomarkets incentivize vendors to offer high‐strength products to attract positive reviews and customers. The transparency and feedback systems on cryptomarkets may act as an informal regulation system, rewarding sellers of high‐strength drugs with more sales and a positive reputation.

However, MDMA tablets showed lower strength when sourced from cryptomarkets, contradicting this hypothesis. Interestingly, prior research found the opposite effect, where MDMA tablets sourced on‐line had higher MDMA content than those from off‐line sources. One differentiation is that van der Gouwe and colleagues included samples from Clearnet websites in their on‐line definition, whereas the present study focused solely upon cryptomarkets. One potential reason MDMA tablets showed marginally lower strength from cryptomarkets is that the off‐line samples were predominantly from the Dutch drug‐checking service, representing a uniquely high‐strength domestic MDMA market. In contrast, the cryptomarket samples may reflect a greater global supply and exhibit more variability, including some lower‐strength tablets. Another factor could be price competition between vendors driving down prices and, in turn, driving down strength reflecting the nature of 'purity‐adjusted pricing'. This phenomenon may be more pronounced for MDMA tablets compared to other substances for two reasons. First, the MDMA tablet market has particularly high demand, resulting in greater competition. Secondly, the global nature of cryptomarkets means that vendors can source tablets from any country, increasing supply diversity and availability of low‐cost, low‐strength tablets. This expanded supply could further enable tablet vendors to lower prices through purity‐adjusted pricing. In contrast, forms such as MDMA powder may have a more concentrated regional production, limiting supply diversity. The expanded global reach of vendors selling tablets on cryptomarkets may enable more aggressive purity‐adjusted pricing, manifesting in lower tablet strength. MDMA powder and cocaine demonstrated reduced likelihood of adulteration as well as lower adulterant count when sourced from cryptomarkets. This supports the hypothesis and highlights how market transparency could deter adulteration, as vendors face reputational damage and lost sales if found to sell adulterated substances. For other substances, such as amphetamine and LSD, the lack of significant findings for adulterant count suggests that additional factors may influence adulterant levels. For instance, more centralized production of these drugs could lead to uniform adulteration practices throughout market‐places. Additionally, different user demographics and knowledge regarding drugs may impact vendors' adulteration behaviours if some communities have less awareness of adulterants. Lastly, dominance of the cryptomarket supply by a few key vendors could enable those sources to determine adulteration standards.

### Controlling new drugs under marketing regulations [^a74bd3ca]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

The rapid emergence of myriad substances openly marketed as 'legal highs' is straining traditional drug control systems which require time and basic scientific data on harms to react, presenting governments with the dilemma of no response or a disproportionate response. Some countries have side-stepped this using novel policy and legislative approaches. Should other countries consider them?

Methods

We review the different laws invoked to stop the open sale of new psychoactive substances, focusing on the European Union (EU).

Results

Some countries have designed new catch-all control systems, or faster systems to classify substances as drugs. Others have enforced consumer safety or medicines legislation to stop the open sale of these products. The latter originate from harmonization of the internal market of the EU. Rigorous, objective evaluation is required, but first results suggest that these have been effective, while avoiding criminalization of users.

Conclusions

Every EU country should have existing laws for protecting public health that can be applied swiftly yet proportionately to new drugs appearing on the open market with minimum political involvement. It seems the key is the speed, not the weight, of response. Given support for their enforcement mechanisms, these systems might be as effective and more efficient than the old ones.

### Cheaper tobacco product prices at US air force bases compared with surrounding community areas, 2019 [^f00cf645]. Tobacco Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In March 2017, the US Department of Defense (DoD) implemented a policy requiring all military stores to set tobacco prices equal to 'prevailing prices' in the 'local community' adjusted for state and local taxes. We compared tobacco product prices in a sample of retailers located on five Air Force Bases (AFBs) in Texas and Mississippi with those sold in nearby off-base stores.

Methods

We constructed a list of on-base and off-base tobacco retailers. Off-base retailers included stores that were located within a 1.5-mile road network service area from main AFB gates. Between July and September 2019, a trained auditor visited 23 on-base and 50 off-base retailers to confirm tobacco product sales, and documented the price of cigarettes and Copenhagen smokeless tobacco. For each area, the median price for each product, as well as the difference in median prices by on-base versus off-base status, was calculated.

Results

The median price of cigarettes and smokeless products was cheaper at on-base retailers. All products were cheaper at on-base stores in Fort Sam Houston and Lackland AFB. Similarly, all products were cheaper in on-base stores at Keesler AFB, with the exception of Marlboro Red packs ($0.22 more), and at Sheppard AFB with the exception of cheapest cigarette cartons ($6.26 more).

Conclusion

Despite the implementation of the new DoD policy, tobacco products are cheaper in on-base retailers compared with off-base retailers. Refining of the definitions used and improved compliance with the new DoD policy are needed.

### Antimicrobial agents-optimising the ecological balance [^ec98c024]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Another strategy was to compensate successful development as a way to motivate developers. The Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act was ratified in October 2012 by the US government and aimed to incentivize antibiotic discovery. This included granting an additional 5 years of market exclusivity for antibiotics developed to treat serious infections, termed the qualified infectious disease product, and an additional 6 months for development of a companion rapid diagnostic test. This bill also entitled the new drug to priority review and fast-track approval, which in turn committed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to review its clinical trial guidelines and review processes. In addition, a streamlined clinical trial process for novel antibiotics, the Limited Population Antibacterial Drug approval, allows potential drugs to be studied via smaller, faster and less expensive trials. Following this, a proposed US bill, the 21st Century Cures Act, offers qualified antibiotics Limited Population Antibacterial Drug approval and the option of transferable market exclusivity for up to 12 months, where the purchasers are required to donate a portion of the returns to AMR research and patient access programmes.

Perhaps a more well-rounded model is the WHO's Global Consortium, which provides support at the drug discovery stage via an open source platform as well as grants for academics. It aims to lower development costs and risk using patent buy-outs of successfully developed antibiotics (which facilitates antibiotic stewardship and negates the need for excessive marketing), funding of clinical trials and advance purchase commitments for generic distribution.

Additionally, many business models and incentive strategies have been proposed, with some placing emphasis on investment at the beginning of drug development while others reward only successful development of a drug. Nevertheless, a successful package not only requires the creation of a supportive environment for investment that increases profitability and aligns both public and private priorities, but should also address public health objectives such as promoting antibiotic stewardship and improving patient access to new (potentially expensive) antibiotics.

In turn, we distinguish two types of regions: those that have a single manager, and those that are shared such that all managers are free to harvest. Ultimately, the harvest methods used by all managers determine the total areas that become degraded at time t in the managed and in the shared regions at the global scale, and, respectively. Accordingly, the total non-degraded areas in all managed regions, x 1, and in all shared regions, x 2, decrease due to non-sustainable harvest as follows:Moreover, the harvest functions are constrained by the non-degraded areas:for all t, where.

In turn, we assume that harvest comes with a direct cost as more labor and resources are directed toward harvesting. We incorporate this direct cost as a reduction in c (t), which would otherwise grow exponentially at an exogenous rate g c due to technological developments. Specifically, we assume that c (t) is given bywhere C 1 and C 2 are the direct costs of harvesting (in units of c), and λ is the ratio between the direct costs of non-sustainable and sustainable harvest.

Model of the competitive market

It remains to specify how the harvest strategies of the managers at the local scale are determined, and how these strategies determine the harvest functions at the global scale,… We are interested in comparing two types of solutions: The optimal solution that maximizes the social welfare, and the market solution that emerges in a competitive market. The optimal solution is found via the maximization of the social welfare (Eq. 4) subject to the constraints given in Eqs. 6–9. In turn, to define the market solution, we consider a competitive market in which each manager aims to maximize her/his own utility. Specifically, we consider a well-established framework in which the market is perfectly competitive, such that, if property rights are defined everywhere and there are no externalities, the market solution coincides with the optimal solution. In turn, the market solution depends on the form of the externalities for the various managers, namely, it depends on how non-sustainable harvest by a given manager affects the ecosystem in regions managed by other managers.
