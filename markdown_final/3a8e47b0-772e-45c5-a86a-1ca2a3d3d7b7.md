## Question

Pudendal neuralgia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose and manage suspected pudendal neuralgia/pudendal nerve entrapment, including how to weigh neurophysiology, imaging, nerve blocks, and when to escalate to interventions or surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the syndrome is defined and confirmed clinically. Then, I should verify which diagnostic adjuncts actually change management. Next, I will review first-line conservative care and when to consider image-guided blocks. After that, I will examine criteria for surgical referral and expected outcomes. Finally, I should consider neuromodulation and procedural options for refractory cases and highlight common pitfalls and how to avoid misdiagnosis [^113nnn9y] [^114VmqUh] [^112BAmFt] [^1132KjmY] [^113VRNSj].

> Wait, let me verify the framing: the original trace admits there was no specific question and even says "I will provide produce program… ", which is off-track; hold on, I should correct that and provide a stepwise clinical pathway rather than a "program", grounded in guideline- and evidence-based steps for pudendal neuralgia within chronic pelvic pain algorithms and multidisciplinary care, as recommended by the EAU 2025 guidance for chronic pelvic pain and suspected peripheral nerve pain syndromes [^113nnn9y].

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and diagnostic anchor points. The diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia due to pudendal nerve entrapment is primarily clinical; the Nantes criteria are widely used: pain in the pudendal territory, worse with sitting, not waking the patient at night, no objective sensory loss, and a positive anesthetic pudendal nerve block, with additional supportive and exclusion criteria to refine the phenotype; importantly, there is no pathognomonic test, so the diagnosis remains a clinical synthesis rather than a single-test confirmation [^114VmqUh].

> Hold on, I should verify how to operationalize the "positive block" criterion and whether image guidance matters. The EAU 2025 guideline explicitly recommends image- and nerve-locator–guided local anesthetic injections for diagnosis in suspected pudendal neuralgia, with imaging and neurophysiology as aids; image-guided pudendal nerve block is considered safe and effective by ESSR consensus, and responses to blocks are variable but can be helpful in both diagnosis and selection of therapy, including predicting surgical outcomes in some series; dual-site CT-guided infiltrations and prospective cohort data show clinically meaningful short-term improvements in a subset, while a negative diagnostic block has been associated with poor surgical response in selection studies, so I need to ensure blocks are technically accurate and interpreted in context [^111JYYxp] [^114hAf6p] [^1117SK4p] [^116eb91J] [^1126aj6Y].

> Next, I should review neurophysiological testing, but wait — let's not jump to conclusions about which tests to order. Focused neurophysiology can assist selection and prognostication when combined with image-guided infiltration, with a multicenter retrospective study showing that the combination of neurophysiological studies plus imaging-guided pudendal nerve infiltration had good sensitivity and specificity and predicted surgical success; however, older latency measures (PNTML) are unreliable for correlating symptoms and are not recommended in routine fecal incontinence workups by ACOG, and single-fiber EMG correlates better with symptom scores than terminal motor latency in colorectal cohorts, so I should use neurophysiology judiciously, choosing methods with better clinical correlation and avoiding routine PNTML outside targeted contexts [^112BAmFt] [^114GuxFa] [^112ZaPL8].

> I need to check the role of imaging — MR neurography and tractography are increasingly discussed, but hmm, wait a minute, are they definitive. MR neurography can demonstrate pudendal neuropathy features and may correlate with block outcomes, but response rates to blocks remain mixed; diffusion tensor imaging tractography of the lumbosacral plexus and pudendal nerve is feasible on 1.5–3T systems and may open new perspectives, yet there are no established normative microstructural values for the pudendal nerve, so imaging should be adjunctive, not diagnostic in isolation, and results must be integrated with clinical criteria and block responses [^113z29xc] [^113HTGah].

> Now, I will examine first-line management while I ensure we adhere to guideline-based neuropathic pain strategies. Standard neuropathic pain management applies: the EAU advises using established neuropathic pain approaches; the SOGC guideline suggests offering gabapentin for neuropathic pelvic pain in women; broader neuropathic pain literature supports antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and topical agents alongside non-pharmacologic modalities such as pelvic floor physical therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, tailored to patient comorbidity and preferences within a multidisciplinary framework [^1132KjmY] [^111GBKvZ] [^11669DL3].

> But wait, when conservative measures are insufficient, how should I sequence interventional options before surgery. Image-guided pudendal nerve blocks can be both diagnostic and therapeutic with favorable safety profiles; transsacral S2–S4 blockade is a viable alternative route in select patients; pulsed radiofrequency of the pudendal nerve — CT-guided or via pain practice — has early supportive data and case reports suggesting longer relief than simple injection in some cohorts, though data quality is low, so I should counsel about uncertain durability while using these as bridge or adjunctive strategies [^114hAf6p] [^111aTNdd] [^112FfxBb] [^115nvsR5].

> I should confirm when to refer for surgery and what outcomes to expect. Early referral to an expert working within an MDT is recommended for suspected peripheral nerve pain syndromes such as pudendal neuralgia; across 19 studies and 810 patients, surgical decompression yields an overall significant pain relief rate of roughly two-thirds with heterogeneity; minimally invasive and transgluteal techniques report promising results, but selection matters — meeting all Nantes criteria and especially having a positive diagnostic block predicts better surgical success, and anatomical variability underscores the need for experienced surgeons and tailored approaches, including laparoscopic transperitoneal release where appropriate [^113nnn9y] [^113VRNSj] [^115qg573] [^115uNvHE] [^1126aj6Y] [^1149aiGm] [^116DqVXC].

> Let me consider neuromodulation for refractory cases, but hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence. Sacral neuromodulation and pudendal nerve stimulation have shown feasibility and symptomatic benefit in small series and case reports, including wireless peripheral systems and salvage after failed decompression, and conus medullaris spinal cord stimulation can expand pain-free sitting time with durable benefit in selected refractory patients; nonetheless, evidence quality is low and patient selection plus expectation setting are critical [^111F685x] [^112mdKFN] [^115K9bVA] [^115BmwDF].

> Next, I should review diagnostic pitfalls and differentials to avoid anchoring bias. Tarlov cysts at S2–S4 are frequently discordant with symptom laterality and should not be overattributed as the pain source; in fecal incontinence populations, pudendal neuropathy is common but complex, and the puborectal continence reflex may function independently of pudendal status, reinforcing that motor latency alone should not drive management; integrating clinical criteria, careful sensory mapping, and targeted tests helps prevent misdiagnosis [^116mSjEm] [^114CKMsW] [^115k3i6i].

> To synthesize actionable next steps, I need to ensure a logical, testable pathway: confirm the clinical syndrome with Nantes criteria, exclude mimics, and document baseline pain/function; obtain an image-guided diagnostic pudendal block and consider targeted neurophysiology if it will inform prognosis or surgery selection; initiate standard neuropathic pain therapy and pelvic floor rehabilitation; if inadequate, offer image-guided therapeutic blocks or PRF with counseling on expected duration; and for persistent disability with supportive diagnostic signals, refer early to an MDT-expert surgeon for decompression while considering neuromodulation in non-surgical or post-surgical refractory cases, monitoring outcomes with validated measures and reassessing at each step [^114VmqUh] [^111JYYxp] [^1132KjmY] [^112BAmFt] [^113VRNSj].

### Surgical approaches for pudendal nerve entrapment: Insights from a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VRNSj]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE) is an underdiagnosed condition affecting a spectrum of pelvic functions, primarily pain, as outlined by Nantes diagnostic criteria. Although numerous surgical decompression techniques are available for its management, consensus on efficacy and safety is lacking. This study conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and complication rates of the main surgical decompression techniques.
- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed®, Embase®, Web of Science®, and ClinicalTrails.gov® on April 19, 2023. Initial screening involved title and abstract evaluation, followed by retrieval and assessment of abstracts and full-text articles. Studies assessing pain outcomes before and after surgical release of the pudendal nerve were included. Studies were excluded if they lacked full-text, focused on diagnostic methods, or had outcomes relating solely to LUTS, digestive symptoms, or sexual dysfunction. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using the National Institute of Health (NIH) Study Quality Assessment tool. Studies were categorized based on three surgical techniques: perineal, transgluteal, and laparoscopic transperitoneal. Random-effects meta-analysis with subgroup analysis was used. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to investigate the influence of covariates on the observed outcomes.
- **Results**: Nineteen studies, comprising 810 patients, were included. The overall significant pain relief rate across all techniques was estimated at 0.67 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.78) with considerable heterogeneity observed.

### Diagnostic criteria for pudendal neuralgia by pudendal nerve entrapment (Nantes criteria) [^114VmqUh]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2008). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia by pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome is essentially clinical, with no pathognomonic criteria. However, various clinical features can suggest the diagnosis. We have defined criteria that can assist in diagnosing this condition.

A working party has validated a set of simple diagnostic criteria known as the Nantes criteria. The five essential diagnostic criteria are:

1. Pain in the anatomical territory of the pudendal nerve.
2. Pain worsened by sitting.
3. The patient is not woken at night by the pain.
4. No objective sensory loss on clinical examination.
5. Positive anesthetic pudendal nerve block.

Other clinical criteria can provide additional support for the diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia. Exclusion criteria have also been proposed and include: purely coccygeal, gluteal, or hypogastric pain; exclusively paroxysmal pain; exclusive pruritus; and imaging abnormalities that could explain the symptoms.

The diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia by pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome remains predominantly clinical, as there are no specific clinical signs or complementary test results definitively indicative of the disease. Yet, a combination of criteria can be suggestive of the diagnosis.

### Advancing the diagnosis and management of pudendal nerve entrapment: The role of neurophysiological studies and imaging-guided infiltrations [^112BAmFt]. Neuroradiology (2025). High credibility.

Pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE) diagnosis is not standardized, leading to delays in diagnosis that impact quality of life and therapeutic outcomes. The primary goal is to determine the role of neurophysiological studies (NFS) and imaging-guided pudendal nerve infiltration (ImPNI) in diagnosing PNE and selecting patients for surgery.

A retrospective, multicentric study was conducted with patients whose PNE was refractory to conservative treatment. Patient data, including NFS results, ImPNI, and surgical outcomes, were evaluated. A visual analogue scale assessed intervention responses. Test performance metrics for NFS and ImPNI, as well as binary logistic regression, were employed to determine their predictive value for postoperative improvement.

Eighty-eight patients were diagnosed with PNE. All underwent NFS, and ImPNI was performed in 69 patients (78.4%), with 60 patients (68.2%) showing symptom improvement. Among the 40 patients (85%) who underwent pudendal nerve decompression surgery, 75% improved after surgery, while 20% did not. The combination of NFS and ImPNI demonstrated a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 85.7%, with a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 98% and a Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 30%. NFS and ImPNI were significant predictors of surgical success with p-values of 0.013 [95% CI: -23.6 to 19.9] and 0.003 [95% CI: -20.6 to -18.5], respectively. Primary limitations included the retrospective design and the absence of a control group.

Neurophysiological studies and imaging-guided pudendal nerve infiltrations are essential and highly reliable tools for diagnosing pudendal nerve entrapment. ImPNI is a valuable predictor of surgical outcomes.

### Single-fiber electromyography correlates more closely with incontinence scores than pudendal nerve terminal motor latency [^112ZaPL8]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

The investigation of fecal incontinence is important in deciding the most appropriate treatment. The presence of neuropathy has been shown to affect surgical outcomes adversely. Latency studies are of dubious value in assessing neuropathy; needle electromyography is the gold standard test. The relationship between these two tests and the symptoms of fecal incontinence has not been studied.
- **Method**: A cohort of 57 patients underwent neurologic and symptom assessment using latency studies, concentric and single-fiber electromyography, and symptom assessment using the Cleveland Clinic Scoring System.
- **Results**: There was a significant correlation between left mean fiber density and Cleveland Clinic Scoring (correlation: 0.32, P = 0.02) but not between right or left latency studies.
- **Conclusion**: Single-fiber electromyography gave relevant results that could be obtained easily on modern equipment. Latency values were not reliable.

### Response to pudendal nerve block in women with pudendal neuralgia [^1117SK4p]. Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

To examine the evolution of pain and the duration of numbness after neural blockade of the pudendal nerve in women with pudendal neuralgia and correlate with clinical and historical data, a prospective, single-arm, open-label study was conducted at a university hospital and outpatient clinic.

Eighty-two adult female patients were recruited from November 8, 2008, to February 14, 2010. Patients were selected based on the presence of spontaneous or provoked pain in the distribution of the pudendal nerve. Subjects underwent a standardized pudendal nerve block.

Visual analog pain scores and the presence of numbness were recorded before and for 64 hours after the pudendal nerve block. A complete clinical history and examination were documented. Sixty-six patients completed the study. About 86.9% had a reduction in one or more pain symptoms, while 44.3% found that more than one of their pain symptoms did not return. Approximately 69.7% of patients reported numbness lasting up to 16 hours or longer. Previous gynecological surgery was recorded in 75.8%, and previous traumatic obstetric events in 47.0% of cases. A prolonged history of pain correlated with a reduced chance of a positive outcome of the pudendal nerve block.

In conclusion, in patients with pudendal neuralgia, the pudendal nerve block has a variable response but may have a beneficial effect in a subset of women. Surgical and obstetrical trauma are common historical antecedents.

### Role of 3 tesla MR neurography and CT-guided injections for pudendal neuralgia: Analysis of pain response [^113z29xc]. Pain Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) has an increasing role in the diagnosis and management of pudendal neuralgia, a neurogenic cause of chronic pelvic pain.
- **Objective**: The objective of this research was to determine the role of MRN in predicting improved pain outcomes following computed tomography (CT)-guided perineural injections in patients with pudendal neuralgia.
- **Study design**: This study used a retrospective cross-sectional study design.
- **Setting**: The research was conducted at a large academic hospital.
- **Methods**:
	- **Patients**: Ninety-one patients (139 injections) who received MRN and CT-guided pudendal blocks were analyzed.
	- **Intervention**: A 3 Tesla (T) scanner was used to evaluate the lumbosacral plexus for pudendal neuropathy. Prior to receiving a CT-guided pudendal perineural injection, patients were given pain logs and asked to record pain on a visual analog scale.
	- **Measurement**: MRN findings for pudendal neuropathy were compared to the results of the CT-guided pudendal nerve blocks. Injection pain responses were categorized into three groups: positive block, possible positive block, and negative block.
- **Statistical tests**: A chi-square test was used to test any association, and a Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to test any trend. The significance level was set at .05. All analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
- **Results**: Ninety-one patients (139 injections) who received MRN were analyzed. Of these 139 injections, 41 were considered positive (29.5%), 52 of 139 were possible positives (37.4%), and 46 of 139 were negative blocks (33.1%).

### Endoscopic trans gluteal minimal-invasive approach for nerve liberation (ENTRAMI technique) in case of pudendal and/or cluneal neuralgia by entrapment: One-year follow-up [^115qg573]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). High credibility.

Chronic neuropathic perineal pain syndrome is a collective term that encompasses several diagnoses. In patients where the neuropathic pain syndrome is caused by pudendal or cluneal nerve entrapment, surgical release can be proposed if other measures have failed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcome of patients suffering from pudendal and/or cluneal nerve entrapment at 1 year after this minimally invasive surgery, which is based on the open trans gluteal approach that has proven its efficacy compared to medical treatment in a randomized controlled trial.
- **Methods**: Patients eligible for inclusion had chronic perineal neuropathic pain for at least 3 months in the area served by the pudendal and/or cluneal nerve, refractory to conservative measures. Patients met all five of the Nantes criteria.
- **Results**: Fifteen patients underwent the ENTRAMI technique. At 1 year after surgery, an overall reduction of the average maximal Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS-score) was observed, from 9 (range, 7–10) at baseline to 5 (range, 0–10; P-value < 0.05). Optimal treatment response (Patient Global Impression of Change, PGIC ≥ 90%) was found in 40% of participants. No complications were recorded.
- **Conclusion**: This study clearly shows that the technique is feasible with promising long-term results in a difficult-to-manage patient group.

### The pudendal syndrome: A photo essay of nerve compression damage visualized at neurolysis in patients with chronic neuropathic pelvic pain [^116dgHJJ]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Low credibility.

- **Aims**:
	(1) To use intraoperative photographs to visualize and explain pudendal nerve compressions and anatomical variations of compression sites in patients with chronic pelvic pain. (2) To emphasize the diagnostic importance of sensory examination with a safety pin at the six pudendal nerve branches in all patients with chronic pelvic pain: the dorsal nerves (penis or clitoris; the perineal nerves; and the inferior rectal nerves).
- **Methods**:
	- Between 2003 and 2014, "definite" pudendal neuropathy was diagnosed by examination and with two neurophysiologic tests. Neurolysis, via a transgluteal approach, was recommended only after 14 weeks of conservative care failed to adequately improve symptoms and validated symptom scores. Photographs of surgical findings were culled for their educational impact. An illustration of each photo clarifies the surgical anatomy.
- **Results**:
	- The transgluteal incision permits access to pudendal anatomy and compression sites from the subpiriformis area through the interligamentary space and the pudendal canal (Alcock canal). Compressions were acquired or congenital and severity varied significantly. Pinprick sensory testing diagnoses pudendal neuropathy in 92% of both genders. Mid-nerve compression occurred commonly between the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments, less frequently in the Alcock canal, but also at aberrant pathways, for example, between layers of the sacrotuberous ligament; a separate inferior rectal nerve passing through the sacrospinous ligament; at an anomalous lateral pathway posterior to the ischial spine.

### Pudendal entrapment as an etiology of chronic perineal pain: Diagnosis and treatment [^113WwCwd]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2007). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate pudendal entrapment as an etiology of chronic pain, examine a diagnostic protocol for pudendal entrapment, and assess clinical response to surgical decompression.
- **Methods**: A case series involving 58 consecutive patients diagnosed with pudendal entrapment was conducted. Diagnosis was based on clinical factors, neurophysiologic studies, and response to pudendal nerve infiltrations. All patients were refractory to other treatment modalities. Assessments were done before and after surgical decompression, including the degree of pain measured by visual analog scale (VAS) score, percent global overall improvement, and enhanced function and quality of life before surgery and 12 months or longer after surgery.
- **Results**: The primary symptom was progressive, chronic, intractable neuropathic pain in the perineum (ano-rectal and/or urogenital) which worsened with sitting. Other symptoms included urinary hesitancy, frequency, urgency, constipation/painful bowel movements, and sexual dysfunction. Following surgical decompression, 35 (60%) patients were classified as responders based on one of the following criteria: greater than 50% reduction in VAS score, greater than 50% improvement in global assessment of pain, or greater than 50% improvement in function and quality of life.
- **Conclusions**: Pudendal entrapment can cause chronic, disabling perineal pain in both men and women. As symptomatic patients seek medical care from various specialists, a reliable diagnostic protocol should be established.

### A novel electrophysiological method in the diagnosis of pudendal neuropathy: Position-related changes in pudendal sensory evoked potentials [^112XjnWW]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

To examine the diagnostic value of pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE) neuropathy, stimulation was performed on the two sides separately following a provocation by a standard sitting position. Routine pudendal SEPs conducted in the supine position with bilateral simultaneous stimulation may not reveal abnormalities because PNE complaints often appear or worsen in the sitting position.

Forty-nine patients with PNE and 16 controls were included. SEP recordings were performed by stimulating the dorsal nerve of the penis or clitoris on either side. The recordings took place at the initial supine position, at the beginning and end of the sitting position provocation, and during a second supine position.

Amplitude loss in the SEP responses after prolonged sitting was significantly more pronounced on the symptomatic sides of the patients. Approximately a 45% decrease in the SEP amplitude or an amplitude value less than 1.5 µV at the end of sitting are the parameters to be used with high selectivity.

The dynamic pudendal SEP study described here appears more helpful in diagnosing PNE than conventional SEPs.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: A Delphi-based consensus paper from the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR)-part VII, nerves of the lower limb [^114hAf6p]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Image-guided pudendal nerve block is safe, effective, and well-tolerated with few complications. A successful pudendal nerve block is crucial for the diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia and provides guidance for treatment. Different studies, including two randomized controlled trials, demonstrated the absence of complications for this procedure. Furthermore, no significant difference in terms of efficacy was demonstrated between ultrasound (US) and fluoroscopic guidance.
- **US-guided interventional procedures**: Around the genitofemoral nerve are feasible and effective, but evidence is only supported by a small series. US-guided procedures around the genitofemoral nerve are usually performed in conjunction with other nerve procedures, such as ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves; thus, in some papers, it is not easy to differentiate the outcomes of the various procedures. Furthermore, the results are reported on small series. Lee et al. reported the results of radiofrequency ablation of the genitofemoral nerve in four patients, with a reported 100% reduction of pain up to 12 months.
- **US-guided perisciatic injection**: Provides good symptom relief in patients with piriformis syndrome; however, the addition of corticosteroids to local anesthetics still has an unclear role.

### Sacral neuromodulation as a treatment for neuropathic clitoral pain after abdominal hysterectomy [^111umFFF]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The cause of clitoral pain in this patient is unknown and is likely multifactorial. Repeated minor trauma to the pelvic floor and pudendal nerve may have accumulated due to vaginal deliveries and pelvic surgery, leading to a measurable pudendal nerve lesion. Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) has shown benefits in improving clitoral pain, with effects persisting for up to six months post-implantation. Previous studies evaluating SNM on chronic idiopathic pelvic pain have shown positive results. Siegel et al. reported significant improvement in pain symptoms in six out of ten patients with pelvic pain, persisting following a median follow-up of 19 months. However, no previous studies have evaluated SNM treatment for clitoral pain. Although SNM was used as an off-label treatment for clitoral pain in this case, the results suggest that SNM might be effective for patients with clitoral pain.

### Pulsed radiofrequency ablation of pudendal nerve for treatment of a case of refractory pelvic pain [^115nvsR5]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia (PN) is the result of pudendal nerve entrapment or injury, also known as "Alcock syndrome". The pain that develops is often chronic and can be debilitating. If conservative measures fail, invasive treatment modalities can be considered. The goal of this case report is to contribute to the small body of literature suggesting that pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) ablation can effectively treat PN, and to demonstrate that high-resolution MR neurography imaging can be used to detect pudendal neuropathy.
- **Case presentation**: We present a case of a 51-year-old woman with five years of worsening right groin and vulva pain. Various medication trials led to limited improvement. The first diagnostic right pudendal nerve block was performed using 3 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 6 mg of betamethasone via a transgluteal technique targeting the right ischial spine; this procedure resulted in approximately eight hours of more than 50% pain relief. The patient was subsequently referred for MR neurography of the lumbosacral plexus. This study revealed increased signal of the right pudendal nerve at the ischial spine and in the pudendal canal, findings consistent with the clinical picture of PN. Six weeks after the initial block, the patient underwent a second right transgluteal pudendal nerve block, utilizing 3 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 40 mg of triamcinolone acetonide; this procedure resulted in approximately eight hours of 100% pain relief. Satisfied with these results, the patient decided to undergo pudendal nerve PRF ablation for possible long-term relief.

### Sacral neuromodulation as a treatment for pudendal neuralgia [^115BmwDF]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia is a debilitating pain syndrome, and finding long-lasting treatment modalities has been challenging in pain management. The pudendal nerve has sensory and motor functions and influences autonomic functions. Thus, entrapment or damage to this nerve can have multiple serious implications. The constellation of symptoms which result from injury to this nerve is commonly referred to as pudendal neuralgia.

When conservative therapy does not provide adequate pain relief and surgical procedures fail or are not viable options, central and peripheral nerve stimulation can be effective treatment modalities. More recent approaches to treatment include the use of peripheral nerve stimulation through the use of an electrical lead placed next to the pudendal nerve in the ischioanal fossa. Additionally, epidural stimulation of the conus medullaris and pulsed radiofrequency ablation of the pudendal nerve have been shown to be effective in small patient populations.

We present the case of a 36-year-old woman who sustained pudendal nerve injury during a hysterectomy and subsequently developed intractable pelvic pain and pudendal neuralgia. Conservative treatment measures failed, but she obtained excellent results from peripheral nerve stimulator therapy. Permanent implantation consisted of 4 tined Interstim leads, individually placed into the bilateral S3 and S4 foramina. The patient has been followed for approximately 4 years since her procedure, demonstrating increased function as she is able to stand and sit for prolonged periods of time. She has returned to her usual daily activities.

### Selection criteria for surgical treatment of pudendal neuralgia [^1126aj6Y]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2017). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia is the clinical expression of a chronic compression of the pudendal nerve. The diagnosis is based on a set of five criteria, called Nantes criteria. Four of the criteria are clinical, and the last requires evaluation of the anesthetic response to CT-guided infiltration of the pudendal nerve. The aim of our study is to evaluate the relevance of anesthetic test response in selecting patients for surgery and whether this criterion can be used to predict its success.
- **Methods**: Retrospective analysis of a cohort of 34 patients undergoing surgical treatment. In our cohort, we included six patients with negative CT-guided pudendal nerve infiltration test.
- **Results**: Of the 28 patients that met all five Nantes criteria, 64% (18 patients) responded well to surgery. In contrast, 100% of the six patients with a negative anesthetic test failed to show an amelioration of symptoms after surgical treatment (P = 0.006). In our analysis, there was no significant difference in surgery response when men were compared to women (P = 0.387), when the procedure was unilateral or bilateral (P = 0.562), or when the duration of symptoms was long (P = 0.412). We observed a difference in terms of age between the group of responders and non-responders, although this difference did not reach the threshold of significance (P = 0.216).
- **Conclusions**: The selection of candidates for surgery should always include a single diagnostic anesthetic injection of the pudendal nerve, as the fifth of the Nantes criteria is an effective predictor of the success of surgery.

### Pudendal entrapment neuropathy: A rare complication of pelvic radiation therapy [^111jmcsN]. Pain Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE) is an uncommon cause of chronic pain. It typically occurs when the pudendal nerve is fused to nearby anatomical structures or trapped between the sacrotuberous and sacrospinalis ligaments. Causes of pudendal nerve entrapment include excessive bicycling, pregnancy, anatomical abnormalities, scarring due to surgery, or as a sequela of radiation therapy. Radiation-induced peripheral neuropathy is usually chronic, progressive, and often irreversible. Radiation-induced pudendal neuropathy is less common than the more familiar brachial plexopathy secondary to radiation treatment for breast cancer. However, the prevalence of PNE is increasing due to improved long-term cancer survival.

Diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia is essentially clinical. No specific clinical signs or complementary tests are reliably confirmatory. A detailed pain history with correlative clinical examination is paramount for accurate diagnosis. Performance of a pudendal nerve block can serve as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Utilizing various imaging studies, as well as performing an electrophysiological study with pudendal nerve motor latency testing, may yield valuable evidence in support of a pudendal neuralgia diagnosis.

We present the case of a 59-year-old man with stage IV prostate cancer, referred to the pain clinic for chronic perineal and right-sided pelvic pain. His pain began insidiously, approximately two months after undergoing radiation treatment and chemotherapy three years prior. He was ultimately diagnosed as having a right-side pudendal neuropathy.

### Laparoscopic transperitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release for pudendal entrapment syndrome [^1149aiGm]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Pudendal nerve and artery entrapment is an underdiagnosed pathology responsible for several urinary, sexual, and anorectal complaints. The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic transperitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release in a large retrospective cohort of patients with pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome, with both short- and long-term follow-up. Technical details and outcomes are also reported.
- **Methods**: A series of 235 patients with pudendal syndrome underwent laparoscopic transperitoneal pudendal canal release between June 2015 and February 2020. Operative data were recorded prospectively for all patients. A complete history, pain visual analog scale (VAS) for perineodynia, and three scores evaluating the main symptoms (USP, IIEF-5, PAC-SYM) were obtained before and at least 24 months after surgery for 32 patients only. Post-operative complications were also evaluated using the Clavien-Dindo classification at regular intervals.
- **Results**: The mean operating time per side was 33.9 ± 6.8 minutes, and the average hospital stay was 1.9 ± 0.3 days. Blood loss was 20 cc ± 10 cc, with no patients needing transfusion. The only significant peri-operative complication was hemorrhage (600 ml) in one patient induced by a pudendal artery laceration, successfully treated by laparoscopic suturing. Post-operative complications were noted in 18.7% of patients, with no serious Clavien-Dindo complications. Perineodynia VAS dropped from 6.8 ± 0.9 to 2.2 ± 1.8 after surgery (p < 0.001). Mean IIEF-5 scores significantly improved one month after the surgery (15.2 vs 19).

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^11669DL3]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Peripheral neuropathic pain, a challenging condition to manage, requires an array of non-procedural treatment options. These treatments can provide relief without the need for invasive procedures. The effectiveness of different pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches varies, but they generally aim at alleviating symptoms, improving quality of life, and minimizing side effects.
- **Pharmacological treatments**: These include the use of medications such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and topical agents, which can help manage pain symptoms. Medications must be chosen based on the specific needs and medical history of the patient to maximize efficacy and minimize potential side effects.
- **Non-pharmacological treatments**: Techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, and the use of assistive devices offer alternative ways to manage pain. These methods focus on improving the patient's coping strategies, functional ability, and overall well-being.

While these treatments may not cure peripheral neuropathic pain, they play a crucial role in managing symptoms and improving patient outcomes.

### Unilateral pudendal neuropathy is common in patients with fecal incontinence [^114CKMsW]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuropathy and fecal incontinence frequently coexist; however, the contribution of neuropathy is unknown. The pudendal nerve innervates the external anal sphincter muscle, anal canal skin, and coordinates reflex pathways. Lateral dominance or a dominantly innervating nerve and its subsequent damage may have major implications in the etiology and treatment of fecal incontinence. This study was designed to establish the prevalence of pudendal neuropathy, particularly a unilateral one, and to examine the impact on anorectal function.

A total of 923 patients (745 females; mean age, 52 years; range, 17–92 years) with fecal incontinence were studied using endoanal ultrasonography, anorectal manometry, rectal sensation, and pudendal nerve terminal motor latencies.

A total of 520 patients (56 percent) demonstrated pudendal neuropathy, which was unilateral in 38 percent (351 patients; 169 right-sided, 182 left-sided). Neuropathy, whether bilateral (bilateral vs. normal; 56 cm H2O [range, 7–154] vs. 67 cm H2O [range, 5–215]; P < 0.01) or unilateral (unilateral vs. normal; 61 cm H2O [range, 0–271] vs. 67 cm H2O [range, 5–215]; P = 0.04), was associated with reduced anal resting tone. This was also observed with respect to squeeze increments (bilateral vs. normal; 34 cm H2O [range, 0–207] vs. 52 cm H2O [range, 0–378]; P < 0.001, unilateral vs. normal; 41 cm H2O [range, 0–214] vs. 52 cm H2O [range, 0–378]; P < 0.01). In those with intact sphincters, unilateral neuropathy was associated with reduced squeeze increments.

### Initial experience using a novel nerve stimulator for the management of pudendal neuralgia [^111F685x]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). High credibility.

In patients with pudendal neuralgia, prior studies have shown efficacy in chronic stimulation with Interstim® (Medtronic, Inc.). This feasibility study reports on the initial experience of using a wireless system to power an implanted lead at the pudendal nerve, StimWave®, to treat pudendal neuralgia.

- **Methods**: Retrospective chart review identified patients with a lead placed at the pudendal nerve for neuralgia and powered wirelessly. Clinical outcomes were assessed at postoperative visits and phone calls. Administered non-validated follow-up questionnaire evaluated the Global Response Assessment, percentage of pain improvement, satisfaction with the device, and initial settings of the device (hours per day of stimulation).

- **Results**: Thirteen patients had the StimWave® lead placed at the pudendal nerve — 12 (92%) were female and 1 (7.6%) male. The mean age was 50 years (range: 20–58). Failed prior therapies included medical therapy (100%), pelvic floor physical therapy (92%), pudendal nerve blocks (85%), pelvic floor muscle trigger point injections (69%), neuromodulation (30.7%), or surgeries for urogenital pain (23.1%). After the trial period, 10 out of 13 (76.9%) had greater than 50% improvement in pain, with 6 out of 13 (46.1%) reporting 100% pain improvement. Nine underwent permanent lead placement. At the last postoperative visit (range: 6–83 days), 5 out of 9 patients reported over 50% pain improvement. Seven patients reached for phone calls (22–759 days) reported symptoms to be "markedly improved" (n = 2), "moderately improved" (n = 4), or "slightly improved" (n = 1). At follow-up, complications included lead migration.

### Pudendal neuralgia, a severe pain syndrome [^112Gf5cL]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to describe the clinical and electrodiagnostic findings, therapies, and outcomes of patients with pudendal neuralgia.

The study design was a retrospective, descriptive analysis of 64 patients from March 19 to December 22, 2003.
- **Results**:
	- Clinical findings included pain along nerve distribution in all patients (64, 100%), pain aggravated by sitting (62, 97%), pain relieved by standing or lying (57, 89%), and a high rate of misdiagnosis (53, 83%).
	- Neurophysiologic findings showed normal results in 23 patients (35%), demyelination in 17 patients (26%), axonal loss in 5 patients (7.5%), and both demyelination with axonal loss in 21 patients (32%).
	- Therapies involved were conservative treatments in all cases (64, 100%), nerve injection (38, 59%), neuromodulation (2, 3%), and decompression surgery (10, 15%).
	- Pain improvement was noted as slight or moderate with conservative therapy (64, 100%), nerve injection drastically improved symptoms in 12 patients (31%), neuromodulation (2, 100%), and decompression surgery benefited 6 patients (60%).

The conclusion drawn from the study indicates that pudendal neuralgia is poorly recognized and treated. Although improvement is gained primarily with conservative therapy, injections and decompression surgery benefit about half and one-third of patients, respectively. Neuromodulation requires further evaluation.

### Lumbosacral plexus and pudendal nerve magnetic resonance tractography: A systematic review of the clinical applications for pudendal neuralgia [^113HTGah]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2024). High credibility.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is commonly used to establish three-dimensional mapping of white-matter bundles in the supraspinal central nervous system. DTI has also been the subject of many studies on cranial and peripheral nerves. This non-invasive imaging technique enables virtual dissection of nerves in vivo and provides specific measurements of microstructural integrity.

Adverse effects on the lumbosacral plexus may be traumatic, compressive, tumoral, or malformative and thus require dedicated treatment. DTI could lead to new perspectives in pudendal neuralgia diagnosis and management. We performed a systematic review of all articles or posters reporting results and protocols for lumbosacral plexus mapping using the DTI technique between January 2011 and December 2023. Twenty-nine articles published were included. Ten studies with a total of 351 participants were able to track the lumbosacral plexus in a physiological context, and 19 studies with a total of 402 subjects tracked the lumbosacral plexus in a pathological context.

Tractography was performed on a 1.5T or 3T MRI system. DTI applied to the lumbosacral plexus and pudendal nerve is feasible, but no microstructural normative value has been proposed for the pudendal nerve. The most frequently used tracking parameters in our review are: 3T MRI, b-value of 800 s/mm², 33 directions, 3 × 3 × 3 mm³, AF threshold of 0.1, minimum fiber length of 10 mm, bending angle of 30°, and 3D T2 TSE anatomical resolution. Increased use of DTI could lead to new perspectives in the management of pudendal neuralgia due to entrapment syndrome.

### Pudendal nerve entrapment as source of intractable perineal pain [^115QR66M]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Perineal pain caused by pudendal nerve entrapment is a rarely reported entity, with only a handful of cases documented in modern literature. A 25-year-old male medical student experienced refractory unilateral orchialgia for 32 months and concomitant proctalgia for 14 months. The pain was positional, exacerbated by sitting, and partially relieved when standing or recumbent. Pudendal nerve entrapment was clinically diagnosed, with computed tomography-guided nerve blocks providing temporary relief. A prolonged left pudendal nerve distal motor latency on electrodiagnostic testing later confirmed the diagnosis.

During surgery, the left pudendal nerve was found flattened in the pudendal canal of Alcock and in contact with the sharp inferior border of the sacrospinous ligament. After surgical decompression and rehabilitation, the patient experienced significant relief from pain and returned to medical school. This case suggests that pudendal nerve entrapment should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic urogenital or anorectal pain, particularly if the pain is aggravated by sitting or if there is a history of bicycle riding.

### Spinal cord stimulation of the conus medullaris for refractory pudendal neuralgia: A prospective study of 27 consecutive cases [^115K9bVA]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2015). Low credibility.

Thirty percent of patients with pudendal neuralgia due to pudendal nerve entrapment obtain little or no relief from nerve decompression surgery. The objective of this study was to describe the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation of the conus medullaris in patients with refractory pudendal neuralgia.

This prospective study was conducted by two centers within the same university city. It described the results obtained on perineal pain and functional disability in all patients with an implanted conus medullaris stimulation electrode for the treatment of refractory pudendal neuralgia. Twenty-seven consecutive patients were included by a multidisciplinary pelvis and perineal pain clinic between May 2011 and July 2012, with a mean follow-up of 15 months.

The intervention consisted of the insertion of a stimulation electrode, followed by a test period averaging 13 days before deciding on permanent electrode implantation. Maximum and average perineal pain scores and the pain-free sitting time were initially compared during the test and in the long-term using a paired t-test. The estimated percent improvement (EPI) was evaluated in the long term.

Twenty of the 27 patients were considered to be responders to spinal cord stimulation, and 100% of implanted patients remained long-term responders, with a mean tripling of sitting time and a mean EPI of 55.5%.

Spinal cord stimulation of the conus medullaris is a safe and effective technique for the long-term treatment of refractory pudendal neuralgia. Routine use of this technique has never been previously reported in the literature.

### Non-venous pelvic pain and roles for pelvic floor PT or pudendal nerve blocks [^111TdeDd]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Non-venous pelvic pain is a dilemma that can frustrate even the most patient providers. Managing these conditions can be bewildering, as they often require a multidisciplinary approach. Diet and lifestyle modifications, in addition to physical therapy, biofeedback, medications, surgery, and integrative medicine modalities, can be used alone or in combination to relieve symptoms. Treatment should be individualized following a proper evaluation and diagnosis. Because most of these conditions are located in the area of pudendal nerve distribution, pudendal nerve blocks have been very successful in controlling pain symptoms and should be used judiciously. This discussion focuses on common conditions and how physical therapy and pudendal nerve blocks play a significant role in treatment.

### Combined decompression of pudendal and inferior cluneal nerves for entrapment neuralgias using transperitoneal robotic laparoscopy: Feasibility and our four-step technique [^111TpLqM]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2024). Low credibility.

To demonstrate the feasibility of a combined decompression of pudendal and inferior cluneal nerves for entrapment syndrome using a transperitoneal robotic laparoscopy, a four-step technique with narrated video footage is presented.

Pudendal and inferior cluneal neuralgias are both causes of perineal pain [1]. Although more precise data are lacking, these two neuralgias are frequently associated. Failures in surgical pudendal nerve decompression in the early 2000s led to the discovery of a potential entrapment syndrome of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh and its inferior cluneal branches between the ischium bone and the sacrotuberous ligament [2]. The resulting neuralgia is responsible for neuropathic pain affecting a more posterior part of the perineum and the thigh, without neurovegetative symptoms. In cases where medical treatment fails, surgery using an invasive open transgluteal approach may be proposed as a standard treatment [3–5].
- **Interventions**: Transperitoneal robotic laparoscopy offers a minimally invasive method for releasing both pudendal and inferior cluneal nerves. This procedure is conducted following a four-step technique:
	1. Opening of the peritoneum between the external iliac vessels and the umbilical ligament.
	2. Dissection of the internal iliac and pudendal arteries up to the pudendal nerve.
	3. Section of the sacrospinous ligament and release of the pudendal nerve.
	4. Section of the sacrotuberous ligament and release of the inferior cluneal nerve.

Previously, pudendal and inferior cluneal neuralgias often required more invasive approaches.

### Peripheral nerve stimulation for pudendal neuralgia: A technical note [^1123tmA3]. Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuropathy is a chronic, disabling form of perineal pain involving the pudendal nerve, a mixed somatic and autonomic nerve originating from sacral nerve roots. Peripheral nerve stimulation of the pudendal nerve can be useful to decrease symptom burden in patients who have failed initial conservative treatment modalities.
- **Methods**: In this manuscript, we describe an approach to the placement of a peripheral nerve stimulator for the treatment of pudendal neuralgia. We present a case of complex pelvic neuropathy and review the factors that lead to successful placement. Technical aspects of stimulator placement and ultrasound landmarks are reviewed.
- **Results**: A lateral to medial approach with ultrasound guidance at the level of the ischial spine is likely to facilitate proper lead placement along the course of the pudendal nerve. Aftercare and adherence to post-implant activity restrictions — particularly avoiding the use of the extremes of hip flexion and extension for four weeks — lead to the absence of lead migration.
- **Conclusions**: Pudendal nerve stimulation is an emerging technique for neuromodulation of refractory pudendal neuralgia. Ultrasound-guided pudendal nerve stimulation is a viable technique for neuromodulation of pudendal neuralgia. Optimization of patient selection, ultrasound guidance, and proper adherence to post-implant activity restrictions may be helpful for long-term therapeutic success.

### Initial experience of CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency ablation of the pudendal nerve for chronic recalcitrant pelvic pain [^112FfxBb]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the initial experience with computed tomography (CT)-guided pulsed radiofrequency ablation (pRFA) of the pudendal nerve in cases of recalcitrant neuropathic pelvic pain. The endpoints include technical feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the therapy.

- **Materials and methods**: Ten patients who underwent pRFA for neuropathic pudendal nerve pain during the trial period were followed for their response to treatment over 6 months. Each patient received pRFA under CT guidance with a concomitant perineural injection of anesthetic and/or corticosteroid. Pain scores were then measured using a numeric rating scale at fixed intervals up to 6 months.

- **Results**: All procedures were deemed technically successful with no immediate complications. pRFA demonstrated an improved duration of pain improvement compared to the most recent perineural injection (p = 0.0195), but not when compared to the initial injection (p = 0.64). Reported pain scores were lower with pRFA than with both the first and most recent injections, although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1094 and p = 0.7539, respectively).

- **Conclusion**: Overall, pRFA of the pudendal nerve using CT guidance can be considered a safe and effective therapy. This technique provides direct visualization of the nerve to maximize safety and efficacy while offering a novel form of therapy for patients with chronic, recalcitrant pelvic pain.

### Hip arthroscopy and periacetabular osteotomy generally improve sexual function in patients, but have a risk of iatrogenic pudendal nerve injury that can temporarily worsen sexual function: A systematic review [^1161Djgn]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Although most studies agree that sexual function is improved after hip sports medicine orthopedic surgeries, it is important that patients are counseled on the risk of iatrogenic nerve injuries during surgery. The use of a perineal post during hip arthroscopy is implicated in almost a quarter of all intraoperative complications with this surgery. Importantly, the pudendal nerve, a major nerve responsible for sexual function, is at risk for injury in hip arthroscopy.

In female patients, the pudendal nerve may be implicated in symptoms of vulvodynia associated with femoroacetabular impingement. For male patients, damage to the pudendal nerve can contribute to erectile dysfunction after surgery. In patients with ongoing pudendal nerve damage or entrapment, potential therapeutic measures include anesthesia injection, decompression, or neurolysis.

To avoid pudendal nerve damage intra-operatively, one study in this review conducted hip arthroscopy without a perineal post. The authors found that in a postless hip arthroscopy, 0% of patients had iatrogenic nerve injuries. Further studies comparing hip arthroscopy with and without the use of a perineal post could be conducted to verify the benefit of postless hip arthroscopy on reducing pudendal nerve injury.

- **Iatrogenic nerve injuries**: Other major nerves implicated in iatrogenic nerve injuries were the sciatic nerve and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. In a systematic review, deep gluteal syndrome causing sciatic nerve entrapment was iatrogenic in 30% of cases.

### Anatomical variants of the pudendal nerve observed during a transgluteal surgical approach in a population of patients with pudendal neuralgia [^116DqVXC]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Several studies have described the course and anatomical relations of the pudendal nerve. Several surgical nerve decompression techniques have been described, but only the transgluteal approach has been validated by a prospective randomized clinical trial. The purpose of this study was to describe the course of the nerve and its variants in a population of patients with pudendal neuralgia in order to guide the surgeon in the choice of surgical approach for pudendal nerve decompression.
- **Objectives**: In order to support the choice of the transgluteal approach used in our institution, we studied the exact topography, anatomical relations, and zones of entrapment of the pudendal nerve in a cohort of operated patients.
- **Study design**: Observational study.
- **Setting**: University hospital.
- **Methods**: One hundred patients underwent unilateral or bilateral nerve decompression performed by a single operator via a transgluteal approach. All patients satisfied the Nantes criteria for pudendal neuralgia. The operator meticulously recorded zones of entrapment, anatomical variants of the course of the nerve, and the appearance of the nerve in the operative report.
- **Results**: One hundred patients and 145 nerves were operated consecutively. Compression of at least one segment of the pudendal nerve (infrapiriform foramen, ischial spine, and Alcock's canal) was observed in 95 patients. The zone of entrapment was situated at the ischial spine between the sacrospinous ligament (or ischial spine) and the sacrotuberous ligament in 74% of patients. Anatomical variants were observed in 13 patients.

### Endoscopic transperineal pudendal nerve decompression: Operative pudendoscopy [^115uNvHE]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Pudendal nerve entrapment can produce a pudendal syndrome comprising perineodynia together with urinary, sexual, and anorectal symptoms. This syndrome can be treated surgically by the transperineal approach. By using an endoscope during the procedure (referred to as "operative pudendoscopy"), the surgeon has close-up visual control of each decompression step, demonstrates the different levels of entrapment, and cuts the sacrospinous ligament under visual control. The aim of this study was to describe the technical details of this new technique and its outcome in the treatment of pudendal syndrome.
- **Methods**: A series of 113 patients with severe pudendal syndrome underwent operative pudendoscopy. A complete history, pain visual analog scale (VAS) for perineodynia, and four scores evaluating the main symptoms (ICIQ-SF, NHI-CPSI, St Mark's, and Wexner) were obtained before and at least 24 months after surgery. The three clinical signs of pudendal syndrome (abnormal pinprick sensitivity, painful skin rolling test, and painful pudendal nerve) and perineal descent were analyzed before and after surgery in 91 patients.
- **Results**: The mean operating time per side was 50.3 ± 15.2 minutes and the average hospital stay was 2.1 ± 0.4 days. Perineodynia VAS dropped from 7.2 ± 1.4 to 4.5 ± 2.9 after surgery (p < 0.0001) and the symptom scores significantly improved. The frequency of sexual arousal syndrome, dyspareunia, and cystalgia was also significantly reduced. Pathological perineal descent (≥ 1.5 cm measured with a Perineocaliper®) observed in 13 patients was reduced from 1.81 to 0.77 cm after surgery.

### Chronic pelvic pain: Neurogenic or non-neurogenic? Warm detection threshold testing supports a diagnosis of pudendal neuropathy [^117HEMsr]. Pain Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in men is rarely considered to have a neurogenic (neuropathic) basis. The separation of neurogenic from non-neurogenic pain is possible using clinical examination and neurophysiologic tests, allowing for a definite diagnosis of neuropathic pain.

- **Objectives**: We aim to demonstrate that definite pudendal neuropathic abnormalities can be supported by a quantitative sensory test (QST) called the warm temperature threshold detection (WDT) test in men with CPP.
- **Study design**: This is a retrospective review of 25 consecutive, unrecruited men evaluated in a private clinical practice beginning on January 1, 2010. The techniques of examination and neurophysiological testing have been standard since 2003.
- **Setting**: A private practice that is a referral center because of its focus on CPP of a neuropathic basis.
- **Methods**: Pinprick sensation was evaluated at six sites in the pudendal nerve territory (three branches on each side). A WDT was performed at each nerve branch using a Physitemp NTE-2C Thermoprobe and Controller, which used a stepping algorithm from a neutral baseline of 31.5°C. Quantitative and subjective "qualitative responses" were recorded. Our preferred symptom score to evaluate pain level at consultation is the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). The results become the benchmark for comparison of responses following future treatments (not discussed). When possible, microscopy was used to evaluate prostate secretions for inflammatory prostatitis, except in two men with CPP who had undergone a previous radical prostatectomy.

### Therapeutic pudendal nerve blocks using corticosteroids cure pelvic pain after failure of sacral neuromodulation [^111Mo9q4]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

A patient with bladder frequency and urgency associated with pelvic pain experienced no control of symptoms through previous bladder distention, hysterectomy, or sacral nerve root stimulator. A clinical and neurophysiological diagnosis of pudendal neuropathy was made. Treatment with a nerve protection program and pudendal nerve perineural injections of local anesthetics and corticosteroids provided total symptomatic relief that is durable.

### Successful treatment of pudendal neuralgia with tricolumn spinal cord stimulation: Case report [^117TLVL9]. Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

There is large variation in the success of decompressive surgery for pudendal neuralgia (PN), the most chronic, disabling form of perineal pain. We attempt to determine whether spinal cord stimulation using new-generation multicolumn leads could form part of the treatment algorithm for refractory PN.
- **Clinical presentation**: A man with PN that was unresponsive to conventional treatment demonstrated a neuropathic component and had a negative response to nerve infiltrations (so he was not indicated for decompressive surgery) and a positive response to perianal transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. He was implanted with a 16-contact surgical lead at the level of conus medullaris, allowing multicolumn stimulation. Using transverse combinations, it was possible to obtain 100% paresthesia over the perineal area without unwanted dorsal root stimulation. Perineal and radicular pain was successfully relieved for up to 12 months (80% and 60% reduction in the visual analogue scale scores, respectively), with an improvement in all quality of life domains and a reduction in drug consumption.
- **Conclusion**: Spinal cord stimulation using a 16-contact lead may be a viable therapeutic option for patients with refractory PN for whom decompressive surgery is contraindicated.

### Development and validation of a pudendal nerve block simulation-based educational intervention [^117V1aNZ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recognizes the importance of providing comprehensive pain management options and acknowledges the variability in the availability of specific modalities. Before the advent of neuraxial anesthesia, pudendal nerve block was the primary means of providing pain relief during the later stages of labor, delivery, and related interventions. The use of this modality steadily decreased over the second half of the 20th century to less than 10% by the 1990s, and 3% by 2016. Over the years, the number of trained physicians available to provide education on performing pudendal blocks has continued to decline.

Patient-centered obstetric care should include comprehensive options for pain management at the time of labor. Pudendal nerve block in modern obstetric practice remains essential and safe in a wide range of scenarios. However, clinicians have inadvertently limited their ability to offer comprehensive pain management options and lost practice of a skill that is of paramount importance in situations where neuraxial analgesia is not available, including low-resource settings. In addition, the ability to administer pudendal blocks transvaginally is clinically useful in treating pudendal neuralgia in non-obstetrical populations as an alternative to the transgluteal approach used by non-obstetrician gynecologists.

Simulation in obstetrics is a well-established technique that improves knowledge, clinician performance, and patient outcomes. Additionally, simulation is a useful tool to teach skills.

### Transsacral S2-S4 nerve block for vaginal pain due to pudendal neuralgia [^111aTNdd]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia is a type of neuropathic pain experienced predominantly while sitting, and it causes a substantial decrease in the quality of life in affected patients. Pudendal nerve block is a diagnostic and therapeutic option for pudendal neuralgia. Transsacral block at S2 through S4 results in pudendal nerve block, which can successfully relieve pain due to pudendal nerve injury.

Herein, the blockade of S2 through S4 using lidocaine and methylprednisolone is reported for successful treatment of pudendal neuralgia in two patients with severe chronic vaginal pain. The patients, aged 44 and 58 years, respectively, were referred from the Gynecology Department to the pain clinic because of burning, stabbing, electric shock-like, unilateral pain localized to the left portion of the vagina and extending to the perineum. Their initial pain scores were 9 and 10, respectively, on a numeric rating scale. Both patients refused pudendal nerve block using classical techniques.

Therefore, a diagnostic transsacral S2-S4 nerve block was performed using lidocaine 1% and repeated using lidocaine 1% and methylprednisolone 80 mg after confirming block efficiency, as demonstrated by an immediate decrease in pain scores. After one month, pain scores were 1 and 0, respectively, and both patients were free of pain at six-month follow-up. The study suggests that blockade of S2 through S4 using lidocaine and methylprednisolone is an effective treatment option in patients with chronic pudendal neuralgia when traditional pudendal nerve block is not applicable.

### Epitol [^1175zeTn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Epitol is indicated for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.

- **Dosage recommendations**:
	- **Initial dosage**: On the first day, administer 100 mg twice a day, resulting in a total daily dose of 200 mg. This dose may be increased by up to 200 mg per day, using increments of 100 mg every 12 hours, only as necessary to achieve pain relief. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 1200 mg.

	- **Maintenance dosage**: Pain control can typically be maintained with a daily dosage ranging from 400 to 800 mg. However, some patients may be adequately maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require up to 1200 mg daily. It is recommended to attempt dose reduction to the minimum effective level or discontinue the drug altogether at least once every three months during the treatment period.
- **Tablet formulations**: Epitol is available as chewable or conventional tablets.

### Perineal and rectal nerve recruitment order varies during pudendal neurostimulator implant surgery [^116B8ANn]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Pudendal nerve stimulation (PNS) is an off-label use of sacral neuromodulation (SNM) for targeting pelvic pain and bladder symptoms. Studies have shown that patients whose symptoms are refractory to SNM can be salvaged with PNS, leading to improvement of pelvic pain, voiding, and urinary incontinence. However, there is limited literature on the direct effects of PNS on the lower urinary tract, in particular during intraoperative placement.

The pudendal nerve originates from the S2, S3, and S4 spinal nerve roots. It typically forms a primary trunk and then splits into the inferior rectal nerve, perineal nerve, and genital nerve primary branches. The genital nerve, which is sensory only, innervates the external genitalia. The perineal nerve innervates the pelvic floor, urethra, and perineal muscles, while the rectal nerve innervates the external anal sphincter (EAS) and levator ani. Pudendal nerve anatomical structure is diverse. Near the sacrospinous ligament, one to three nerve trunks may be found with different branching points. The heterogeneity of pudendal nerve anatomy could pose potential obstacles during a PNS surgical approach and may influence the lead placement and variation in results. No study has investigated the activation patterns of the pudendal nerve among perineal and rectal motor responses during PNS implant surgery.

### Evaluating the discordant relationship between Tarlov cysts and symptoms of pudendal neuralgia [^116mSjEm]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia is a painful neuropathic condition involving the pudendal nerve dermatome. Tarlov cysts have been reported in the literature as another potential cause of chronic lumbosacral and pelvic pain. Notably, they are often located in the distribution of the pudendal nerve origin at the S2, S3, and S4 sacral nerve roots and it has been postulated that they may cause similar symptoms to pudendal neuralgia. Literature has been inconsistent on the clinical relevance of the cysts and if they are responsible for symptoms.
- **Objective**: To evaluate the prevalence of S2-S4 Tarlov cysts at the pudendal nerve origin (S2-S4 sacral nerve roots) in patients specifically diagnosed with pudendal neuralgia, and establish association of patient symptoms with the location of Tarlov cyst.
- **Study design**: A retrospective study was performed on 242 patients with pudendal neuralgia referred for pelvic magnetic resonance imaging from January 2010 to November 2012. Dedicated magnetic resonance imaging review evaluated for presence, level, site, and size of Tarlov cysts. Among those with demonstrable cysts, subsequent imaging data were collected and correlated with the patients' clinical site of symptoms. Statistical analysis was performed using χ², Pearson χ², and Fisher exact tests to assess significance.
- **Results**: Thirty-nine (16.1%) patients demonstrated at least one sacral Tarlov cyst; and of the 38 patients with complete pain records, 31 (81.6%) had a mismatch in findings. A total of 50 Tarlov cysts were identified in the entire patient cohort. The majority of the Tarlov cysts were located…

### Combined site-specific sacral neuromodulation and pudendal nerve release surgery in a patient with interstitial cystitis and persistent arousal [^115Sayqh]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

A variety of neuromodulation approaches have been described for the management of pelvic neuropathies, including interstitial cystitis, pudendal neuralgia, and persistent genital arousal disorder. The benefits of a combined sacral and pudendal nerve neuromodulator have yet to be explored for these patients. In this report, we describe the case of a 35-year-old woman with complex pelvic neuropathy resulting in urinary, sexual, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. She presented with an established diagnosis of interstitial cystitis; however, she also fulfilled diagnostic criteria for pudendal neuralgia and persistent genital arousal disorder. The patient underwent implantation of a combined sacral and pudendal nerve neuromodulation device at the time of surgical decompression of the pudendal nerves. An impressive clinical response followed. This case demonstrates a unique clinical presentation and highlights the value of a combined surgical and neuromodulatory approach in the management of patients with complex pelvic neuropathies.

### Evaluation of acute pelvic pain in women [^112ftAh3]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

Acute pelvic pain is defined as noncyclic, intense pain localized to the lower abdomen and/or pelvis, with a duration of less than three months. Signs and symptoms are often nonspecific. The differential diagnosis is broad and depends on the patient's age, pregnancy status, and whether the etiology is gynecologic or nongynecologic.
- **Nongynecologic etiologies**: Include gastrointestinal, urinary, and musculoskeletal conditions. Urgent nongynecologic conditions include appendicitis and pyelonephritis.

- **Urgent gynecologic conditions**: Include ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cyst, adnexal torsion, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Notably, approximately 40% of ectopic pregnancies are misdiagnosed at the presenting visit.
- **Less urgent etiologies**: Include sexually transmitted infections, pelvic floor myofascial pain, dysmenorrhea, and muscle strain. Approximately 15% of untreated chlamydia infections lead to pelvic inflammatory disease.

History and physical examination findings guide laboratory testing. Questions should focus on the type, onset, location, and radiation of pain; timing and duration of symptoms; aggravating and relieving factors; and associated symptoms. Performing a urine pregnancy test or beta human chorionic gonadotropin test is an important first step for sexually active, premenopausal patients. Imaging options should be considered, starting with transvaginal ultrasonography, followed by computed tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging can be useful if ultrasonography and computed tomography are nondiagnostic.

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^117QeyC9]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathic pain is a common condition affecting a large portion of the population. Treatment choices are broad and diverse, giving clinicians a variety of options that can be tailored to the individual patient. While medications have the highest level of evidence for treatment, other options including therapy, modality, psychological, and lifestyle approaches should be considered as a part of the treatment algorithm. These approaches can often be used in tandem to hopefully provide the patient with a well-rounded treatment plan for peripheral neuropathic pain.

### Dual site pudendal nerve infiltration: More than just a diagnostic test [^116eb91J]. Pain Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia (PN) is a very painful and often disabling condition in which pudendal nerve blocks play an important role in both the diagnosis and management of PN. Some previous reports have advocated the use of pudendal nerve infiltration (PNI) as a diagnostic test only.
- **Objective**: We aim to assess the outcomes of patients with typical refractory PN who underwent dual site computed tomography (CT)-guided pudendal nerve infiltration.
- **Study design**: A bicentric, retrospective cohort analysis.
- **Setting**: An academic practice.
- **Methods**: Between 2002 and 2016, 385 PNIs were performed in 195 patients in the two units. Only patients suffering from typical clinical PN were included, and only the first infiltration in each patient was considered for analysis. Therefore, 95 patients who underwent 155 procedures were assessed.

	- Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (0–10) and self-reported estimated improvement (SRI), expressed as a percentage. Efficacy of the procedure was assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after procedure follow-up, and clinical success was defined as a 50% decrease of the VAS score. All procedures were performed under CT guidance and on an outpatient basis. Dual site infiltration was performed in each case at both the ischial spine and intra-Alcock's canal sites using a mixture of fast- and slow-acting anesthetic (1 mL lidocaine hydrochloride 1% and 2 mL ropivacaine chlorhydrate) along with a half dose of 1.5 mL of cortivazol (3.75 mg).
- **Results**: Clinical success at one month post-procedure was present in 63.2% of patients (60/95) with a mean VAS score reduction.

### Pathophysiology and therapeutic options for fecal incontinence [^115fo4eG]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Fecal incontinence can result from a variety of causes, including hemorrhoids, pudendal nerve injury, irritable bowel syndrome, fecal impaction, acute diarrhea, autonomic neuropathy, encopresis, autosomal dominant leukodystrophy with autonomic disease, brain failure, anorectal fistula, and Crohn's disease. Additionally, certain medications such as valproate, arsenic trioxide, sodium picosulfate/magnesium oxide/citric acid, linaclotide, zonisamide, and regadenoson can also contribute to fecal incontinence.

### Finite element modeling and in vivo analysis of electrode configurations for selective stimulation of pudendal afferent fibers [^1123eFpH]. BMC Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Pudendal nerve stimulation is a potential means of restoring bladder function in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Stimulation of sensory (afferent) fibers in either the dorsal penile branch (DNP) or the cranial sensory branch (CSN) of the pudendal nerve can evoke stimulation frequency-dependent contraction or relaxation of the urinary bladder in cats. However, the existence of comparable reflexes in persons with SCI remains unclear.

In both experimental and clinical settings, intraurethral electrical stimulation (IES) has been utilized as a minimally invasive method to investigate these reflexes. However, the activation of multiple nerve pathways (pudendal and pelvic) by this approach does not enable identification of the specific sensory nerves responsible for the evoked bladder reflexes. The present study used a finite element model (FEM) and parallel in vivo measurements in the male cat to quantify the effects of electrode configuration and position on intraurethral activation of pudendal afferent nerve fibers. The primary aim of this study was to determine the optimal IES electrode configuration and stimulation locations for selectively activating pudendal afferents to aid future preclinical and clinical investigations.

Clinical evaluation of the bladder response to pudendal nerve stimulation is difficult because of the limited access to the pudendal nerve. The pudendal nerve trunk is located in the ischiorectal fossa, where it exhibits a complex and highly variable branching pattern that provides the motor and sensory innervation of the genitalia.

### Gralise [^113ZyNSw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Gralise for the management of postherpetic neuralgia was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. This study enrolled patients between the ages of 21 to 89 with postherpetic neuralgia persisting for at least 6 months following healing of a herpes zoster rash and a baseline pain intensity score of at least 4 on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).

This 11-week study compared Gralise 1,800 mg once daily with placebo. A total of 221 and 231 patients were treated with Gralise and placebo, respectively. The study treatment, including titration for all patients, comprised a 10-week treatment period followed by 1 week of dose tapering. Double-blind treatment began with titration starting at 300 mg/day and titrated up to a total daily dose of 1,800 mg over 2 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of fixed dosing at 1,800 mg once daily, and then 1 week of dose tapering. During the 8-week stable dosing period, patients took 3 active or placebo tablets each night with the evening meal. During baseline and treatment, patients recorded their pain in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale. The mean baseline pain score was 6.6 and 6.5 for Gralise and placebo-treated patients, respectively.

Treatment with Gralise statistically significantly improved the endpoint mean pain score from baseline. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement is shown in Figure 1.

### European Academy of Neurology guideline on trigeminal neuralgia [^115Eq88b]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for trigeminal neuralgia, the EAN 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining an MRI in all patients with trigeminal neuralgia to exclude secondary causes. Use a combination of three high-resolution sequences: 3D T2-weighted, 3D time-of-flight MRA, and 3D T1-weighted gadolinium, to aid in detecting possible neurovascular compression. Ensure the neuroradiologist is blinded to the side of pain and describe whether vessel contact causes morphological changes of the nerve.

### Pelvic nerve endometriosis: MRI features and key findings for surgical decision [^111sEusr]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Pain management in patients with pudendal neuropathy includes medical treatment with drugs such as antidepressants or neuromodulators, and perineural injection of corticosteroids combined with lidocaine or bupivacaine. In most cases, these injections offer temporary symptom relief. Pudendal nerve decompression surgery may be considered for patients who do not respond to medical treatment.

Treatment of episiotomy scar endometriosis may require surgical excision to minimize the risk of recurrence. Recently, image-guided percutaneous treatments using cryotherapy have been considered.
- **Lumbar plexus**: The lumbar plexus is formed by the ventral rami of the L1–L4 nerve roots. It descends within or posterior to the psoas major muscle and is located anterior to the L2–L5 transverse processes before exiting into the pelvis. Key nerves arising from this plexus include the obturator nerve and the femoral nerve.

### Proctalgia fugax: Caused by pudendal neuropathy [^111VAgJc]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Proctalgia fugax is a strange condition characterized by sudden, uncomfortable pain that typically occurs at night without warning and disappears completely without any objective traces. It is classified as a functional anorectal pain according to the Rome II diagnostic criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders. Numerous theories have been proposed regarding its causes, but none are decisive, and therefore, it is not linked to a definitive treatment. The study included 68 patients with proctalgia fugax, of whom 55 patients exhibited tenderness along the pudendal nerve. The location, character, and degree of pain induced by digital examination were confirmed by all patients to be similar to the pain experienced during paroxysms. Following administration of a nerve block, symptoms disappeared completely in 65 percent of the patients and decreased in 25 percent. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of proctalgia fugax is related to neuralgia of the pudendal nerves.

### Alcock canal syndrome due to obturator internus muscle fibrosis [^116mhNXc]. Muscle & nerve (2010). Low credibility.

Alcock canal syndrome is a rare entrapment neuropathy of the pudendal nerve. We report a case of perineal neuralgia where pudendal nerve compression was due to fibrosis of the obturator internus muscle following an injury of the muscle. After being misdiagnosed for 2 years, the patient was diagnosed only following a combined neurophysiologic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigation. This case underlines the importance of performing focused neurophysiologic and neuroimaging studies in patients with neuropathic perineal pain in order to reach a correct diagnosis.

### Sacral neuromodulation to treat voiding dysfunction in patients with previous pelvic surgery for deep infiltrating endometriosis: our centre's experience [^111c8zrA]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Only three patients were investigated before the SNM test for pudendal neuropathy using bilateral pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML) and external anal sphincter electromyography (EAS EMG) studies. In PNTML evaluation, the delay between the electrical stimulation of the pudendal nerve and the EMG activity of the external anal sphincter (EAS) was recorded using a St. Mark's glove electrode©. During EAS EMG, EMG activity was recorded by an EMG needle inserted in the four quadrants of the EAS.

The SNM Interstim© staged procedure was performed using a standardised electrode placement technique. In the first stage, a permanent tine lead was implanted under local anaesthesia with fluoroscopic control into the S3 sacral foramen, on the left or right side, considering the best motor and sensory response at the lowest amplitude threshold in the testing phase. In the second stage, a permanent pulse generator was implanted for the patients with significant objective relief of symptoms after 6–8 weeks of the testing period. In those with negative symptom relief, the lead and external temporary extensions were removed under local anaesthesia.

Variables such as VS/Ds before SNM therapy, previous DIE surgical procedures, UDS results, time between surgery and the SNM test, age at the SNM test, SNM test results, and the daily number of self-catheterisations (if performed) before the SNM test and after permanent implantation of the system were recorded for each patient.

### Pudendal neuromodulation is feasible and effective after pudendal nerve entrapment surgery [^112mdKFN]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with intractable pain in the pudendal nerve distribution may benefit from pudendal neuromodulation; however, some may have previously undergone pudendal nerve entrapment surgery (PNES), potentially altering nerve anatomy and function. We examined pudendal neuromodulation outcomes in patients with prior PNES.
- **Methods**: Patients with a history of PNES and quadripolar, tined pudendal lead placement for urogenital pain were reviewed. Symptoms and outcomes were collected from existing medical records.
- **Outcomes**: Patients with pudendal neuromodulation and prior PNES were compared to patients with no prior PNES who had pudendal lead placement.

- **Results**: Fifteen patients with a history of 1, 2, or 3 prior PNES (n = 13, 1, and 1, respectively) were evaluated. Most (10; 67%) were female, with bilateral pain (9; 60%), and symptoms of 5–26 years. After trialing the lead, bladder symptoms and pain were improved in 8 of 12 and 9 of 14 patients, respectively, and 80% of patients (12/15) underwent permanent generator implantation. When prior PNES patients were compared to those with no prior PNES (n = 43), gender (67% vs 77% female; p = 0.50) and age (median 63 vs 58 years; p = 0.80) were similar; however, BMI differed (mean 24 vs 29; p = 0.008) and a lower proportion (12/15; 80% vs 42/43; 98%; p = 0.049) had generator implantation. Importantly, median lead implant time (48 vs 50 minutes; p = 0.65) did not differ between the two groups.
- **Clinical implications**: Pudendal neuromodulation has the potential to provide pain relief for a very difficult-to-treat population.

### The puborectal continence reflex functions independently of the pudendal nerve [^115k3i6i]. Colorectal Disease (2019). Low credibility.

The ability of patients with poor pudendal nerve function to voluntarily contract their external anal sphincter is limited. However, it is not known whether the condition of the pudendal nerve influences voluntary puborectal muscle contraction. Recently, we described the puborectal continence reflex that maintains fecal continence by involuntary contractions of the puborectal muscle. We aim to investigate whether both voluntary and involuntary contractions of the puborectal muscle are influenced by the condition of the pudendal nerve.
- **Method**: We retrospectively analyzed 129 adult patients who underwent anorectal function tests at the Anorectal Physiology Laboratory. Anal electrosensitivity was used as a measurement of the pudendal nerve function. Voluntary and involuntary contractions of the puborectal muscle were defined as maximum puborectal muscle contractility and maximum pressure at the level of the puborectal muscle during the balloon retention test.
- **Results**: Voluntary contraction of the puborectal muscle was significantly decreased in patients with pudendal nerve damage (P = 0.002). Involuntary contractions, however, were not associated with the condition of the pudendal nerve (P = 0.63). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the condition of the pudendal nerve and patients' sex significantly predicted voluntary contraction but not involuntary contraction.
- **Conclusion**: Voluntary contractions of the puborectal muscle are significantly decreased in patients with pudendal nerve damage, while involuntary contractions of the puborectal muscle are unaffected.

### Estimate of the proportion of uncertain diagnoses of pudendal neuralgia in women with chronic pelvic-perineal pain: A systematic review with a descriptive data synthesis [^112D54jD]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). Low credibility.

There is a gap between pudendal neuralgia (PN) due to pudendal entrapment syndrome and PN without pudendal entrapment syndrome; the latter could have atypical symptoms.
- **Aim**: Defining a rate of atypical PN from a clinical series of female patients with chronic pelvic-perineal pain.
- **Methods**: The atypical PN was defined as a pain not meeting clinical criteria for pudendal entrapment syndrome. The effect size was the rate of atypical PN. Such a rate was expected to be found among patients screened for enrollment in clinical series on pudendal neuropathic pain. A systematic search was performed, looking for clinical series on PN. Studies must report information on female patients, pelvic-perineal pain, and at least a clinical criterion for diagnosing the pudendal neurogenic origin of pain, as well as the proportion of patients with pain not meeting the clinical criterion/a for diagnosing the pudendal entrapment pain.
- **Results**: From 2,637 references, nine studies were included for qualitative analysis. Three of them were not suitable for data synthesis: one assessed the rate of PN after hip arthroscopy, a second enrolled miscellaneous patients, and a third investigated patients with gynecological diseases. Six studies involved patients with suspicion of pudendal entrapment symptoms (205 patients observed), allowing data synthesis. One of these series was judged as being of good quality. The overall rate of atypical PN is 0.013 (95% confidence interval, 0.008–0.021), I² 0%. Further analysis suggests the risk of bias for all studies.
- **Conclusions**: Atypical PN in females is low when clinica.

### Pudendal neuralgia: A new option for treatment? Preliminary results on feasibility and efficacy [^115UoazX]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the feasibility and report the short-term results of a new procedure for the treatment of pudendal neuralgia, consisting of transperineal injections of autologous adipose tissue with stem cells along the Alcock's canal.
- **Methods**: Fifteen women with pudendal neuralgia not responsive to three months of medical therapy were clinically examined, with VAS score, validated SF-36 questionnaire, and pudendal nerve motor terminal latency (PNMTL). These patients underwent pudendal nerve lipofilling. Clinical examinations using VAS, SF36, and PNTML were scheduled during a 12-month follow-up, with the incidence of pain recurrence (VAS > 5) as the primary outcome measure. Appropriate tests were used for statistics.
- **Results**: All patients had a preoperative increase in pudendal nerve latencies. Twelve patients completed the follow-up protocol. There was no mortality and no complications. Two patients experienced no pain improvement and continued to use analgesic drugs. At 12 months, VAS significantly improved (3.2 ± 0.6 vs. 8.1 ± 0.9, P < 0.001), as did SF36 (75.5 ± 4.1 vs. 85.0 ± 4.5 preoperative, P < 0.01), while PNTML showed a non-significant trend toward better nerve conduction (2.64 ± 0.04 vs. 2.75 ± 0.03 preoperative, P = 0.06).
- **Conclusions**: The new technique appears to be easy, with a low risk of complications, and shows significant improvement of symptoms in the short term. A larger study with appropriate controls and longer follow-up is now needed to assess its real effectiveness.

### Right laparoscopic pudendal release + neurostimulator prosthesis (LION procedure) in pudendal neuralgia [^114jQ8GS]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia is a highly disabling condition with complex diagnostic challenges and controversial treatment outcomes. Surgical neurolysis has been shown to be the most effective treatment. Sacral root neurostimulation or posterior tibial nerve stimulation are used to assist patients who either have not responded to surgery or have worsened after an initial improvement.
- **Methods**: Given the excellent visualization of the pudendal nerve during laparoscopic pudendal release, we propose to combine this procedure with neurostimulation, taking advantage of the possibility of in situ placement of the electrode. The abdominal cavity is accessed laparoscopically through four ports. After identifying and releasing the pudendal nerve, a neurostimulation electrode is placed next to the nerve and connected to a generator located in a subcutaneous pocket.
- **Results**: This procedure has been performed in one patient with satisfactory results.
- **Conclusions**: Laparoscopic pudendal release with a neurostimulator prosthesis is an experimental technique that offers promise for the treatment of pudendal neuralgia.
