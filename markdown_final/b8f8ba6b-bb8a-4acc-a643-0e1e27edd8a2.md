## Question

Patient with HIV and a new diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma what does need to be ordered to determine the chemotherapy dosing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what needs to be ordered to determine chemotherapy dosing for a patient with HIV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about HIV disease status, especially CD4 count, viral load, and antiretroviral therapy interactions. Then, I should assess baseline organ function and performance status to inform dosing safety. Next, I will examine lymphoma biology, staging, and prognostic indices to guide regimen selection and intensity. Finally, I need to consider CNS prophylaxis, opportunistic infection prevention, and plans for relapse management, while continuously verifying drug-drug interactions and supportive care needs [^1154sMqb] [^1137XErm] [^117XG2aU] [^1111cHuB].

> Let me first confirm the overarching treatment principle, because I don't want to jump to conclusions. In the cART era, when feasible, we should treat HIV-associated DLBCL similarly to HIV-unrelated DLBCL, using standard immunochemotherapy and continuing ART, with rituximab offered for CD20-positive disease when CD4 is at least 50 cells/µL, as endorsed by EHA/ESMO 2024 and BHIVA 2014 [^1154sMqb] [^112NXwsm] [^11773hxx]. Wait, I initially thought rituximab might be contraindicated with low CD4 counts, but I should correct that; while infection risk may be higher in profound immunosuppression, guidelines support rituximab in most patients with attention to CD4 thresholds and infection prophylaxis rather than an absolute contraindication [^116qhnJy] [^1154sMqb].

> I will now examine the HIV-specific pretreatment assessment. I need to check the CD4 count because this guides regimen intensity and the safety of standard-dose rituximab-containing therapy, with full-dose immunochemotherapy preferred when CD4 is 50 cells/µL or higher, and closer surveillance if CD4 is below 50 cells/µL per EHA/ESMO and BHIVA recommendations [^1154sMqb] [^113Row7q]. I should confirm HIV viral load as uncontrolled viremia can worsen tolerability and infection risk during chemotherapy, prompting optimization of ART before or during chemo when possible [^1137XErm]. Hold on, I must also verify HBV and HCV co-infection status because HBV reactivation risk exists with rituximab, and HCV should be treated with direct-acting antivirals as advised in EHA/ESMO 2024 [^111FwnFW].

> Next, I should review the current ART regimen for drug-drug interactions with chemotherapy, and I need to ensure boosters like ritonavir or cobicistat are avoided when possible due to CYP3A4-mediated toxicity increases with anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, and etoposide; integrase inhibitor–based regimens are typically preferable during chemotherapy, consistent with oncology–HIV interface guidance [^1137XErm] [^113wAkfT]. Wait, let me verify switch principles; switching ART for safety and interaction mitigation should follow established switch frameworks to maintain suppression while improving tolerability during chemo [^117K8hTv].

> I will now examine baseline organ function and marrow reserve because dosing hinges on these parameters. I should double-check a complete blood count since cytopenias are common in HIV and some NRTIs like zidovudine exacerbate marrow suppression, which could compound chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression and influence dose intensity and G-CSF planning [^1137XErm] [^115VJfki]. I need to confirm renal and hepatic function because cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and high-dose methotrexate require dose adjustments with renal impairment, and hepatic dysfunction can alter metabolism of doxorubicin and vinca alkaloids, necessitating careful dosing and monitoring [^1137XErm]. But wait, what if creatinine-based eGFR is misleading in HIV or altered body composition; cystatin C may help, yet evidence in HIV is insufficient for routine eGFR estimation, so I should interpret cystatin C cautiously and not over-rely on it for dosing decisions [^116o9hBo] [^112L2Ro7].

> Let me consider performance status and prognostic indices next. I should confirm ECOG or Karnofsky performance because it contributes to HIV-specific risk scores and informs regimen intensity decisions in historical risk-adapted strategies, while modern outcomes emphasize the importance of HAART and IPI rather than chemotherapy intensity alone [^113WRrHs]. I need to check LDH and calculate the IPI since EHA/ESMO recommends IPI for prognosis and it may influence the aggressiveness of frontline therapy and need for CNS prophylaxis [^116jRgTA].

> I will now examine lymphoma biology and staging to refine regimen selection. I should confirm CD20 expression to establish rituximab eligibility in HIV-DLBCL per EHA/ESMO 2024, since rituximab improves response and survival in pooled analyses even in HIV-associated NHL when combined with chemotherapy [^1154sMqb] [^1146rjH6]. Hold on, I should verify cell-of-origin testing; determining GCB vs ABC subtype via gene expression profiling or immunohistochemistry provides prognostic information and may influence clinical considerations, though it does not by itself change standard R-CHOP or DA-EPOCH-R selection in most cases [^113ShxYB]. Hmm, wait a minute, my prior note on staging was truncated; I should correct that and ensure complete staging with PET-CT, bone marrow evaluation when indicated, and assessment for extranodal sites that raise CNS risk, to fully inform treatment planning and prophylaxis needs [^117XG2aU].

> Before committing to an anthracycline-containing regimen, I need to ensure baseline cardiac function by echocardiogram or MUGA because doxorubicin is part of R-CHOP and DA-EPOCH-R, and baseline left ventricular function assessment is standard practice prior to anthracycline exposure in DLBCL patients [^117XG2aU]. Hold on, let me verify that while this step is standard across DLBCL care, it is implicitly relevant here due to routine use of anthracyclines in recommended regimens for HIV-DLBCL [^117XG2aU].

> Now, I should review frontline regimen options and dosing strategy. If CD4 is at least 50 cells/µL with acceptable organ function, I should offer full-dose R-CHOP for six 21-day cycles as per EHA/ESMO 2024, or DA-EPOCH-R as an alternative per EHA/ESMO 2024 initial therapy suggestions, avoiding empiric dose reductions solely due to HIV when the patient is otherwise fit [^117XG2aU] [^112PiYfV]. I need to ensure rituximab is included for CD20-positive disease given its association with improved CR, PFS, and OS in pooled analyses, while vigilantly monitoring infection risk in very low CD4 contexts rather than withholding it categorically [^1146rjH6] [^1154sMqb]. If CD4 is below 50 cells/µL, hold on, I should verify BHIVA's stance; yes, closer surveillance and individualized adjustments may be prudent, but under-treatment should be avoided when feasible to preserve curative intent [^113Row7q] [^111bBJYy].

> Next, I should review CNS evaluation and prophylaxis, because missing this could be consequential. I need to check CNS risk features and, if high risk, offer prophylaxis with intrathecal and/or IV methotrexate following BHIVA guidance aligned with HIV-negative criteria, ensuring renal function and timing considerations are addressed to avoid interacting with systemic chemotherapy [^1111cHuB]. I should confirm that primary CNS lymphoma in people with HIV is treated with high-dose methotrexate–based regimens in patients with adequate performance status, renal function, and no pleural or abdominal effusions as recommended by EANO 2023, preferring polychemotherapy over methotrexate monotherapy [^113anhdu] [^114dy89R]. For relapsed or refractory PCNSL, I need to remember EHA/ESMO options including whole-brain radiotherapy or thiotepa-based strategies with ASCT when chemosensitive, selected to patient fitness and HIV control [^1137dfpz].

> Let me reconsider ART management during chemotherapy because interactions can derail plans. I should confirm continuation of HAART during chemotherapy as advised by BHIVA, and when necessary, switch away from ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens to integrase inhibitor–based therapy to minimize CYP3A4 interactions, coordinating closely with HIV specialists to maintain virologic suppression [^11773hxx] [^113LiRPg] [^113wAkfT] [^1137XErm]. Wait, I should double-check that switching maintains suppression and tolerability using established principles for regimen modification in stable patients during cancer therapy [^117K8hTv].

> I will now examine supportive care and opportunistic infection prophylaxis tied to CD4 thresholds and treatment intensity. I need to ensure Pneumocystis prophylaxis for patients with CD4 counts 200 cells/mm³ or less, for which inhaled pentamidine has evidence and is FDA-indicated in high-risk HIV populations when TMP-SMX is not feasible, though TMP-SMX is typically first-line when tolerated in oncology practice [^112HCf9Y]. I should confirm region-specific primary prophylaxis needs such as histoplasmosis and talaromycosis if CD4 thresholds are met or travel risk applies, aligning with DHHS OI guidance and timing around chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression [^11369hJm] [^115CSSA8]. Hold on, I must also verify vaccination status and growth factor support plans, balancing infection risk reduction with chemotherapy dose intensity to avoid avoidable delays or reductions where curative therapy is intended [^1137XErm].

> For relapse planning, I need to ensure a clear pathway. If the patient relapses after frontline therapy, I should offer salvage induction chemotherapy and proceed to autologous stem cell transplantation in fit patients with well-controlled HIV, consistent with EHA/ESMO and BHIVA guidance, noting that modern series support feasibility and durable remissions with ASCT in HIV-associated lymphomas [^114ri7BX] [^1126JWiD] [^1153o3gq] [^116iaWKu]. I should confirm timely transplant referral and coordinate ART throughout the transplant process to maintain suppression and immune recovery [^11773hxx].

> Finally, before finalizing dosing decisions, I should double-check that I am not overemphasizing regimen intensity at the expense of fundamentals. The historical risk-adapted data show survival is driven by HAART use, HIV score, and IPI rather than the specific CHOP-intensity, reinforcing that maintaining ART, delivering planned dose intensity when safe, and addressing prognostic factors are paramount, rather than reflexively downgrading chemotherapy solely due to HIV status [^113WRrHs]. Let me verify all the above steps against EHA/ESMO and BHIVA guidance once more to ensure alignment and safety before prescribing full-dose immunochemotherapy with integrated HIV care and prophylaxis plans [^1154sMqb] [^111bBJYy].

For an HIV-positive patient with newly diagnosed DLBCL, order the following to determine chemotherapy dosing: **CBC with differential** for marrow reserve, **CMP** for renal and hepatic function, **LDH** for tumor burden, and **CD4 count and HIV viral load** for immune status and infection risk [^1137XErm]. Also obtain **echocardiogram or MUGA** for anthracycline safety, and review current ART for drug interactions [^113wAkfT]. These labs guide dosing, rituximab use, and supportive care [^1154sMqb].

---

## Hematologic evaluation

Obtain a **complete blood count (CBC) with differential** to assess baseline marrow reserve and cytopenias; neutropenia or thrombocytopenia may require dose adjustments or growth factor support [^1137XErm]. The **absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count** further guide dosing and the need for G-CSF or transfusions.

---

## Renal and hepatic function tests

- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: Evaluate renal and hepatic function; impaired function may require dose adjustments, especially for renally cleared or hepatically metabolized agents [^1137XErm].

- **Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)**: Essential for dosing renally cleared drugs (e.g. methotrexate, cisplatin) [^116o9hBo].

- **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: Assess hepatic reserve; elevated transaminases or bilirubin may necessitate dose modifications [^115wLwPy].

---

## Cardiac evaluation

Obtain an **echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan** to assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) before anthracyclines (e.g. doxorubicin); reduced LVEF may necessitate dose reduction or alternative regimens.

---

## HIV-specific laboratory tests

Obtain a **CD4+ T-cell count** to assess immune status and infection risk — CD4 < 50 cells/µL increases infection risk and may influence rituximab use and supportive care [^1154sMqb]. Also measure the **HIV viral load** to gauge virologic control; a high viral load may increase infection risk and affect chemotherapy tolerance [^1137XErm].

---

## Tumor burden and prognostic markers

Assess **lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)** as a marker of cell turnover; elevated LDH correlates with higher tumor burden and may influence dosing and supportive care [^1133okYU]. Determine the **International Prognostic Index (IPI)** to assess prognosis and guide therapy intensity [^116jRgTA].

---

## Antiretroviral therapy (ART) review

Review the **current ART regimen** for drug-drug interactions with chemotherapy and adjust to minimize interactions and toxicity [^1137XErm].

---

## Summary table of essential laboratory tests

| **Laboratory test** | **Purpose** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| CBC with differential | Hematologic reserve | Guides dosing, growth factors, transfusions |
| CMP (renal and hepatic function) | Organ function | Dose adjustments for renal/hepatic impairment [^1137XErm] |
| Echocardiogram/MUGA | Cardiac function | Anthracycline safety and dosing |
| CD4+ T-cell count | Immune status | Infection risk, rituximab use [^1154sMqb] |
| HIV viral load | Virologic control | Infection risk, chemotherapy tolerance [^1137XErm] |
| LDH | Tumor burden | Prognosis, supportive care |
| IPI | Prognosis | Therapy intensity [^116jRgTA] |
| ART review | Drug interactions | Adjust ART to minimize interactions [^113wAkfT] |

---

## Clinical implications of laboratory results

- **Hematologic abnormalities**: Neutropenia or thrombocytopenia may require dose reductions, delays, or growth factor support [^1137XErm].

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dosing for renally cleared drugs; consider alternatives if severe impairment [^116o9hBo].

- **Hepatic impairment**: Modify dosing for hepatically metabolized drugs; monitor closely for toxicity [^115wLwPy].

- **Cardiac dysfunction**: Reduce anthracycline dose or use alternatives if LVEF is reduced.

- **Low CD4 count**: Increased infection risk; consider prophylaxis and cautious rituximab use [^1154sMqb] [^112HCf9Y].

- **High HIV viral load**: Increased infection risk; optimize ART and monitor closely [^1137XErm].

- **High tumor burden (LDH)**: May require aggressive supportive care and close monitoring [^116jRgTA].

---

## Conclusion

In HIV-positive DLBCL, obtain CBC with differential, CMP, echocardiogram/MUGA, CD4 count, HIV viral load, LDH, and IPI, and review ART for interactions. These tests guide **dosing, rituximab use, and supportive care** to optimize outcomes [^1154sMqb].

### Management of HIV infection in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy [^1137XErm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The optimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with cancer remains unknown, as clinical trials are lacking and published data are insufficient to guide recommendations. When concomitant use of chemotherapy and ART is anticipated, overlap of toxic effects and drug-drug interactions between chemotherapy and ART may alter the optimal choice of ART. Prospective studies are urgently needed to further define the toxic effects of combined chemotherapy and ART in HIV-positive cancer patients. Such studies should aid the development of guidelines for treatment of this population.

For now, clinicians should individualize decisions regarding treatment of HIV according to clinical and laboratory findings, cancer treatment plan (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery), liver or renal disease, potential adverse drug effects (e.g. rash, gastrointestinal intolerance, bone marrow suppression), and patient preference. This review focuses on what infectious disease specialists need to know to select the most appropriate ART regimens for patients receiving chemotherapy.

### ELYPSE-7: A randomized placebo-controlled phase IIa trial with CYT107 exploring the restoration of CD4+ lymphocyte count in lymphopenic metastatic breast cancer patients [^111Ld9bC]. Annals of Oncology (2015). High credibility.

Lymphopenia is a predictive factor for hematological toxicity, progression, and early death in advanced cancers, including metastatic breast cancer (MBC). CYT107 is a recombinant interleukin 7 (IL-7) from Cytheris, now Revimmune. It is well tolerated and capable of expanding the lymphocyte pool in humans. The aims of this study were to determine the optimal schedule for delivering CYT107 and to assess its effect on clinical endpoints.

- **Patient and methods**: This placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase IIa trial was conducted in MBC patients with less than 1500/µl lymphocytes treated with capecitabine. Using a 2-by-2 factorial design, 20 patients were randomly allocated to four arms to receive CYT107 or placebo before chemotherapy and CYT107 or placebo during chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was CD4+ count changes before and during chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints were hematological toxicity, safety, overall response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Quantification and functional competence of circulating immune cells were also assessed.

- **Results**: When administered before chemotherapy, CYT107 induced a significant increase of CD4+ [+148.1% in CYT107 versus +9.9% in placebo groups (Wilcoxon, P = 0.002)] and CD8+ T-cell counts, including both naïve and memory subsets. When CYT107 was administered during chemotherapy, the magnitude of CD4+ and CD8+ increase was less significant. No modulation of immune cell functional competence was observed. CYT107 was well tolerated with no related ≥ grade 3 adverse events except for one fatal suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction.

### AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma: Final analysis of 485 patients treated with risk-adapted intensive chemotherapy [^113WRrHs]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

We aimed to compare AIDS risk-adapted intensive chemotherapy in AIDS-related lymphoma (ARL) patients before and after the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A total of 485 patients aged from 18 to 67 years were randomly assigned to chemotherapy after stratification according to an HIV score based on performance status, prior AIDS, and CD4(+) cell counts below 0.10 x 10(9)/L (100/mm(3)).

- **Patient classification and treatment**:
	- A total of 218 good-risk patients (HIV score 0) received ACVBP (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, and prednisolone) or CHOP (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone); 177 intermediate-risk patients (HIV score 1) received CHOP or low-dose CHOP (Ld-CHOP); and 90 poor-risk patients (HIV score 2–3) received Ld-CHOP or VS (vincristine and steroid).

- **Overall survival (OS) rates**:
	- The 5-year overall survival in the good-risk group was 51% for ACVBP versus 47% for CHOP (P = 0.85); in the intermediate-risk group, 28% for CHOP versus 24% for Ld-CHOP (P = 0.19); and in the poor-risk group, 11% for Ld-CHOP versus 3% for VS (P = 0.14).

The time-dependent Cox model demonstrated that the only significant factors for OS were HAART (relative risk [RR] 1.6, P < .001), HIV score (RR 1.7, P < .001), and the International Prognostic Index (IPI) score (RR 1.5, P < .001), but not the chemotherapy regimen. Our findings indicate that in ARL patients, HIV score, IPI score, and HAART affect survival, but not the intensity of the CHOP-based chemotherapy.

### Nebupent [^112HCf9Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

NebuPent is indicated for the prevention of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in high-risk, HIV-infected patients defined by one or both of the following criteria: a history of one or more episodes of PJP or a peripheral CD4+ (T4 helper/inducer) lymphocyte count less than or equal to 200/mm³. These indications are based on the results of an 18-month randomized, dose-response trial in high-risk, HIV-infected patients and on existing epidemiological data from natural history studies.

The controlled trial's patient population consisted of 408 patients, 237 of whom had a history of one or more episodes of PJP. The remaining patients without a history of PJP included 55 patients with Kaposi's sarcoma and 116 patients with other AIDS diagnoses, ARC, or asymptomatic HIV infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive NebuPent via the Respirgard® II nebulizer at one of the following three doses: 30 mg every two weeks (n = 135), 150 mg every two weeks (n = 134), or 300 mg every four weeks (n = 139). The results of the trial demonstrated a significant protective effect (p < 0.01) against PJP with the 300 mg every four-week dosage regimen compared to the 30 mg every two-week dosage regimen. The 300 mg dose regimen reduced the risk of developing PJP by 50 to 70% compared to the 30 mg regimen. A total of 293 patients (72% of all patients) also received zidovudine at some time during the trial. The analysis of the data demonstrated the efficacy of the 300 mg dose even after adjusting for the effect of zidovudine.

### Incidence and risk factors for relapses in HIV-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma as observed in the German HIV-related lymphoma cohort study [^1133okYU]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Since the chemotherapy regimen (R-CHOP or GMALL) seems to be critical for relapse-free survival (RFS), we investigated the frequency of treatment reduction (either in the number of chemotherapy cycles or in the treatment intensity) or delays during treatment among all patients with aggressive B-NHL. The results of the dose intensity analysis are displayed in Online Supplementary Table S3. Overall, 32.7% of patients experienced a treatment delay, 13.8% had dose reductions, and 16.5% underwent fewer chemotherapy cycles. Only 37.0% received their full planned course of therapy.

Patients who experienced treatment delays, dose reductions, or reduced numbers of chemotherapy cycles were significantly older (42 vs. 45 years; P = 0.042) and more likely to have been administered the GMALL protocol compared to patients who completed the full course of therapy (P < 0.001) (Online Supplementary Table S3). Overall, 86.2% of patients with CD20+ lymphomas received rituximab. There was no difference in the relapse rate between patients with or without rituximab administration (P = 0.75), and our results were consistent even when patients without rituximab were excluded (data not shown).

- **Factors influencing the RFS**: To investigate the effects of different factors, including treatment reduction or delay on 5-year RFS (5yRFS), we studied two specific groups: patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) receiving R-CHOP regimens, and patients with Burkitt lymphoma (BL) receiving the GMALL regimen (see also Figure 1). In DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP, a high International Prognostic Index (IPI), an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), st…

### Cystatin C in HIV-infected patients: Promising but not yet ready for prime time [^112L2Ro7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

With the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy, chronic kidney disease has become a prominent cause of morbidity in individuals infected by HIV. Because serum creatinine has significant limitations in this specific population, cystatin C is emerging as a promising biomarker for both the evaluation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the detection of drug-induced kidney injury. Along with renal function, serum cystatin C concentration is associated with several biological parameters such as C-reactive protein, HIV viral load, and CD4+ cell count. All these determinants of cystatin C are, however, more or less independent of GFR.

Studies evaluating the accuracy of cystatin C for estimating GFR in the setting of HIV infection are scarce, and their methodology is often questionable due to lack of a reference method or inadequate statistical analyses. Thus far, data are insufficient to encourage the use of cystatin C or cystatin C-based equations to estimate GFR in the HIV-infected population. Further research is needed to explore the clinical utility of cystatin C in this setting. Beyond the use of cystatin C as a GFR marker, future studies will have to evaluate its role as a predictor of patient outcomes, particularly regarding cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

### Trogarzo [^116Q18ho]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a reproductive study conducted on monkeys, reversible decreases in CD4+ T cells and B cells, along with increases in CD8+ T cells, were observed within the first four weeks after birth in infants born to pregnant monkeys receiving ibalizumab-uiyk intravenously. Lymphocyte counts returned to near-normal levels by three months of age. One infant monkey died from a systemic viral infection that may be related to ibalizumab-uiyk-induced immunosuppression. No malformations or premature births were observed in this study.

- **Clinical considerations**: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester. Administration of Trogarzo during pregnancy may affect immune responses in the in utero-exposed infant. For infants with perinatal exposure to Trogarzo, immune phenotyping of the peripheral blood, including CD4+ T cell and B cell counts, is recommended. Expert consultation is also recommended to provide guidance on monitoring and management, such as the need for antibiotic or immunoprophylaxis of exposed infants based on the degree of immunosuppression observed. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in exposed infants is unknown.

- **Data**: In an enhanced pre- and post-natal development (ePPND) study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered intravenous doses of either vehicle or 110 mg/kg ibalizumab-uiyk every week from gestation day 20–22 until parturition on gestation day 160 ± 10. Significant changes in infant…

### Treatment factors affecting outcomes in HIV-associated non-Hodgkin lymphomas: A pooled analysis of 1546 patients [^1146rjH6]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Limited comparative data exist for the treatment of HIV-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We analyzed pooled individual patient data for 1,546 patients from 19 prospective clinical trials to assess treatment-specific factors — such as the type of chemotherapy, rituximab, and combination antiretroviral (cART) use — and their influence on the outcomes of complete response (CR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

- **Rituximab**: In our analysis, rituximab was associated with a higher CR rate (odds ratio [OR] 2.89; P < .001), improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.50; P < .001), and OS (HR 0.51; P < .0001).

- **Chemotherapy**: Compared with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), initial therapy with more dose-intense regimens resulted in better CR rates with ACVBP (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, and prednisolone) showing an OR of 1.70 (P < .04), improved PFS with ACVBP (HR 0.72; p = 0.049) and "intensive regimens" (HR 0.35; P < .001), and improved OS with "intensive regimens" (HR 0.54; P < .001).

- **EPOCH regimen**: Infusional etoposide, prednisone, infusional vincristine, infusional doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (EPOCH) were associated with significantly better OS in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (HR 0.33; p = 0.03).

- **Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)**: The use of cART was associated with improved CR rates (OR 1.89; p = 0.005) and showed a trend toward improved OS (HR 0.78; p = 0.07).

These findings provide supporting evidence for patterns of care where definitive evidence is unavailable.

### Cell-intrinsic CD4 T cell tolerance: A new frontier in therapy [^116HHy8A]. Trends in Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

CD4 T cell tolerance is essential for immune homeostasis, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Although regulatory T cells (Tregs) mediate T cell-extrinsic tolerance, this review emphasizes the CD4 T cell-intrinsic pathways — anergy and exhaustion — that are triggered by suboptimal or persistent antigen stimulation. These states share transcriptional and epigenomic features across contexts such as cancer, pregnancy, and transplantation. Instead of being distinct, they form a spectrum of tolerance with potential for therapeutic targeting. CD154 has re-emerged as a promising target, although memory T cell tolerization remains challenging. A deeper understanding of what sustains or reverses CD4 T cell tolerance is key to designing treatments that induce or maintain tolerance in autoimmunity and transplantation, or restore functionality in cancer and chronic infection.

### Zidovudine [^115VJfki]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hematologic toxicity/bone marrow suppression**: Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise, evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells per mm³ or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g per dL. Hematologic toxicities appear to be related to pretreatment bone marrow reserve and to the dose and duration of therapy. In patients with advanced symptomatic HIV-1 disease, anemia and neutropenia were the most significant adverse events observed. For patients experiencing hematologic toxicity, a reduction in hemoglobin may occur as early as 2 to 4 weeks, while neutropenia usually occurs after 6 to 8 weeks. There have been reports of pancytopenia associated with the use of zidovudine, which was reversible in most instances after discontinuance of the drug. Significant anemia, often requiring dose adjustment, discontinuation of zidovudine, and/or blood transfusions, has occurred during treatment with zidovudine alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals.

	- Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended to detect severe anemia or neutropenia in patients with poor bone marrow reserve, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with zidovudine. For HIV-1-infected individuals and patients with asymptomatic or early HIV-1 disease, periodic blood counts are recommended. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Myopathy**: Myopathy and myositis with pathological changes, similar to those produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with the use of zidovudine.

### Update on the treatment of HIV-associated hematologic malignancies [^113s2DgL]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

HIV is associated with an excess cancer risk, particularly of lymphoid malignancies. Modern therapeutics have changed the landscape of HIV disease, and typical opportunistic complications of AIDS are now largely avoided. Although the risk of lymphoma has decreased, it still remains high. Nevertheless, treatment outcomes have improved due to advancements in both HIV medicine and cancer therapeutics for the common lymphomas occurring in those with HIV infection.

Other hematologic malignancies are rarely seen in HIV-infected patients, but the standardized risk ratio for many of these cancers is higher than in the background population. Principles of cancer care and an appreciation for HIV infection as a comorbid condition can guide physicians in setting realistic goals and treatments for this patient population. In many cases, expected outcomes are very similar to HIV-unrelated patients, and therapeutic planning should be based on this understanding.

Treatment tolerance can be predicted based on the status of the HIV disease and the cancer therapy being administered. For those hematologic cancers in which transplantation is part of standard care, this modality should be considered an option in those with HIV infection.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^112JLUjR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Includes confirmed viral rebound and failure to achieve confirmed ≤ 100,000 copies/mL and CD4+ cell count (< or ≥ 200 cells/mm³). Through 144 weeks of therapy, 62% and 58% of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and stavudine arms, respectively, achieved and maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. The mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count was 263 cells/mm³ for the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets arm and 283 cells/mm³ for the stavudine arm.

Through 144 weeks, 11 subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and 9 subjects in the stavudine group experienced a new CDC Class C event.

Study 934 reports data through 144 weeks from a randomized, open-label, active-controlled multicenter trial. This study compared emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets administered in combination with efavirenz versus zidovudine/lamivudine fixed-dose combination administered with efavirenz in 511 antiretroviral-naïve subjects. From Weeks 96 to 144 of the trial, subjects received a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir DF with efavirenz in place of emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets with efavirenz. Subjects had a measurable response.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine effectiveness among a population-based cohort of people living with HIV [^113GdwTa]. AIDS (2022). High credibility.

People with HIV were underrepresented in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine clinical trials. We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection for the BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and ChAdOx1 vaccines among a population-based cohort of people with HIV in Ontario, Canada.

- **Design**: Test-negative design.

- **Methods**: We identified people with HIV aged ≥ 19 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR between December 14, 2020 (first availability of COVID-19 vaccines) and November 21, 2021 (pre-Omicron circulation). Outcomes included any infection, symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalization/death. We compared the odds of vaccination between test-positive cases and test-negative controls using multivariable logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, region, calendar time, SARS-CoV-2 test histories, influenza vaccination, comorbidities, and neighborhood-level socio-economic status. VE was derived as (1 – adjusted odds ratio) × 100%.

- **Results**: Among 21,023 adults living with HIV, there were 801 (8.3%) test-positive cases and 8,879 (91.7%) test-negative controls. 20.1% of cases and 47.8% of controls received ≥ 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose; among two-dose recipients, 93.4% received ≥ 1 mRNA dose. Two-dose VE ≥ 7 days before specimen collection was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74–87%) against any infection, 94% (95% CI = 82–98%) against symptomatic infection, and 97% (95% CI = 85–100%) against hospitalization/death. Against any infection, VE declined from 86% (95% CI = 77–92%) within

### HIV-1 low-level viremia predicts viral failure in participants on antiretroviral therapy in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study [^113Xzyc7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

- **Schematic depiction of low-level viremia (LLV)**: This section illustrates the definition of LLV, showing examples of how the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Black dots represent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral RNA measurements. A fixed window size of 90 days was used, starting the analysis at the first HIV RNA measurement that occurred 180 days after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART).

- **AUC calculation**: The AUC per window was calculated by interpolating the viral RNA measurements. The last value of each window was carried forward to the end of the corresponding window, illustrated in the teal area for each window. The first window where viral failure was observed — indicated by an interpolated value of ≥ 200 copies/mL (see window 6) — was omitted. Viral failure was thus assigned to the end of the last window with values 500/µL.

- **Body mass index and HIV subtypes**: Body mass index was categorized as 25, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. HIV subtypes were determined using the COMET and REGA tools; if results differed, the subtype with higher support was assigned. Subtypes were grouped as B, A, C, AE, AG, or other.

- **Self-reported adherence**: Self-reported adherence was classified as optimal, suboptimal with ≤ 1 ART dose missed per month, and poor with > 1 ART dose missed per week. Pre-ART HIV RNA levels were categorized as < 10,000, 10,000–50,000, and 50,001–200,000.

### Durable remissions with autologous stem cell transplantation for high-risk HIV-associated lymphomas [^116iaWKu]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

The treatment of HIV-associated lymphoma has evolved since the widespread adoption of highly active antiretroviral therapy. HIV-infected individuals are now able to tolerate more intensive chemotherapy because they possess better hematologic reserves and face fewer infections. As a result, there have been higher response rates in patients with HIV-associated Hodgkin disease (HD) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) treated with chemotherapy alongside antiretroviral therapy. However, salvage chemotherapy still offers little chance of long-term survival for patients with refractory or relapsed disease.

In non-HIV settings, patients with relapsed Hodgkin disease (HD) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have a better chance of achieving long-term remission with high-dose chemotherapy coupled with autologous stem cell rescue (ASCT) compared to conventional salvage chemotherapy. In a prior report, we demonstrated that this approach is well tolerated in patients with underlying immunodeficiency stemming from HIV infection. Furthermore, similar engraftment rates to those in non-HIV settings and low infectious risks have been observed.

Herein, we expand upon this early experience with the largest single-institution series of 20 patients. With long-term follow-up, we demonstrate that ASCT can lead to an 85% progression-free survival. This finding suggests that ASCT may be potentially curative in select patients with relapsed HIV-associated HD or NHL.

### Interleukin-2 as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive adults [^111Ke1sx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

- **Summary of main results**: We identified 25 trials that met our inclusion criteria. The number of participants in the included trials varied from nine to 4111 participants. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) doses and the duration of follow-up varied across the included trials. We judged the risk of bias due to the methodological quality of the included studies to be low. There was no significant difference in mortality whether IL-2 was added to the ART regimen or not (high certainty evidence). There was a significant increase in CD4 cell count in the IL-2 group in most of the included trials (high certainty evidence). There was no statistically significant difference between viral load in both groups for measures less than 50 copies/mL or 500 copies/mL in most trials (high certainty evidence). IL-2 probably causes an increase in adverse effects, particularly grade 3 or 4 adverse effects (moderate certainty evidence). Most of the included trials reported similar adverse events; neutropenia and myalgia were most commonly reported. There is probably no difference in the incidence of opportunistic infections in the IL-2 and control groups (low certainty evidence). Adherence was not reported in any of the included trials.

- **Overall completeness and applicability of evidence**: We conducted a comprehensive search and included all relevant trials regardless of whether they reported the review's outcomes of interest. Most included trials excluded participants who were previously on immunomodulators or steroids, or with an autoimmune disease, or with malignancy requiring them to be on immunom.

### Severe renal dysfunction and risk factors associated with renal impairment in HIV-infected adults in Africa initiating antiretroviral therapy [^112WFQWT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

We sought to investigate renal function in previously untreated symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults with CD4(+) cell counts of ≤ 200 cells/mm³. These patients were starting antiretroviral therapy (ART). Specifically, baseline characteristics and risk factors were assessed for both moderate (eGFR of ≥ 30 but < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) and severe (< 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) impairments in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). First-line ART regimens included zidovudine-lamivudine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (for 74% of patients), nevirapine (16%), and abacavir (9%), mostly nonrandomized allocation. After ART initiation, the median eGFR remained stable at 89–91 mL/min/1.73 m² for the period from week 4 through week 96. Fifty-two participants (1.6%) developed severe renal dysfunction.

### Cervical cancer treatment in HIV-positive patients: A survey of treatment practices in India [^1116p7jG]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

The CD4 cell count was cited as an important parameter for deciding on both radiotherapy schedules and concurrent chemotherapy. The risk for opportunistic infections increases as CD4 cell counts drop to < 200 cells/mm3. Sixty-one respondents reported omitting concurrent chemotherapy if the CD4 cell counts were < 200 cells/mm3. Surprisingly, one-third of respondents preferred to modify the radiotherapy schedule as well in patients with lower CD4 cell counts, probably because of concerns about treatment compliance. Previous studies have shown that patients on ART are more likely to tolerate chemoradiation. Hence, the management of these patients essentially involves coordination among oncologists and HIV physicians.

In our survey, 17% of respondents did not routinely check CD4 cell counts or HIV viral loads before initiating cervical cancer–directed therapy. This suggests that one of five respondents was not well-informed regarding management algorithms or clinically acceptable workflow for simultaneous management of HIV and cervical cancer in their patient population. For inexplicable reasons, 6% of respondents do not routinely refer patients to ART clinics before starting treatment. It is particularly concerning that as many as 50% of respondents believed that ART should be started only after CD4 counts drop, even when guidelines recommend the initiation of ART regardless of CD4 cell counts in patients with HIV. This clearly highlights the gaps in knowledge among oncologists in India regarding HIV management in patients with cervical cancer and an urgent need for improvement.

### The changing landscape of lymphoma associated with HIV infection [^113wAkfT]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Low credibility.

In the pre-cART era, the NHL risk was 25- to 150-fold higher in HIV-infected patients than in the general population. There is no doubt that the availability of cART significantly improved the prognosis of patients with HIV lymphoma. For example, comparing the pre-cART era with the cART era, the 2-year overall survival (OS) in patients with DLBCL increased from 24% to 67%. In BL, 2-year OS increased from 37% to 75%. However, these impressive results have not been observed in all lymphoma subtypes. In a small cohort of patients with PEL, OS improved marginally from 33% to 40% between the two eras.

A delayed introduction of cART has been shown to significantly increase the risk of developing HIV lymphoma. Initiation of cART should be prompt, irrespective of the CD4 cell count and independent of whether chemotherapy is planned or not. There is no reason to delay cART because of chemotherapy, including high-dose chemotherapy. However, this does not mean that interactions can be ignored. Integrase inhibitors bear advantages concerning drug-drug interactions and confer a faster decline of the viremia. By contrast, CYP3A4-inhibitors such as ritonavir and cobicistat-containing regimens should be avoided when possible to prevent severe adverse effects.

- **Factors influencing therapy**: Important factors that may influence the treatment of HIV-associated lymphomas include ART, ECOG, and IPI.

### Dose-response relationship between methadone dose and adherence to antiretroviral therapy among HIV-positive people who use illicit opioids [^111XqWfC]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

For HIV-positive individuals who use illicit opioids, engagement in methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) can contribute to improved HIV treatment outcomes. However, to our knowledge, the role of methadone dosing in adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has not yet been investigated. We sought to examine the relationship between methadone dose and ART adherence among a cohort of people who use illicit opioids.

- **Design and setting**: We used data from the AIDS Care Cohort to Evaluate Access to Survival Services (ACCESS) study, an ongoing prospective observational cohort of HIV-positive people who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada. This study is linked confidentially to comprehensive HIV treatment data in a setting of universal no-cost medical care, including medications. We evaluated the longitudinal relationship between methadone dose and the likelihood of ≥ 95% adherence to ART among ART-exposed participants during periods of engagement in MMT.

- **Participants**: Two hundred and ninety-seven ART-exposed individuals on MMT were recruited between December 2005 and May 2013 and followed for a median of 42.1 months.

- **Measurements**: We measured methadone dose at ≥ 100 versus < 100 mg/day and the likelihood of ≥ 95% adherence to ART.

- **Findings**: In adjusted generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses, MMT dose ≥ 100 mg/day was associated independently with optimal adherence to ART [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08–1.77]. In a subanalysis, we observed a dose-response relationship between increasing MMT dose and ART adherence (AOR = 1.06 per 20 mg/day).

### Antiretrovirals and the kidney in current clinical practice: Renal pharmacokinetics, alterations of renal function and renal toxicity [^116o9hBo]. AIDS (2014). Low credibility.

Assessment of renal function in HIV-positive patients is of increasing importance in the context of aging and associated comorbidities. Exposure to nephrotoxic medications is widespread, and several commonly used antiretroviral drugs have nephrotoxic potential. Moreover, specific antiretrovirals inhibit renal tubular transporters, resulting in the potential for drug-drug interactions as well as increases in serum creatinine concentrations. These increases can affect estimates of glomerular filtration rate in the absence of changes in the actual glomerular filtration rate. This review explores the effects of antiretroviral therapy on the kidney and offers an understanding of mechanisms that lead to apparent and real changes in renal function.

### Cancer care for transgender and gender-diverse people: Practical, literature-driven recommendations from the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer [^111Gdm7W]. CA (2024). Low credibility.

Extrapolating from the observations in patients with human immunodeficiency virus, laboratory values should be interpreted in the context of GAHT in TGD individuals. The duration of GAHT, the dose, and the route of administration should be recorded. For those on GAHT for more than 1 year, many laboratory values should generally be interpreted based on their affirmed gender (Table 3). For those who are newly initiated on hormone therapy for less than 1 year, it is important to understand that the values may change over time. For those who have stopped GAHT, within 3 months, laboratory values typically reflect their sex assigned at birth.

With respect to renal function, GAHT can result in alterations in body mass index, muscle mass, and fat mass. These changes may ultimately reflect changes in body composition, volume of distribution, and, ultimately, the generation of creatinine. Estimates suggest that a TGD person on testosterone for at least 1 year manifests a nearly 4‐kg increase in lean body mass, whereas a TGD person on estradiol has a 2.4‐kg decrease. Based on these changes, Turino Miranda and colleagues proposed a framework to evaluate kidney function in TGD individuals and advocated for the use of cystatin C because it is less dependent on both muscle mass and dietary intake. Hence, its use for calculating the estimated glomerular filtration rate may depend less on the sex/gender covariate (male vs. female). Because some factors, such as older age, obesity, and cigarette smoking, influence cystatin C, caution should be raised.

### Rituximab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in HIV-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma: A pooled analysis of 15 prospective studies [^111k8FdS]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

In HIV-positive patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), no benefit of adding rituximab to chemotherapy was seen in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We performed a meta-analysis of prospective studies to ascertain outcomes in HIV-positive NHL patients treated with chemotherapy (chemo) versus rituximab and chemo (R-chemo). A literature search through September 2011 was performed using the key search "(HIV OR AIDS) AND lymphoma". The main outcomes were overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CRR), and 2-year overall survival (OS) and are reported as non-adjusted odds ratio (OR). We identified 15 prospective studies including 1,060 HIV-positive NHL patients: 675 treated with chemo and 385 with R-chemo.

There was a higher proportion of HAART in R-chemo patients (82% vs. 68%; p < 0.01) but there were no differences in the proportion of patients with advanced stage or high/high-intermediate age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (aaIPI) scores. Meta-analysis showed the OR for ORR, CRR, and 2-year OS in patients treated with R-chemo was 1.39 (95% CI 0.79–2.47; p = 0.26), 1.66 (95% CI 0.98–2.82; p = 0.06), and 2.19 (95% CI 1.68–2.86; p < 0.001), respectively. HIV-positive lymphoma patients treated with R-chemo had higher odds for CR and 2-year OS when compared to chemo but also had a higher proportion of HAART usage.

### Outcomes of cervical cancer in HIV-positive women treated with radiotherapy at a tertiary care center in India [^117R5F6t]. JCO Global Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

CD4 counts have been an important parameter for determining immune status in HIV-positive patients. In our study, only 71% of patients planned for curative treatment could be prescribed concurrent chemotherapy. A CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm³ was considered to be the most common reason for not planning chemotherapy. Similarly, a study by Simonds et al. revealed that only 61% of their HIV-positive patients were prescribed chemoradiation, and the authors cited the same reason for not planning chemotherapy in most of their patients.

Although the data regarding the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to definitive radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm³ are lacking, chemotherapy has usually been omitted in most of the studies due to concerns regarding tolerability in those patients. Furthermore, in the study, a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm³ was found to be associated with adverse disease-free survival (DFS) on univariate analysis. Hence, it is crucial to optimize antiretroviral therapy (ART) and maintain the CD4 count level to plan effective cancer treatment strategies.

### Roctavian [^117WgVEx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In clinical studies of Roctavian, the efficacy and safety for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients have not been determined, as only three HIV-infected patients were treated. Among them, one developed hepatocellular injury, which resolved and was attributed to the concomitant administration of the antiretroviral drug efavirenz [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

- **Factor VIII inhibitors**: The safety and effectiveness of Roctavian in patients with prior or active factor VIII inhibitors have not been established [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)]. Patients with active factor VIII inhibitors should avoid Roctavian. Post-administration, patients should be monitored for factor VIII inhibitor development through clinical observations and laboratory tests [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Hepatic impairment**: The safety and effectiveness of Roctavian in patients with hepatic impairment have not been established. Clinical studies excluded patients with known hepatic cirrhosis, significant fibrosis (stage 3 or 4 on the Batts-Ludwig scale or equivalent), Hepatitis B or C, or a history of hepatic malignancy. No dose adjustments can be recommended for these patients.

- **Renal impairment**: The safety and effectiveness of Roctavian in patients with renal impairment have not been established. No dose adjustments are recommended for these patients.

### Aids-related malignancies: State of the art and therapeutic challenges [^115wLwPy]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Despite the impact of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on HIV-related mortality, malignancy remains an important cause of death in the current era. Although the advent of cART has resulted in reductions in the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-AIDS-defining malignancies present an increased risk for HIV-infected patients. These malignancies are characterized by common clinical features, generally displaying more aggressive behavior and more advanced disease at diagnosis, leading to poorer patient outcomes.

Specific therapeutic recommendations are lacking for new nonopportunistic malignancies, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, anal cancer, lung cancer, hepatocarcinoma, and many others. Antiretroviral agents have a propensity for causing drug interactions due to their ability to either inhibit or induce the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. Since many antineoplastic drugs are also metabolized by the CYP system, coadministration with cART could result in drug accumulation and increased toxicity, or decreased efficacy of one or both classes of drugs. Further research is necessary to delineate the combined safety and pharmacokinetics of antiretrovirals and antineoplastic therapy.

Special considerations of these AIDS-related and non-AIDS-related malignancies, as well as their clinical and therapeutic aspects, constitute the subject of this review.

### Efficacy and safety of three second-line antiretroviral regimens in HIV-infected patients in Africa [^117GKXBZ]. AIDS (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical outcomes and safety were evaluated in this study. Eighty-seven HIV-related events were observed in 70 participants (16%), primarily within the first three months of initiating second-line treatment. Only two events were classified as stage 4, specifically extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. Within the 48-week study period, six patients (1%) died. Among them, one succumbed to liver cancer, and another to severe tuberculosis (TB). The remaining four mortalities, occurring at home, were of unknown causes. Two of these patients were in the ABC/ddI arm, but the brevity of treatment — just 3 to 4 days before death — ruled out a hypersensitivity reaction to ABC.

Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were noted in 58 patients (13%), with no significant difference between the treatment groups. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was necessary for five patients: one due to a suspected ABC reaction, which was unconfirmed upon expert review, one in the DRV group due to severe kidney failure unrelated to the study drug, two due to progressive neuropathy in patients already suffering from stavudine-related neuropathic pain, and one patient requested to decrease pill burden while on TB treatment in the ABC/ddI group.

Gastrointestinal complaints were prevalent, with significant differences observed between the DRV/r and LPV/r groups [26 patients (17%) versus 48 and 50 patients (33%); P = 0.001]. Neuropathy symptoms were reported by 24 participants (5%), primarily present from baseline, with 11 in the ABC/ddI group. No statistically significant differences were found across groups concerning liver and kidney toxicity. Only one patient exhibited increased alanine aminotransferase levels exceeding five times the upper limit of normal. Furthermore, 61 participants (14%) experienced a 25% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR - Cockcroft-Gault equation).

### B-cell depletion reveals a role for antibodies in the control of chronic HIV-1 infection [^113MJuUZ]. Nature Communications (2010). Low credibility.

The impact of B-cell depletion on neutralizing antibody (NAb) titres is a key area of investigation. Following rituximab therapy, the subject's HIV-1 plasma viral load (pVL), previously stable, increased by more than 1.7 log10, peaking at 737,400 copies per mL four months after the final dose of rituximab. The pVL subsequently returned to baseline levels in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Therefore, we analyzed the impact of rituximab therapy on NAb titres in relation to viral dynamics.

Rituximab therapy led to a 30% reduction in total IgG levels, which reached their lowest point at the peak of virus load (10.8 g/l; normal range 8–16 g/l) and returned to pre-rituximab levels thereafter. To evaluate NAb activity throughout this period, we generated pseudoviruses derived from autologous envelope (env) sequences. Serum obtained before the first dose of rituximab potently neutralized virus pseudotyped with autologous envelope derived from plasma acquired two years previously (day 336 after seroconversion). The same serum neutralized contemporaneous autologous Env pseudotypes, although to a lesser extent, with 1:60 serum dilutions effectively blocking more than 90% infection.

Heterologous NAb activity was also observed against HXB2 and 8/12 Tier 2/3 clade-B reference strains (NIH, AIDS). Following rituximab therapy, we observed a marked decrease in neutralizing activity, characterized by a drop of more than threefold in IC50 serum titres against day 336 Env pseudotypes, which recovered over a four-month period. Strikingly, these changes coincided with the increase in pVL. Recovery of NAb responses correlated with a decrease in pVL.

### Low dose versus high dose stavudine for treating people with HIV infection [^117KPUs1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Stavudine remains a component of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-constrained countries due to its relatively low cost, despite the WHO recommendation for its phasing out as a strategy to reduce stavudine-associated toxicities. Where stavudine is still in use, it is recommended at a dose lower than the standard dose in order to reduce stavudine-related toxicity.

- **Objectives**: To compare the safety and virologic efficacy of low dose versus high dose stavudine for treating HIV-1 infection.

- **Search methods**: The comprehensive search strategy developed by the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group was used to identify randomised controlled trials that compared the use of low dose versus high dose stavudine. The last search was conducted in February 2014 and the searches covered the period from 1996 to 2014.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of low dose and high dose stavudine as part of ART combination therapy for treating adults.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently selected eligible trials, assessed the methodological quality of the included studies, and completed data extraction and analysis.

- **Main results**: The search identified 3952 abstracts, which were scanned for relevance. Three trials met the inclusion criteria (Milinkovic 2007; McComsey 2008; Sanchez-Conde 2005). All three trials were conducted in developed countries, participants were ART experienced, and all had sustained virologic suppression at baseline. A total of 157 participants were recruited for the trials. Sample sizes ranged from 24 to 92.

### Plasmablastic lymphoma: 2024 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management [^116Nc7CT]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). High credibility.

Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a rare CD20-negative aggressive lymphoma with a poor prognosis under standard treatment options. Although PBL is associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and other immunosuppressed states, it can also affect immunocompetent individuals.

- **Diagnosis**: The diagnosis requires a high clinical suspicion and pathological confirmation. EBER expression and MYC gene rearrangements are frequently detected. The differential diagnosis includes EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, extracavitary primary effusion lymphoma, ALK+ DLBCL, and HHV8+ large B-cell lymphoma, among others.

- **Risk stratification**: Age ≥ 60 years, advanced clinical stage, and high intermediate and high International Prognostic Index scores are associated with worse survival.

- **Management**: Combination chemotherapy regimens, such as EPOCH, are recommended. The addition of bortezomib, lenalidomide, or daratumumab might improve outcomes. Including PBL patients and their participation in prospective clinical trials is warranted.

### Chemotherapy rescues tumor-driven aberrant CD4+ T-cell differentiation and restores an activated polyfunctional helper phenotype [^113f24Nk]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

The functional development of tumor-specific CD4(+) T cells has a critical impact on the outcome of antitumor immune responses. Adoptive immunotherapy involving tumor-specific CD4(+) T cells has shown encouraging clinical benefits in some cancer patients. To mount an effective antitumor immunity, it is desirable to elicit activated type 1 T helper cells. Here, we report that type 1 T helper cell-like effector cells that arose in tumor-bearing hosts progressively expressed programmed death 1 during tumor growth. The programmed death 1(hi) effector cells displayed a dysfunctional phenotype, characterized by selective down-regulation of interleukin-7 receptor, heightened apoptosis, and poor antitumor efficacy.

This tumor-driven aberrant T-cell response could be prevented by a single dose of the widely used chemotherapy agent cyclophosphamide. We show that chemotherapy conditioned the host environment, creating a transient window for optimal effector differentiation for adoptively transferred CD4(+) T cells. This robust effector differentiation, which was antigen-driven and mechanistically dependent on an intact host response to type I interferon, gave rise to activated polyfunctional T helper cells with high interleukin-7 receptor, rapid clonal expansion, and potent antitumor activity against established B-cell lymphomas. We hypothesize that prevention of tumor-induced effector cell dysfunction is a major mechanism contributing to the efficacy of combined chemoimmunotherapy.

### Functional analysis of clinical response to low-dose IL-2 in patients with refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease [^116QpcQJ]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) have a paucity of regulatory CD4 T cells (CD4Tregs) that mediate peripheral tolerance. In clinical trials, daily low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been administered safely for prolonged periods in patients with steroid-refractory cGVHD. Peripheral CD4Tregs expand dramatically in all patients during IL-2 therapy, but clinical improvement was observed in approximately 50% of patients.

We examined the impact of low-dose IL-2 therapy on functional T-cell markers and the T-cell repertoire within CD4Tregs, conventional CD4 T cells (CD4Tcons), and CD8+ T cells. IL-2 had profound effects on CD4Tregs homeostasis in both response groups, including selective expansion of the naive subset, improved thymic output, and increased expression of Ki67, FOXP3, and B-cell lymphoma 2 within CD4Tregs. Similar changes were not seen in CD4Tcons or CD8 T cells.

Functionally, low-dose IL-2 enhanced, in vitro, CD4Treg-suppressive activity in both response groups, and all patient CD4Tcons were similarly suppressed by healthy donor CD4Tregs. High-throughput sequencing of the T-cell receptor β (TCRβ) locus demonstrated that low-dose IL-2 therapy increased TCR repertoire diversity and decreased evenness within CD4Tregs without affecting CD4Tcons or CD8 T cells. Using clone-tracking analysis, we observed rapid turnover of highly prevalent clones in CD4Tregs as well as the conversion of CD4Tcons to CD4Tregs.

After 12 weeks of daily IL-2, clinical responders had a greater influx of novel clones within the CD4Treg compartment compared with nonresponders.

### Update on HIV lymphoma [^116qhnJy]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

In industrialized nations, people infected with HIV remain at increased risk for malignancies despite highly active antiretroviral therapy. In these countries, lymphoma is the most common HIV-associated malignancy. This review summarizes progress from January 2005 to February 2007. The majority of investigations have been in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, with infusional therapy remaining promising but cumbersome. Rituximab likely improves complete response rates and possibly overall survival but is associated with increased infections in a subset of patients with very low CD4 counts. Biologic insights have been attained in the spectrum of HIV-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and virologic coinfections. Overall, the outcome for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma in the setting of HIV continues to improve as insights into the pathophysiology and treatment advance.

### Clinical trials for treatment and prevention of HIV-associated malignancies in Sub-Saharan Africa: Building capacity and overcoming barriers [^1178Edm6]. JCO Global Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of diseases. AIDS-defining lymphomas are aggressive B-cell NHLs, including diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and primary CNS lymphomas, among others. Additionally, the risk of other lymphomas, such as classic Hodgkin lymphoma, is increased in the presence of HIV. Like other malignancies discussed above, these lymphomas are often associated with viral infections, most commonly Epstein-Barr virus, which is detected in 30% to 100% of cases depending on the specific lymphoma subtype, and less commonly KSHV infection. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), lymphomas are a common malignancy, particularly among individuals under 60 years of age. Moreover, there is evidence showing that even with the increased availability and accessibility of ART, rates of lymphomas are increasing.

- **In high-resource settings**: Multiagent chemotherapy regimens combined with rituximab and ART have significantly improved overall survival across the wide spectrum of lymphomas, leading to similar outcomes irrespective of HIV infection status.
- **Challenges in SSA**: Given the difficulties in SSA with cost, logistical complexity, treatment-associated complications, and high levels of supportive care necessary to deliver the aforementioned therapies, implementation of these strategies remains challenging.

The only active HIV lymphoma trial we identified in SSA through our search was a randomized, phase II, multicenter trial developed by the AMC to compare an oral chemotherapy regimen with a standard intravenous cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine…

### Immune status and associated mortality after cancer treatment among individuals with HIV in the antiretroviral therapy era [^117NPPzm]. JAMA Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Immunologic decline associated with cancer treatment in people with HIV is not well characterized. Quantifying excess mortality associated with cancer treatment-related immunosuppression may help inform cancer treatment guidelines for persons with HIV.

- **Objective**: To estimate the association between cancer treatment and CD4 count and HIV RNA level in persons with HIV and between post-treatment CD4 count and HIV RNA trajectories and all-cause mortality.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This observational cohort study included 196 adults with HIV who had an incident first cancer and available cancer treatment data while in the care of The Johns Hopkins HIV Clinic from January 1, 1997, through March 1, 2016. The study hypothesized that chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in people with HIV would increase HIV RNA levels owing to treatment tolerability issues and would be associated with a larger initial decline in CD4 count and slower CD4 recovery compared with surgery or other treatment. An additional hypothesis was that these CD4 count declines would be associated with higher mortality independent of baseline CD4 count, antiretroviral therapy use, and risk due to the underlying cancer. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, through April 1, 2018.

- **Exposures**: Initial cancer treatment category (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy vs. surgery or other treatment).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Post-cancer treatment longitudinal CD4 count, longitudinal HIV RNA level, and all-cause mortality.

- **Results**: Among the 196 participants (135 [68.9%] male; median age, 50 [interquartile range]).

### Primary cutaneous CD4+ small- to medium-sized pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma: Temporary remission by oral doxycycline [^116wn1dn]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

In the recent World Health Organization-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer classification, primary cutaneous CD4+ small- to medium-sized pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma is listed as a provisional entity. This condition is histopathologically characterized by pleomorphic CD3+/CD4+/CD8-/CD30- T lymphocytes. Clinically, it presents as solitary tumors, mostly affecting the head and neck area, with an indolent clinical course and an estimated 5-year survival rate of about 60% to 80%. Current therapeutic options include topical or systemic treatment with glucocorticoids, local excision of solitary lesions, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (e.g. cyclophosphamide) in cases of aggressive clinical behavior or systemic disease.

We present the case of a 21-year-old female patient with a 5-year history of a solitary, slowly growing tumor on the right cheek. Histopathologic findings revealed a primary cutaneous CD4+ small- to medium-sized pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma with an admixture of numerous CD20+ B cells, representing almost half of the infiltrate. In this patient, we achieved a temporary (13 months) complete remission of the lymphoma through oral treatment with doxycycline monohydrate, 200 mg per day.

Doxycycline is a relatively nontoxic and well-tolerated oral agent and should be considered as a therapeutic option in primary cutaneous CD4+ small- to medium-sized pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma, especially in cases with a high percentage of B lymphocytes and no signs of systemic disease.
