## Question

Differential diagnosis of dyspnea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step approach to the differential diagnosis of dyspnea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and red flags. Then, I should categorize the dyspnea by acuity and likely organ systems. Next, I will prioritize life-threatening causes and outline a staged diagnostic workup. After that, I should consider special populations and common pitfalls, and finally synthesize a practical algorithm while double-checking the evidentiary support for each step and test threshold.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: airway, breathing, and circulation come first, and I need to ensure oxygenation, ventilatory status, and hemodynamics are addressed before anything else, because dyspnea is a symptom with potentially unstable physiology and high prognostic weight in acute care settings [^117AmvbA] [^111Z7ANP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should categorize the presentation by acuity and chronicity because that shapes the differential and testing sequence, with acute dyspnea demanding rapid exclusion of life threats and chronic dyspnea allowing a more methodical, staged evaluation, and I should remember that dyspnea is a subjective perceptual symptom requiring self-report and careful characterization of sensory qualities to guide mechanism-based thinking [^116oPAHD] [^115qXFxL].

> Next, I should review the major etiologic buckets to frame the differential: pulmonary, cardiac, hematologic, neuromuscular, metabolic, and psychogenic or systemic contributors, and I need to keep in mind that up to about 85% of chronic dyspnea is explained by a relatively small set of cardiopulmonary diagnoses, which helps me prioritize early testing and avoid premature closure [^111Yskpe] [^116zKGr4].

> I will now examine life-threatening causes that must be considered early in acute dyspnea: acute decompensated heart failure, pulmonary embolism, severe asthma or COPD exacerbation, pneumonia with sepsis, tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, and severe anemia; wait, let me verify the epidemiology and thresholds that guide testing, because normal vital signs do not reliably exclude serious disease and pretest probability should drive imaging and biomarker use [^115wYhX2] [^117NJHSG].

> For acute heart failure, I should confirm that BNP or NT-proBNP can expedite diagnosis when pretest probability is low to intermediate, but I need to remember that COPD and pneumonia can elevate natriuretic peptides, so higher thresholds are often needed in those contexts; lung ultrasound can markedly improve diagnostic accuracy for ADHF beyond clinical assessment and chest radiography, and I should double-check that the evidence supports its integration at the bedside [^116f11oz] [^116Eo8Xp] [^114Fst5N].

> For suspected pulmonary embolism, I should confirm that D-dimer is most useful to rule out PE in low-probability outpatients, whereas inpatients and older adults have poorer negative predictive value; I need to ensure I apply validated pretest probability tools and proceed to CTPA when indicated, recognizing that a negative CTPA often reveals alternative explanations such as pneumonia, edema, or effusion [^117NJHSG] [^115qc8pP] [^117DVngd].

> Let me consider COPD exacerbations carefully; GOLD endorses the Rome definition emphasizing dyspnea and/or cough and sputum worsening within 14 days, but I should verify that pneumonia, acute heart failure, and pulmonary embolism frequently mimic or complicate ECOPD, so I must actively search for these when the presentation is atypical or severe, using chest radiography, natriuretic peptides, and clinical probability for PE as appropriate [^111HmkaQ] [^114NhHvq] [^113wwWr9].

> I should confirm that tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis requiring immediate needle decompression; lung ultrasound can rapidly detect pneumothorax at the bedside and is particularly useful in the ICU or ED when time and transport are limiting, so I need to integrate POCUS early when pneumothorax is on the table [^113wi6F3].

> For severe anemia, I need to check hemoglobin or hematocrit early because reduced oxygen-carrying capacity can drive exertional dyspnea and is easily missed if I anchor on cardiopulmonary causes alone; this is a simple, high-yield test in the initial laboratory screen [^112QroCv].

> Now, regarding the initial diagnostic workup, let me verify the first-line tests that efficiently separate common causes: pulse oximetry, CBC, BMP, ECG, chest radiography, and spirometry when feasible; I should remember that no single test tracks dyspnea across all conditions, so results must be interpreted in clinical context and used to refine pretest probabilities rather than replace clinical judgment [^113nXVcu] [^116zKGr4].

> If first-line tests are inconclusive, I should double-check the role of second-line testing: natriuretic peptides for heart failure, D-dimer for PE when probability is low, echocardiography for valvular disease or HFpEF, and high-resolution CT for interstitial lung disease or complex parenchymal processes; I need to ensure I escalate testing in a staged fashion to minimize unnecessary procedures while maintaining diagnostic yield [^116zKGr4] [^113j1Uuh].

> But wait, what if the cause remains unclear after noninvasive testing; in that case, I should consider cardiopulmonary exercise testing to distinguish cardiac, pulmonary, neuromuscular, and deconditioning contributions, and I should remember that CPET is particularly helpful when multiple mechanisms are suspected or when exercise-related symptoms persist despite normal initial studies [^1117km6e] [^111x76rs].

> Let me think about special populations and contexts; in pregnancy and the peripartum period, I need to consider PPCM, cor triatriatum, and other cardiomyopathies, and I should maintain a low threshold for echocardiography given the potential for rapid deterioration; in COPD, I should actively screen for arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation, which is common and prognostically important; in children, I must tailor the differential to developmental airway anatomy and common viral etiologies while remaining open to immunologic or structural causes when the course is atypical [^1141LN9U] [^116DEVHD] [^115qc8pP] [^115WNc9C].

> I should confirm that I avoid common pitfalls: accepting a single cause when dyspnea is multifactorial, anchoring on a known diagnosis without verifying new features, and failing to reassess when treatment fails; dyspnea is often multifactorial in chronic disease, and mislabeling non-ECOPD events as COPD exacerbations can delay appropriate therapy and worsen outcomes [^111Yskpe] [^113wwWr9].

> Next, I should review how patient descriptors can guide mechanisms; chest tightness suggests bronchoconstriction, air hunger or inability to get a deep breath points to dynamic hyperinflation or restrictive mechanics, and effort or suffocation may reflect increased ventilatory drive or neuromuscular weakness; hold on, I should verify that cultural and linguistic differences can shape these descriptions, so I must interpret them cautiously and in context [^116oPAHD].

> I will now synthesize a practical algorithm: stabilize and assess severity; obtain a focused history and exam to assign pretest probabilities; perform first-line tests; if unrevealing, add targeted second-line tests based on leading hypotheses; if still undiagnosed, pursue CPET or specialty referral; throughout, I should continuously reassess and treat identified causes while monitoring response, because addressing the underlying driver is the most reliable way to relieve dyspnea [^116zKGr4] [^117AmvbA].

> Finally, I need to ensure my diagnostic thresholds and tools are evidence-aligned: use BNP primarily to rule out heart failure in low-to-intermediate probability settings, apply D-dimer judiciously for PE in outpatients with low probability, leverage lung ultrasound to improve ADHF discrimination, and remember that algorithmic approaches to chronic dyspnea can achieve high diagnostic yield with staged testing; I should double-check that each step is justified by the patient's pretest probability and clinical trajectory before proceeding [^116f11oz] [^117NJHSG] [^114Fst5N] [^112FEjf1].

Dyspnea has a broad differential, but **most cases are due to cardiac or pulmonary disease** [^116zKGr4] [^113j1Uuh]. A structured approach — history, exam, and targeted testing — is essential to identify the cause and guide therapy [^113nXVcu].

---

## Cardiac causes

- **Heart failure**: common; look for orthopnea, PND, JVD, edema, S3; BNP/NT-proBNP and echocardiography are key [^114FBcnb] [^116p3fuF].
- **Coronary artery disease**: exertional dyspnea with chest discomfort; ECG and troponins guide evaluation [^113qXGEN].
- **Valvular disease**: murmurs, orthopnea, fatigue; echocardiography is diagnostic [^115sXryv].
- **Arrhythmias**: palpitations, irregular pulse; ECG and telemetry are indicated [^115qc8pP].
- **Pericardial disease**: chest pain, muffled heart sounds; echocardiography is first-line [^115sXryv].

---

## Pulmonary causes

- **Obstructive lung disease**: COPD and asthma are common; wheezing, hyperinflation, and airflow limitation on spirometry support the diagnosis [^113qXGEN] [^117YL4cT].
- **Interstitial lung disease**: dry cough, crackles, restrictive pattern; HRCT is diagnostic [^113j1Uuh].
- **Pneumonia**: fever, productive cough, focal signs; chest radiography and clinical assessment guide management [^115iaYzu].
- **Pulmonary embolism**: sudden dyspnea, pleuritic pain, risk factors; D-dimer and CT pulmonary angiography are used [^117NJHSG] [^117DVngd].
- **Pneumothorax**: sudden unilateral pain, decreased breath sounds; chest radiography or ultrasound confirms [^113KBsgm].

---

## Hematologic causes

Hematologic causes include **anemia**, which reduces oxygen-carrying capacity and causes exertional dyspnea; the CBC is diagnostic [^112QroCv].

---

## Neuromuscular causes

Neuromuscular causes include **respiratory muscle weakness** from ALS, myasthenia gravis, or diaphragmatic paralysis; look for accessory muscle use, orthopnea, and low MIP/MEP [^115G9eh7].

---

## Metabolic and systemic causes

Metabolic and systemic causes include **metabolic acidosis** (e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis, renal failure), which increases ventilatory drive and presents with Kussmaul respirations, and **thyroid disease** — hyperthyroidism causes increased metabolic demand and dyspnea [^116DHAUM].

---

## Psychogenic causes

Psychogenic causes include **anxiety and panic disorders**, which can cause hyperventilation and dyspnea; this is a diagnosis of exclusion [^113KBsgm].

---

## Initial diagnostic evaluation

- **History and physical examination**: onset, duration, triggers, associated symptoms, smoking, occupational exposures, comorbidities; vital signs, lung and cardiac exam [^113nXVcu].
- **Basic tests**: CBC, electrolytes, renal function, ECG, chest radiography, pulse oximetry, spirometry [^116zKGr4].
- **Advanced tests**: echocardiography, BNP/NT-proBNP, D-dimer, CT chest, V/Q scan, cardiopulmonary exercise testing as indicated [^113qXGEN].

---

## Common pitfalls and challenges

Common pitfalls include **multifactorial dyspnea** — especially in COPD with heart failure or anxiety — and **overlap syndromes** such as asthma-COPD overlap or HFpEF, which complicate diagnosis and require careful evaluation [^114X6SDj] [^1111NMMw].

---

Dyspnea is most often cardiac or pulmonary; a **focused history, exam, and staged testing** identify the cause and direct therapy [^113nXVcu].

Background

Dyspnea is a common and ambiguous complaint that results in 3.4 million emergency department (ED) visits annually. While learners may encounter lists of differential diagnoses to consider while in training, often these lists are not empirically based. We sought to establish an evidence-based differential diagnosis for dyspnea and to determine whether normal vital signs can rule out a life-threatening diagnosis.

Methods

We analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2005 to 2014 for ED visits with a chief complaint of dyspnea and tallied the principal discharge diagnosis. We included 10,170 sampled ED visits by adults with a chief complaint of dyspnea, representing nearly 42 million visits nationally. We then calculated the most common principal discharge diagnoses by age group and the frequency of abnormal respiratory vital signs in cases with life-threatening diagnoses.

Results

The most represented age group was 45 to 64 years (31.6%). Most visits were discharged directly from the ED (57.5%), while 8.1% required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). The most common diagnosis in patients aged 18 to 44 was acute asthma exacerbation (14.8%). Obstructive chronic bronchitis was the most common specified diagnosis in both patients ages 45 to 64 (11.1%) and patients ages 65 to 79 (12.4%), while congestive heart failure was the most common for patients ages 80 and over (15.9%). Respiratory vital signs were frequently normal in the 44.6% of visits that resulted in a potentially life-threatening diagnosis but corresponded to increased ICU utilization when abnormal.

Conclusions

For patients with dyspnea, the high utilization of ICUs highlights the importance of an accurate differential. The frequencies established here can be used as pretest probabilities in Bayesian analysis to improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis lists.

### When the chief complaint is (or should be) dyspnea in adults [^111Yskpe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Dyspnea, "a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity", is an important and challenging complaint associated with a wide variety of adverse clinical outcomes, including hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac mortality. Although up to 85% of cases are caused by asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, congestive heart failure, or psychogenic disorders, a systematic approach can help to identity uncommon, but important, causes of dyspnea. In this review that includes clinical examples as well as a didactic review of currently available information, we suggest a step-wise approach to the evaluation of the adult patient with dyspnea. It is also important to avoid 3 possible pitfalls: accepting a cause for dyspnea in which the element identified is only part of a syndrome which includes that element; accepting a single cause for dyspnea when the cause is multifactorial; and failing to recognize a diagnosis and cause of dyspnea is incorrect and has been assumed without rigorous confirmation, when a patient with a specific diagnosis is referred for "failing to respond to treatment".

Initial Evaluation

A careful medical history and physical examination complemented by the rational measurement of objective variables can help establish, with a degree of certainty, that an ECOPD is the most likely diagnosis (Table 1), particularly in patients with mild events seen in the outpatient setting. However, in many patients, the signs and symptoms of an ECOPD (especially if more severe) are not specific, and other diseases may mimic an ECOPD and/or aggravate its clinical presentation (Figure 1). Most of these patients are seen in an acute care setting, and we developed an initial practical algorithm to help reach a more precise diagnosis (Figure 2).

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^116oPAHD]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea evaluation — clinical categories and diagnostic value of descriptors include two major patient categories: those with new onset of breathing discomfort for whom the underlying cause has not yet been determined and those with known cardiovascular, respiratory, or neuromuscular disease who are experiencing worsening dyspnea; for the former, evaluation focuses on discovering an underlying abnormality or diagnosis, and for the latter the goal is to discern deterioration of a known disorder or emergence of a new problem. In new-onset dyspnea, the history and physical examination remain the mainstays of diagnostic evaluation, and when diagnosis remains elusive, specialty referral (e.g., pulmonologist, cardiologist, or multidisciplinary dyspnea clinic) may help identify a potentially treatable underlying cause. In most cardiopulmonary diseases both increased ventilatory demand and altered ventilatory mechanics are present, whereas in some nonpathological circumstances (e.g., at altitude or during pregnancy) increased drive predominates; patient words or phrases describing the quality of breathing discomfort may provide insight into pathophysiological mechanisms, with chest tightness relatively specific for dyspnea due to bronchoconstriction, sensations of "air hunger" and "inability to get a deep breath" probably representing increased drive to breathe plus limited tidal volume and being common with dynamic hyperinflation and restrictive mechanics, and sensations of effort, suffocation, and rapid breathing characterizing CO2-induced panic attacks but being nonspecific; linguistic and cultural differences can affect symptom characterization, and some patients have difficulty grasping the concept of "quality" of their breathing sensations.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^113wwWr9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Combining a thorough clinical history and examination with currently available clinical biomarkers, most patients with COPD who have a classic presentation may be diagnosed with reasonable confidence as having an ECOPD. However, in other patients, acute decompensations of coexisting morbidities or the development of acute events such as acute HF, pneumonia, or PE can contribute to or cause those events. Thus, all patients with COPD who have worsening respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea without infective evidence, should be investigated for the frequent morbidities that may complicate those events. It is extremely important that trial planners adopt a more objectively supported system of determining the cause of admissions labeled as COPD exacerbations, given that prior trials may have incorrectly labeled hospitalized deteriorations as COPD exacerbations when, in fact, these events were driven by other comorbidities. With the knowledge and resources available to us, the time for precise diagnosis of these episodes is now.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^114X6SDj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer from acute episodes of worsening dyspnea, often associated with increased cough, sputum, and/or sputum purulence. These exacerbations of COPD (ECOPDs) impact health status, accelerate lung function decline, and increase the risk of hospitalization. Importantly, close to 20% of patients are readmitted within 30 days after hospital discharge, with great cost to the person and society. Approximately 25% and 65% of patients hospitalized for an ECOPD die within 1 and 5 years, respectively. Patients with COPD are usually older and frequently have concomitant chronic diseases, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, interstitial lung diseases, bronchiectasis, asthma, anxiety, and depression, and are also at increased risk of developing pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax. All of these morbidities not only increase the risk of subsequent ECOPDs but can also mimic or aggravate them. Importantly, close to 70% of readmissions after an ECOPD hospitalization result from decompensation of other morbidities. These observations suggest that in patients with COPD with worsening dyspnea but without the other classic characteristics of ECOPD, a careful search for these morbidities can help detect them and allow appropriate treatment. For most morbidities, a thorough clinical evaluation supplemented by appropriate clinical investigations can guide the healthcare provider to make a precise diagnosis. This perspective integrates the currently dispersed information available and provides a practical approach to patients with COPD complaining of worsening respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea. A systematic approach should help improve outcomes and the personal and societal cost of ECOPDs.

### Acute dyspnea in the office [^116DHAUM]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Respiratory difficulty is a common presenting complaint in the outpatient primary care setting. Because patients may first seek care by calling their physician's office, telephone triage plays a role in the early management of dyspnea. Once the patient is in the office, the initial goal of assessment is to determine the severity of the dyspnea with respect to the need for oxygenation and intubation. Unstable patients typically present with abnormal vital signs, altered mental status, hypoxia, or unstable arrhythmia, and require supplemental oxygen, intravenous access and, possibly, intubation. Subsequent management depends on the differential diagnosis established by a proper history, physical examination, and ancillary studies. Dyspnea is most commonly caused by respiratory and cardiac disorders. Other causes may be upper airway obstruction, metabolic acidosis, a psychogenic disorder, or a neuromuscular condition. Differential diagnoses in children include bronchiolitis, croup, epiglottitis, and foreign body aspiration. Pertinent history findings include cough, sore throat, chest pain, edema, and orthopnea. The physical examination should focus on vital signs and the heart, lungs, neck, and lower extremities. Significant physical signs are fever, rales, wheezing, cyanosis, stridor, or absent breath sounds. Diagnostic work-up includes pulse oximetry, complete blood count, electrocardiography, and chest radiography. If the patient is admitted to the emergency department or hospital, blood gases, ventilation-perfusion scan, D-dimer tests, and spiral computed tomography can help clarify the diagnosis. In a stable patient, management depends on the underlying etiology of the dyspnea.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^114xSWQk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is punctuated by acute worsening of dyspnea, often associated with increased cough, sputum volume, and/or purulence. These exacerbations of COPD (ECOPDs) worsen health status, accelerate lung function decline, and increase the risk of subsequent ECOPDs, hospitalization, and death.

Patients with COPD are usually older and have multiple morbidities, including heart failure (HF), ischemic heart disease (IHD), arrhythmias, interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), bronchiectasis, anxiety, and depression, all of which increase the risk of ECOPDs and death. Furthermore, the incidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism (PE), which can mimic and/or worsen an ECOPD, are frequent in these patients (,–). Approximately 25% and 65% of patients hospitalized for an ECOPD die within 1 and 5 years, respectively, mainly because of respiratory and cardiovascular complications, with close to 20% readmitted within 30 days after discharge. Importantly, close to 70% of these readmissions are because of decompensation of other morbidities.

We previously proposed an updated definition of ECOPDs that, in addition to symptom worsening, incorporates the measurement of six objective variables (respiratory and cardiac rate, oxygen saturation, dyspnea, C-reactive protein [CRP], and, when available, arterial blood gases) to determine ECOPD severity. In most patients, especially in the milder cases seen in primary care, a classic presentation may be confidently diagnosed as an ECOPD. However, in some, particularly the more severe cases seen in the acute care setting, decompensation of coexisting morbidities (particularly HF) or development of new morbidities (e.g. PE or pneumonia) can be confused with, or contribute to, ECOPDs.

Studies have shown that directed clinical evaluation (pretest probability) complemented with clinical investigations can help precise diagnoses. This review integrates the dispersed information from those studies to provide clinicians with a practical approach to patients with COPD who have worsening respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea, not explained by an ECOPD who are seen primarily in the acute care setting. Despite the concerns of potential adverse drug effects, a diagnosis of ECOPD should not alter the treatment of any associated morbidity, which should adhere to the general concept of guideline-directed medical treatment.

### Inflammatory biomarkers predicting prognosis in patients with acute dyspnea [^11552azS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

1.1 Background

Dyspnea is one of the most common symptoms at the emergency department (ED), accounting for approximately 3–4 million visits in the ED every year in the United States. The underlying differential diagnoses are diverse and range from conditions with high risk of mortality to virtually no risk of mortality at all. Chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common in patients with acute dyspnea as well as infections, pulmonary embolism, and anxiety disorders. Physical examination, history, laboratory work, and imaging techniques are used in assessing the cause. However, the identification of the correct diagnosis is just one step toward correctly treating the patient, and sometimes, the main underlying cause of acute dyspnea is not unmasked until during hospitalization or after the patient has left the ED. An equally important task for the physician at the ED is to make decisions of intensity of treatment and level of care, or follow-up in the case of hospital discharge. One of the key factors to take into account as a basis for these decisions is the patient's risk of long-term mortality.

Not only in infections but also in chronic diseases, for example, CHF and COPD, has inflammation been suggested be a part of the pathological processes. By definition, inflammation is a protective tissue response to injury or destruction of tissues, which aims at eliminating the injurious agent and the injured tissues. Clinically and epidemiologically, inflammation is usually estimated by measurement of circulating substances that are released as a cause or consequence of an inflammatory response, and the most widely used biomarker for inflammation is C-reactive protein (CRP). However, inflammation is a complex process, and the total variance of the wide range of inflammatory substances can only partially be explained by CRP.

Although the main cause of dyspnea is usually established within a few days of hospitalization, the physician in the ED is commonly subjected to a patient with little information except brief medical history and a state of acute dyspnea. Even in cases when the patient has one or several known diseases which can cause acute dyspnea, for example, CHF, COPD, and previous pneumonia, the main underlying cause and severity of the current episode could be difficult to assess. Therefore, we chose to study an unselected patient population with acute dyspnea.

Dyspnea epidemiology and healthcare utilization — population and clinical data show high burden, affecting "up to half of patients admitted to acute care, tertiary care hospitals" and "one quarter of ambulatory patients", with community prevalence "9 to 13%" among adults, "15 to 18%" among adults aged 40 years or older, and "25 to 37%" among adults aged 70 years and older; in the United States, dyspnea-related presentations account for "3 to 4 million emergency department visits annually".

### Evaluation of chronic dyspnea [^113j1Uuh]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic dyspnea is defined as dyspnea lasting more than one month. In approximately two thirds of patients presenting with dyspnea, the underlying cause is cardiopulmonary disease. Establishing an accurate diagnosis is essential because treatment differs depending on the underlying condition. Asthma, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, interstitial lung disease, and psychogenic causes account for 85 percent of patients with this principal symptom. The history and physical examination should guide selection of initial diagnostic tests such as electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, pulse oximetry, spirometry, complete blood count, and metabolic panel. If these are inconclusive, additional testing is indicated. Formal pulmonary function testing may be needed to establish a diagnosis of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or interstitial lung disease. High-resolution computed tomography is particularly useful for diagnosing interstitial lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, or pulmonary embolism. Echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide levels help establish a diagnosis of congestive heart failure. If the diagnosis remains unclear, additional tests may be required. These include ventilation perfusion scans, Holter monitoring, cardiac catheterization, esophageal pH monitoring, lung biopsy, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

(pulmonologist #1): In a patient presenting with dyspnea, fatigue, weight loss, and clubbing, these complaints may be signs of a chronic disease involving the respiratory tract. In addition, other causes, including cardiac causes and other organ system diseases, must be considered with these findings.

(pulmonologist#2): In the differential diagnosis of cardiac disease, we search for findings of pulmonary edema, elevated pulmonary artery or systemic blood pressure, and rhythm disorderfindings.

(pulmonologist#3): Tuberculosis, malignancy, and collagen tissue diseases are primarily includedin the differential diagnosis because of weight loss. The patient's sedimentation, C‐reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin (Hb), and leucocyte values were within normal limits. However, tuberculosis, pulmonary involvement of collagen tissue diseases, or interstitial lung disease may be investigatedin cases where findings related to the respiratory system are at the forefront. PFT and imagingmethods may be the next step for differential diagnosis.

### Chronic dyspnea: diagnosis and evaluation [^116zKGr4]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea is a symptom arising from a complex interplay of diseases and physiologic states and is commonly encountered in primary care. It is considered chronic if present for more than one month. As a symptom, dyspnea is a predictor for all-cause mortality. The likeliest causes of dyspnea are disease states involving the cardiac or pulmonary systems such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, pneumonia, and coronary artery disease. A detailed history and physical examination should begin the workup; results should drive testing. Approaching testing in stages beginning with first-line tests, including a complete blood count, basic chemistry panel, electrocardiography, chest radiography, spirometry, and pulse oximetry, is recommended. If no cause is identified, second-line noninvasive testing such as echocardiography, cardiac stress tests, pulmonary function tests, and computed tomography scan of the lungs is suggested. Final options include more invasive tests that should be done in collaboration with specialty help. There are three main treatment and management goals: correctly identify the underlying disease process and treat appropriately, optimize recovery, and improve the dyspnea symptoms. The six-minute walk test can be helpful in measuring the effect of ongoing intervention. Care of patients with chronic dyspnea typically requires a multidisciplinary approach, which makes the primary care physician ideal for management.

Primary care and cardiology roles in HFpEF pathway — Many individuals present first to primary care with dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and/or signs of congestion, and the primary care clinician should be aware of HFpEF in the differential diagnosis, order relevant testing, be able to initiate guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), and recognize when a cardiology referral may be useful; the cardiology specialist's role is to exclude an alternative diagnosis explaining dyspnea, edema, and preserved EF, optimize GDMT, and encourage clinical trials.

### Complexity in clinical diagnoses of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115u8DQz]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. The 2022 GOLD guidelines define AECOPD as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy. However, it is increasingly recognized that AECOPD is heterogenous. Exacerbations have a range of underlying etiologies and clinicopathological processes manifesting with similar syndromic phenotypes, each of which could have different prognosis and response to therapy. A diagnosis of AECOPD relies on subjective symptoms, and non-specific clinical features, which can be confounded by several associated comorbidities that are highly prevalent in the COPD population. It is not uncommon that COPD patients presenting with dyspnea receive a diagnosis of AECOPD, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure all in one setting. This ambiguity leads to a broad, complex, and potentially unnecessary treatment regimen.

We aimed to identify clinical, radiographic, and laboratory characteristics that might help distinguish AECOPD from symptoms secondary to another dominant disease in patients with a history of COPD.

### An adult cystic fibrosis patient presenting with persistent dyspnea: case report [^113K6MqM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Persistent dyspnea is a common finding in the cystic fibrosis patient that typically leads to further work up of an alternative pulmonary etiology. Adult cystic fibrosis patients; however, are growing in numbers and they are living into the ages in which coronary artery disease becomes prevalent. Coronary disease should be included in the consideration of diagnostic possibilities.

Case Presentation

A 52-year-old white male with cystic fibrosis was evaluated for exertional dyspnea associated with vague chest discomfort. Diagnostic testing revealed normal white blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet count, basic metabolic panel, fasting lipid profile, HbA1c, with chest radiograph confirming chronic cystic findings unchanged from prior radiographs and an electrocardiogram that revealed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block. Stress thallium testing demonstrated a reversible anteroseptal perfusion defect with a 55% left ventricular ejection fraction. Heart catheterization found a 99% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery extending into the two diagonal branches, with 100% obstruction of the left anterior descending artery at the trifurcation and 70% lesion affecting the first posterior lateral branch of the circumflex artery.

Conclusion

This case report represents the first description in the medical literature of a cystic fibrosis patient diagnosed with symptomatic coronary artery disease. Applying a standard clinical practice guide proved useful toward evaluating a differential diagnosis for a cystic fibrosis patient presenting with dyspnea and chest discomfort.

Synopsis of noncardiac chest pain — differential diagnosis is broad and includes respiratory, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, psychological, and other causes; musculoskeletal causes are the most common and include costochondritis, muscle strain, and consequences of recent or occult chest trauma such as rib fracture; gastrointestinal causes, commonly esophageal, include gastrointestinal reflux, esophageal dysmotility, and gastritis from either medications or peptic ulcer disease; respiratory causes are less frequent but potentially more serious and include PE, pneumonia, and pneumothorax; many patients will have dyspnea in addition to chest pain; psychological causes are usually diagnoses of exclusion but merit consideration in the right context.

### An adult cystic fibrosis patient presenting with persistent dyspnea: case report [^112X719A]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This is the first report of a cystic fibrosis patient diagnosed with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) and acknowledges that adult cystic fibrosis patients have indeed survived into the years were coronary artery disease becomes prevalent. Therefore, the likelihood of coronary disease should be included in the diagnostic consideration of persistent dyspnea associated with chest discomfort by applying the same standards used in grading a differential with an anginal presentation in non-CF patients.

The patient presented in this case had a Framingham score estimate that predicted a 10-year cardiovascular risk at 4%. However, because of the presence of subtle chest discomfort associated with dyspnea, medical decision making includes an active alternative diagnosis of atypical angina based on two of three positive criteria of exertional symptoms with symptom relief upon resting. Persistent dyspnea may be an occasional finding for a cystic fibrosis patient, and one that typically leads to further work up of a pulmonary etiology; however, cardiovascular disease was additionally considered in this patient.

The typical differential diagnosis of persistent dyspnea in an adult cystic fibrosis patient would include pneumothorax (5% prevalence), atypical mycobacterial pneumonia (15% prevalence), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (30% prevalence), and cor pulmonale (3% prevalence in association with severe CF pulmonary disease). Without a history for hemoptysis, atypical mycobacterium and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis would be less likely. Physical exam and chest radiograph did not support either pneumothorax or congestive heart failure. Symptoms could also be explained by this patient's progression of gastroesophageal reflux and/or Barrett's esophagus.

Atypical angina would be the most prevalent differential diagnosis, at 60%, for our patient's clinical presentation of chest pain in the non-CF male patient at this age. The risk of CAD is not typically considered as an active alternative diagnosis for the CF patient; yet with aging, even CF patients will be at risk for CAD. This risk may even be greater given higher prevalence of known risk factors such as diabetes mellitus in the CF versus non-CF patient.

### Asthma history and presentation [^115sRRNd]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is suspected from a history of key symptoms, including cough, wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness, and increased mucus production. A positive family or personal history of atopic diseases and diseases that are comorbid with asthma, such as allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, is also important. The differential diagnosis of asthma is broad and includes potentially life-threatening diseases. Pediatric asthma and psychiatric mimics require special attention to prevent misdiagnosis. Differentiating asthma from these other disease states by history alone is not always possible. Because accurate diagnosis is critical to successful treatment, objective testing by spirometry and methacholine challenge should be employed.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111HmkaQ]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Management of exacerbations — definition and differential diagnosis: An exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD) is defined as an event characterized by increased dyspnea and/or cough and sputum that worsens in < 14 days and is often associated with increased local and systemic inflammation caused by infection, pollution, or other insult to the airways; as symptoms are not specific to COPD, relevant differential diagnoses should be considered, particularly pneumonia, congestive heart failure and pulmonary embolism.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117QQ5K3]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma differential diagnosis by presenting features — The page lists symptom–condition pairs for alternative causes of asthma-like symptoms: "Shortness of breath, family history of early emphysema" is paired with "Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency"; "Sudden onset of symptoms" with "Inhaled foreign body"; "Dyspnea, inspiratory wheezing (stridor)" with "Inducible laryngeal obstruction"; "Cough, sputum, dyspnea on exertion, smoking or noxious exposure" with "COPD"; "Sudden onset of dyspnea, chest pain" with "Pulmonary embolism"; "Dyspnea, unresponsive to bronchodilators" with "Central airway obstruction"; "Chronic cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea; and/or fatigue, fever, (night) sweats, anorexia, weight loss" with "Tuberculosis"; and "Prolonged paroxysms of coughing, sometimes stridor" with "Pertussis". The page also notes that any of these conditions may contribute to respiratory symptoms even in patients with confirmed asthma.

### Evaluation and management of dyspnea as the dominant presenting feature in neuromuscular disorders [^115G9eh7]. Muscle & Nerve (2024). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea is a common symptom in neuromuscular disorders and, although multifactorial, it is usually due to respiratory muscle involvement, associated musculoskeletal changes such as scoliosis or, in certain neuromuscular conditions, cardiomyopathy. Clinical history can elicit symptoms such as orthopnea, trepopnea, sleep disruption, dysphagia, weak cough, and difficulty with secretion clearance. The examination is essential to assist with the diagnosis of an underlying neurologic disorder and determine whether dyspnea is from a cardiac or pulmonary origin. Specific attention should be given to possible muscle loss, use of accessory muscles of breathing, difficulty with neck flexion/extension, presence of thoraco-abdominal paradox, conversational dyspnea, cardiac examination, and should include a detailed neurological examination directed at the suspected differential diagnosis. Pulmonary function testing including sitting and supine spirometry, measures of inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, cough peak flow, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, pulse oximetry, transcutaneous CO₂, and arterial blood gases will help determine the extent of the respiratory muscle involvement, assess for hypercapnic or hypoxemic respiratory failure, and qualify the patient for noninvasive ventilation when appropriate. Additional testing includes dynamic imaging with sniff fluoroscopy or diaphragm ultrasound, and diaphragm electromyography. Polysomnography is indicated for sleep related symptoms that are not otherwise explained. Noninvasive ventilation alleviates dyspnea and nocturnal symptoms, improves quality of life, and prolongs survival. Therapy targeted at neuromuscular disorders may help control the disease or favorably modify its course. For patients who have difficulty with secretion clearance, support of expiratory function with mechanical insufflation-exsufflation, oscillatory devices can reduce the aspiration risk.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^113nXVcu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea evaluation and management principles — assessment "continues to be dependent on a thorough history and physical examination", and no single test universally tracks dyspnea because "no diagnostic test or biomarker correlates closely with changes in dyspnea across all conditions or settings", though "specific tests (e.g., spirometry or peak flow, D-dimer, brain natriuretic peptide [BNP], arterial blood gases) have diagnostic utility in specific clinical settings or circumstances". Initial treatment prioritizes the underlying cause as "the first priority", after which "the clinician should direct attention to persistent physiological derangements amenable to intervention (e.g., hypoxemia, acidemia)". For chronic exertional dyspnea, "the contribution of cardiovascular deconditioning… should be investigated and pulmonary rehabilitation and exercise training considered for patients with long-standing dyspnea and reduced functional capacity". Measurement is emphasized, as "dyspnea can and should be measured", and instruments "should be classified as addressing domains of sensory-perceptual experience, affective distress, or symptom/disease impact or burden", with a call that "clinicians and investigators should be more explicit about the domains being measured". Finally, adjunct approaches "targeted at altering afferent sensory information… or central processing… demand further investigation".

### What's going wrong with this postpartum woman? [^1141LN9U]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a left ventricular systolic dysfunction failure emerges during the antepartum or puerperal period, and can result in maternal death. Reported incidences are increasing and differing globally. Echocardiography is the cornerstone for the diagnosis. The immediate goals in acute management are the stabilization of the hemodynamic state, providing symptomatic relief, and ensuring fetal wellbeing. Emergency physicians should be aware of PPCM at the differential diagnosis of dyspnea in pregnancy related emergencies and play role in early diagnosis.

Arrhythmias

The prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation (AF), is increased in patients with COPD. Furthermore, during an ECOPD, the risk of AF and other arrhythmias doubles, and, importantly, AF during an ECOPD increases morbidity and mortality. AF presence can be ascertained by atypical chest discomfort, palpitations, lightheadedness, and dyspnea, as well as an irregular pulse on palpation. Unlike other morbidities, there is less diagnostic dilemma between AF and ECOPD. Standard ECG and heart monitoring can detect the presence of chronic, acute, or intermittent arrhythmias. The role of new-onset AF as a cause of acute dyspnea in a patient with COPD is still unknown, so the unresolved clinical question is whether AF was a pre-existing or new-onset event. The diagnostic approach to a patient with suspected AF is shown in Figure E2.

PE

The prevalence of PE in patients with ECOPD ranges from 3.3% to 29.4%, being more common in patients with atypical or unexplained ECOPD and requiring specific and prompt management to improve outcomes. PE should be considered in patients with increased dyspnea in the context of risk factors such as a history of venous thromboembolic disease, hospitalization for HF, or malignancy. Although patients with either PE or ECOPD characteristically complain of worsened dyspnea, those with PE commonly report pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, and signs of right HF and are less likely to have a cough with increased or purulent sputum.

Two studies have considered practical approaches to evaluating PE frequency in hospitalized patients with ECOPD. The first used the revised Geneva score to assess the pretest clinical probability of PE in 740 patients, whether PE was suspected or not. Patients with a high clinical probability of PE (score of at least 11) proceeded to computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) and leg ultrasound. For patients scoring under 11, D-dimer testing was performed, with PE excluded (and no subsequent testing) if the D-dimer value was less than 500 ng/ml. Of 17 patients with high pretest probability, 5 had positive CTPA. In the 442 with low pretest probability and D-dimer of at least 500 μg/L, 36 had a positive CTPA. Importantly, 3-month mortality when PE or deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) was excluded was 5.5%, compared with 27% and 20% in patients with confirmed PE or isolated DVT, respectively.

### Congestive heart failure: diagnosis, pathophysiology, therapy, and implications for respiratory care [^116p3fuF]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common clinical disorder that results in pulmonary vascular congestion and reduced cardiac output. CHF should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any adult patient who presents with dyspnea and/or respiratory failure. The diagnosis of heart failure is often determined by a careful history and physical examination and characteristic chest-radiograph findings. The measurement of serum brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography have substantially improved the accuracy of diagnosis. Therapy for CHF is directed at restoring normal cardiopulmonary physiology and reducing the hyperadrenergic state. The cornerstone of treatment is a combination of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and slow titration of a beta blocker. Patients with CHF are prone to pulmonary complications, including obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions. Continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation benefit patients in CHF exacerbations.

Miscellaneous Morbidities

Anxiety and Depression

In patients with ECOPD, the prevalence of depression and anxiety ranges between 9% and 58%, depending on the assessment method. Furthermore, patients with COPD who have depression and/or anxiety are at increased risk of ECOPD and hospitalizations compared with nondepressed individuals. In addition, nearly 10% of current and former smokers have concomitant anxiety and depression, which independently predict the risk of exacerbations. This vicious cycle worsens with every exacerbation, as each episode leads to symptom worsening, aggravates muscle weakness, and decreases functional capacity (limiting activity), consequently worsening anxiety and depression.

The causal role of anxiety/depression in ECOPDs has not been systematically studied. Panic attacks and anxiety may cause tachypnea that, in COPD, may result in hyperinflation and culminate in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Furthermore, hypercapnia triggers panic attacks because of the activation of specific brainstem reflexes, causing hyperventilation, hyperinflation, and aggravating panic symptoms. In patients with COPD who have a panic attack, the lack of increase in cough and sputum in the absence of either an inflammatory burst or another explanatory morbidity for dyspnea and tachypnea can help establish a diagnosis.

Pneumothorax

Pneumothorax is a potentially life-threatening event that occurs in some patients with COPD, resembles an ECOPD, and requires prompt recognition. Subpleural blebs and bullae are frequent in older males with more severe emphysema and cigarette or marijuana smoke exposure. In patients with COPD who present with pneumothorax, dyspnea is associated with chest pain, often accompanied by hypoxemia, and occasionally, acute respiratory failure. A pneumothorax diagnosis is usually confirmed by chest X-ray, being careful to avoid misinterpretation with bullae. Lung ultrasound may also be diagnostic and more readily available in the ICU or emergency room settings.

Pleural Effusion

Large pleural effusions may contribute to worsening dyspnea in patients with COPD, as they alter lung and chest wall elastic equilibrium, creating a restrictive ventilatory defect. If the effusion is large and associated with elevated natriuretic peptides, the causes are more likely cardiovascular in origin, particularly acute HF, whereas if it is associated with high CRP concentrations, it likely reflects a parapneumonic effusion or empyema because of underlying infection and occasionally lung cancer. Chest X-rays, ultrasound imaging, and chest CT are all useful in determining the presence, size, and complexity of pleural effusion in a patient with ECOPD.

Methods

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Only full-length peer-reviewed studies (randomised controlled trials, cohort, case-control, cross-sectional studies and systematic reviews) published in English from 1946 to November 2020 were included in this review. We excluded abstracts for which a full-length paper was not available. Study participants were patients of any age who presented to a primary, secondary or tertiary care services with unknown causes of chronic dyspnoea (duration ≥ 1 month). The main outcome of interest was the use and diagnostic accuracy of an algorithmic approach to the assessment of dyspnoea.

Search strategy, study selection and analysis

A comprehensive MEDLINE search using the MESH terms "dyspnea/laboured breath/breath short/breathlessness" and "decision support system, clinical/diagnosis computer-assisted/decision support techniques/medical decision making" was conducted. Secondary searches were performed using EMBASE using the same keywords. Additional literature was identified by searching the citation list of the identified articles. We also looked for relevant literature using Google Scholar. All the searched results were merged into one single Endnote Library and all duplicates were removed. Once duplicates were removed, the investigators (C.J. N.B. N.H. and A.P.S.) independently reviewed the title and abstracts and excluded irrelevant studies. The full-length relevant articles were retrieved and examined to further determine if they met inclusion criteria. Conflicts were resolved through discussion with all investigators. Data were extracted to a specifically designed form that included details on the patient cohort, clinical algorithm and investigations utilised and accuracy of the algorithms. Results were analysed descriptively and presented in a narrative format.

### Contemporary topics in pediatric pulmonology for the primary care clinician [^112bjtg6]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2013). Low credibility.

Disorders of the respiratory system are commonly encountered in the primary care setting. The presentations are myriad and this review will discuss some of the more intriguing or vexing disorders that the clinician must evaluate and treat. Among these are dyspnea, chronic cough, chest pain, wheezing, and asthma. Dyspnea and chest pain have a spectrum ranging from benign to serious, and the ability to effectively form a differential diagnosis is critical for reassurance and treatment, along with decisions on when to refer for specialist evaluation. Chronic cough is one of the more common reasons for primary care office visits, and once again, a proper differential diagnosis is necessary to assist the clinician in formulating an appropriate treatment plan. Infant wheezing creates much anxiety for parents and accounts for a large number of office visits and hospital admissions. Common diagnoses and evaluation strategies of early childhood wheezing are reviewed. Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases of children and adults. The epidemiology, diagnosis, evaluation, treatment, and the patient/parent education process will be reviewed. A relatively new topic for primary care clinicians is cystic fibrosis newborn screening. The rationale, methods, outcomes, and implications will be reviewed. This screening program may present some challenges for clinicians caring for newborns, and an understanding of the screening process will help the clinician communicate effectively with parents of the patient.

### Cardiac or pulmonary dyspnea in patients admitted to the emergency department [^116dK7wr]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A simple and quick way of discrimination between cardiac and pulmonary causes of dyspnea is essential in patients admitted to the emergency department. We aimed to assess the utility of easily applicable diagnostic tools in the differential diagnosis of cardiac and pulmonary causes of dyspnea in patients presenting with shortness of breath. Clinical and radiologic evaluation, peak expiratory flow (PEF), PaO₂, PaCO₂ measurements were performed in 94 patients admitted to the emergency room with dyspnea. All the patients were hospitalized for accurate diagnosis and later were categorized into cardiac and pulmonary dyspnea groups. PEF, %PEF (percent of predicted PEF), dyspnea differentiation index (DDI = PEF × PaO₂/1000), %DDI (%PEF × PaO₂/1000), PaO₂ and PaCO₂ measurements were compared between the two groups. When cardiac and pulmonary dyspnea groups were compared, considering 1.6 as the cut-off value for DDI, measurements above this value imply cardiac pathology with 76.7% sensitivity and 67.2% specificity. The sensitivity and specificity for cardiac dyspnea calculated according to the cut-off values were 96.7% and 40.6% for %DDI; 86.7% and 60.9% for PEF; 86.7% and 54.7% for %PEF; 66.7 and 68.7 for PaO₂. Also for pulmonary dyspnea, sensitivity and specificity values for PaCO₂ were 50% and 93%. We conclude that DDI, %DDI, PEF, %PEF, PaO2 and PaCO2 are simple and easily applicable tools for differential diagnosis of cardiac and pulmonary dyspnea. Adjunctive utility of these tests in the emergency department with clinical and radiologic evaluation contributes to this discrimination.

Exacerbations of COPD

A New Definition

Exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) negatively affect health status, disease progression, and prognosis. The previous GOLD definition of ECOPD was highly non-specific ("acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy ").

Besides, the severity of ECOPD was determined post facto (mild, moderate, or severe) based on the use of healthcare resources, which is useless to guide treatment at the point of care.

To address these limitations, GOLD 2023 has adopted the recent consensus Rome proposal, which defines ECOPD as: " an event characterized by dyspnea and/or cough and sputum that worsen over ≤ 14 days, which may be accompanied by tachypnea and/or tachycardia and is often associated with increased local and systemic inflammation caused by airway infection, pollution, or other insult to the airways".

Differential Diagnosis

Patients with COPD are at increased risk of other acute events, particularly decompensated heart failure, pneumonia, and/or pulmonary embolism that may mimic or aggravate an ECOPD (Figure 8). Thus, while worsening of dyspnea, particularly if associated with cough and purulent sputum, and no other symptoms or signs in a patient with COPD, may be diagnosed as an ECOPD, other patients may have worsening of respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea without the classic characteristics of ECOPD, that should prompt careful consideration and/or search of those potential confounders, or contributors.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaChronic dyspnea-noncardiovascular origin [^111XpaQ7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic dyspnea may result from a variety of disorders of cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, systemic, and psychogenic etiology. This article discusses guidelines for the initial imaging of six variants for chronic dyspnea of noncardiovascular origin: (1) Chronic dyspnea of unclear etiology; (2) Chronic dyspnea with suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; (3) Chronic dyspnea with suspected central airways disease; (4) Chronic dyspnea with suspected interstitial lung disease; (5) Chronic dyspnea with suspected disease of the pleura or chest wall; and (6) Chronic dyspnea with suspected diaphragm dysfunction. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^116Eo8Xp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A chest X-ray can help distinguish an ECOPD from acute HF, with cardiomegaly supporting structural heart damage and HF likely present if there is pulmonary edema. The best laboratory markers of HF are elevation of natriuretic peptides (brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide), with thresholds supportive of acute HF, consistent with European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on HF, shown in Figure 3. Importantly, natriuretic peptides are commonly elevated in patients with stable COPD or pneumonia and increase further in patients with ECOPD even without acute HF. As such, higher thresholds are needed to accurately diagnose concomitant acute HF and ECOPD. More informative is the presence of low peptide concentrations, which have excellent negative predictive value for acute HF, even in patients with an ECOPD. Patients with elevated natriuretic peptides during an ECOPD have a worse prognosis, including a risk of death. Finally, point-of-care ultrasonography can help differentiate ECOPD from acute HF, although more research is required to establish their impact on health outcome benefits. A diagnostic algorithm to evaluate a patient with suspected acute HF is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3.
Algorithm reflecting the clinical features of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presenting with increased respiratory symptoms and suspected acute heart failure. Recommendations are on the basis of the most recent European and American Guidelines on heart failure. *The thresholds for N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and BNP are intended for the diagnosis of acute heart failure (HF) and may need correction with age. Thresholds for new onset stable HF are much lower (i.e. NT-proBNP > 125 pg/ml and BNP > 35 pg/ml) and should be used outside the context of an exacerbation of COPD. Note that the presence of COPD may raise these values. Please see text for further details.

### Negative computed tomography for acute pulmonary embolism: important differential diagnosis considerations for acute dyspnea [^117DVngd]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the principal means of evaluating dyspnea in the emergency department. As its use has increased, the number of studies positive for pulmonary embolism (PE) has decreased to less than 20%. Many of the negative PE studies provide an alternative explanation for dyspnea, most commonly pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or atelectasis. Nonthrombotic emboli may also be suggested. Airway and obstructive lung disease may be detected on CTPA. Pleural and pericardial disease may also explain the dyspnea, but more detailed evaluation of the serosal surfaces may be limited on the arterial phase of a CTPA.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dyspnea in palliative care, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, ASCO 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain a systematic assessment of dyspnea using validated patient-reported outcome measures at every inpatient and outpatient encounter in patients with advanced cancer. Use a validated observation measure in patients unable to self-report.

### An algorithmic approach to chronic dyspnea [^113SGisE]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Question

The objective of the study was to prospectively evaluate an algorithmic approach to the cause(s) of chronic dyspnea. MATERIALS/PATIENTS/METHODS: Prospective observational study. The study group consisted of 123 patients with a chief complaint of dyspnea of unknown cause present for > 8 weeks. Dyspnea severity scores were documented at entry and after therapy. Patients underwent an algorithmic approach to dyspnea. Therapy could be instituted at any time that data supported a treatable diagnosis. Whenever possible, accuracy of diagnosis was confirmed with an improvement in dyspnea after therapy. Tests required, spectrum and frequency of diagnoses, and the values of individual tests were determined.

Results

Cause(s) was(were) diagnosed in 122/123 patients (99%); 97 patients had one diagnosis and 25 two diagnoses. Fifty-three percent of diagnoses were respiratory and 47% were non-respiratory. Following therapy, dyspnea improved in 63% of patients.

Conclusions

The prospective algorithmic approach led to diagnoses in 99% of cases. A third of patients were diagnosed with each tier of the algorithm, thus minimizing the need for invasive testing. Specific diagnoses led to improvement in dyspnea in the majority of cases. Based on the results of this study, the algorithm can be revised to further minimize unnecessary tests without loss of diagnostic accuracy.

### Impact of point-of-care B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) measurement on medical decision-making for older emergency department patients with dyspnea [^111fRiNq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been shown to aid in the Emergency Department (ED) diagnosis of heart failure. We sought to determine how point-of-care BNP measurement influences real-world medical decision-making. Using a commercially available, point-of-care assay, BNP levels were measured in a convenience sample of ED patients over the age of 55 years who complained of dyspnea. Blinded to BNP results, emergency physicians were asked to formulate a differential diagnosis and management plan for each patient. Immediately thereafter, BNP results were disclosed and the physicians were asked what (if any) decisions they would change. With physicians blinded to BNP results, 24 of 88 patients (27%) were given a primary diagnosis of heart failure, and 18 patients (20%) were given a secondary or alternative diagnosis of heart failure. For the former group, disclosure of BNP results resulted in no changes in diagnosis or management. For the latter group, disclosure of BNP results caused heart failure to become the primary diagnosis in 4 patients (22%), and led to five changes in medical management. For the 46 patients initially given neither a primary nor secondary diagnosis of heart failure, disclosure of BNP results caused heart failure to become the primary diagnosis in one patient (2%) and a secondary diagnosis in 4 patients (9%), and led to five changes in medical management. Thus, for ED patients with a primary clinical diagnosis of heart failure, BNP testing had no impact on medical decision-making. However, for other patients with dyspnea, elevated BNP levels did influence medical decision-making, particularly when heart failure was in the differential diagnosis.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^116f11oz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute dyspnea — B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone precursor (NTproBNP) may help evaluate heart failure as the cause of dyspnea and can expedite evaluation and treatment; however, routine use of BNP in all patients with acute dyspnea is not recommended. In acute care settings such as an ED, sensitivity of BNP or NTproBNP is substantially higher than specificity and utility is greatest for ruling out heart failure when pretest probability is low to intermediate, while the utility of serial BNP testing in known heart failure is uncertain.

### Causes and evaluation of chronic dyspnea [^113qXGEN]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic dyspnea is shortness of breath that lasts more than one month. The perception of dyspnea varies based on behavioral and physiologic responses. Dyspnea that is greater than expected with the degree of exertion is a symptom of disease. Most cases of dyspnea result from asthma, heart failure and myocardial ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, or psychogenic disorders. The etiology of dyspnea is multifactorial in about one-third of patients. The clinical presentation alone is adequate to make a diagnosis in 66 percent of patients with dyspnea. Patients' descriptions of the sensation of dyspnea may be helpful, but associated symptoms and risk factors, such as smoking, chemical exposures, and medication use, should also be considered. Examination findings (e.g., jugular venous distention, decreased breath sounds or wheezing, pleural rub, clubbing) may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Initial testing in patients with chronic dyspnea includes chest radiography, electrocardiography, spirometry, complete blood count, and basic metabolic panel. Measurement of brain natriuretic peptide levels may help exclude heart failure, and D-dimer testing may help rule out pulmonary emboli. Pulmonary function studies can be used to identify emphysema and interstitial lung diseases. Computed tomography of the chest is the most appropriate imaging study for diagnosing suspected pulmonary causes of chronic dyspnea. To diagnose pulmonary arterial hypertension or certain interstitial lung diseases, right heart catheterization or bronchoscopy may be needed.

### Profound thrombocytopenia and dyspnea 11 Days after cardiac surgery [^113WxmNi]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Case Presentation

A 59‐year‐old Caucasian female with hypertension and dyslipidemia presented to the hospital with dyspnea. Her platelet count was 7 × 10⁹/L (reference range [RR], 150–400). Eleven days earlier, she had undergone an elective valve‐sparing Bentall procedure (replacement of hemi‐aortic arch) and ascending aorta repair with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for aortic root aneurysm. Her postoperative course was uneventful, with discharge on postoperative day (POD) 4. The patient reported no bleeding symptoms/signs, and petechiae were not present.

Platelet count declines are universal post‐cardiac surgery, with platelet count recovery to preoperative baseline expected by the seventh POD, and continued platelet count increase that typically peaks by POD14; thus, a platelet count of 7 × 10⁹/L on POD11 is highly abnormal and sufficiently reduced to be classified as "profound" thrombocytopenia (< 20 × 10⁹/L). Yet, this patient presented with dyspnea, not bleeding. The urgent task was to identify promptly the cause of her dyspnea and to address the profound thrombocytopenia with the key question: did a single diagnosis explain both?

Vital signs were BP 98/59, HR 102/min, RR 23/min, temperature 38.5°C; oxygen saturation was 95% (room air). Urgent echocardiography showed normal ventricular contractility without valve abnormalities; however, a moderate‐to‐large pericardial effusion was present; subtle right ventricular diastolic collapse suggested partial or incipient cardiac tamponade. The cardiologists were concerned that the pericardial fluid was blood rather than serous fluid, that is hemorrhagic pericarditis. However, risk of pericardiocentesis was felt to be extremely high due to thrombocytopenia; thus, urgent hematology consultation was requested.

There is a limited differential diagnosis for profound thrombocytopenia, particularly given the normal platelet count just 11 days earlier. The differential diagnosis includes: pseudothrombocytopenia (spurious thrombocytopenia); consumptive thrombocytopenia (disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC] secondary to infection/shock, thrombotic microangiopathy [TMA], or immune heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia [HIT]); or destructive thrombocytopenia (antibody‐mediated platelet clearance by drug‐dependent antibodies, autoantibodies, or alloantibodies). A reasonable first diagnostic step is to evaluate the complete blood count (CBC), along with peripheral blood film review.

### Puzzling dyspnea caused by respiratory muscle weakness [^1144Xu4Z]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Dyspnea is common in advanced stages of neuromuscular disorders, but it is infrequently the presenting symptom. However, dyspnea is a frequent complaint in a primary care setting but is rarely caused by a respiratory muscle weakness. Consequently, the diagnosis of respiratory muscle weakness often is delayed. First symptoms may occur when respiratory muscles are under increased load, such as when standing in the water higher than the chest, swimming, or in the supine position. We describe a patient in whom dyspnea was the first symptom of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to remind clinicians of clinical features of respiratory muscle weakness and to help avoid the delay in diagnosis.

### Assessment and diagnosis of chronic dyspnoea: a literature review [^112FEjf1]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Dyspnoea or breathlessness is a common presenting symptom among patients attending primary care services. This review aimed to determine whether there are clinical tools that can be incorporated into a clinical decision support system for primary care for efficient and accurate diagnosis of causes of chronic dyspnoea. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar for all literature published between 1946 and 2020. Studies that evaluated a clinical algorithm for assessment of chronic dyspnoea in patients of any age group presenting to physicians with chronic dyspnoea were included. We identified 326 abstracts, 55 papers were reviewed, and eight included. A total 2026 patients aged between 20–80 years were included, 60% were women. The duration of dyspnoea was three weeks to 25 years. All studies undertook a stepwise or algorithmic approach to the assessment of dyspnoea. The results indicate that following history taking and physical examination, the first stage should include simply performed tests such as pulse oximetry, spirometry, and electrocardiography. If the patient remains undiagnosed, the second stage includes investigations such as chest x-ray, thyroid function tests, full blood count and NT-proBNP. In the third stage patients are referred for more advanced tests such as echocardiogram and thoracic CT. If dyspnoea remains unexplained, the fourth stage of assessment will require secondary care referral for more advanced diagnostic testing such as exercise tests. Utilising this proposed stepwise approach is expected to ascertain a cause for dyspnoea for 35% of the patients in stage 1, 83% by stage 3 and > 90% of patients by stage 4.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^115qXFxL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea — definition and assessment: Dyspnea is a perceptual symptom that must be self-reported and differentiated from observable signs. The statement emphasizes that "dyspnea per se can only be perceived by the person experiencing it", explains that "Perception entails conscious recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli and their meaning", and concludes, "Therefore, as is the case with pain, adequate assessment of dyspnea depends on self-report". It further clarifies, "Because dyspnea is a symptom (i.e., perception of an abnormal or distressing internal state), it must generally be distinguished from signs that clinicians typically invoke as evidence of respiratory distress, such as tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, and intercostal retractions", and that "Distinctive sensory qualities are important in considering the physiological mechanisms underlying the breathing discomfort, but the definition of dyspnea should be neutral with respect to any particular quality".

Differential diagnosis of heart failure etiologies

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) proposes a four-step algorithm to diagnose HFpEF. First, women with dyspnea (especially on exertion) or orthopnea should undergo a pretest evaluation. This consists of screening for HFpEF risk factors such as obesity, metabolic syndrome/diabetes mellitus, physical inactivity, and arterial hypertension, recording ECG in search for atrial fibrillation (a highly predictive criteria for HFpEF), and performing echocardiography or CMR showing LVEF ≥ 50%, non-dilated LV, concentric hypertrophy, and left atrial enlargement (Case 3). If the presentation is suggestive of HFpEF, an echocardiographic score is calculated based on a series of major and minor criteria which will not be detailed here. In case the score does not allow ruling in or ruling out the diagnosis of HFpEF, a 3 rd step consists of considering diastolic dysfunction assessed by stress echocardiography, which alongside preserved LVEF is a cardinal feature of HFpEF. If the diagnosis still remains uncertain, invasive hemodynamic measurements using left and right heart catheterization are recommended with measurement of LV end-diastolic pressure and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Once HFpEF is confirmed, the final step consists of an etiological workup. Given that CMVD is present in most patients with HFpEF, PET-MPI with calculation of CFR and MBF is recommended. CMR detects most of the specific etiologies (ischemic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, or restrictive cardiomyopathies), while CCTA can be most useful to evidence CAD. In selected cases, bone scintigraphy and ¹²³I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (¹²³I-MIBG) scintigraphy are useful to detect cardiac amyloidosis.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction update-2016 [^113UHLnn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) — differential diagnosis requires distinguishing inspiratory stridor alone from inspiratory stridor with or without expiratory wheezing to differentiate EIB from exercise-induced laryngeal dysfunction, using an appropriate exercise or surrogate challenge and flexible laryngoscopy, assessing for dyspnea or hyperventilation masquerading as asthma, evaluating for COPD or restrictive lung disease when exertional dyspnea is present, differentiating exercise-induced anaphylaxis by associated pruritus, urticaria, and low blood pressure, and considering cardiopulmonary testing, specialist referral, or psychological evaluation as indicated.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^114FBcnb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular Morbidities

Cardiovascular morbidities are frequently present in patients experiencing ECOPDs, and thus a patient history is important to assess their presence or impact. Chest pain/discomfort, fluid retention, or irregular pulse suggest a cardiovascular cause as an alternative or contributing diagnosis to an ECOPD.

Acute HF

Acute HF is defined by worsening of dyspnea at rest (particularly while supine) or during exertion and/or fatigue, together with signs of fluid retention such as pulmonary congestion, increased jugular vein distension, or ankle swelling, with objective evidence of an abnormality of the structure or function of the heart. Some of these clinical findings can make distinguishing ECOPD from acute HF difficult. In addition, COPD is present in up to 50% of patients with HF, and HF occurs in roughly 20% of individuals with COPD because of overlapping risk factors (aging and smoking) and underlying mechanisms (systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and muscular atrophy). Furthermore, an HF diagnosis is often difficult to confirm in patients with preserved ejection fraction, which is common in patients with COPD. Hypoxemia and tachycardia in ECOPD can promote decompensation in HF, whereas pulmonary fluid retention in HF can worsen airway obstruction. In addition, wheezing is common in acute HF (approximately 30%), whereas COPD can mask the presence of basilar crackles. However, their presence, coupled with evidence of leg edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, and a third heart sound increases the likelihood of HF being the cause of, or a contributor to, the acute event.

### Rare presentation of inflammatory lung disease and subcutaneous nodules on FDG PET / CT scan: brief discussion of differential diagnoses [^114hnPpa]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We present a 37-year-old man with cough and progressive dyspnea for the past 3 years. According to inconclusive chest CT scan and lung biopsy histopathology findings, the patient referred for 18F-FDG PET/CT scan for further evaluation. Classic pulmonary manifestations of Langerhans cell histiocytosis were seen on CT images with intense FDG uptake on PET scan. Moreover, PET/CT revealed multiple hypermetabolic subcutaneous foci throughout his body. Finally, the patient was treated with corticosteroids. Follow-up chest CT images demonstrated improvement of lung lesions in accordance with improvement in the patient's symptoms. We are briefly discussing differential diagnoses in this patient.

### New international guidelines and consensus on the use of lung ultrasound [^111E3SVz]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In particular, the possibility of differentiating between primary cardiogenic and pulmonary SIS was proposed to the differential diagnosis of cardiogenic edema, ARDS, and pulmonary fibrosis.

After 2010, pulmonologists and pediatricians began extensively exploring the point of care applications of thoracic US in their fields of interest.

Beyond the differential diagnosis between cardiogenic and primary pulmonary dyspnea, the interest of pulmonologists has also recently extended to the bedside evaluation of fibrosing interstitial lung diseases.,

Furthermore, the recent COVID‐19 pandemic has determined an exponential growth of research that confirmed the role of LUS as a useful point‐of‐care tool for diagnosis support, prognostic stratification and monitoring of COVID‐19 pneumonias.,

The pathologies that benefit most from LUS examination are dyspnea, thoracic trauma, COVID‐19, pneumonia, pleural pathology (effusions and pneumothorax), and heart failure. The role of bedside US is relevant both in the diagnostic and in patient monitoring phases.

Clinicians should thus use LUS as a "point of care" examination in case of patient with dyspnea, chest pain and any chest symptom.

Point‐of‐care US examination of the chest remained for many years within the limits of a uniform assessment of the critically ill, regardless of the setting and pathology.

Instead, the most recent observations, both clinical and experimental, lead us to believe that both indications and specialist‐settings, in which the point‐of‐care examination is performed, should be taken into consideration. This also applies to US scanners imaging settings, the selected probe and the number and distribution of scans to be acquired.,

As an example, whether an algorithmic approach focused on the analysis of B‐lines may be adequate for the interpretation of cardiogenic dyspnea in the emergency room or ICU, the dyspnea of a chronically ill patient in pulmonary medicine settings requires a different evaluation of the US clips. Clinical integration and adaptation of the methodology to the specific setting is already ongoing.

### From dyspnea to diagnosis: a pediatric case report on an unexpected condition [^112JBmmE]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Second podcast:

Radiologist: There is an extensive image of diffuse nodular opacities throughout the parenchyma on chest CT with apparent bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. When considering the potential differential diagnosis of this finding, we must include an inflammatory process with granuloma formation, such as sarcoidosis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection; however, a similar interstitial process can also be seen in hypersensitivity pneumonitis or in other diffuse lung diseases.
Pulmonologist: Exactly, this is an acute diffuse parenchymal lung disease image. Importantly, the patient worsens clinically and requires constant oxygen therapy. To ascertain the diagnosis, we should perform lung function tests and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. These examinations can provide additional important diagnostic clues, help assess the extent and character of tissue damage, as well as find the infectious agent.
Dermatologists: These skin lesions are not typical and have a broad differential diagnosis, may be a sign of contact allergy, which would also explain blood eosinophilia, but could resemble some skin manifestation of TB or sarcoidosis. To verify this, we should perform a skin biopsy of one of the lesions.
Rheumatologists: From a rheumatological point of view, most of the combined symptoms would suggest vasculitis, the skin biopsy proposed by the dermatology team will help us confirm if this is the case. We would like to exclude EGPA, which although very rare in this age group, could explain the description of the symptoms the patient presents. In case of EGPA, the biopsy should revealing granulomas and ANCA autoantibodies should be positive.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® dyspnea-suspected cardiac origin (ischemia already excluded): 2021 update [^115sXryv]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea is the symptom of perceived breathing discomfort and is commonly encountered in a variety of clinical settings. Cardiac etiologies of dyspnea are an important consideration; among these, valvular heart disease (Variant 1), arrhythmia (Variant 2), and pericardial disease (Variant 3) are reviewed in this document. Imaging plays an important role in the clinical assessment of these suspected abnormalities, with usually appropriate procedures including resting transthoracic echocardiography in all three variants, radiography for Variants 1 and 3, MRI heart function and morphology in Variants 2 and 3, and CT heart function and morphology with intravenous contrast for Variant 3. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### From dyspnea to diagnosis: a pediatric case report on an unexpected condition [^116Mwvu7]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Discussion

A 7‐year‐old patient with no history of severe infections presented with sudden onset of dyspnea, fever, and acute respiratory insufficiency. Although this clinical condition is usually associated with an acute respiratory infection, a rare primary immunodeficiency was eventually diagnosed. The borderline growth represented the only finding indicative of possible chronicity. Because the respiratory failure did not respond to first‐line therapeutic approaches, a detailed pulmonary evaluation was performed, revealing acute diffuse lung parenchymal disease. While the chest CT pattern can usually narrow the otherwise extensive differential diagnoses, in our case the lung involvement combined with skin involvement, required an extensive workup to exclude a range of diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and vasculitis. The diffuse nodular pattern with hilar lymphadenopathy also warranted an oncologic screening in search of possible malignancy. Finally, the history of mold and mulch exposure, high levels of specific IgG antibodies against molds together with the corresponding CT pattern suggested the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). However, at the initial stage, several aspects were unclear. First, the association of HP with skin lesions was elusive. Second, an ongoing fungal lung infection had to be thoroughly assessed, particularly as the targeted examinations were inconclusive. Third, although the CMV positivity in BAL did not match the short history of symptoms, CMV infection may, in rare cases, present as diffuse parenchymal pattern on CT scan and, as such, CMV pneumonia had to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Eventually, given the atypical combination of symptoms and pathogens, an underlying immune pathology was considered and confirmed to be CGD, altering the course of the child's management.

### Lung ultrasound-implemented diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure in the ED: a SIMEU multicenter study [^114Fst5N]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Lung ultrasonography (LUS) has emerged as a noninvasive tool for the differential diagnosis of pulmonary diseases. However, its use for the diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) still raises some concerns. We tested the hypothesis that an integrated approach implementing LUS with clinical assessment would have higher diagnostic accuracy than a standard workup in differentiating ADHF from noncardiogenic dyspnea in the ED.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, prospective cohort study in seven Italian EDs. For patients presenting with acute dyspnea, the emergency physician was asked to categorize the diagnosis as ADHF or noncardiogenic dyspnea after (1) the initial clinical assessment and (2) after performing LUS ("LUS-implemented" diagnosis). All patients also underwent chest radiography. After discharge, the cause of each patient's dyspnea was determined by independent review of the entire medical record. The diagnostic accuracy of the different approaches was then compared.

Results

The study enrolled 1,005 patients. The LUS-implemented approach had a significantly higher accuracy (sensitivity, 97% [95% CI, 95%-98.3%]; specificity, 97.4% [95% CI, 95.7%-98.6%]) in differentiating ADHF from noncardiac causes of acute dyspnea than the initial clinical workup (sensitivity, 85.3% [95% CI, 81.8%-88.4%]; specificity, 90% [95% CI, 87.2%-92.4%]), chest radiography alone (sensitivity, 69.5% [95% CI, 65.1%-73.7%]; specificity, 82.1% [95% CI, 78.6%-85.2%]), and natriuretic peptides (sensitivity, 85% [95% CI, 80.3%-89%]; specificity, 61.7% [95% CI, 54.6%-68.3%]; n = 486). Net reclassification index of the LUS-implemented approach compared with standard workup was 19.1%.

Conclusions

The implementation of LUS with the clinical evaluation may improve accuracy of ADHF diagnosis in patients presenting to the ED.

### Point-of-care ultrasound in management for dyspneic uremic patients: a case report [^111upJqD]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Point-of-Care Ultrasound (PoCUS) is considered as an extension of clinicians' patient care and can be integrated into daily clinical practice. Dyspnea is a common presentation in uremic patients. With the aids of PoCUS and integrated assessments of lung, heart and inferior vena cava (IVC), the etiology of dyspnea in uremic patients can be determined earlier.

Case presentation

A 67-year-old woman presented with progressive shortness of breath and bilateral legs edema for 3 weeks. The laboratory data revealed marked elevated level of serum creatinine and blood urea. A large amount of pericardial effusion was timely detected by PoCUS. Uremic pericarditis was suspected. Emergent hemodialysis was initiated and her symptoms improved.

Conclusions

PoCUS is a noninvasive and cost-effective imaging modality and it has been popular in the emergency department (ED). In uremic patients presenting with dyspnea, the integration of PoCUS into traditional physical examinations help emergency physicians narrow down the differential diagnoses.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^115iaYzu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Infectious Diseases

Pneumonia

In patients with COPD, the symptoms of pneumonia and ECOPD may be similar (worsened cough, sputum production, dyspnea, and fever). Physical examination may help in the differentiation, with signs of consolidation (localized crackles, crepitus, and dullness on percussion) more frequent in patients with pneumonia. However, because a diagnosis of COPD increases pneumonia risk (by 1.3- to 13.5-fold) and severity, pneumonia should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with symptoms of ECOPD.

If the clinical assessment deems the ECOPD to be mild or moderate and there are no signs of lung consolidation, no further diagnostic testing to differentiate the two diseases is indicated. However, if the episode is severe and/or prolonged, and there are abnormal chest exam findings, a proper diagnosis of pneumonia should be undertaken. Mortality after hospitalized pneumonia is higher than after hospitalized ECOPD. Although most patients without severe ECOPD can be safely treated on the basis of chest X-ray results alone, opacities not visible on a chest X-ray may be seen with more sensitive CT scans.

### Appropriate use of point-of-care ultrasonography in patients with acute dyspnea in emergency department or inpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^113wi6F3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Clinical considerations for POCUS in acute dyspnea — applicability, exclusions, device scope, training, and diagnostic uncertainty: The included studies enrolled adult patients presenting in EDs and inpatient settings with dyspnea as a primary symptom (unspecified acute dyspnea) and who were later confirmed to have 1 of the conditions of interest (congestive heart failure [including pulmonary edema], pleural effusion, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax). The systematic review excluded studies that included patients with other medical conditions that can cause dyspnea (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, acute coronary symptoms, and trauma) if the patients were not also confirmed to have 1 of the conditions of interest. This recommendation does not apply to handheld devices; evidence from 1 high risk of bias study is very uncertain (insufficient) about the effect of handheld POCUS devices in addition to the standard pathway on health, diagnostic, and treatment outcomes. Clinicians who use POCUS should be trained in the use and interpretation of findings and ongoing care quality assessment. As with any diagnostic test, this recommendation applies to clinical scenarios where there is diagnostic uncertainty, and clinicians should understand and consider that the test accuracy of POCUS varies according to the likelihood of underlying diseases. Figure 2 shows that, using the prevalence estimates of various conditions reported in the studies, the rate of false-positive test results for pneumonia and pulmonary embolism may be higher than what many clinicians and patients are comfortable with, and clinicians can also review Figure 2 and consider that the severity of consequences of false-negative or false-positive test results may differ according to disease.

### Diagnosis in just over a minute: a case of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia [^114R6iki]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) is a rare interstitial lung disease characterized by subacute dyspnea, peripheral infiltrates on imaging, and pulmonary eosinophilia. We report a case of a 48-year-old man who presented to a "minute clinic" with cough and dyspnea. After improvement on a short course of steroids for a presumptive diagnosis of bronchospasm, he presented to our hospital with symptom recurrence. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed peripheral infiltrates and bronchoscopy confirmed pulmonary eosinophilia. In this clinical vignette, we review the typical presentation of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, the differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia, and the challenges of diagnosing a rare condition that may mimic more common causes of dyspnea, especially in a "minute clinic" setting.

EILD, primarily vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) and also other glottic abnormalities, can be elicited by exercise and mimic EIB, and inspiratory stridor is a differentiating hallmark sign with EILD and not with EIB. Flattening of the inspiratory curve on spirometric maneuvers can be seen concomitant with symptoms, and EILD can occur alone or with EIB; failure to respond to asthma management is a key historical feature suggesting EILD. Bronchial provocation challenge results with methacholine, exercise, and EVH can be negative in patients with EILD who do not otherwise have BHR, and medications used to treat asthma, such as β2-agonists, are ineffective to prevent or reverse EILD. EILD can be suspected based on bronchial provocation challenges with EVH, methacholine, and/or exercise, demonstrating variable extrathoracic airway obstruction. Symptom timing can aid differentiation: inspiratory stridor with throat tightness during maximal exercise resolves within approximately 5 minutes of discontinuation of exercise in patients with EILD, whereas dyspnea with EIB peaks 5 to 20 minutes after stopping and involves expiration rather than inspiration. For direct diagnosis of VCD/EILD, diagnosis can be made directly by using continuous laryngoscopy during exercise challenge, and spirometry and laryngoscopy with sound recording can be performed during exercise, detecting minor and major aryepiglottic and vocal cord abnormalities. EILD can coexist with EIB, and inspiratory stridor is the signature clinical feature suggesting EILD rather than EIB.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111QByKB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Symptom-based differential diagnoses in difficult-to-treat asthma assessment: Perform a careful history and physical examination to identify whether symptoms are typical of asthma, or are more likely due to an alternative diagnosis or comorbidity, noting that dyspnea may reflect COPD, obesity, cardiac disease, or deconditioning; cough may reflect inducible laryngeal obstruction (also called vocal cord dysfunction, VCD), upper airway cough syndrome (also called post-nasal drip), gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), bronchiectasis, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; and wheeze may reflect obesity, COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, or VCD; investigate according to clinical suspicion and age.

### An unusual cause of dyspnea [^112oKz3q]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Dyspnea is an alarming symptom for both the patient and the emergency physician. There are many causes of dyspnea, some of which are life-threatening, especially in the elderly patient. In addition to the usual cardiac and pulmonary causes such as congestive heart failure, asthma exacerbation, COPD, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism, there are less common causes of dyspnea, which if not diagnosed and managed expeditiously may have dire consequences for both the patient and physician. We present a case of an elderly patient with a life-threatening unusual cause of acute shortness of breath, a diaphragmatic hernia with sepsis.

### Point-of-care ultrasound in management for dyspneic uremic patients: a case report [^113AQgBN]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are two kinds of end-stage renal disease (ESRD)-related pericardial diseases: uremic pericarditis and dialysis-associated pericarditis. Uremic pericarditis occurs in the non-dialysis patients with untreated uremia. Dialysis pericarditis occurs in chronic-dialysis patients with inadequate dialysis or fluid overload. Early diagnosis for uremic pericarditis is challenging for clinicians currently because of the low incidence caused by the widespread availability of dialysis. Besides, the typical presentations of pericarditis such as fever, pleuritic chest pain, friction rub could not occur in all patients. Moreover, the characteristic finding of diffuse ST elevation in ECG is rare in uremic pericarditis because the myocardium is not involved. Therefore, PoCUS can play an important role to rule in or rule out pericardial effusion in clinical practice.

Some limitations would exist in diagnostic ultrasound in patients with multi-diagnoses and multi-comorbidities. For example, patients with congestive heart failure and pneumonia would have pleural effusion, prominent B lines and lung consolidation. However, with gathering useful clinical information, ultrasonographers could overcome this problem based on the clinical situation of the patients. In uremic patients presenting with dyspnea, the integration of PoCUS into traditional physical examinations help emergency physicians narrow down the differential diagnoses.

Dyspnea definition and prognostic associations — dyspnea is defined as a "subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity", and evidence indicates prognostic value: "dyspnea is a predictor of hospitalization and mortality in patients with chronic lung disease", and "in some cases is more closely correlated with 5-year survival than forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)", with dyspnea "more closely associated with cardiac mortality than angina". Advances also support that "different sensations may reflect different pathways associated with different sensory qualities (notably work/effort, tightness, and air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration)".

Clinical presentation and initial assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) include suspicion when patients report cough, sputum production, dyspnea, or recurrent lower respiratory infections, exposure to cigarette smoke or environmental/occupational pollutants, or an acute exacerbation; history should assess evidence that COPD is present versus alternatives, comorbidities, ability to perform activities of daily living, other effects of the condition, and social support; on examination, a normal exam is common in mild COPD with signs emerging as disease progresses, and detection of diminished breath sounds and hyperresonance has a positive likelihood ratio of greater than 5.0, a moderately strong predictor that COPD is present; routinely measured parameters include respiratory rate, oxygen saturation at rest and with exertion, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), breathlessness using the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea score [mMRC], and functional capacity, which is best determined by an exercise test such as timed walking distances or walking speed; exercise tests have been shown to predict mortality particularly well in patients with COPD.

Pulmonary embolism workup — D-dimer is used in suspected pulmonary embolism; its sensitivity is much greater than specificity and positive predictive value is poor, so its primary value is rapid identification of patients with low probability of pulmonary embolism in outpatient settings, while its negative predictive value is poor in hospitalized patients, especially after several days or in patients older than 60 years of age.

### An uncommon cause of dyspnea in the emergency department [^114kpKVi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chest pain and shortness of breath are chief complaints frequently evaluated in the emergency department. ACS, pulmonary embolism, and disorders involving the lung parenchyma are some of the disease processes commonly screened for. Occasionally, patients presenting with histories and clinical exams consistent with these common illnesses may end up having more rare pathology. We present the case of a young patient who presented with chest pain and dyspnea with ECG changes and history concerning for pulmonary embolism who was ultimately diagnosed with idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension. The importance of a prompt diagnosis of this condition along with emergency department management of complications related to the disease is discussed in this report.

### The role of inferior vena cava diameter in the differential diagnosis of dyspneic patients; best sonographic measurement method? [^11625bZN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We aimed to determine the role of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter in making a differentiation between dyspnea of cardiac (acute heart failure [AHF]) and pulmonary origin. We also attempted to determine the best sonographic method for the measurement of IVC diameter.

Methods

This prospective observational study was conducted at the intensive care unit of the emergency department of a training and research hospital. This study enrolled patients with the main symptom of dyspnea who were categorized into 2 groups, cardiac dyspnea and pulmonary dyspnea groups, based on the final diagnosis. All patients underwent sonographic measurement of minimum and maximum diameters of IVC, and the caval index (CI) was calculated in both M-mode and B-mode. The sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LR) of the IVC values for the differentiation of the 2 groups were calculated.

Results

This study included a total of 74 patients with a mean age of 72.8 years. Thirty-two patients had dyspnea of cardiac origin, and 42 patients had dyspnea of pulmonary origin. The IVC diameter measured with B-mode during inspiration (B-mode i) was the most successful method for differentiation of the 2 groups. B-mode i values greater than 9 mm predicted dyspnea of cardiac origin with a sensitivity of 84.4% and a specificity of 92.9% (+LR: 11.8, LR: 0.16).

Conclusion

Sonographic assessment of the IVC diameter may be used as a rapid, readily, nonexpensive, complication-free, and reproducible technique for the differentiation of cardiac and pulmonary causes of dyspnea. B-mode i measurement may be more successful in the differentiation of dyspnea compared with other IVC diameters and calculations.

### Unknown rheumatic cardiac disease as cause of acute onset post-partum dyspnea: a case report [^116FjURx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute post-partum dyspnea configures an obstetric challenge with multiple differential diagnosis.

Case Presentation

We present a case of a previous healthy woman with preeclampsia who developed severe dyspnea 30 h after delivery. She complained of cough, orthopnea, and bilateral lower extremities oedema. She denied headaches, blurry vision, nausea, vomiting, fever or chills. Auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur, and was compatible with pulmonary oedema. A timely bedside echocardiogram showed moderate dilated left atrium with severe mitral insufficiency suggestive of an unknown rheumatic disease. She was managed with noninvasive ventilation, loop diuretics, vasodilators, thromboprophylaxis, head-end elevation, and fluid restriction with progressive improving.

Conclusions

Hemodynamic changes in pregnant patients with previously silent cardiac disease may pose a challenge and cause post-partum dyspnea. This scenario requires a timely and multidisciplinary approach.

### Dyspnea in children: what is driving it and how to approach it [^115WNc9C]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Dyspnea in children has important physical and psychosocial impact. It is useful to define the quality of the dyspnea and quantify its magnitude in a child-friendly manner. Through careful history taking and physical examination, a targeted investigation can lead to identification of the cause and potential treatment. This article provides a framework for the clinical approach to dyspnea in children, including important information to gather during the history, physical assessment, how to quantify dyspnea, and choice and use of laboratory measurements.

### Beyond the usual suspects: neonatal fever and desaturation [^111rdwd7]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We report a 1-month-old infant admitted with fever, dyspnea, and desaturation after an unmonitored pregnancy in a migrant family. The patient rapidly required mechanical ventilation. Laboratory parameters were markedly elevated, suggesting an infectious etiology.

Methods

The clinical course is described with emphasis on diagnostic challenges, including imaging, laboratory findings, and the stepwise process of differential diagnosis.

Results

After common etiologies were excluded, rarer causes were considered. The final diagnosis was established through integration of clinical assessment, radiological imaging, laboratory data, and microbiological testing.

Conclusion

In neonates with fever and respiratory distress, RSV bronchiolitis is usually the first consideration. If excluded, clinicians must remain alert to less frequent etiologies. This case underscores the importance of a broad differential diagnosis in infants with acute respiratory compromise.

### An unexpected cause of chronic cough in a young woman: tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^115CTjfh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Heart failure typically manifests with exertional dyspnea or limb edema. Old age, underlying heart disease, and coronary risk factors are known risk factors for heart failure. Thus, congestive heart failure is rarely considered as a differential diagnosis of chronic cough in a previously healthy young person. However, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TIC) can result in such a situation. A case of a previously healthy 27-year-old woman with TIC is described herein. On the first examination, the patient presented with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction caused by persistent tachyarrhythmia. Cardiomyopathy subsided with only heart rate control; therefore, the patient was diagnosed as having TIC. TIC can develop irrespective of age and underlying heart disease. The long-term outcome may be good, and LV systolic function recovers in most patients following resolution of arrhythmia. Physicians need to consider TIC as a differential diagnosis in patients of any age who present with heart failure, because prompt treatment generally leads to resolution of symptoms and ventricular function.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117YL4cT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lists suggestive features for COPD and common mimics: COPD is associated with midlife onset, slowly progressing symptoms, and a long history of smoking; asthma presents with early onset, varying symptoms, night/early-morning symptoms, allergy/rhinitis/eczema, a family history, and airflow limitation that is largely reversible; congestive heart failure shows fine basilar crackles, a dilated heart on chest radiography, peripheral edema, a history of ischemic heart disease, and volume restriction not airflow limitation on pulmonary function tests; bronchiectasis features large volumes of purulent sputum, bacterial infection, coarse crackles, clubbing, and bronchial dilation and bronchial wall thickening on chest radiography/computed tomography (CT); tuberculosis includes lung infiltrate on chest radiography and microbiological confirmation with high local prevalence; obliterative bronchiolitis has younger onset in nonsmokers with a history of rheumatoid arthritis/fume exposure and hypodense areas on expiration on CT; and diffuse panbronchiolitis affects mostly male nonsmokers, almost all have chronic sinusitis, and shows diffuse small centrilobular nodular opacities and hyperinflation on chest radiography and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).

### Histoplasmosis in an elderly Polish tourist-a case report [^115VcE4p]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The final diagnosis of histoplasmosis is often delayed due to lack of specific clinical features and necessity of wide differential diagnosis. In our patient time elapsed from first symptoms to commencement of appropriate therapy was more than 3 months. That was probably related to the fact that frequent travelling by elderly patients to exotic places is relatively new phenomenon in Poland. Thus, epidemiology of tropical diseases and endemic pathogens are not widely known and they are not considered in differential diagnosis. As a result of delayed diagnosis proportion of patients receive unnecessary treatment for common bacterial infections or tuberculosis. Our patient received several antibiotics what may have led to superinfection and another antibiotic therapy. Making the diagnosis was quite difficult as experience in diagnosing and treating histoplasmosis was limited in Poland and some diagnostic tests (antigen detection, molecular methods) were not available. Moreover, the culture was negative what may be explained by the low sensitivity of this method described before. What helped us to confirm the suspicion of histoplasmosis was serology. Its positivity results from an exposure to the fungus at some point in the past, so it should be interpreted cautiously. However, considering the clinical manifestation, recent travel to the endemic area and the lack of exposure in the homeland, positive IgM was interpreted as a reliable confirmation of histoplasmosis in our patient.

In moderately severe or severe forms of pulmonary histoplasmosis, Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends the use of liposomal amphotericin B (3.0–5.0 mg/kg qd intravenously for 1–2 weeks) followed by itraconazole (200 mg tid for 3 days and then 200 mg bid for total of 12 weeks). In patients with low risk of nephrotoxicity alternative therapy includes deoxycholate formulation of amphotericin. Additionally, methylprednisolone during the first 1–2 weeks of antifungal therapy is recommended in patients who develop respiratory complications, including hypoxemia or significant respiratory distress. Prognosis is good, unless the treatment is inadequate.

To conclude, histoplasmosis should be included into differential diagnosis in patients presenting with dyspnea and cough after travelling to endemic areas.

### New international guidelines and consensus on the use of lung ultrasound [^114LVFik]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Future Developments

Harmonize specific protocols by disease/setting of use, such as lung congestion, pulmonary embolism, subpleural consolidation, ICU patient, and athlete after exertion by describing
the image acquisition protocol (including the imaging settings);
the typical LUS patterns w.r.t. the specific disease/setting.

Point‐of‐care US is performed by clinicians at bedside, followed by immediate visual interpretation and clinical integration of the imaging results.

Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (E‐FAST) scan protocol was the first point‐of‐care US examination performed in patients with recent chest trauma.

Starting from the work of Lichtenstein et al, chest ultrasound examination (LUS) has become a widespread practice in the emergency room and intensive care, for the diagnosis of dyspnea.

In particular, since the second decade of the 2000s, many publications were produced on the use of US for the bedside diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema, ARDS, and pneumonia.,

The main users were the emergency physicians and the intensivists, who benefited from the use of US scanners in different areas: emergency rooms, intensive care units, particular environmental rescue conditions.

The main object of interest was the differential diagnoses of dyspnea. LUS was utilized as an effective differential diagnostic tool between heart failure and pleuro‐pulmonary involvement, as well as for questioning pulmonary embolism.

Moreover, the greater sensitivity of US compared with chest X‐ray for detecting subpleural inflammatory consolidations, fostered the wide spreading of bedside diagnoses of pneumonia.

At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, several studies started indicating the possibility of improving the low specificity of the sonographic interstitial syndrome (SIS), which encompasses all vertical artifacts, that is, B‐lines and white lung.

### Not your typical pneumonia: a case of exogenous lipoid pneumonia [^113NpDMa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The constellation of chronic cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis can include a broad range of differential diagnoses. Although uncommon, exogenous lipoid pneumonia (ELP) should be considered when patients present with this symptom complex. We report a case of a 72-year-old female who presented with hemoptysis, cough, and dyspnea. The admission computed tomography scan of the chest revealed progressive interstitial infiltrates. Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse erythema without bleeding. Culture and cytology of lavage fluid were negative. Open-lung biopsy revealed numerous lipid-laden macrophages and multinucleated foreign-body giant cells. On further questioning, the patient admitted to the daily use of mineral oil for constipation. The diagnosis of ELP was made. The literature review revealed that many cases typically present with chronic cough with or without dyspnea. Our case illustrates an unusual presenting symptom of hemoptysis and the need to identify patients who can be at risk of developing this rare condition.

### Malignant pulmonary edema in a pregnant woman caused by cor triatriatum [^116DEVHD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Undiagnosed maternal congenital heart disease can result in significant risks to both mother and fetus. When maternal symptoms and signs are atypical of preeclampsia, broadening the differential diagnosis and multidisciplinary consultation can lead to improved outcomes.

Case

A 24-year-old primiparous woman with a pregnancy complicated by elevated blood pressure and proteinuria presented at term with symptoms of decreased fetal movement, increasing dyspnea, and cough. Her symptoms progressively worsened until she experienced cardiorespiratory arrest during attempted intubation. Emergency cesarean delivery was performed after 5 minutes of resuscitation efforts. Echocardiogram performed after delivery revealed cor triatriatum requiring surgical excision.

Conclusion

A complete differential diagnosis for edema, hypertension, and dyspnea near term will allow for recognition of more rare conditions. Referral to cardiology in cases in which work-up is negative for preeclampsia may aid in earlier diagnosis and management. A team approach to management involving obstetrics and medicine will improve the rapidity with which rare conditions can be managed effectively.
