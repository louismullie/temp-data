## Question

Find side effects of midazolam in sedation dentistry.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the side effects of midazolam when used for sedation in dentistry. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and typical routes/doses used in dental sedation. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence base, especially pediatric dentistry. Next, I will extract and categorize adverse effects by frequency and severity, and reconcile any discrepancies across sources. After that, I should consider dose-response and route-specific risks, including drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized list and outline mitigation strategies with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope. Midazolam is commonly used for minimal to moderate sedation in dentistry, particularly in children, with oral dosing typically 0.25–1.0 mg/kg and intranasal dosing around 0.2–0.5 mg/kg; IV use is less common in general dental practice but may be used by specialists, and all uses require continuous monitoring and readiness to manage airway events [^112pkbVi] [^112qxa9K] [^115beEZ4].

> I need to check the strength of evidence. The most relevant, high-quality synthesis for pediatric dental sedation is the 2018 Cochrane review showing moderate-certainty evidence that oral midazolam improves cooperation versus placebo, albeit with heterogeneity and limited safety granularity, which means I should corroborate adverse event data with FDA labeling and larger observational series to avoid underestimating risks [^117UoWgu].

> Next, I should review respiratory and airway effects because these are the most consequential. Serious cardiorespiratory events including respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respiratory arrest, and even cardiac arrest have been reported, with higher incidence when midazolam is combined with other CNS depressants or when the airway is unprotected during upper airway procedures such as dentistry; capnography and pulse oximetry are recommended to detect early hypoventilation and apnea [^117KcNXf] [^1173N1g9] [^111k7D9i].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about frequency without checking labeled data. FDA materials note decreased tidal volume and/or respiratory rate in 23.3% after IV use and apnea in 15.4% after IV use, but these figures derive from broader sedation contexts and often reflect coadministration with other sedatives; still, they underscore the need for vigilant monitoring and dose titration in dental settings where the airway is shared and unprotected [^11586oos] [^11276vU6].

> I will now examine paradoxical reactions, which are clinically important in pediatrics. Agitation, hyperactivity, combativeness, and involuntary movements occur in about 2% of pediatric IV cases and are also described with oral and intranasal routes; these may reflect dosing issues or true paradoxical responses and can be managed with reassessment, supportive measures, or flumazenil reversal when indicated [^11586oos] [^114XenUC].

> Let me consider CNS and neurobehavioral effects. Somnolence, dizziness, dysarthria, and nystagmus are common; cognitive impairment and anterograde amnesia are expected pharmacologic effects and may be desired for anxiolysis, but they also contribute to post-procedure confusion and delayed recovery, which should be factored into discharge planning and caregiver counseling [^111Ndrhd] [^111h2apP].

> I should confirm gastrointestinal and miscellaneous adverse effects. Nausea and vomiting are relatively common, hiccups and headache are reported, and local irritation or taste disturbance can occur with intranasal administration; these are generally mild but can affect patient comfort and cooperation during dental procedures [^111Ndrhd] [^112bpeLZ].

> But wait, what about dose-response and route-specific nuances. Higher oral doses, particularly above 0.5 mg/kg, are associated with increased adverse events and oversedation, including ataxia, hypotension, and respiratory depression; intranasal dosing around 0.4–0.5 mg/kg appears effective with acceptable safety in pediatric procedural sedation, though local nasal irritation is common and dose-finding studies continue to refine the optimal balance [^1132dZ71] [^115beEZ4].

> I need to ensure I capture drug–drug interaction risks. Concomitant opioids markedly increase the risk of profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death; if opioids are used, doses must be reduced and patients monitored with capnography and pulse oximetry, with flumazenil immediately available for rescue [^117KcNXf] [^114dxXUq] [^116zWzTL].

> Let me synthesize a prioritized, clinically useful list. Very common/important risks include respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, and apnea, especially with IV use or coadministration; common effects include somnolence, dizziness, dysarthria, nystagmus, nausea, vomiting, and paradoxical agitation; uncommon but serious events include laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hypotension, and seizure-like activity, with pediatric patients particularly vulnerable to airway events and oversedation [^11586oos] [^111Ndrhd] [^117JXTep].

> Hold on, I should verify mitigation strategies and documentation needs. Continuous monitoring of ventilation with capnography, pulse oximetry, and clinical assessment is recommended; practitioners must be skilled in airway management and have age-appropriate equipment and reversal agents (flumazenil for benzodiazepines, naloxone if opioids are used) immediately available; dosing should be individualized and titrated to effect with sufficient time between doses to assess peak response, especially with non-IV routes [^111k7D9i] [^116zWzTL] [^111qTdqT].

> Finally, I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with guideline-level advice. Professional guidelines emphasize patient selection, pre-procedure evaluation for airway risk and comorbidities, fasting considerations, and quality improvement processes to minimize adverse events; in pediatric dentistry specifically, oral midazolam remains a reasonable option when used with appropriate monitoring, but alternatives like nitrous oxide or dexmedetomidine combinations may be considered based on procedure type, duration, and patient risk profile [^1127enGm] [^111aQmX7] [^112Dwocf].

---

Midazolam is commonly used for dental sedation because of its rapid onset and short duration, but it carries **clinically important side effects**. The most frequent are **respiratory depression, oxygen desaturation, and paradoxical reactions** (agitation, combativeness), especially in children or when combined with other CNS depressants [^11586oos] [^117UoWgu]. Other common effects include somnolence, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and injection-site pain; serious risks include apnea, airway obstruction, and hypotension, though these are rare with appropriate dosing and monitoring [^117KcNXf] [^1173N1g9]. Midazolam should be titrated cautiously, with continuous monitoring and immediate access to reversal agents and airway equipment to mitigate these risks [^111k7D9i] [^116zWzTL].

---

## Common side effects

- **Respiratory depression and oxygen desaturation**: Frequent with midazolam, particularly when combined with other CNS depressants or in patients with compromised respiratory function [^117KcNXf] [^1173N1g9].

- **Paradoxical reactions**: Agitation, hyperactivity, and combativeness occur in a subset of patients, especially children, and may necessitate discontinuation or reversal [^11586oos] [^114XenUC].

- **Sedation-related effects**: Somnolence, dizziness, and impaired coordination are common and may persist after the procedure, affecting recovery and discharge [^111Ndrhd].

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are reported, particularly with higher doses or rapid administration [^111Ndrhd].

- **Injection-site reactions**: Pain, redness, and induration can occur with intramuscular or intravenous administration [^117Nri57].

---

## Serious adverse effects

- **Respiratory arrest and apnea**: Rare but potentially life-threatening, especially with overdose, rapid IV administration, or concomitant opioid use [^117KcNXf] [^1173N1g9].

- **Airway obstruction and laryngospasm**: More likely in procedures involving the upper airway, such as dental work, and require immediate intervention [^117KcNXf] [^1173N1g9].

- **Hypotension and cardiovascular depression**: Occurs infrequently but may be significant in patients with cardiovascular instability or when combined with other sedatives [^117KcNXf] [^1173N1g9].

- **Seizure-like activity**: Rarely reported, particularly in pediatric patients or with rapid IV administration [^11586oos].

---

## Pediatric-specific considerations

Children are more prone to **paradoxical reactions** and respiratory depression; dosing should be weight-based and carefully titrated [^116J7Mtt]. The most commonly used oral dose is 0.5 mg/kg, with a maximum of 20 mg; higher doses increase the risk of adverse effects [^112pkbVi] [^1132dZ71]. Continuous monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function is essential, and facilities must be equipped to manage airway complications [^112pkbVi].

---

## Factors influencing side effects

Several factors influence the likelihood and severity of side effects:

| **Factor** | **Influence on side effects** |
|-|-|
| Dose and route of administration | Higher doses and IV administration increase risk of respiratory depression and paradoxical reactions [^1132dZ71] [^11586oos] |
| Patient age and comorbidities | Elderly, pediatric, and patients with respiratory or cardiovascular disease are at higher risk [^114XenUC] [^116J7Mtt] |
| Concomitant medications | CNS depressants, including opioids and alcohol, significantly increase risk of respiratory depression and sedation [^117KcNXf] [^1173N1g9] |
| Speed of administration | Rapid IV administration increases risk of respiratory arrest and hypotension [^113A8apc] |

---

## Clinical management and mitigation strategies

- **Pre-procedure assessment**: Evaluate patient history, comorbidities, and concurrent medications to identify risk factors [^1127enGm].

- **Dose titration**: Use the lowest effective dose, titrating slowly to effect, especially in elderly or pediatric patients [^114XenUC] [^116J7Mtt].

- **Continuous monitoring**: Employ pulse oximetry, capnography, and clinical observation throughout sedation [^111k7D9i].

- **Availability of reversal agents**: Ensure flumazenil is readily available for rapid reversal of benzodiazepine effects [^116zWzTL].

- **Airway management**: Maintain equipment and trained personnel for airway support and resuscitation [^112pkbVi].

---

Midazolam is effective for dental sedation but carries meaningful risks, particularly respiratory depression and paradoxical reactions. These risks are **manageable with careful dosing, monitoring, and readiness to intervene**, and clinicians should balance benefits and risks on a case-by-case basis.

### Midazolam for sedation before procedures [^111h2apP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Midazolam is used for sedation before diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures. It is an imidazole benzodiazepine that has depressant effects on the central nervous system (CNS) with rapid onset of action and few adverse effects. The drug can be administered by several routes including oral, intravenous, intranasal and intramuscular.

Objectives

To determine the evidence on the effectiveness of midazolam for sedation when administered before a procedure (diagnostic or therapeutic).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL to January 2016), MEDLINE in Ovid (1966 to January 2016) and Ovid EMBASE (1980 to January 2016). We imposed no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials in which midazolam, administered to participants of any age, by any route, at any dose or any time before any procedure (apart from dental procedures), was compared with placebo or other medications including sedatives and analgesics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each included study. We performed a separate analysis for each different drug comparison.

Main Results

We included 30 trials (2319 participants) of midazolam for gastrointestinal endoscopy (16 trials), bronchoscopy (3), diagnostic imaging (5), cardioversion (1), minor plastic surgery (1), lumbar puncture (1), suturing (2) and Kirschner wire removal (1). Comparisons were: intravenous diazepam (14), placebo (5) etomidate (1) fentanyl (1), flunitrazepam (1) and propofol (1); oral chloral hydrate (4), diazepam (2), diazepam and clonidine (1); ketamine (1) and placebo (3); and intranasal placebo (2). There was a high risk of bias due to inadequate reporting about randomization (75% of trials). Effect estimates were imprecise due to small sample sizes. None of the trials reported on allergic or anaphylactoid reactions. Intravenous midazolam versus diazepam (14 trials; 1069 participants)There was no difference in anxiety (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 1.62; 175 participants; 2 trials) or discomfort/pain (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.49; 415 participants; 5 trials; I² = 67%). Midazolam produced greater anterograde amnesia (RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.66; 587 participants; 9 trials; low-quality evidence). Intravenous midazolam versus placebo (5 trials; 493 participants)One trial reported that fewer participants who received midazolam were anxious (3/47 versus 15/35; low-quality evidence). There was no difference in discomfort/pain identified in a further trial (3/85 in midazolam group; 4/82 in placebo group; P = 0.876; very low-quality evidence). Oral midazolam versus chloral hydrate (4 trials; 268 participants)Midazolam increased the risk of incomplete procedures (RR 4.01; 95% CI 1.92 to 8.40; moderate-quality evidence). Oral midazolam versus placebo (3 trials; 176 participants)Midazolam reduced pain (midazolam mean 2.56 (standard deviation (SD) 0.49); placebo mean 4.62 (SD 1.49); P < 0.005) and anxiety (midazolam mean 1.52 (SD 0.3); placebo mean 3.97 (SD 0.44); P < 0.0001) in one trial with 99 participants. Two other trials did not find a difference in numerical rating of anxiety (mean 1.7 (SD 2.4) for 20 participants randomized to midazolam; mean 2.6 (SD 2.9) for 22 participants randomized to placebo; P = 0.216; mean Spielberger's Trait Anxiety Inventory score 47.56 (SD 11.68) in the midazolam group; mean 52.78 (SD 9.61) in placebo group; P > 0.05). Intranasal midazolam versus placebo (2 trials; 149 participants)Midazolam induced sedation (midazolam mean 3.15 (SD 0.36); placebo mean 2.56 (SD 0.64); P < 0.001) and reduced the numerical rating of anxiety in one trial with 54 participants (midazolam mean 17.3 (SD 18.58); placebo mean 49.3 (SD 29.46); P < 0.001). There was no difference in meta-analysis of results from both trials for risk of incomplete procedures (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.12; downgraded to low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no high-quality evidence to determine if midazolam, when administered as the sole sedative agent prior to a procedure, produces more or less effective sedation than placebo or other medications. There is low-quality evidence that intravenous midazolam reduced anxiety when compared with placebo. There is inconsistent evidence that oral midazolam decreased anxiety during procedures compared with placebo. Intranasal midazolam did not reduce the risk of incomplete procedures, although anxiolysis and sedation were observed. There is moderate-quality evidence suggesting that oral midazolam produces less effective sedation than chloral hydrate for completion of procedures for children undergoing non-invasive diagnostic procedures.

### Midazolam injection, USP CIV (for intravenous or intramuscular use… [^116zfb2f]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioids Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation. Individualization of Dosage. Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine central nervous system depressant. Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including midazolam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. If a decision is made to use midazolam concomitantly with opioids, monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation. Risk of Respiratory Adverse Events Serious cardiorespiratory adverse events have occurred after administration of midazolam.

These have included respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respiratory arrest and/or cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury. There have also been rare reports of hypotensive episodes requiring treatment during or after diagnostic or surgical manipulations particularly in adult or pediatric patients with hemodynamic instability. Hypotension occurred more frequently in the sedation studies in patients premedicated with a narcotic. Reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements, hyperactivity and combativeness have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients. These reactions may be due to inadequate or excessive dosing or improper administration of midazolam hydrochloride; however, consideration should be given to the possibility of cerebral hypoxia or true paradoxical reactions.

Should such reactions occur, the response to each dose of midazolam hydrochloride and all other drugs, including local anesthetics, should be evaluated before proceeding. Reversal of such responses with flumazenil has been reported in pediatric patients. For pediatric patients, particular care should be taken to assure safe ambulation. Use of midazolam late in pregnancy can result in sedation and/or withdrawal symptoms in the neonate. Monitor neonates exposed to midazolam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to midazolam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly.

### Midazolam hydrochloride [^112dmgEP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

The efficacy and safety of midazolam in clinical use are functions of the dose administered, the clinical status of the individual patient, and the use of concomitant medications capable of depressing the CNS. Anticipated effects may range from mild sedation to deep levels of sedation with a potential loss of protective reflexes, particularly when coadministered with anesthetic agents or other CNS depressants. Care must be taken to individualize the dose of midazolam HCl syrup based on the patient's age, underlying medical/surgical conditions, concomitant medications, and to have the personnel, age- and size-appropriate equipment and facilities available for monitoring and intervention. Practitioners administering midazolam must have the skills necessary to manage reasonably foreseeable adverse effects, particularly skills in airway management.

### Sedation of children undergoing dental treatment [^117UoWgu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Children's fear about dental treatment may lead to behaviour management problems for the dentist, which can be a barrier to the successful dental treatment of children. Sedation can be used to relieve anxiety and manage behaviour in children undergoing dental treatment. There is a need to determine from published research which agents, dosages and regimens are effective. This is the second update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2005 and previously updated in 2012.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and relative efficacy of conscious sedation agents and dosages for behaviour management in paediatric dentistry.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 22 February 2018); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 22 February 2018); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 22 February 2018); and Embase Ovid (1980 to 22 February 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected if they met the following criteria: randomised controlled trials of conscious sedation comparing two or more drugs/techniques/placebo undertaken by the dentist or one of the dental team in children up to 16 years of age. We excluded cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted, in duplicate, information regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcome measures and results. Where information in trial reports was unclear or incomplete authors of trials were contacted. Trials were assessed for risk of bias. Cochrane statistical guidelines were followed.

Main Results

We included 50 studies with a total of 3704 participants. Forty studies (81%) were at high risk of bias, nine (18%) were at unclear risk of bias, with just one assessed as at low risk of bias. There were 34 different sedatives used with or without inhalational nitrous oxide. Dosages, mode of administration and time of administration varied widely. Studies were grouped into placebo-controlled, dosage and head-to-head comparisons. Meta-analysis of the available data for the primary outcome (behaviour) was possible for studies investigating oral midazolam versus placebo only. There is moderate-certainty evidence from six small clinically heterogeneous studies at high or unclear risk of bias, that the use of oral midazolam in doses between 0.25 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg is associated with more co-operative behaviour compared to placebo; standardized mean difference (SMD) favoured midazolam (SMD 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59 to 2.33, P < 0.0001, I² = 90%; 6 studies; 202 participants). It was not possible to draw conclusions regarding the secondary outcomes due to inconsistent or inadequate reporting or both.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some moderate-certainty evidence that oral midazolam is an effective sedative agent for children undergoing dental treatment. There is a need for further well-designed and well-reported clinical trials to evaluate other potential sedation agents. Further recommendations for future research are described and it is suggested that future trials evaluate experimental regimens in comparison with oral midazolam or inhaled nitrous oxide.

### Efficacy of oral midazolam for minimal and moderate sedation in pediatric patients: a systematic review [^115cDdfG]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

3.4 Comparison of midazolam doses

The dose most frequently used in the trials, irrespective of the context of sedation, was 0.5 mg/kg. Among all trials, 5 reported response rates at 0.25‐0.3 mg/kg (N = 236), 22 at 0.5 mg/kg (N = 811), 3 at 0.75 mg/kg (N = 55), 5 at 1.0 mg/kg (N = 234), and 1 at 1.5 mg/kg (N = 136). Six of the trials presented dose comparisons. In most cases, statistically significantly higher response rates were shown at doses of 1.0 or 1.5 mg/kg as compared to doses of 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg. However, no statistically significant differences were shown between 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg doses or between 0.75 and 1.0 mg/kg doses.

Some reports conclude that small doses of midazolam (0.25‐0.5 mg/kg) are highly effective and that little advantage is gained by increasing the dose (0.75‐1.5 mg/kg). Among them is a very well‐designed study that enrolled 397 patients and used a 5‐point scale to demonstrate satisfactory sedation at 3 midazolam doses (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg), where response rates of 93.2% (123/132), 97.7% (129/132), and 100% (133/133), respectively, were observed. 18 Two out of the six studies that evaluated different doses did not observe a dose‐response trend and obtained higher response rates at low doses than at high doses. 16, 19

In noncooperative children, midazolam was shown to be efficacious for dental procedures, both when used as premedication before general anesthesia (0.5‐1.0 mg/kg) 20, 21 and for sedation (0.3‐0.5 mg/kg). 19, 22

### Oral midazolam vs. intranasal dexmedetomidine plus oral midazolam for sedation of pediatric outpatients: a double-blinded randomized controlled trial [^114F7V2h]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To identify the safer and more effective sedative for use in pediatric dentistry, various dosages and routes of administration have been explored for multiple sedative drugs. Among them, dexmedetomidine is increasingly used in pediatric sedation. Dexmedetomidine can be administered by intravenous, oral, mucosal, and intramuscular routes. In this study, we used nasal spray administration. In contrast to oral administration, nasal spray administration avoids first-pass hepatic metabolism, providing more reliable absorption. In contrast to intravenous and intramuscular injection, intranasal dexmedetomidine is a noninvasive method of administration, which does not stimulate the nasal mucosa, avoids eliciting patient fear, and is more acceptable to children. Although bradycardia and hypotension are common side effects of dexmedetomidine sedation, intervention is rarely required, as observed in this study. In our clinical experience, we found that sudden arousal in response to stimulation, such as pain or sound stimulation in the procedures, may be a disadvantage of dexmedetomidine as a sole sedative, which resulted in a clinically significant rate of sedation failure, corresponding with previous studies.

### Efficacy of oral midazolam for minimal and moderate sedation in pediatric patients: a systematic review [^116sAiPm]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSION

Oral midazolam is an efficacious medication with an adequate safety profile for use in minimal or moderate sedation in children from 4 months to 18 years old at doses from 0.25 to 1.5 mg/kg. The incidence of adverse events, such as paradoxical reactions and respiratory events, and the risk of over‐sedation increase with increasing doses. Oral midazolam compares well with other alternative noninvasive medications. The need to use validated scales for the evaluation of sedation in future studies is highlighted.

### Practice guidelines for moderate procedural sedation and analgesia 2018: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on moderate procedural sedation and analgesia, the American association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, American college of radiology, American dental association, American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists, and Society of Interventional Radiology [^113R2jfY]. Anesthesiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Moderate procedural sedation and analgesia — evidence collection and analysis included randomized controlled trials, prospective nonrandomized comparative studies, retrospective comparative studies, observational studies, and case reports/case series, while excluding editorials, literature reviews, meta-analyses, abstracts greater than 5 yr old, unpublished studies, studies in non–peer-reviewed journals, and newspaper articles. Evidence linkages assessed for formal meta-analyses included capnography versus blinded capnography, supplemental oxygen versus no supplemental oxygen, midazolam combined with opioids versus midazolam alone, propofol versus midazolam, flumazenil versus placebo for benzodiazepine reversal, and flumazenil versus placebo for reversal of benzodiazepines combined with opioids. For outcomes, fixed and random-effects odds ratios were reported for dichotomous data and raw and standardized mean differences for continuous data, with an acceptable significance level set at P < 0.01, and no search for unpublished studies was conducted.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adverse Reactions in the Controlled Study of Intramuscular Midazolam in Patients with Status Epilepticus

In a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled clinical study, 448 patients were assigned to receive intramuscular (IM) midazolam via an autoinjector, and 445 were assigned to receive intravenous (IV) lorazepam. Approximately 45% of patients were female, and the mean age was 43 years. Patients were administered treatment by a healthcare professional (e.g., paramedic) prior to arrival at a hospital.

Table 1 lists the adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of the IM midazolam-treated patients and at a rate greater than the IV lorazepam-treated patients.

Adverse Reactions in Other Midazolam Studies

Fluctuations in vital signs were the most frequently seen findings following parenteral administration of midazolam in adults for uses other than that for which SEIZALAM is indicated, and included decreased tidal volume and/or respiratory rate decrease [11% of patients following intramuscular administration], as well as variations in blood pressure and pulse rate. The majority of serious adverse effects, particularly those associated with oxygenation and ventilation, have been reported when midazolam was administered with other medications capable of depressing the CNS. The incidence of such events was higher in patients undergoing procedures involving the airway without the protective effect of an endotracheal tube (e.g., upper endoscopy and dental procedures).

The following additional adverse reactions were reported after intramuscular administration in adults: Headache (1.3%), and local effects at the IM injection site including pain (3.7%), induration (0.5%), redness (0.5%), and muscle stiffness (0.3%).

PRECAUTIONS

General

Intravenous doses of midazolam should be decreased for elderly and for debilitated patients (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). These patients will also probably take longer to recover completely after midazolam administration for the induction of anesthesia.

Midazolam does not protect against the increase in intracranial pressure or against the heart rate rise and/or blood pressure rise associated with endotracheal intubation under light general anesthesia.

The efficacy and safety of midazolam in clinical use are functions of the dose administered, the clinical status of the individual patient and the use of concomitant medications capable of depressing the CNS. Anticipated effects range from mild sedation to deep levels of sedation virtually equivalent to a state of general anesthesia where the patient may require external support of vital functions. Care must be taken to individualize and carefully titrate the dose of midazolam to the patient's underlying medical/surgical conditions, administer to the desired effect being certain to wait an adequate time for peak CNS effects of both midazolam and concomitant medications, and have the personnel and size-appropriate equipment and facilities available for monitoring and intervention (see Boxed WARNING, WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Practitioners administering midazolam must have the skills necessary to manage reasonably foreseeable adverse effects, particularly skills in airway management. For information regarding withdrawal, see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE section.

3.5 Effectiveness considering different age groups

The age of the patients included in the different studies is shown in Table 2. The age groups considered in the studies were generally not in agreement with standard ICH pediatric classification, precluding comparison between studies.

When assessed individually, the single study (N = 397) evaluating the efficacy of midazolam in different age groups indicated that, although more children in the youngest group were agitated at baseline, the response rates with midazolam according to sedation criteria were not significantly different across ages, with overall response rates of 97, 96, and 98% for children 6 months to < 2 years, 2 to < 6 years, and 6 to < 16 years, respectively. 18

3.6 Safety

Descriptive and/or quantitative safety information from the selected studies has been summarized in Table 2. The main adverse events observed were paradoxical reactions, nausea and vomiting and respiratory events. According to the available safety data from the studies, higher midazolam doses generally resulted in a higher incidence of adverse events and of cases of over‐sedation (particularly 1‐1.5 mg/kg doses). It has been shown that doses of midazolam higher than 0.5 mg/kg may be associated with increased levels of adverse events such as loss of balance and head control, dysphoria and blurred vision, hypotension, respiratory depression, dysphoric reactions, and ataxia 9, 16, 18 and lead to a higher incidence of deep sedation. 18, 21, 23 Cases of deep sedation with an oral dose of 0.5 mg/kg have also been reported. 24

It was noted that some of the adverse events reported are observed when oral midazolam is used in combination with other drugs (following induction of anesthesia, or after administration of treatments used for local anesthesia, or other medications required for the respective interventions) and can therefore not be attributed to midazolam treatment exclusively.

Anesthesiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Moderate procedural sedation and analgesia practice parameters — literature findings on sedative/opioid combinations and dexmedetomidine indicate that meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing midazolam combined with opioids versus midazolam alone reports equivocal findings for pain and discomfort, hypoxemia, and patient recall of the procedure, and that when midazolam combined with opioids is compared with opioids alone, trials report equivocal findings for patient recall, pain during the procedure, frequency of hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and respiratory depression. Trials comparing dexmedetomidine with midazolam report equivocal outcomes for recovery time, oxygen saturation levels, apnea, and bradycardia, with another trial reporting a longer recovery time for dexmedetomidine alongside otherwise equivocal findings. Additional trials report a lower frequency of hypoxemia when dexmedetomidine is combined with an opioid analgesic compared with midazolam combined with an opioid analgesic, and deeper sedation with a lower frequency of hypoxemia when dexmedetomidine combined with midazolam and meperidine is compared with midazolam combined with meperidine. A titration approach using small, incremental doses compared with a single, rapid bolus reports higher total physician times, medication dosages, frequencies of hypoxemia, and somnolence scores for titration.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

See WARNINGS concerning serious cardiorespiratory events and possible paradoxical reactions. Fluctuations in vital signs were the most frequently seen findings following parenteral administration of midazolam in adults and included decreased tidal volume and/or respiratory rate decrease (23.3% of patients following IV and 10.8% of patients following IM administration) and apnea (15.4% of patients following IV administration), as well as variations in blood pressure and pulse rate. The majority of serious adverse effects, particularly those associated with oxygenation and ventilation, have been reported when midazolam is administered with other medications capable of depressing the central nervous system. The incidence of such events is higher in patients undergoing procedures involving the airway without the protective effect of an endotracheal tube (e.g., upper endoscopy and dental procedures).

### Advantages of sedation with remimazolam compared to midazolam for the removal of impacted Tooth in patients with dental anxiety [^111Kf1fD]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although midazolam is commonly used to sedate patients with dental anxiety, it has shortcomings that reduce the satisfaction of patients and doctors. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the advantages of remimazolam as a sedative.

Methods

The study design was a prospective randomized controlled trial. Patients with dental anxiety and who were to undergo impacted tooth removal were randomized into remimazolam and midazolam groups. They were sedated with remimazolam or midazolam prior to receiving nerve blocker. The predictor variable was the type of sedative, while the primary outcome variables were the onset time, awakening time, recovery time, and postoperative side effects. Secondary outcome variables were the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale score before and after surgery, patient satisfaction and comfort levels scores, and doctor satisfaction level scores. Other variables included the patient demographics and the operation time. Data were analyzed using the Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney test, χ² test, and two-way repeated measurement ANOVA test (SPSS Version 25.0).

Results

A total of 83 patients were included in this study, with 42 randomized to the remimazolam group and 41 to the midazolam group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographic features and operation time. Patients in the remimazolam group had significantly shorter onset time, awakening time, and recovery time compared to those in the midazolam group (each P < .001). Postoperative side effects were more frequent in the midazolam group (P < .001). Following surgery, the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale scores in both groups were significantly lower than prior to surgery (P < .001). Satisfaction levels scores for the patients and doctor were higher in the remimazolam group than in the midazolam group (P < .001).

Conclusions

The use of remimazolam results in faster onset, more rapid recovery, and lower incidence of postoperative side effects compared to midazolam, leading to improved satisfaction for patients and doctors. Remimazolam therefore appears to have several advantages over midazolam for the sedation of patients with dental anxiety associated with the removal of impacted teeth.

### A comparison of four sedation techniques for pediatric dental surgery [^115j1Tev]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

We prospectively assessed the efficacy and side effects of four sedation techniques in our dental clinic: oral midazolam, intranasal (IN) midazolam, IN midazolam combined with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC), and IN midazolam combined with IN sufentanil.

Materials & Methods

With IRB approval, a nonrandomized open label study of moderate sedation in children undergoing dental surgery was administered during a 6 -month period. The sedation regimen was rotated daily at the anesthesiologist's discretion. Each sedation was monitored by a research nurse who assessed the quality of sedation and the frequency of complications. All children were monitored during the procedure and recovery for at least 20 min, before discharge based on the University of Michigan Sedation and Ohio State behavior rating scores.

Results

One hundred and two children were sedated in the dental clinic during this period. The sedation was successful in 73% (range 64% to 88%) of the children. The time to onset was greatest with OTFC (37 min) and least with IN midazolam (17 min) compared with the other two groups (20 and 30 min). Recovery after OTFC was prolonged (39 min) significantly compared with the other three groups (26.5–30 min). Efficacy of sedation and frequency of complications (9% incidence of nausea and 6% of mild hemoglobin desaturation) were similar among the groups.

Conclusions

All four sedation regimens were equally effective in this cohort of healthy children. The onset and recovery with OTFC was significantly delayed compared with the other regimens. The frequency of side effects was small; there were no side effects in the PO midazolam group.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

NOTE: CONTAINS BENZYL ALCOHOL (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use)

Midazolam is a potent sedative agent that requires slow administration and individualization of dosage. Clinical experience has shown midazolam to be 3 to 4 times as potent per mg as diazepam. BECAUSE SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING CARDIORESPIRATORY ADVERSE EVENTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED, PROVISION FOR MONITORING, DETECTION AND CORRECTION OF THESE REACTIONS MUST BE MADE FOR EVERY PATIENT TO WHOM MIDAZOLAM INJECTION IS ADMINISTERED, REGARDLESS OF AGE OR HEALTH STATUS. Excessive single doses or rapid intravenous administration may result in respiratory depression, airway obstruction and/or arrest. The potential for these latter effects is increased in debilitated patients, those receiving concomitant medications capable of depressing the CNS, and patients without an endotracheal tube but undergoing a procedure involving the upper airway such as endoscopy or dental (see Boxed WARNING and WARNINGS .)

Reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements, hyperactivity and combativeness have been reported in adult and pediatric patients. Should such reactions occur, caution should be exercised before continuing administration of midazolam (see WARNINGS).

Midazolam Injection should only be administered IM or IV (see WARNINGS).

Care should be taken to avoid intra-arterial injection or extravasation (see WARNINGS). Midazolam Injection may be mixed in the same syringe with the following frequently used premedications: morphine sulfate, meperidine, atropine sulfate or scopolamine. Midazolam, at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, is compatible with 5% dextrose in water and 0.9% sodium chloride for up to 24 hours and with lactated Ringer's solution for up to 4 hours. Both the 1 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL formulations of midazolam may be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in water.

2 RESEARCH STRATEGY

2.1 Literature search

A systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to identify clinical studies evaluating the use of oral midazolam in pediatric patients in the context either of premedication before anesthesia for surgical procedures or during diagnostic or treatment procedures. Articles were identified from electronic resources including PubMed and ScienceDirect (eg, MEDLINE search ("midazolam"[MeSH Terms] OR "midazolam"[All Fields]) AND "sedation"[All Fields] AND ("child"[MeSH Terms] OR "child"[All Fields] OR "children"[All Fields]) AND ("pediatrics"[MeSH Terms] OR "pediatrics"[All Fields] OR "pediatric"[All Fields])) and by manual searches from further evaluation of key review articles and bibliographies of articles. All studies published or in press between January 1988 and March 2016, and written in English, were considered.

2.2 Study selection and outcomes

Only randomized studies that assessed the efficacy of midazolam as a sole medication using evaluation scales related to minimal/moderate sedation, and where the effectiveness of oral midazolam for sedation in terms of number of responders with respect to the number of treated children (generally within 30‐45 minutes postadministration, and up to 1 hour) was reported, were considered. All studies evaluating moderate sedation using discrete sedation scales were selected.

The outcome used for comparison purposes was the proportion of patients considered adequately sedated for the specific intervention (response rate), as detailed in each study. Studies that used placebo, other drugs, different oral midazolam doses, different oral midazolam preparations, or other routes of administration as comparators were acceptable. Information about comparators used in the different studies was extracted. Observations regarding vital signs and reported adverse events were summarized.

Other Adverse Events

Reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements (including tonic/clonic movements and muscle tremor), hyperactivity and combativeness have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients. These reactions may be due to inadequate or excessive dosing or improper administration of midazolam hydrochloride; however, consideration should be given to the possibility of cerebral hypoxia or true paradoxical reactions. Should such reactions occur, the response to each dose of midazolam hydrochloride and all other drugs, including local anesthetics, should be evaluated before proceeding. Reversal of such responses with flumazenil has been reported in pediatric patients.

Concomitant Use of Central Nervous System Depressants

Concomitant use of barbiturates, alcohol or other central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, desaturation, or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect. Narcotic premedication also depresses the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation.

Debilitation and Comorbid Considerations

Higher risk adult and pediatric surgical patients, elderly patients and debilitated adult and pediatric patients require lower dosages, whether or not concomitant sedating medications have been administered. Adult or pediatric patients with COPD are unusually sensitive to the respiratory depressant effect of midazolam hydrochloride. Pediatric and adult patients undergoing procedures involving the upper airway such as upper endoscopy or dental care, are particularly vulnerable to episodes of desaturation and hypoventilation due to partial airway obstruction. Adult and pediatric patients with chronic renal failure and patients with congestive heart failure eliminate midazolam more slowly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Because elderly patients frequently have inefficient function of one or more organ systems and because dosage requirements have been shown to decrease with age, reduced initial dosage of midazolam hydrochloride is recommended, and the possibility of profound and/or prolonged effect should be considered.

Injectable midazolam should not be administered to adult or pediatric patients in shock or coma, or in acute alcohol intoxication with depression of vital signs. Particular care should be exercised in the use of intravenous midazolam in adult or pediatric patients with uncompensated acute illnesses, such as severe fluid or electrolyte disturbances.

Risk of Intra-arterial Injection

There have been limited reports of intra-arterial injection of midazolam hydrochloride. Adverse events have included local reactions, as well as isolated reports of seizure activity in which no clear causal relationship was established. Precautions against unintended intra-arterial injection should be taken. Extravasation should also be avoided.

The safety and efficacy of midazolam following nonintravenous and nonintramuscular routes of administration have not been established. Midazolam hydrochloride should only be administered intramuscularly or intravenously.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Midazolam HCl syrup is indicated for use as a single dose (0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 20 mg) for preprocedural sedation and anxiolysis in pediatric patients. Midazolam HCl syrup is not intended for chronic administration.

Monitoring

Midazolam HCl syrup should only be used in hospital or ambulatory care settings, including physicians' and dentists' offices that can provide for continuous monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function. Immediate availability of resuscitative drugs and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag/valve/mask ventilation and intubation, and personnel trained in their use and skilled in airway management should be assured [see WARNINGS]. For deeply sedated patients, a dedicated individual whose sole responsibility it is to observe the patient, other than the practitioner performing the procedure, should monitor the patient throughout the procedure. Continuous monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function is required.

Midazolam HCl syrup must be given only to patients if they will be monitored by direct visual observation by a health care professional. Midazolam HCl syrup should only be administered by persons specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of respiratory effects of anesthetic drugs, including respiratory and cardiac resuscitation of patients in the age group being treated.

Patient response to sedative agents, and resultant respiratory status, is variable. Regardless of the intended level of sedation or route of administration, sedation is a continuum; a patient may move easily from light to deep sedation, with potential loss of protective reflexes, particularly when coadministered with anesthetic agents, other CNS depressants, and concomitant medications which may potentially cause a more intense and prolonged sedation [see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions]. This is especially true in pediatric patients. The health care practitioner who uses this medication in pediatric patients should be aware of and follow accepted professional guidelines for pediatric sedation appropriate to their situation.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Intravenous doses of midazolam hydrochloride should be decreased for elderly and for debilitated patients (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). These patients will also probably take longer to recover completely after midazolam administration for the induction of anesthesia.

Midazolam does not protect against the increase in intracranial pressure or against the heart rate rise and/or blood pressure rise associated with endotracheal intubation under light general anesthesia.

The efficacy and safety of midazolam in clinical use are functions of the dose administered, the clinical status of the individual patient, and the use of concomitant medications capable of depressing the CNS. Anticipated effects range from mild sedation to deep levels of sedation virtually equivalent to a state of general anesthesia where the patient may require external support of vital functions. Care must be taken to individualize and carefully titrate the dose of midazolam hydrochloride to the patient's underlying medical/surgical conditions, administer to the desired effect being certain to wait an adequate time for peak CNS effects of both midazolam hydrochloride and concomitant medications, and have the personnel and size-appropriate equipment and facilities available for monitoring and intervention (see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Practitioners administering midazolam hydrochloride must have the skills necessary to manage reasonably foreseeable adverse effects, particularly skills in airway management. For information regarding withdrawal (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

Parenteral medications are titrated in the oral and maxillofacial surgery office to achieve moderate sedation, deep sedation, or general anesthesia while continuously maintaining spontaneous ventilation with an open airway. After initial drug administration, the provider assesses and interprets both the level of anesthesia and the presence/severity of adverse side effects, both of which guide further drug titration, cessation, reversal, or medical management. This assessment is called monitoring, which guides the conduct of anesthesia delivery and becomes the essence of this art.

The studies presented high variability, with response rates [95% confidence interval] in anesthetic premedication ranging from 36.7% [21.6%, 54.9%] to 97.0% [94.8%, 98.3%] and from 56.1% [43.1%‐68.4] to 97.8% [86.1%, 99.7%] in medical procedures (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Response rates (95% CI) in the different contexts of sedation in pediatric patients receiving oral midazolam. n: number of responders, N, number of subjects

Although it could be argued that different sedation criteria should be used between premedication and sedation before procedures, the reality of the studies was that differences observed in sedation scales or success criteria were not associated with the context of sedation (there were studies with nonrestrictive and more restrictive success criteria both for medical procedures and for premedication before anesthesia). There was no apparent difference in terms of response rates between both contexts of sedation.

Only six of the studies fulfilled the selection criteria for sedation before procedures, and therefore, limited information could be gathered from studies performed in this indication. The effectiveness of midazolam in children undergoing procedures, such as dental treatment, has already been reported in a previous review. 14

Tolerability of Intranasal Midazolam Administration for Antiseizure Treatment in Adults

Nine of 12 (75%) studies reported side effects in detail. The most commonly reported adverse events after in-MDZ administration were dizziness (three studies; mean 23.5% [SD 38.6%]), confusion (one study; 17.4%), local irritation (eight studies; mean 16.6% [SD 9.6%]), sedation (eight studies; mean 12.7% [SD 9.7%]), and respiratory difficulties (three studies; mean 5.7% [SD 9.8%]; Fig. 3). Less common adverse events included nausea (three studies; mean 4.9% [SD 4.1%]), abnormal product taste (three studies; mean 4% [SD 2.2%]), suicidal ideation (one study; 3.6%), headache (six studies; mean 2.6% [SD 2.7%]), convulsions (one study; 3%), and restlessness (one study; 2%). In the two studies with (administered or at least recommended) a higher in-MDZ dose (10 mg), there was no excess of respiratory depression reported. However, in one of the two studies, which reported adverse effects in detail, a relatively high proportion of patients reported drowsiness (two of three study participants). In addition, one study reported that 21.7% of patients treated with in-MDZ had tongue bites compared to 7.4% in the intravenous lorazepam group (not statistically significant). Only three studies provided data on reported side effects with either midazolam administered via different routes or other benzodiazepines.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections:

Cardiorespiratory Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Paradoxical Behavior [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Dependence and Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
Impaired Cognitive Function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]
Hypotension and Seizure in Preterm Infants and Neonates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]
Pediatric Neurotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]

The following adverse reactions have been identified from literature or postmarketing reports of midazolam. Because some of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Fluctuations in vital signs were the most frequently seen findings following parenteral administration of midazolam in adults and included decreased tidal volume and/or respiratory rate decrease (23.3% of patients following intravenous administration) and apnea (15.4% of patients following intravenous administration), as well as variations in blood pressure and pulse rate. The majority of serious adverse reactions, particularly those associated with oxygenation and ventilation, have been reported when midazolam is administered with other medications capable of depressing the central nervous system. The incidence of such events is higher in patients undergoing procedures involving the airway without the protective effect of an endotracheal tube, (e.g., upper endoscopy and dental procedures).

Pediatric Patients

The following adverse events related to the use of intravenous midazolam in pediatric patients were reported in the medical literature: desaturation 4.6%, apnea 2.8%, hypotension 2.7%, paradoxical reactions 2.0%, hiccough 1.2%, seizure-like activity 1.1% and nystagmus 1.1%. The majority of airway-related events occurred in patients receiving other CNS depressing medications and in patients where midazolam was not used as a single sedating agent.

Neonates

There have been reports of hypotensive episodes and seizures following the administration of midazolam to neonates, [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

### Efficacy of oral midazolam for minimal and moderate sedation in pediatric patients: a systematic review [^112r5Sc8]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

One of the most widely used options for minimal/moderate sedation in pediatric patients is oral midazolam, as it presents an alternative to less well‐accepted routes of administration (eg, intravenous or intranasal) of this well‐known efficacious and well‐tolerated short‐acting benzodiazepine. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to identify clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of oral midazolam for sedation in pediatric patients in the context of premedication before anesthesia or during diagnostic/treatment procedures. The percentage of responders (response rate) after single administration of oral midazolam was evaluated and compared versus placebo in a subset of placebo‐controlled studies. The range of oral midazolam doses providing effective sedation in the different pediatric age subsets was analyzed in order to assess optimum dosing strategies. A total of 25 pediatric clinical studies, utilizing a variety of measures of sedation effectiveness, were selected. These studies included a total of 1472 patients (aged 4 months‐18 years) treated with midazolam (0.25‐1.5 mg/kg) and 138 patients treated with placebo. The response rates [95% confidence interval] with oral midazolam ranged from 36.7% [21.6%, 54.9%] to 97.8% [86.1%, 99.7%], while with placebo response rates ranged from 4.0% [0.6%, 23.5%] to 41.0% [29.4%, 53.6%]. When considering the 4 placebo‐controlled studies, the odds ratios [95% confidence interval] for the comparison of midazolam vs. placebo ranged from 13.4 [5.0, 36.0] to 25.9 [6.7, 100.6]. The analysis of subgroups by context of sedation showed response rates [95% confidence interval] with oral midazolam ranging from 36.7% [21.6%, 54.9%] to 97.0% [94.8%, 98.3%] for anesthetic premedication and from 56.1% [43.1%, 68.4] to 97.8% [86.1%, 99.7%] for medical procedures. The efficacy of midazolam for pediatric minimal/moderate sedation from a dose of 0.25 mg/kg and above was demonstrated. The probability of occurrence of adverse events and over‐sedation increases with increasing doses.

### Does sevoflurane add to outpatient procedural sedation in children? A randomised clinical trial [^112znrBE]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Paediatric sedation outside of the operating room is a growing theme in the anaesthesiology field. Few new sedatives have been launched in the last decade, which suggests the need for further development of new routes and methods for delivery of existing anaesthetic agents.

Sevoflurane, "a near-perfect anaesthetic", has been used for procedural sedation in an outpatient basis and in intensive care units. However, there is little evidence of its effectiveness and safety in the paediatric population for a variety of procedures, including color Doppler ultrasound examination, voiding cystourethrography, gastrointestinal endoscopy, placement of central catheter in neonatal intensive care, magnetic resonance imaging, and dental treatment.

In paediatric dentistry, inhalation sedation with sevoflurane and nitrous oxide has reached success rates varying from 80 to 92%, which are increased to up 99% when intravenous midazolam and fentanyl are added as an alternative to general anesthesia. A systematic review concluded that there is a need for clinical trials on sedation agents for dental treatment since only the agents that showed some (weak-very weak) evidence of effectiveness were oral midazolam and nitrous oxide inhalation.

Among the aforementioned studies, there were only 3 clinical trials conducted in the dental setting; however, these studies did not examine the effects of sevoflurane as the sole gas inhaled anaesthetic agent (without nitrous oxide). Additional information is needed to add to the development of the outpatient sedation technique with sevoflurane. Thus, we performed this clinical trial with the aim of assessing the effect of sevoflurane during dental treatment in children aged 4 to 6 years old. We hypothesised adding sevoflurane to a sedation regimen would improve children's behaviour with minimal adverse events.

### The failed sedation: solutions for the oral and maxillofacial surgeon [^114Hrw3w]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Due to wide variation in patient responses, both intended and adverse, it is impossible to successfully sedate all patients. Choosing the right drug and dose regimen can be challenging, especially in patients who are naïve to anesthesia. Underdosing can lead to pain perception, patient movement and combativeness, awareness with recall, and the sympathetic neuroendocrine stress response. Overdosing can lead to unintended loss of upper airway tone, hypoventilation/apnea, adverse cardiovascular changes, and prolonged sedation (with its attendant problems).

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the rate of successful sedation for dental treatment. Secondary outcomes were the dental treatment success rate, intraoperative or postoperative adverse events and parental satisfaction with the sedation treatment.

The RSS was used to evaluate each participant's sedation status during dental treatment. Patient behavior during sedation was evaluated using the Frankl scale (Table 1). Evaluation of completion of treatment under sedation was evaluated by the Houpt scale (Table 1). The above scales were evaluated every 5 min after treatment. The score with the most occurrences was recorded as the final score of the scale. Frankl scale scores of 1 or 2 were considered sedation failure, and scores of 3 or 4 were considered sedation success. Furthermore, Houpt scale scores of 1 or 2 were considered treatment failure, and scores of 3–6 were considered treatment success. These evaluations were performed by the blinded observer previously trained by theoretically and practically.

Unexpected and undesirable responses to sedatives that threaten or cause patient injury or discomfort were defined as adverse events, in accordance with the World Society of Intravenous Anesthesia International Sedation Task Force Tool. Such events included agitation, drowsiness, motor imbalance, dizziness, respiratory distress, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal symptoms, and any other unexpected or undesirable responses to sedatives that could threaten or cause patient injury or discomfort. The blinded observer registered all adverse events during and after the dental sedation procedure (both in the procedure room and recovery room). 24 h after treatment, the blinded observer interviewed the participant's parents by anonymous e-mail questionnaires about whether their child had any adverse events, whether the parents were satisfied with the sedation treatment (very satisfied, generally satisfied or dissatisfied). The above procedures did not change after the start of the trial.

Moderate procedural sedation and analgesia practice parameters — recommendations for sedative or analgesic medications not intended for general anesthesia specify that combinations of sedative and analgesic agents may be administered as appropriate for the procedure and condition of the patient, that each component should be administered individually to achieve the desired effect, and that dexmedetomidine may be administered as an alternative to benzodiazepine sedatives on a case-by-case basis. A related caution notes that the propensity for combinations of sedative and analgesic agents to cause respiratory depression and airway obstruction emphasizes the need to appropriately reduce the dose of each component and to continually monitor respiratory function.

Moderate sedation/analgesia — purposes and risk considerations — include that "the purposes of these guidelines are to allow clinicians to optimize the benefits of moderate procedural sedation regardless of site of service; to guide practitioners in appropriate patient selection; to decrease the risk of adverse patient outcomes (e.g., apnea, airway obstruction, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, death); to encourage sedation education, training, and research; and to offer evidence-based data to promote cross-specialty consistency for moderate sedation practice". "Moderate sedation/analgesia provides patient tolerance of unpleasant or prolonged procedures through relief of anxiety, discomfort, and/or pain". If depth becomes excessive, "these sedation practices can be associated with cardiac or respiratory depression that must be rapidly recognized and appropriately managed to avoid the risk of hypoxic brain damage, cardiac arrest, or death". Conversely, "inadequate sedation or analgesia can result in unplanned patient discomfort or patient injury, lack of cooperation, or adverse physiological or psychological responses to stress". Technique selection depends on multiple factors: "The appropriate choice of agents and techniques for moderate sedation/analgesia is dependent upon the experience, training, and preference of the individual practitioner, requirements or constraints imposed by associated medical issues of the patient or type of procedure, and the risk of producing a deeper level of sedation than anticipated". In addition, "the choice of agents or techniques are limited by federal, state, or municipal regulations or statutes".

### What works and what's safe in pediatric emergency procedural sedation: an overview of reviews [^115RUKdT]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Midazolam, administered through various routes, is the most commonly used benzodiazepine for procedural sedation. Midazolam alone was found not to provide reliable sedation for procedures. 7, 20 Its safety, effectiveness and duration of sedation, and the timing of adverse effects could not be reliably predicted. 19 Midazolam has been combined with fentanyl, ketamine, propofol, or nitrous oxide to produce deep sedation with analgesia, but is associated with adverse effects including apnea, 19 laryngospasm, 17, 19 bradycardia, 17 and/or hypotension. 19

Propofol, alone 18 or when combined with opiates, can be titrated to achieve varied levels of sedation. 17, 20 In one review it was not as effective as ketamine. 12 The use of propofol for procedural sedation presents a risk of potentially serious adverse effects, especially respiratory depression, airway obstruction, 17, 18, 20 and hypotension. 12 These may be exacerbated when used with opioids. Propofol is associated with a low risk of adverse effects, including assisted ventilation, 8, 17, 19, 20 desaturation, 8, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20 emesis, 8, 19, 20 and pain with injections. 8, 18, 19

The advantage of propofol is that recovery time and total sedation time are shorter than other treatment modalities. 12, 20 Further, propofol may require only a single loading dose to produce sedation. 2, 4, 25 When provided by an experienced individual, propofol appears safe with high satisfaction ratings from patients and parents. 2, 4 Propofol has been known to cause pain on injections, which may be reduced by administering a small amount of lidocaine prior to the propofol or delivering the sedative via a large vein. 26

Ketamine has been widely used since 1970. It provides a unique dissociative state and is well tolerated and effective and preserves upper‐airway reflexes, making it ideal for sedation in the ED. 2, 4, 25, 27 Consistently found to be one of the most effective medications for procedural sedation, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20 ketamine can be titrated intravenously, or administered as a bolus intramuscularly. 14, 20

### Speed of recovery and side-effect profile of sevoflurane sedation compared with midazolam [^115agMtL]. Anesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Sedation for surgical procedures performed with regional or local anesthesia has usually been achieved with intravenous medications, whereas the use of volatile anesthetics has been limited. The use of sevoflurane for sedation has been suggested because of its characteristics of nonpungency, rapid induction, and quick elimination. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the quality, recovery, and side effects of sevoflurane sedation compared with midazolam.

Methods

One hundred seventy-three patients undergoing surgery with local or regional anesthesia were enrolled in a multicenter, open-label, randomized investigation comparing sedation with sevoflurane versus midazolam. Sedation level was titrated to an Observer's Assessment of Alertness — Sedation score of 3 (responds slowly to voice). Recovery was assessed objectively by Observer's Assessment of Alertness — Sedation, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and memory scores, and subjectively by visual analog scales.

Results

Significantly more patients in the sevoflurane group had to be converted to general anesthesia because of excessive movement (18 sevoflurane and 2 midazolam; P = 0.043). Of remaining patients, 141 were assessable for efficacy and recovery data (93 sevoflurane and 48 midazolam). Sevoflurane and midazolam produced dose-related sedation. Sevoflurane patients had higher DSST and memory scores during recovery. Seventy-six percent (sevoflurane) compared with 35% (midazolam) returned to baseline DSST at 30 min postoperatively (P < 0.05). More frequent excitement-disinhibition was observed with sevoflurane (15 [16%] vs. midazolam; P = 0.008).

Conclusions

Sevoflurane for sedation produces faster recovery of cognitive function as measured by DSST and memory scores compared with midazolam. However, sevoflurane for sedation is complicated by a high incidence of intraoperative excitement.

Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including midazolam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. If a decision is made to use midazolam concomitantly with opioids, monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions).

Risk of Respiratory Adverse Events

Serious cardiorespiratory adverse events have occurred after administration of midazolam. These have included respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respiratory arrest and/or cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury. There have also been rare reports of hypotensive episodes requiring treatment during or after diagnostic or surgical manipulations particularly in adult or pediatric patients with hemodynamic instability. Hypotension occurred more frequently in the sedation studies in patients premedicated with a narcotic.

Individualization of Dosage

Midazolam must never be used without individualization of dosage particularly when used with other medications capable of producing central nervous system depression. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for complete information.

Other Adverse Events

Reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements (including tonic/clonic movements and muscle tremor), hyperactivity and combativeness have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients. These reactions may be due to inadequate or excessive dosing or improper administration of midazolam; however, consideration should be given to the possibility of cerebral hypoxia or true paradoxical reactions. Should such reactions occur, the response to each dose of midazolam and all other drugs, including local anesthetics, should be evaluated before proceeding. Reversal of such responses with flumazenil has been reported in pediatric patients.

### Oral midazolam vs. intranasal dexmedetomidine plus oral midazolam for sedation of pediatric outpatients: a double-blinded randomized controlled trial [^115JDFFM]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Children are a unique group of dental patients, such that invasive oral treatment of children is the most challenging clinical task for many dentists. In many countries, the prevalence of dental anxiety in adolescents was estimated to range from 5–20%. Children's anxiety concerning dental treatment may lead to behavioral management problems, which interfere with successful dental treatment. To relieve children's anxiety and manage their behavior, pharmacologic sedation and analgesia are commonly used.

Oral midazolam is an effective sedative agent for children undergoing dental treatment. However, because of first-pass hepatic metabolism, it is difficult to accurately calculate the effective dose absorbed. Therefore, the sedative effect cannot be adjusted and titrated, causing large individual differences, and widely variable sedation success rate (e.g. from 30–70%). Accordingly, some children require additional sedatives. Previous reports have demonstrated that when buccal midazolam is added to intranasal dexmedetomidine, the successful sedation rate for computerized tomography (CT) and/or auditory brainstem response test (ABR) is higher than oral chloral hydrate or intranasal dexmedetomidine in children. However, this combination has only been studied in children undergoing short and non-stimulating procedures. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of well-designed trials concerning the efficacy of intranasal dexmedetomidine combined with oral midazolam in uncooperative children undergoing dental treatment. This trial evaluated the efficacy of combined treatment with dexmedetomidine and midazolam, compared to oral midazolam alone.

### Guidelines for monitoring and management of pediatric patients before, during, and after sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures: update 2016 [^111aQmX7]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Goals of sedation and drug selection — stated goals are to guard the patient's safety and welfare; to minimize physical discomfort and pain; to control anxiety, minimize psychological trauma, and maximize the potential for amnesia; to modify behavior and/or movement so as to allow the safe completion of the procedure; and to return the patient to a state in which discharge from medical/dental supervision is safe, as determined by recognized criteria. These goals "can best be achieved by selecting the lowest dose of drug with the highest therapeutic index for the procedure", and "the selection of the fewest number of drugs and matching drug selection to the type and goals of the procedure are essential for safe practice". For painful procedures, analgesic medications are indicated, whereas for nonpainful procedures sedatives/hypnotics are preferred; when both sedation and analgesia are desirable (eg, fracture reduction), either single agents with analgesic/sedative properties or combination regimens are commonly used. "Anxiolysis and amnesia are additional goals that should be considered in the selection of agents for particular patients", and "the potential for an adverse outcome may be increased when 2 or more sedating medications are administered". The document also notes renewed interest in noninvasive routes (including intranasal and inhaled routes such as nitrous oxide) and states that "Knowledge of each drug's time of onset, peak response, and duration of action is important", with "Titration of drug to effect" described as "an important concept".

### Assessment of valeriana officinalis L. (valerian) for conscious sedation of patients during the extraction of impacted mandibular third molars: a Randomized, split-mouth, double-blind, crossover study [^111y8ZY7]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an herbal drug (valerian) to control anxiety during mandibular third molar extraction compared with a reference benzodiazepine drug commonly used in dental procedures (midazolam).

Materials and Methods

Twenty anxious patients with an indication for bilateral extraction of mandibular third molars were selected. The patients received capsules containing valerian 100 mg or midazolam 15 mg orally 60 minutes before the procedures in a randomized, split-mouth, crossover design. Changes in the physiological parameters (eg, oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) were assessed at specific times during surgery, and the patients completed a questionnaire postoperatively. The data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon and paired t tests, with a significance level of 5%.

Results

No statistically significant differences in oxygen saturation were observed, regardless of the drug used. However, the other physiological parameters were significantly lower when the patients had taken midazolam compared with valerian. Somnolence was the most common side effect reported with both drugs.

Conclusions

Although midazolam was more effective in reducing the physiological parameters studied, valerian seemed to provide the comfort and relaxation required, with no sedation and less somnolence than midazolam, during third molar extraction. Further studies are necessary before valerian can be clinically recommended.

Dental anxiety is a leading cause of postponing treatment and/or complete avoidance of professional oral care. Therefore, effective sedation and pain control are integral components of dental care for the fearful and anxious patient. The application of oral sedation aids the trained practitioner to provide care to the anxious dental patient and remains the safest, most established, and most commonly used route of drug administration. Proper training and understanding of pharmacologic properties allows for safe and effective application of analgesics and sedatives for oral sedation.

### Sedation with midazolam leads to reduced pain after dental surgery [^111qFwp7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Our principal objective in this study was to evaluate the potential pain reducing effect of i.v. midazolam in patients undergoing oral surgery. One-hundred-twenty-five patients with impacted mandibular third molars requiring removal under local anesthetic were randomized into 2 groups. The first group (n = 64) was administered i.v. midazolam by titration until a clinical end-point of conscious sedation followed by local anesthetic before surgery; the second group (n = 61) was the control and was administered only local anesthetic before surgery. The surgery was performed in a standardized manner in both groups by the same surgeon. Outcome measures were four primary end-points: pain intensity as assessed by a 100-mm visual analogue scale and a 4-point categorized scale hourly for 8 h, time to first analgesic, total analgesic (ibuprofen) consumption over the first 48 h, and a 5-point categorical patient global assessment scale (0 = poor, 1 = fair, 2 = good, 3 = very good, and 4 = excellent). Throughout the 8-h investigation period, patients in the midazolam group reported significantly lower pain intensity scores than those in the control group (19.0 ± 13.2 mm versus 28.1 ± 12.8 mm, P < 0.05). The patients in the midazolam group also reported significantly longer time to first analgesic (165.5 ± 56.5 min versus 202.2 ± 79.0 min, P < 0.05), less analgesic consumption (1275 ± 364 mg versus 1688 ± 407 mg, P < 0.001) and better patient global assessment (3.34 ± 0.8 versus 2.4 ± 0.9, P < 0.001). We conclude that systemically administered midazolam is effective in reducing postoperative pain after third molar surgery.

Implications

In this observer blinded study, we found that i.v. midazolam treatment (0.09 mg/kg) has a pain-reducing effect after third molar surgery, thus improving postoperative pain management.

Anesthesiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Randomized controlled trials of ketamine and etomidate — comparative sedation effects: RCTs comparing ketamine with propofol report equivocal findings for sedation scores, pain during the procedure, oxygen saturation levels, and recovery scores, while RCTs comparing ketamine with etomidate report less airway assistance required and lower frequencies of myoclonus with ketamine; one RCT comparing ketamine combined with midazolam versus midazolam combined with alfentanil reports a lower frequency of hypoxemia but increased disruptive movements, longer recovery times, and longer times to discharge for the ketamine–midazolam combination. Among etomidate combinations, one RCT comparing etomidate plus fentanyl versus midazolam plus fentanyl reports deeper sedation with the combination group, with equivocal findings for timing and oxygenation measures and a higher frequency of myoclonus, while another RCT comparing etomidate plus morphine and fentanyl versus midazolam plus morphine and fentanyl reports shorter sedation times for the etomidate combination with equivocal oxygenation and ventilation findings but a higher frequency of patient recall and myoclonus; an additional RCT found intravenous ketamine versus intramuscular ketamine had shorter sedation onset and recovery times and fewer rescue doses administered, with equivocal findings for sedation efficacy, respiratory depression, and time to discharge.

### Midazolam [^1141PuSw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Injectable midazolam can also be used during maintenance of anesthesia, for surgical procedures, as a component of balanced anesthesia. Effective narcotic premedication is especially recommended in such cases.

Incremental injections of approximately 25% of the induction dose should be given in response to signs of lightening of anesthesia and repeated as necessary.

CONTINUOUS INFUSION

For continuous infusion, midazolam 5 mg/mL formulation is recommended diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5%

dextrose in water.

Usual Adult Dose:

If a loading dose is necessary to rapidly initiate sedation, 0.01 to 0.05 mg/kg (approximately 0.5 to 4 mg for a typical adult) may be given slowly or infused over several minutes. This dose may be repeated at 10 to 15 minute intervals until adequate sedation is achieved. For maintenance of sedation, the usual initial infusion rate is 0.02 to 0.10 mg/kg/hr (1 to 7 mg/hr). Higher loading or maintenance infusion rates may occasionally be required in some patients.

The lowest recommended doses should be used in patients with residual effects from anesthetic drugs, or in those concurrently receiving other sedatives or opioids.

Individual response to midazolam is variable. The infusion rate should be titrated to the desired level of sedation, taking into account the patient's age, clinical status and current medications. In general, midazolam should be infused at the lowest rate that produces the desired level of sedation. Assessment of sedation should be performed at regular intervals and the midazolam infusion rate adjusted up or down by 25% to 50% of the initial infusion rate so as to assure adequate titration of sedation level. Larger adjustments or even a small incremental dose may be necessary if rapid changes in the level of sedation are indicated. In addition, the infusion rate should be decreased by 10% to 25% every few hours to find the minimum effective infusion rate. Finding the minimum effective infusion rate decreases the potential accumulation of midazolam and provides for the most rapid recovery once the infusion is terminated. Patients who exhibit agitation, hypertension or tachycardia in response to noxious stimulation, but who are otherwise adequately sedated, may benefit from concurrent administration of an opioid analgesic. Addition of an opioid will generally reduce the minimum effective midazolam infusion rate.

### The use of propofol for procedural sedation in emergency departments [^113Bdicm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is increasing evidence that propofol is efficacious and safe for procedural sedation (PS) in the emergency department (ED) setting. However, propofol has a narrow therapeutic window and lacks of a reversal agent. The aim of this review was to cohere the evidence base regarding the efficacy and safety profile of propofol when used in the ED setting for PS.

Objectives

To identify and evaluate all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing propofol with alternative drugs (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, etomidate and ketamine) used in the ED setting for PS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1950 to September week 2 2013) and EMBASE (1980 to week 2 2013). We searched the Current Controlled Trials metaRegister of Clinical Trials (compiled by Current Science) (September 2013). We checked the reference lists of trials and contacted trial authors. We imposed no language restriction. We re-ran the search in February 2015. We will deal with the one study awaiting classification when we update the review.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing propofol to alternative drugs (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, etomidate and ketamine) used in the ED setting for PS in participants of all ages.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently performed data extraction. Two authors performed trial quality assessment. We used mean difference (MD), odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to measure effect sizes. Two authors independently assessed and rated the methodological quality of each trial using The Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias.

Main Results

Ten studies (813 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Two studies only included participants 18 years and younger; six studies only included participants 18 years and older; one study included participants between 16 and 65 years of age and one study included only adults but did not specify the age range. Eight of the included studies had a high risk of bias. The included studies were clinically heterogeneous. We undertook no meta-analysis. The primary outcome measures of this review were: adverse effects (as defined by the study authors) and participant satisfaction (as defined by the study authors). In one study comparing propofol/fentanyl with ketamine/midazolam, delayed adverse reactions (nightmares and behavioural change) were noted in 10% of the ketamine/midazolam group and none in the propofol/fentanyl group. Seven individual studies reported no evidence of a difference in adverse effects between intravenous propofol, with and without adjunctive analgesic agents, and alternative interventions. Three individual studies reported no evidence of a difference in pain at the injection site between intravenous propofol and alternative interventions. Four individual studies reported no evidence of a difference in participant satisfaction between intravenous propofol, with and without adjunctive analgesic agents, and alternative interventions (ketamine, etomidate, midazolam). All the studies employed propofol without the use of an adjunctive analgesic and all, except one, were small (fewer than 100 participants) studies. The quality of evidence for the adverse effects and participant satisfaction outcomes was very low. Nine included studies (eight comparisons) reported all the secondary outcome measures of the review except mortality. It was not possible to pool the results of the included studies for any of the secondary outcome measures because the comparator interventions were different and the measures were reported in different ways. Seven individual studies reported no evidence of difference in incidence of hypoxia between intravenous propofol, with and without adjunctive analgesic agents, and alternative interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

No firm conclusions can be drawn concerning the comparative effects of administering intravenous propofol, with or without an adjunctive analgesic agent, with alternative interventions in participants undergoing PS in the ED setting on adverse effects (including pain at the injection site) and participant satisfaction. The review was limited because no two included studies employed the same comparator interventions, and because the number of participants in eight of the included studies were small (fewer than 100 participants).

### A partially blinded randomised controlled trial of patient-maintained propofol sedation and operator controlled midazolam sedation in third molar extractions [^112DokVH]. Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Patient-maintained sedation using propofol has recently been shown to be effective for dental surgery. We compared this new technique to the established technique of operator administered midazolam. The two groups were compared before, during and after sedation. The two primary outcomes were time until discharge and oxygen saturation. Vital signs, anxiety and psychomotor skills were also compared. State anxiety was reduced to a greater extent in the propofol group (mean difference 10 (SD 4) mm; p = 0.010. Propofol patients recovered quicker (mean difference 7 (SD 1.4) min; p = 0.001). Propofol patients had a smaller reduction in arterial oxygen saturation (mean difference 0.8 (SD 0.3)%; p = 0.030), and a reduced increase in heart rate (mean difference 9 (SD 2) beats·min⁻¹; p < 0.001). Both techniques were well tolerated and safe. Propofol sedation offered superior anxiolysis, quicker recovery, less amnesia and less depression of simple psychomotor function.

Anesthesiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Moderate procedural sedation — patient evaluation strategies and risk factors state that preprocedure patient evaluation consists of reviewing previous medical records, a focused physical examination, and preprocedure laboratory testing where indicated. Observational studies indicate that some adverse outcomes may occur in patients with preexisting medical conditions when moderate sedation/analgesia is administered. These conditions include extremes of age, ASA status III or higher, respiratory conditions, obstructive sleep apnea, respiratory distress syndrome, obesity, allergies, psychotropic drug use, history of gastric bypass surgery, pediatric patients who are preoperative or who have behavior or attention disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and history of long-term benzodiazepine use; case reports describe similar adverse outcomes for newborns, a patient with mitochondrial disease, a patient with grand mal epilepsy, and a patient with a history of benzodiazepine use. Unless otherwise noted in this document, hypoxemia is reported in the literature to be oxygen desaturation to at most 90%.

Reversal agents for moderate procedural sedation/analgesia — assure that specific antagonists are immediately available in the procedure room whenever opioid analgesics or benzodiazepines are administered, regardless of route. If patients develop hypoxemia, significant hypoventilation or apnea during sedation/analgesia, encourage or physically stimulate patients to breathe deeply, administer supplemental oxygen, and provide positive pressure ventilation if spontaneous ventilation is inadequate. Use reversal agents in cases where airway control, spontaneous ventilation, or positive pressure ventilation is inadequate; administer naloxone to reverse opioid-induced sedation and respiratory depression and administer flumazenil to reverse benzodiazepine-induced sedation and respiratory depression. After pharmacologic reversal, observe and monitor patients for a sufficient time to ensure that sedation and cardiorespiratory depression does not recur once the effect of the antagonist dissipates, and do not use sedation regimens that are intended to include routine reversal of sedative or analgesic agents. Practitioners are cautioned that acute reversal of opioidinduced analgesia may result in pain, hypertension, tachycardia, or pulmonary edema.

### An evaluation of dexmedetomidine in combination with midazolam in pediatric sedation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1123b8wQ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Dexmedetomidine and midazolam are commonly used sedatives in children. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the safety and effectiveness of sedation provided by dexmedetomidine combined with midazolam versus other sedatives including chloral hydrate, midazolam and other sedatives in pediatric sedation.

Methods

The Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PubMed databases, and Clinicaltrials.gov register of controlled trials were searched from inception to June 2022. All randomized controlled trials used dexmedetomidine-midazolam in pediatric sedation were enrolled. The articles search, data extraction, and quality assessment of included studies were performed independently by two researchers. The success rate of sedation was considered as the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes included onset time of sedation, recovery time of sedation and occurrence of adverse events.

Results

A total of 522 studies were screened and 6 RCTs were identified; 859 patients were analyzed. The administration of dexmedetomidine combined with midazolam was associated with a higher sedation success rate and a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting in computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, Auditory Brainstem Response test or fiberoptic bronchoscopy examinations than the other sedatives did (OR = 2.92; 95% CI: 1.39–6.13, P = 0.005, I² = 51%; OR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.07–0.68, P = 0.008, I² = 0%, respectively). Two groups did not differ significantly in recovery time and the occurrence of adverse reactions (WMD = -0.27, 95% CI: -0.93 to -0.39, P = 0.42; OR 0.70; 95% CI: 0.48–1.02, P = 0.06, I² = 45%. respectively). However, the results of the subgroup analysis of ASA I-II children showed a quicker onset time in dexmedetomidine-midazolam group than the other sedatives (WMD = -3.08; 95% CI: -4.66 to -1.49, P = 0.0001, I² = 30%).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis showed that compared with the control group, dexmedetomidine combined with midazolam group provided higher sedation success rates and caused a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting in completing examinations, indicating a prospective outpatient clinical application for procedural sedation.

### Midazolam hydrochloride [^112qxa9K]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine central nervous system (CNS) depressant.

Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamic properties of midazolam and its metabolites, which are similar to those of other benzodiazepines, include sedative, anxiolytic, amnesic and hypnotic activities. Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to result from reversible interactions with the γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) benzodiazepine receptor in the CNS, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The action of midazolam is readily reversed by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil.

Data from published reports of studies in pediatric patients clearly demonstrate that oral midazolam provides safe and effective sedation and anxiolysis prior to surgical procedures that require anesthesia as well as before other procedures that require sedation but may not require anesthesia. The most commonly reported effective doses range from 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg in children (6 months to < 16 years). The single most commonly reported effective dose is 0.5 mg/kg. Time to onset of effect is most frequently reported as 10 to 20 minutes.

The effects of midazolam on the CNS are dependent on the dose administered, the route of administration, and the presence or absence of other medications.

Following premedication with oral midazolam, time to recovery has been assessed in pediatric patients using various measures, such as time to eye opening, time to extubation, time in the recovery room, and time to discharge from the hospital. Most placebo-controlled trials (8 total) have shown little effect of oral midazolam on recovery time from general anesthesia; however, a number of other placebo-controlled studies (5 total) have demonstrated some prolongation in recovery time following premedication with oral midazolam. Prolonged recovery may be related to duration of the surgical procedure and/or use of other medications with central nervous system depressant properties.

Moderate procedural sedation — sedation recovery and reversal with flumazenil are summarized. Sedation recovery (awakening time) reports raw mean difference = −10.01 (CI −11.63 to −8.39); standard mean difference (fixed effects) = −1.23 (CI −1.49 to −0.96); and standard mean difference (random effects) = −1.57 (CI −2.46 to −0.68), with Z −11.87, P < 0.001 and Z −4.55, P < 0.001; heterogeneity < 0.001. Reversal agents (flumazenil vs. placebo) show recovery within 15min with 11.67 (6.47–21.05), Z 10.72, P < 0.001; and 14.07 (5.59–35.45), Z 7.37, P < 0.001; heterogeneity 0.064. For reversal of benzodiazepines combined with opioids, recovery within 30min shows 7.13 (4.49–11.32), Z 10.94, P < 0.001 for both models; heterogeneity 0.538.

Reversal agents: naloxone and flumazenil — assure that specific antagonists are immediately available in the procedure room whenever opioid analgesics or benzodiazepines are administered for moderate procedural sedation/analgesia, regardless of route of administration. If patients develop hypoxemia, significant hypoventilation or apnea during sedation/analgesia: (1) encourage or physically stimulate patients to breathe deeply, (2) administer supplemental oxygen, and (3) provide positive pressure ventilation if spontaneous ventilation is inadequate. Use reversal agents in cases where airway control, spontaneous ventilation or positive pressure ventilation are inadequate. Administer naloxone to reverse opioid-induced sedation and respiratory depression, and administer flumazenil to reverse benzodiazepine-induced sedation and respiratory depression. After pharmacologic reversal, observe and monitor patients for a sufficient time to ensure that sedation and cardiorespiratory depression does not recur once the effect of the antagonist dissipates. Do not use sedation regimens that are intended to include routine reversal of sedative or analgesic agents. Practitioners are cautioned that acute reversal of opioid-induced analgesia may result in pain, hypertension, tachycardia, or pulmonary edema.

### Ketamine with and without midazolam for emergency department sedation in adults: a randomized controlled trial [^112deSpU]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We assess whether midazolam reduces recovery agitation after ketamine administration in adult emergency department (ED) patients and also compared the incidence of adverse events (recovery agitation, respiratory, and nausea/vomiting) by the intravenous (IV) versus intramuscular (IM) route.

Methods

This prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2×2 factorial trial randomized consecutive ED patients aged 18 to 50 years to 4 groups: receiving either 0.03 mg/kg IV midazolam or placebo, and with ketamine administered either 1.5 mg/kg IV or 4 mg/kg IM. Adverse events and sedation characteristics were recorded.

Results

Of the 182 subjects, recovery agitation was less common in the midazolam cohorts (8% versus 25%; difference 17%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6% to 28%; number needed to treat 6). When IV versus IM routes were compared, the incidences of adverse events were similar (recovery agitation 13% versus 17%, difference 4%, 95% CI -8% to 16%; respiratory events 0% versus 0%, difference 0%, 95% CI -2% to 2%; nausea/vomiting 28% versus 34%, difference 6%, 95% CI -8% to 20%).

Conclusion

Coadministered midazolam significantly reduces the incidence of recovery agitation after ketamine procedural sedation and analgesia in ED adults (number needed to treat 6). Adverse events occur at similar frequency by the IV or IM routes.

### Pediatric procedural sedation using the combination of ketamine and propofol outside of the emergency department: a report from the pediatric sedation research consortium [^111R9i5G]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Outcomes associated with a sedative regimen comprised ketamine + propofol for pediatric procedural sedation outside of both the pediatric emergency department and operating room are underreported. We used the Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium database to describe a multicenter experience with ketamine + propofol by pediatric sedation providers.

Design

Prospective observational study of children receiving IV ketamine + propofol for procedural sedation outside of the operating room and emergency department using data abstracted from the Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium during 2007–2015.

Setting

Procedural sedation services from academic, community, free-standing children's hospitals, and pediatric wards within general hospitals.

Patients

Children from birth to less than or equal to 21 years old.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 7,313 pediatric procedural sedations were performed using IV ketamine + propofol as the primary sedative regimen. Median age was 84 months (range, < 1 mo to ≤ 21 yr; interquartile range, 36–144); 80.6% were American Society of Anesthesiologists-Physical Status less than III. The majority of sedation was performed in dedicated sedation or radiology units (76.1%). Procedures were successfully completed in 99.8% of patients. Anticholinergics (glycopyrrolate and atropine) or benzodiazepines (midazolam and lorazepam) were used in 14.2% and 41.3%, respectively. The overall adverse event and serious adverse event rates were 9.79% (95% CI, 9.12–10.49%) and 3.47% (95% CI, 3.07–3.92%), respectively. No deaths occurred. Risk factors associated with an increase in odds of adverse event included ASA status greater than or equal to III, dental suite, cardiac catheterization laboratory or radiology/sedation suite location, a primary diagnosis of having a gastrointestinal illness, and the coadministration of an anticholinergic.

Conclusions

Using Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium data, we describe the diverse use of IV ketamine + propofol for procedural sedation in the largest reported cohort of children to date. Data from this study may be used to design sufficiently powered prospective randomized, double-blind studies comparing outcomes of sedation between commonly administered sedative and analgesic medication regimens.

### Midazolam hydrochloride (midazolam) [^116J7Mtt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of midazolam for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia following single dose intramuscular administration, intravenously by intermittent injections and continuous infusion have been established in pediatric and neonatal patients. For specific safetymonitoring and dosage guidelines (see BoxedWARNING, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, INDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS, OVERDOSAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). UNLIKE ADULT PATIENTS, PEDIATRIC PATIENTS GENERALLY RECEIVE INCREMENTS OF MIDAZOLAM ON A MG/KG BASIS. As a group, pediatric patients generally require higher dosages of midazolam (mg/kg) than do adults. Younger (less than six years) pediatric patients may require higher dosages (mg/kg) than older pediatric patients, and may require closer monitoring. In obese PEDIATRIC PATIENTS, the dose should be calculated based on ideal body weight. When midazolam is given in conjunction with opioids or other sedatives, the potential for respiratory depression, airway obstruction, or hypoventilation is increased. The health care practitioner who uses this medication in pediatric patients should be aware of and follow accepted professional guidelines for pediatric sedation appropriate to their situation.

Midazolam hydrochloride should not be administered by rapid injection in the neonatal population. Severe hypotension and seizures have been reported following rapid IV administration, particularly, with concomitant use of fentanyl.

Animal Data

Published juvenile animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs, such as Midazolam Injection USP, that either block NMDA receptors or potentiate the activity of GABA during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis, results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.

### Double-effect sedation: do physicians not intend a decrease in consciousness when it is caused by drugs that can also reduce specific symptoms? [^117G3d35]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

The ethics of palliative sedation has been debated intensely. Recently, it has been emphasised that many drugs with sedating effects are also effective in reducing specific symptoms like pain and seizures. For example, midazolam is commonly used to sedate terminally ill patients but it can also reduce seizures. Hence, when midazolam is administered to a patient suffering from seizures, it may also lower the patient's consciousness. Similarly, morphine is useful in the management of end-stage pain and dyspnoea, but can also reduce the patient's consciousness, especially when administered in large doses. Cases in which a drug thus alleviates a symptom as well as lowers patient consciousness are called double-effect sedation (DES). Many claim that the decrease in consciousness in DES is merely a side effect and not an intended consequence, even if its occurrence was foreseen in advance or it will be maintained for some time until the patient dies. Additionally, it is often contended that DES is therefore justifiable by the doctrine of double effect (DDE) even though the decrease in consciousness is bad. The purpose of this paper is to examine these claims. I argue that the claims, while sometimes correct, are very frequently false. It will be shown that physicians often intend to reduce consciousness in DES. In such cases, as I conclude, DDE may not serve to justify DES, and DES should be subject to the same rigorous moral evaluations as the use of sedating drugs that do not reduce specific symptoms.

Sedation/analgesia medication administration — In patients receiving intravenous medications for sedation/analgesia, maintain vascular access throughout the procedure and until the patient is no longer at risk for cardiorespiratory depression. In patients who have received sedation/analgesia by nonintravenous routes or whose intravenous line has become dislodged or blocked, determine the advisability of reestablishing intravenous access on a case-by-case basis. Administer intravenous sedative/analgesic drugs in small, incremental doses, or by infusion, titrating to the desired endpoints. Allow sufficient time to elapse between doses so the peak effect of each dose can be assessed before subsequent drug administration. When drugs are administered by nonintravenous routes (e.g., oral, rectal, intramuscular, transmucosal), allow sufficient time for absorption and peak effect of the previous dose to occur before supplementation is considered.

Moreover, three statistically significant neurobehavioral adverse effects, from the 19 tested, consisting of body temperature, general body tone, and arm recoil, were noted after midazolam exposure during the first 2 hours after birth. Other parameters that were inferior in the midazolam groups but that did not reach statistical significance, were palmar grasp, resistance against pull, and startle reaction. RESULTS: Plasma midazolam, propofol, and fentanyl pharmacokinetics were consistent with reports of others. At the 40-min. treatment delay, the anticonvulsant ED50s of intramuscular or intranasal midazolam did not differ and both were significantly lower than the sublingual route. Higher doses of midazolam were required to stop seizures at the 40-min. treatment delay time compared to immediate treatment. The speed of seizure control for intramuscular or intranasal midazolam was the same while sublingual midazolam acted significantly slower.

Midazolam was effective in treating soman-induced seizures when given by all three routes, but with differences in potency and speed of action. Centrally mediated seizures and convulsions are common consequences of exposure to organophosphates. These seizures rapidly progress to status epilepticus and contribute to profound brain injury. Effective management of these seizures is critical for minimization of brain damage. Nasal application of midazolam after 5 min of sarin-induced electrographic seizure activity ameliorated EGSA and convulsive behavior. Delaying the same treatment to 30 min of EGSA leads to attenuation of paroxysmal ECoG activity in all cases but total cessation of paroxysmal activity was not observed in most animals tested.

Cognitive tests utilizing the Morris Water Maze demonstrated that nasal midazolam alone or together with scopolamine, administered after 5 min of convulsions, abolished the effect of sarin on learning. Nasalmidazolam at 5 min prevented brain damage, while delaying the midazolam treatment to 30 min of EGSA resulted in brain damage. The addition of scopolamine to midazolam did not alter the above observation. In summary, nasal midazolam treatment briefly after initiation of OP-induced seizure leads to cessation of EGSA and prevented brain lesions and behavioral deficiencies in the rat model.

### Sedation during endoscopic procedures: a Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology position statement [^115DrLbJ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Section 5: The use of propofol

What is the role of propofol in sedation during endoscopy?

Statement 10: The use of propofol is superior to the classical sedation drugs during interventional endoscopic procedures because the patient's satisfaction is greater and the recovery time is shorter.

Rounds of voting needed to reach agreement: 1; Agreement level: 100%

Studies have shown that propofol is superior to traditional sedation schemes of benzodiazepines plus opioids in ERCP procedures. Higher post-procedure patient satisfaction is achieved with propofol compared to traditional sedation for colonoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, ERCP, but not gastroduodenoscopy. Time to sedation and recovery time are shorter with propofol than with traditional sedation. Regarding adverse effects, propofol may relatively frequently cause hypoventilation, hypotension and bradycardia, but severe adverse effects are extremely rare.

Synergistic sedation with low doses of intravenous midazolam and propofol significantly reduces the required dose of propofol and therefore the risk of complications; it has been reported to be an effective alternative option to the use of propofol as a sole agent. Propofol as a sole agent and synergistic sedation with low doses of intravenous midazolam and propofol have also been proposed for gastrointestinal endoscopy in children.

Despite the adequate safety data from non-anesthesiologists administering propofol, the majority of the anesthesiology community remains opposed, because of the drug's ability to quickly induce deep sedation and general anesthesia. Since there is no reversal agent for propofol, the likelihood that advanced airway management techniques will be needed is higher than for the combination of midazolam with opioids. Moreover, sedation is a continuum, and deep sedation is logically associated with an increased frequency of inadequate ventilation or airway obstruction. Thus, the anesthesiology community recommends that propofol-based sedation should be administered only by anesthetists.

### Safety of outpatient procedural sedation administered by oral and maxillofacial surgeons: the mayo clinic experience in 17, 634 sedations (2004 to 2019) [^115fQfmu]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The safety of the team anesthesia model routinely used by the specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery has recently been called into question. The purpose of this article is to measure the frequency of adverse anesthetic events related to ambulatory surgical procedures performed under intravenous (IV) sedation by the Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Mayo Clinic during a 15-year period using the team anesthesia model.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective cohort study was designed, and a sample of subjects identified undergoing IV sedation at Mayo Clinic from 2004 to 2019. The primary outcome variable of interest was the presence of anesthetic-related adverse events (AEs) consistent with the World Society of Intravenous Anesthesia International Sedation Task Force's intervention-based definitions of adverse anesthetic events. Additional covariates included patient age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, type of surgical procedure performed, and the type/dosage of medications administered periprocedurally. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess for associations between AEs and covariates.

Results

The study identified 17,634 sedations administered to 16,609 unique subjects. In 17,634 sedations, 16 (0.1%) AEs and no subject deaths (0%) were identified. There were no statistically significant associations between AEs and age (hazard ratio [HR], 0.4; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.2 to 1.3; P = 0.13); gender (HR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.3 to 2.5; P = 0.87); ASA 2 classification (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.6 to 4.5; P = 0.33); ASA 3 classification (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 22.0; P = 0.86), or types of IV sedation medications administered during the procedure: fentanyl (HR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.02 to 6.3; P = 0.5); midazolam (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.2 to 4.3; P = 0.98); propofol (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.3 to 3.5; P = 0.99); or ketamine (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.1 to 7.3; P = 0.97).

Conclusions

The frequency of AEs (0.1%) and 0% mortality rate reported in this study demonstrate that the anesthesia team model used by oral and maxillofacial surgeons compares favorably to standardized intervention-based adverse anesthetic event outcomes reported by other nonanesthesiology specialties routinely performing outpatient procedural sedation.

Regarding medical management for procedural sedation, more specifically with respect to gastrointestinal endoscopy, complications, BSG 2024 guidelines recommend to use only low-strength midazolam (1 mg/mL) instead of high-strength midazolam to reduce the risk of adverse events related to oversedation.

### Midazoalm (Midazolam) [^11758mcJ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including midazolam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. If a decision is made to use midazolam concomitantly with opioids, monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS).

Risk of Respiratory Adverse Events

Serious cardiorespiratory adverse events have occurred after administration of midazolam. These have included respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respiratory arrest and/or cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury. There have also been rare reports of hypotensive episodes requiring treatment during or after diagnostic or surgical manipulations particularly in adult or pediatric patients with hemodynamic instability. Hypotension occurred more frequently in the sedation studies in patients premedicated with a narcotic.

Individualization of Dosage

Midazolam hydrochloride must never be used without individualization of dosage particularly when used with other medications capable of producing central nervous system depression (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for complete information).

Other Adverse Events

Reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements (including tonic/clonic movements and muscle tremor), hyperactivity and combativeness have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients. These reactions may be due to inadequate or excessive dosing or improper administration of midazolam hydrochloride; however, consideration should be given to the possibility of cerebral hypoxia or true paradoxical reactions. Should such reactions occur, the response to each dose of midazolam hydrochloride and all other drugs, including local anesthetics, should be evaluated before proceeding. Reversal of such responses with flumazenil has been reported in pediatric patients.

### Guidelines for monitoring and management of pediatric patients during and after sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures: an update [^112rZkv8]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The safe sedation of children for procedures requires a systematic approach that includes the following: no administration of sedating medication without the safety net of medical supervision; careful presedation evaluation for underlying medical or surgical conditions that would place the child at increased risk from sedating medications; appropriate fasting for elective procedures and a balance between depth of sedation and risk for those who are unable to fast because of the urgent nature of the procedure; a focused airway examination for large tonsils or anatomic airway abnormalities that might increase the potential for airway obstruction; a clear understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the medications used for sedation, as well as an appreciation for drug interactions; appropriate training and skills in airway management to allow rescue of the patient; age- and size-appropriate equipment for airway management and venous access; appropriate medications and reversal agents; sufficient numbers of people to carry out the procedure and monitor the patient; appropriate physiologic monitoring during and after the procedure; a properly equipped and staffed recovery area; recovery to presedation level of consciousness before discharge from medical supervision; and appropriate discharge instructions. This report was developed through a collaborative effort of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry to offer pediatric providers updated information and guidance in delivering safe sedation to children.

### Optimal dose of intranasal midazolam for procedural sedation in children: a randomized clinical trial [^115beEZ4]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Intranasal (IN) midazolam is commonly used for procedural sedation in children, but the optimal dose is unclear. Insufficient dosing may result in inadequate sedation, leading to short- and long-term consequences associated with poorly managed procedural pain and distress, whereas doses that are too high may be associated with more adverse events.

Objective

To determine the optimal dose of IN midazolam for procedural sedation in children undergoing laceration repair.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective, double-blind, adaptive selection randomized clinical trial used the Levin-Robbins-Leu sequential selection procedure and was conducted between September 2021 and May 2024 at a tertiary care pediatric emergency department. Participants were children aged 6 months to 7 years with a simple laceration who required IN midazolam to facilitate the repair. The sequential selection procedure eliminated doses when they failed to achieve a prespecified rate of adequate sedation state compared with the best-performing dose. If more than 1 dose survived elimination, secondary outcomes of remaining doses were compared. Data were analyzed from June to August 2024.

Interventions

Doses of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5 mg/kg of IN midazolam.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was adequate sedation state, defined as Pediatric Sedation State Scale (PSSS) score of 2, 3, or 4 (of 5) for at least 95% of the procedure; no PSSS score of 0 or 1; procedure start within 17 minutes of IN midazolam administration; and procedure completion. Secondary outcomes included ideal sedation state (PSSS score of 2 or 3 for 100% of the procedure), time to onset of minimal sedation, adverse events, time to recovery, and clinician and caregiver satisfaction.

Results

Following the sequential selection procedure, a total of 101 children (38 [37.6%] female; median [IQR] age, 3 [2–4] years) were enrolled. The 0.2 and 0.3 mg/kg doses were eliminated, with 19 children receiving 0.2 mg/kg and 24 children receiving 0.3 mg/kg. The 0.4- and 0.5-mg/kg doses remained at enrollment completion, with 29 children receiving 0.4 mg/kg and 29 children receiving 0.5 mg/kg. There were no differences in secondary outcomes between the 2 remaining doses and no serious adverse events with any dose.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, the optimal doses of IN midazolam for procedural sedation in children undergoing laceration repair were 0.4 and 0.5 mg/kg. This finding can inform clinical practice and future studies of IN midazolam for procedural sedation.

### An evaluation of dexmedetomidine in combination with midazolam in pediatric sedation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111RPkLr]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Occurrence of adverse events

Adverse reactions were reported in all included trials. The fixed effects model was utilized for meta-analysis because of no statistical heterogeneity among the studies (P = 0.11, I² = 45%; Fig. 5 A). The results indicated that there was no significant statistical difference in the occurrence of adverse reactions between dexmedetomidine-midazolam sedation and other sedatives (OR 0.70; 95% CI: 0.48–1.02, P = 0.06, I² = 45%; Fig. 5 A). Subgroup analysis showed there was no significant statistical difference in the incidence of bradycardia between dexmedetomidine-midazolam group and control group (OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.33–1.63, P = 0.44, I² = 12%; Fig. 5 B). Three studies reported incidence of hypotension. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the incidence of hypotension in dexmedetomidine-midazolam group was similar to other sedatives group, and the difference was not statistically significant (OR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.24–2.89, P = 0.77, I² = 73%; Fig. 5 C). In the sensitivity analysis, we excluded study of Ji YY 2020[15] with high heterogeneity and found that the value of I² decreased to 0%. However, there was still no remained significant difference in the incidence of hypotension between two groups (OR = 1.52; 95% CI: 0.74–3.14, P = 0.25, I² = 0%). Five trials reported the occurrence of nausea and vomiting. A fixed effects model was chosen for meta-analysis for no statistical heterogeneity among the studies (P = 0.84, I² = 0%; Fig. 5 D). According to the results, DEX combined with midazolam showed a lower incidence rate of nausea and vomiting than other sedatives (OR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.07–0.68, P = 0.008; Fig. 5 D).

When administered with midazolam, ketamine had a longer recovery time than propofol‐fentanyl 20 and midazolam with fentanyl. 12 Ketamine‐midazolam therapy was associated with fewer adverse effects than other parenteral drug combinations, 12, 14 including fewer oxygen desaturations than midazolam‐fentanyl and propofol‐fentanyl, 20 but patients may require head positioning, supplemental oxygen, occasional bag‐valve‐mask ventilatory support, and measures to address laryngospasm. The concurrent administration of midazolam with ketamine was not found to decrease the incidence of emergent reactions, but did decrease the incidence of emesis. 17 The data did not support the regular or routine use of anticholinergics or benzodiazepines. 10, 11 While equally safe according to one review, 14 intravenous ketamine appears to have a better adverse effect profile and a shorter recovery period than intramuscular ketamine, which should be reserved for patients in whom intravenous access is difficult. 9

A combination of ketamine and propofol was first used in the operating room in the early 1990s; however, we found no relevant systematic reviews of this drug combination. These drugs can be delivered premixed or sequentially with ketamine administered first, which allows the analgesic effect of the ketamine to occur first as well as to decrease injection site pain from propofol. 28 Case series have shown that when in combination, lower doses of each drug can be used to provide effective sedation compared to when given as a monotherapy of either agent. Additional benefits of this combination include cardiovascular stability, airway preservation, reduced recovery agitation, and antiemetic properties. A short recovery time and high provider satisfaction rates may also make this combination desirable for use in children in the ED. 28, 29

5.2 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids, Other Sedative Hypnotics, or Other Central Nervous

System Depressants

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Titrate the dose of Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection when administered with opioid analgesics and sedative-hypnotics to the desired clinical response.

Continuously monitor sedated patients for hypotension, airway obstruction, hypoventilation, apnea, and oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects may be more likely to occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the elderly, and ASA‑PS III or IV patients.

Concomitant use of barbiturates, alcohol, or other central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, desaturation, or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect. Narcotic premedication also depresses the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation.

5.3 Risk of Cardiorespiratory Adverse Reactions

Serious cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have occurred after administration of midazolam. These have included respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respiratory arrest and/or cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury. There have also been rare reports of hypotensive episodes requiring treatment during or after diagnostic or surgical manipulations particularly in adult or pediatric patients with hemodynamic instability. Hypotension occurred more frequently in the sedation studies in patients premedicated with an opioid. Excessive single doses or rapid intravenous administration may result in respiratory depression, airway obstruction and/or arrest. When used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia, midazolam should always be titrated slowly in adult or pediatric patients. Adverse hemodynamic events have been reported in pediatric patients with cardiovascular instability; rapid intravenous administration should also be avoided in this population. Continuously monitor patients for early signs of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, and apnea using capnography, pulse oximetry, and clinical assessment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
