## Question

What is the best first line treatment for functional dyspepsia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best first-line treatment for functional dyspepsia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework and how functional dyspepsia is defined and subdivided. Then, I should verify the universal first step of H. pylori testing and eradication. Next, I will examine acid suppression therapy as the initial pharmacologic approach for H. pylori-negative patients, including dose, duration, and when to stop. After that, I should consider symptom-targeted options like prokinetics and when they fit. I will then review nonpharmacologic measures, including exercise and psychological therapies. Finally, I need to outline escalation strategies for refractory cases and synthesize a concise, stepwise recommendation with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation so I don't jump to conclusions: functional dyspepsia is a disorder of gut–brain interaction characterized by bothersome epigastric pain or burning, early satiation, and/or postprandial fullness persisting more than 8 weeks without alarm features or structural disease, and it is commonly subdivided into epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) and postprandial distress syndrome (PDS), which can overlap in practice [^116JFp4f] [^114pYgxi].

> Wait, let me verify the universal first step before any pharmacotherapy: all patients with dyspepsia should be tested for Helicobacter pylori and, if positive, offered eradication therapy because it confers a modest but meaningful symptom benefit with an NNT around 12–13 and is cost-effective in appropriate populations; I initially thought eradication might not help FD specifically, but the updated meta-analytic data show a significant reduction in persistent symptoms when infection is successfully treated, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize test-and-treat as the starting point [^1131QL3w] [^111BbbVZ] [^114kiKKi] [^116v4nbG].

> Next, I should review what to do when H. pylori is negative or eradication fails; hold on, I should confirm the preferred first-line drug class: guidelines converge on offering empirical acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor at the lowest effective dose for about 4–8 weeks, with an expected relative risk reduction of dyspepsia persisting around 0.87–0.88 versus placebo and an NNT near 10–13; if there is no response after 8 weeks, I need to stop and reconsider rather than escalate the dose, and H2-receptor antagonists are a reasonable alternative if PPIs are unsuitable or unavailable [^113x293H] [^112ctZ1k] [^114HBA8C] [^1165fiN9].

> I will now examine symptom-targeted therapy; let me think about prokinetics: for patients with prominent early satiation or postprandial fullness consistent with PDS, a prokinetic can be considered, but I should double-check availability and evidence — tegaserod has supportive data in some regions, acotiamide has evidence largely from Asia, and domperidone or metoclopramide may be options where accessible, though efficacy is modest and adverse effects must be weighed; importantly, prokinetics are generally not first-line unless the phenotype is clearly PDS-predominant or first-line acid suppression fails [^113YabJu] [^113PYskn] [^117WKZHT].

> But wait, what about nonpharmacologic measures; I need to ensure I don't overstate diet: there is insufficient evidence to recommend specific dietary therapies like low-FODMAP for FD, though individualized trigger avoidance is reasonable; however, I should emphasize regular aerobic exercise because a small RCT showed symptomatic benefit when added to conventional care, and I should also educate patients about FD as a gut–brain disorder with a relapsing–remitting course to set expectations and reduce unnecessary testing [^115eKeR6] [^112P62tW] [^113PYskn] [^116nR6N1].

> Hold on, I should verify the escalation pathway for refractory symptoms: if symptoms persist after H. pylori eradication (if applicable) and an adequate PPI trial, tricyclic antidepressants are the preferred next step, starting low (for example, amitriptyline 10 mg nightly) and titrating slowly to 30–50 mg, with an expected NNT around 6; SSRIs and SNRIs have not shown benefit for global FD symptoms, though mirtazapine 15 mg nightly may help selected patients with early satiation and weight loss; psychological therapies such as CBT, psychodynamic/interpersonal therapy, stress management, and hypnotherapy can be considered when drug therapy fails, with an approximate NNT of 3 in trials [^113amFNS] [^116Knxcb] [^116B9EfY] [^112RSrsK] [^114T4Be6] [^1111xQXA].

> I should confirm when to refer and what to avoid in difficult cases: refer to gastroenterology for diagnostic uncertainty, severe symptoms, or failure of first-line strategies; in secondary care, access to dietetic support, behavioral therapies, and specialist drugs is ideal; avoid opioids and surgery given lack of benefit and potential harm, and in severe or refractory presentations, involve a multidisciplinary team and screen for eating disorders when weight loss and food restriction are present [^112td9iD] [^113tX17o] [^112Nca9F] [^115MRUbE] [^113QAoXA].

> Let me reconsider the overall first-line recommendation to ensure internal consistency: the best first-line treatment for functional dyspepsia is a stepwise approach — first, test for H. pylori and eradicate if positive; second, for H. pylori-negative patients or those remaining symptomatic after eradication, offer a time-limited, low-dose PPI trial for 4–8 weeks and stop if ineffective; third, tailor adjuncts to phenotype, with prokinetics considered for prominent PDS features and exercise and education for all; fourth, escalate to TCAs and psychological therapies if refractory — this synthesis aligns with BSG 2022 and ACG/CAG 2017 guidance and reflects the modest but real benefits seen across modalities [^115FFmPD] [^114Gcj1E] [^113PYskn].

---

The best first-line treatment for functional dyspepsia is **test-and-treat for H. pylori** [^115Qvera] in all patients, followed by **PPI therapy** [^114HBA8C] if H. pylori is negative or symptoms persist after eradication [^112ctZ1k]. PPIs are modestly effective (NNT ~10) [^112ctZ1k] and are preferred over H2RAs or prokinetics as initial therapy [^114Gcj1E]. If symptoms persist after 8 weeks of PPI, consider **TCAs** [^113amFNS] or psychological therapies [^1111xQXA]; prokinetics are reserved for prominent meal-related symptoms or as second-line options [^113YabJu]. Lifestyle measures (regular aerobic exercise [^112P62tW], dietary adjustments) and patient education [^116nR6N1] should accompany pharmacologic therapy.

---

## Diagnostic approach and initial management

- **H. pylori test-and-treat**: Strongly recommended as first-line for uninvestigated dyspepsia [^114kiKKi]; eradication modestly improves symptoms (NNT ~12) [^115Qvera] and reduces endoscopy use [^1131QL3w].

- **Empirical acid suppression**: For H. pylori-negative patients or those remaining symptomatic after eradication, PPIs are first-line [^114HBA8C]; H2RAs are alternatives if PPIs are unsuitable [^113x293H].

- **Lifestyle and dietary measures**: Regular aerobic exercise [^112P62tW], dietary adjustments, and patient education [^116nR6N1] are recommended adjuncts.

---

## Pharmacological first-line treatments

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism of action** | **Efficacy** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| PPIs | Acid suppression | Modest benefit (NNT ~10) [^112ctZ1k] | First-line for H. pylori-negative or persistent symptoms [^114HBA8C] |
| H2RAs | Acid suppression | Less effective than PPIs [^1165fiN9] | Alternative if PPIs unsuitable [^113x293H] |
| Prokinetics | Enhanced gastric motility | Limited evidence; reserved for meal-related symptoms [^114MijtQ] | Second-line or adjunctive [^113YabJu] |

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions include **psychological therapies** — CBT, psychodynamic therapy, stress management, and hypnotherapy — which are recommended for patients not responding to drug therapy [^114T4Be6] [^1111xQXA]. Regular **aerobic exercise** [^112P62tW] is advised for all patients with functional dyspepsia. Dietary modifications should be individualized; **avoid restrictive diets** such as low FODMAP, as evidence is insufficient [^115eKeR6] [^111ws49P].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

- **Symptom phenotype**: EPS favors PPIs; PDS may benefit from prokinetics [^112rWXy9].

- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential [^113PYskn].

- **Comorbidities**: Tailor therapy to avoid adverse effects.

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Placebo effect**: High placebo response complicates efficacy assessment [^1169pFtt].

- **Long-term safety**: PPIs are generally safe; monitor for rare adverse effects with prolonged use [^1165fiN9].

- **Individual response**: Treatments are modestly effective; manage expectations [^113PYskn].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | H. pylori test-and-treat | Strongly recommended [^114kiKKi] |
| 2 | PPI therapy | First-line if H. pylori-negative or persistent symptoms [^114HBA8C] |
| 3 | Lifestyle measures | Regular exercise, dietary adjustments, patient education [^112P62tW] [^116nR6N1] |
| 4 | Second-line | TCAs or psychological therapies if PPI fails [^113amFNS] [^1111xQXA] |

---

The best first-line treatment for functional dyspepsia is **H. pylori test-and-treat** [^114Gcj1E], followed by **PPI therapy** [^114HBA8C] if H. pylori is negative or symptoms persist. Lifestyle measures and patient education should accompany pharmacologic therapy, with TCAs or psychological therapies as second-line options [^113amFNS] [^1111xQXA].

### Current management strategies and emerging treatments for functional dyspepsia [^112rWXy9]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Functional dyspepsia refers to painful and nonpainful symptoms that are perceived to arise in the upper digestive tract but are not secondary to organic, systemic or metabolic diseases. The symptoms of this syndrome often overlap with those of GERD and IBS, making its management far from simple. If Helicobacter pylori infection is diagnosed in patients with functional dyspepsia, it should be treated. In patients with mild or intermittent symptoms, reassurance and lifestyle advice might be sufficient; in patients not responding to these measures, or in those with more severe symptoms, drug therapy should be considered. Both PPIs and prokinetics can be used in initial empirical pharmacotherapy based on symptom patterns — a PPI is more likely to be effective in the presence of retrosternal or epigastric burning or epigastric pain, whereas a prokinetic is more effective in dyspepsia with early satiation or postprandial fullness. Although combinations of PPIs and prokinetics might have additive symptomatic effects, single-drug therapy is initially preferable. Antidepressants or referral to a psychiatrist or psychotherapist can be considered in nonresponders and in those whose symptoms have a marked effect on daily functioning. Despite extensive research, functional dyspepsia treatment often remains unsatisfactory. Better characterization of dyspeptic subgroups and understanding of underlying mechanisms will enable treatment advances to be made in the future.

Introduction

Aims

The previous BSG dyspepsia management guidelines were published in 1996. In the intervening years, an extensive amount of new evidence has emerged, improving understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, investigation, and management of the condition. Importantly, it has been recognised that FD accounts for the majority of cases of dyspepsia seen in clinical practice, and that FD is a DGBI. In addition, the Rome criteria, the gold-standard symptom-based diagnostic criteria for FD, are now in their fourth iteration. Consequently, the primary aim of this guideline, commissioned by the BSG, was to consider all of these developments and create a new clinical guideline for the management of FD, including the initial diagnostic approach to the patient presenting with dyspepsia. The guideline is intended to be practical to use and to provide an authoritative framework for current, state-of-the-art, evidence-based clinical practice. It has been reviewed by the BSG Clinical Services and Standards Committee and selected reviewers from the BSG Council.

Methodology

A guideline working group was convened. In keeping with the recommendations of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation guideline development protocol, this comprised a diverse multidisciplinary team of clinicians and academics encompassing expertise from primary, secondary and tertiary care, together with liaison psychiatry. The working group also included representation from two patients who reviewed both the initial proposal and the final guideline to ensure implementation of a patient-centred approach.

Each section of the guideline was allocated a lead author responsible for performing a comprehensive literature search. Additionally, the section covering treatment was informed by a systematic review of the literature, the methodology for which is reported within that section. Eligible studies were graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine. The Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used to evaluate the strength of the recommendations and the overall quality of evidence. Recommendations for each section were made based on the relevant evidence, informed by the literature searches, and were approved by all members of the working group, who met regularly. No formal Delphi voting process was used, but all recommendations achieved complete consensus following extensive review and discussion among the entire working group.

Conflicts of interest

All members of the guideline working group were asked to complete conflicts of interest declarations. These are available as online supplemental table.

Scheduled review

We would suggest these guidelines are reviewed and updated every 5 years.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^111DaEXk]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common disorder of gut–brain interaction, affecting approximately 7% of individuals in the community, with most patients managed in primary care. The last British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guideline for the management of dyspepsia was published in 1996. In the interim, substantial advances have been made in understanding the complex pathophysiology of FD, and there has been a considerable amount of new evidence published concerning its diagnosis and classification, with the advent of the Rome IV criteria, and management. The primary aim of this guideline, commissioned by the BSG, is to review and summarise the current evidence to inform and guide clinical practice, by providing a practical framework for evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of patients. The approach to investigating the patient presenting with dyspepsia is discussed, and efficacy of drugs in FD summarised based on evidence derived from a comprehensive search of the medical literature, which was used to inform an update of a series of pairwise and network meta-analyses. Specific recommendations have been made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. These provide both the strength of the recommendations and the overall quality of evidence. Finally, in this guideline, we consider novel treatments that are in development, as well as highlighting areas of unmet need and priorities for future research.

### Evaluation and management of dyspepsia [^117Aq3oo]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia is a common clinical problem seen by both primary care physicians and gastroenterologists. Initial evaluation should focus on the identification and treatment of potential causes of symptoms such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and medication side effects but also on recognizing those at risk for more serious conditions such as gastric cancer. This manuscript discusses the evaluation and management of dyspepsia including the role of proton-pump inhibitors, treatment of Helicobacter pylori, and endoscopy. Finally, treatment of refractory functional dyspepsia is addressed.

### Functional dyspepsia: evaluation and treatment [^115Gaug1]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is one of the most common disorders seen in general practice and by gastroenterologists. New concepts regarding the pathophysiology and its role for the symptom pattern have emerged during the last few years. This is of importance for development of new treatment alternatives in the near future. At the moment, however, empirical treatment with acid-suppressive agents and prokinetics is the recommended therapeutic approach in the management of these patients, despite limited efficacy. Identification and treatment of H pylori infection has been recommended for uninvestigated dyspepsia, because it may cure underlying peptic ulcer disease, but is unlikely to provide symptomatic benefit to patients with functional dyspepsia. Refractory patients may respond to antidepressants or to psychologic treatments, but proof of efficacy is limited. New and more effective approaches are badly needed for functional dyspepsia.

### Dyspepsia [^111wArcH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A variety of organic diseases can cause dyspepsia, but most patients with epigastric pain have functional dyspepsia. As dyspepsia is common and usually has a benign cause, it is not possible to fully investigate everyone with epigastric pain. Current recommendations suggest that young patients without alarm symptoms can be treated empirically with Helicobacter pylori test and treat and proton pump inhibitor therapy can be offered to those who are negative or remain symptomatic despite treatment for their H. pylori. Patients who remain symptomatic with this strategy may be investigated with endoscopy, but most will have functional dyspepsia.

Recent Findings

There are a large number of trials for prokinetic therapy in functional dyspepsia, but treatment efficacy is uncertain, as there is evidence of publication bias. There are very limited data for the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants in functional dyspepsia. There has been recent interest in the observation that patients with functional dyspepsia have increased eosinophils in the duodenum and this may be accompanied by other subtle manifestations of upregulated mucosal immunity. It is possible that this is being driven by a dietary substance or by a change in the upper gut microbiome.

Summary

The initial management of dyspepsia is well established, but how to manage those who do not respond is a challenge. Future studies evaluating diet and altering the gut microbiome may give clinicians more therapeutic options.

### Dyspepsia [^11215UFb]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Dyspepsia affects up to 40% of the general population and significantly reduces quality of life. A small proportion of patients have peptic ulcer disease as cause and this can be treated empirically with Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy in those that are infected. Approximately 20% have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and this can be effectively treated with proton pump inhibitor therapy. Patients who remain symptomatic may warrant an endoscopy, but most will have functional dyspepsia. Treatment of functional dyspepsia remains a challenge.

Recent Findings

Recent large randomized trials suggest tricyclic antidepressant therapy may be effective in functional dyspepsia. A phase III randomized controlled trial reports that a new prokinetic, acotiamide, reduces dyspepsia symptoms in functional dyspepsia patients. There are also preliminary data that suggest buspirone, a drug that promotes gastric accommodation, is also effective in functional dyspepsia. There are also data to suggest that functional dyspepsia is caused by subtle manifestations of inflammation in the upper gastrointestinal tract, possibly caused by food sensitivity or a change in gut flora.

Summary

The initial management of dyspepsia is well established, but managing those with continued symptoms is a challenge. Antidepressants and newer gastric motility agents show promise. Targeting the diet and gut microbiome is another area for future research in functional dyspepsia.

### Update on the evaluation and management of functional dyspepsia [^115GhGa4]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia affects up to 40 percent of adults each year and is often diagnosed as functional (nonulcer) dyspepsia. The defining symptoms are postprandial fullness, early satiation, or epigastric pain or burning in the absence of causative structural disease. These symptoms may coexist with symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as anxiety and depression. The history and physical examination can help identify other possible causes of the symptoms. Warning signs of serious disease, such as cancer, are unintended weight loss, progressive dysphagia, persistent vomiting, evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, and a family history of cancer. In these cases, more extensive laboratory investigation, imaging, and endoscopy should be considered as clinically indicated. During the initial evaluation, a test-and-treat strategy to identify and eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection is more effective than empiric treatment and more cost-effective than initial endoscopy. Eradication of H. pylori helps one out of 15 patients with functional dyspepsia diagnosed by endoscopy, but may not be cost-effective. Treatment options that may be beneficial for functional dyspepsia include histamine H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetic agents. Although psychotropic medications and psychological interventions have no proven benefit in patients with functional dyspepsia, they are appropriate for treating common psychiatric comorbidities.

Conclusions

FD is a complex, multifactorial DGBI, which is highly prevalent in the community, and is one of the conditions most frequently encountered in the gastroenterology outpatient clinic, although the majority of patients are seen and managed in primary care. An effective approach to the diagnosis and management of FD is, therefore, important to healthcare systems, patients and society. This guideline summarises current evidence to provide a practical guide for clinicians seeing patients with the condition, underlining the importance of effective communication, making a positive diagnosis, and reducing unnecessary investigation. It recommends instituting appropriate, evidence-based treatments according to presence of H. pylori, global patient assessment, and patient choice, to address both symptoms and quality of life within a biopsychosocial framework. It has also highlighted emerging new therapeutic options for FD and priority areas for ongoing research.

### Initial management strategies for dyspepsia [^113WRAwT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

This review considers management strategies (combinations of initial investigation and empirical treatments) for dyspeptic patients. Dyspepsia was defined to include both epigastric pain and heartburn.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and cost effectiveness of the following initial management strategies for patients presenting with dyspepsia: (a) Initial pharmacological therapy (including endoscopy for treatment failures). (b) Early endoscopy. (c) Testing for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)and endoscope only those positive. (d) H. pylori eradication therapy with or without prior testing.

Search Strategy

Trials were located through electronic searches and extensive contact with trialists.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of dyspeptic patients presenting in primary care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were collected on dyspeptic symptoms, quality of life and use of resources. An individual patient data meta-analysis of health economic data was conducted

Main Results

Twenty-five papers reporting 27 comparisons were found. Trials comparing proton pump inhibitors (PPI) with antacids (three trials) and histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) (three trials), early endoscopy with initial acid suppression (five trials), H. pylori test and endoscope versus usual management (three trials), H. pylori test and treat versus endoscopy (six trials), and test and treat versus acid suppression alone in H. pylori positive patients (four trials), were pooled. PPIs were significantly more effective than both H2RAs and antacids. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were; for PPI compared with antacid 0.72 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.80), PPI compared with H2RA 0.63 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.85). Results for other drug comparisons were either absent or inconclusive. Initial endoscopy was associated with a small reduction in the risk of recurrent dyspeptic symptoms compared with H. pylori test and treat (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.96), but was not cost effective (mean additional cost of endoscopy US$401 (95% CI $328 to 474). Test and treat may be more effective than acid suppression alone (RR 0.59 95% CI 0.42 to 0.83).

Authors' Conclusions

Proton pump inhibitor drugs (PPIs) are effective in the treatment of dyspepsia in these trials which may not adequately exclude patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The relative efficacy of histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and PPIs is uncertain. Early investigation by endoscopy or H. pylori testing may benefit some patients with dyspepsia but is not cost effective as part of an overall management strategy.

General overview

It is important to stress that, as with other DGBI, cure of FD is unlikely, and most treatments are of modest efficacy. An explanation of the relapsing and remitting natural history of FD, as well as the fact that treatment is offered with the aim of improving symptoms, social functioning, and quality of life is vital. Although there is little evidence that lifestyle changes lead to symptom improvement, a recent small RCT of aerobic exercise, in addition to conventional management, demonstrated a significant benefit on dyspepsia symptoms, compared with conventional management alone. As recommended above, the first step should be to test the patient for H. pylori infection, because presence of the infection will dictate initial management. If testing has been done previously, and infection was either not present, or was present but FD symptoms have not responded to eradication therapy, treatment should commence with first-line drugs, according to patient choice (figure 2). Second-line drugs are reserved for those whose symptoms do not improve with these measures. All decisions regarding treatment choices should be made by the patient, with advice and support from the clinician.

Figure 2
Treatment algorithm for functional dyspepsia. *Successful eradication of H. pylori should only be confirmed in those with an increased risk of gastric cancer. +Triggers may include spicy food or alcohol, for example, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend specific dietary therapies, including a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, di- and monosaccharides, and polyols in FD. †Overall, there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations regarding whether any treatment should be preferred in patients with EPS or PDS. ‡Efficacy of prokinetics varies according to drug class, and many of these drugs are unavailable outside of Asia and the United States. Most trials of acotiamide have been conducted in patients with PDS. §There is no evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, used as gut–brain neuromodulators, are an efficacious treatment for FD. ∞Tricyclic antidepressants should be used as a first-choice gut–brain neuromodulator. They can be initiated in primary or secondary care, starting at a dose of 10 mg at night, and titrating slowly (eg, by 10 mg per week) according to response and tolerability. Continue for at least 6–12 months if the patient reports a symptomatic benefit. ⁑Mirtazapine may be useful in patients with FD and early satiation and weight loss.

### ACG and CAG clinical guideline: management of dyspepsia [^116cUCiv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG and CAG guideline — methodology states the group followed PICO questions and systematic reviews, searched key databases from inception to December 2015, used stringent binary outcomes of dyspepsia improvement, summarized results as RR and NNT with 95% CI using a random effects model, and used GRADE to rate evidence and recommendation strength. The group formulated statements that followed the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) format to guide the search for evidence. Systematic reviews were conducted for initial management strategies of uninvestigated dyspepsia as well as for pharmacological therapies for FD that supported the PICO statements. An experienced professional developed the search strategies for MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and these databases were searched from inception to December 2015 (Appendix 1). Two independent researchers (PMM and Cathy Yuan) assessed eligibility and extracted data. We took the most stringent definition of dyspepsia improvement as the outcome of interest and the binary definition of improvement was given (i.e., the definition that resulted in the lowest placebo response rate). Summary statistics were expressed as relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat (NNT) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and a random effects model was used. We used the GRADE approach (19) to assess the quality of evidence and give strength of recommendation.

### Guidelines for the management of dyspepsia [^116HMGkn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia is a chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen; patients with predominant or frequent (more than once a week) heartburn or acid regurgitation, should be considered to have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) until proven otherwise. Dyspeptic patients over 55 yr of age, or those with alarm features should undergo prompt esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). In all other patients, there are two approximately equivalent options: (i) test and treat for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) using a validated noninvasive test and a trial of acid suppression if eradication is successful but symptoms do not resolve or (ii) an empiric trial of acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 4–8 wk. The test-and-treat option is preferable in populations with a moderate to high prevalence of H. pylori infection (≥ 10%); empirical PPI is an initial option in low prevalence situations. If initial acid suppression fails after 2–4 wk, it is reasonable to consider changing drug class or dosing. If the patient fails to respond or relapses rapidly on stopping antisecretory therapy, then the test-and-treat strategy is best applied before consideration of referral for EGD. Prokinetics are not currently recommended as first-line therapy for uninvestigated dyspepsia. EGD is not mandatory in those who remain symptomatic as the yield is low; the decision to endoscope or not must be based on clinical judgement. In patients who do respond to initial therapy, stop treatment after 4–8 wk; if symptoms recur, another course of the same treatment is justified. The management of functional dyspepsia is challenging when initial antisecretory therapy and H. pylori eradication fails. There are very limited data to support the use of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants or psychological treatments in functional dyspepsia.

ACG and CAG guideline — scope and definitions note that dyspepsia is described as lasting at least 1 month and functional dyspepsia refers to patients with dyspepsia where endoscopy (and other tests where relevant) has ruled out organic pathology that explains the patient's symptoms. This guideline will focus on initial investigations of dyspepsia such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) testing and endoscopy as well as pharmacological therapies such as H. pylori treatment, PPIs, and prokinetic therapy, and it does not address the management of organic pathology that may present with dyspepsia identified at endoscopy, such as esophagitis or peptic ulcer disease. Further, when H. pylori testing or treatment is recommended we do not specify which investigation or which therapy to use.

### Editorial: functional dyspepsia treatment: trials and tribulations of targeted strategies [^1114GM8W]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

While functional dyspepsia (FD) is an exceedingly common disorder, the number of treatment options remains limited, and strategies for the individualized implementation of these therapies largely are lacking. In the current issue of American Journal of Gastroenterology, Saito and colleagues report on a secondary analysis of data from the Functional Dyspepsia Treatment Trial, specifically examining the role of two candidate genetic markers in predicting FD response to antidepressant treatments. Though the current study yielded a negative result, it nevertheless emphasizes the importance of our continued pursuit of therapeutic biomarkers in order to move beyond "one-size-fits-all" approaches to the treatment of FD and related disorders.

### Current management of functional dyspepsia: impact of Rome III subdivision [^1169pFtt]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of FD

Reassurance is traditionally proposed as the first step in management of FD. Dietary recommendations (eating more frequent, smaller meals and avoiding food that aggravates symptoms) are logical and are usually prescribed to FD patients, but they have not been systematically studied. For many patients drug therapy is considered, but to date the pharmacological options for treating FD are limited. There is a lack of drugs with established efficacy and drug development is hampered by the large placebo effect and the lack of well-validated endpoints for the Rome III definition of FD.

### WITHDRAWN: initial management strategies for dyspepsia [^116UV7We]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

This review considers management strategies (combinations of initial investigation and empirical treatments) for dyspeptic patients. Dyspepsia was defined to include both epigastric pain and heartburn.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and cost effectiveness of the following initial management strategies for patients presenting with dyspepsia (a) Initial pharmacological therapy (including endoscopy for treatment failures). (b) Early endoscopy. (c) Testing for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)and endoscope only those positive. (d) H. pylori eradication therapy with or without prior testing.

Search Strategy

Trials were located through electronic searches and extensive contact with trialists.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of dyspeptic patients presenting in primary care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were collected on dyspeptic symptoms, quality of life and use of resources. An individual patient data meta-analysis of health economic data was conducted

Main Results

Twenty-five papers reporting 27 comparisons were found. Trials comparing proton pump inhibitors (PPI) with antacids (three trials) and histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) (three trials), early endoscopy with initial acid suppression (five trials), H. pylori test and endoscope versus usual management (three trials), H. pylori test and treat versus endoscopy (six trials), and test and treat versus acid suppression alone in H. pylori positive patients (four trials), were pooled. PPIs were significantly more effective than both H2RAs and antacids. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were; for PPI compared with antacid 0.72 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.80), PPI compared with H2RA 0.63 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.85). Results for other drug comparisons were either absent or inconclusive. Initial endoscopy was associated with a small reduction in the risk of recurrent dyspeptic symptoms compared with H. pylori test and treat (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.96), but was not cost effective (mean additional cost of endoscopy US$401 (95% CI $328 to 474). Test and treat may be more effective than acid suppression alone (RR 0.59 95% CI 0.42 to 0.83).

Authors' Conclusions

Proton pump inhibitor drugs (PPIs) are effective in the treatment of dyspepsia in these trials which may not adequately exclude patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The relative efficacy of histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and PPIs is uncertain. Early investigation by endoscopy or H. pylori testing may benefit some patients with dyspepsia but is not cost effective as part of an overall management strategy.

### Functional dyspepsia [^112vzU6b]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Functional dyspepsia is a common disorder, most of the time of unknown etiology and with variable pathophysiology. Therapy has been and still is largely empirical. Data from recent studies provide new clues for targeted therapy based on knowledge of etiology and pathophysiologic mechanisms.

Recent Findings

The role of Helicobacter pylori gastritis in the pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia has been defined: It is causative in a small minority of patients. Associations between (groups of) symptoms and pathophysiologic mechanisms have been established, but there is much overlap and interaction, and their relevance for the individual patient is uncertain, especially because of the variability of symptoms over time. Little progress has been made in pharmacotherapy of functional dyspepsia, but exploratory studies show interesting new options. Hypnotherapy seems a promising alternative.

Summary

For the time being, diagnostic strategies for patients with suspected functional dyspepsia continue to be directed at excluding other disorders, in particular peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease. In the presence of reflux symptoms, acid inhibitory therapy, preferably with a proton pump inhibitor, is a rational choice; otherwise, therapy is still empirical. Hypnotherapy is an option that could be seriously considered.

### Proton-pump inhibitors for the treatment of functional dyspepsia [^114satE1]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

In the Rome III classification, functional dyspepsia (FD) has been further subcategorized into two different syndromes, namely, epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) and postprandial distress syndrome (PDS). Acid-related pathophysiology seems to be mainly responsible for EPS, and antisecretory agents such as proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) seem to be effective mainly against EPS. However, recent information as to the relationship between initial duodenal acid sensitization in the early postprandial phase and delayed gastric emptying in the later postprandial phase would suggest the amelioration of PDS by antisecretory agents. In the present review, we summarized the recent literature on the direct and indirect effect of PPIs in FD (including not only Rome III, but also Rome II criteria). The effects of PPIs against FD are heterogeneous, depending on the protocol of the clinical studies, and the inclusion criteria of each randomized controlled trial (primary care or tertiary care population). As the placebo effects cannot be ignored in this disease, a placebo-controlled study would be necessary, at least for the evaluation of the effect of each agent on symptom relief in patients with FD. Further studies directly comparing PPIs with suitable placebos in terms of their effects in reducing the symptoms of endoscopically confirmed, Rome III-based FD are awaited.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^114MijtQ]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Given that approximately 20% of patients with dyspepsia will have either peptic ulcer or erosive oesophagitis as the underlying cause, the use of empirical acid suppression therapy as a potential management strategy is a reasonable one, as this is an efficacious treatment for both. There is also evidence to suggest that PPI therapy is an efficacious treatment for FD. Other empirical approaches studied include a symptom-based strategy, based on historical subgrouping of patients with dyspepsia, with those with 'reflux-like' or 'ulcer-like' dyspepsia, who probably had EPS, treated with acid suppression and those with 'dysmotility-like' dyspepsia, now termed PDS, a prokinetic drug.

In an attempt to ration use of endoscopy, another approach that has been examined has been to test for H. pylori and only perform endoscopy in those who test positive, based on the theory that these individuals are more likely to have an organic explanation for their symptoms, a so-called 'test and scope' approach. However, this has not been shown to be any more effective than other management strategies, and has never been adopted formally.

There have been multiple RCTs comparing these various management strategies, including prompt endoscopy, for dyspepsia head-to-head. However, until recently, there was equipoise between some of them, and uncertainty as to which was the optimal first-line approach. Pairwise meta-analyses, and even individual patient data meta-analyses, were unable to resolve this uncertainty completely. Although prompt endoscopy is expensive, it was superior to empirical acid suppression or symptom-based management in terms of effect on symptoms in some RCTs, and was superior to 'test and treat' in an individual patient data meta-analysis, but it was not cost-effective. Another individual patient data meta-analysis of 'test and treat' versus empirical acid suppression demonstrated no difference in either costs or effects between the two strategies. Guidelines to date have, therefore, recommended the use of either first-line, depending on local prevalence of H. pylori infection, because a modelling study suggested that 'test and treat' was unlikely to remain cost-effective below a prevalence of infection of 20%.

Recommendations

Referral of patients with FD to gastroenterology in secondary care is appropriate where there is diagnostic doubt, where symptoms are severe, or refractory to first-line treatments, or where the individual patient requests a specialist opinion (recommendation: weak, quality of evidence: low).
We recommend that gastric emptying testing or 24-hour pH monitoring should not be undertaken routinely in patients with typical symptoms of FD (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that, ideally, patients with FD referred to secondary care are managed in a specialist clinic, with access to an interested clinician, dietetic and lifestyle support, with access to efficacious drugs and gut–brain behavioural therapies. Rates of H. pylori 'test and treat' prior to endoscopy, prevalence of H. pylori infection, and use of endoscopy should be audited (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).

### Current opinion: functional dyspepsia [^111jgTuo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Functional dyspepsia is a common gastrointestinal disease that is under-recognized and under-diagnosed. It is a complex disorder of gut-brain interaction with no FDA-approved treatment options. The purpose of this review is to highlight updates in the proposed pathophysiology and present new data regarding potential therapies for functional dyspepsia.

Recent Findings

Alterations in the intestinal microbiome and integrity of the intestinal membrane may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia. The low FODMAP diet, in addition to modulating the microbiome with antibiotics and probiotics, are targets for large future studies. Novel methods of delivery of gut-brain therapies have shown promising results, especially virtual reality.

Summary

The pathophysiology and management of functional dyspepsia is complex and there is still much unknown; however, continued research is identifying new targets for treatment. New and more targeted treatment options provide clinicians a variety of tools to offer patients with functional dyspepsia.

### Cost-effectiveness of a' score and scope' strategy for the management of dyspepsia [^111cH66a]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

It is important to identify the best initial work-up in patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia because of its epidemiological and economical relevance. The objective of the study was to assess systematically the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of invasive and non-invasive strategies for the management of dyspepsia.

Methods

A decision analysis was performed to compare prompt endoscopy, score and scope, test and scope, test and treat, and empirical antisecretory treatment. Published and local data on the prevalence of different diagnoses, rates of Helicobacter pylori infection, accuracy values of diagnostic tests, and effectiveness of drug treatments were used. The perspective of analysis was that of the public healthcare payer, and only direct costs were included, with a one-year post-therapy time horizon. The main outcome measure was cost per asymptomatic patient, valued in 2003 Euros.

Results

Endoscopy was found to be the most effective strategy for the management of dyspepsia (38.4% asymptomatic patients), followed by test and scope (35.5%), test and treat (35.3%), score and scope (34.7%), and empirical treatment (28.5%). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios showed that score and scope was the most cost-effective alternative (483.17 Euros per asymptomatic patient), followed by prompt endoscopy (1396.85 Euros). Sensitivity analyses showed variations when varying the values of prevalence of duodenal ulcer, and the values of healing of functional dyspepsia with antisecretory and eradication drugs. There were no changes when varying the prevalence of H. pylori in dyspepsia.

Conclusions

We would recommend stratifying patients by a score system, referring first to endoscopy those patients at higher risk of organic dyspepsia.

ACG/CAG dyspepsia guideline — Statement 8: We recommend functional dyspepsia patients who are H. pylori-negative or who remain symptomatic despite eradication of the infection should be treated with PPI therapy (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). In 15 RCTs in 14 papers evaluating 5,853 patients, PPI therapy reduced persistent symptoms versus placebo with 2,724/3,916 (69.6%) vs 1,457/1,937 (75.2%), RR dyspepsia remaining = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.82–0.94; P < 0.00001, and an NNT of 10 (95% CI = 7–20). Trials showed no significant difference versus H2RA in 740 patients (RR = 1.27; 95% CI = 0.83–1.94) and a statistically significant difference in favor of PPI over prokinetics in 892 patients (RR dyspepsia remaining = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.81–1.00, P = 0.04). Data suggest that there is no value in doubling the dose of PPI therapy so the drug should be discontinued if the patient does not respond after 8 weeks of standard dose, once-daily therapy.

### Should anti-Helicobacter therapy be different in patients with dyspepsia compared with patients with peptic ulcer diathesis? [^111kqeA2]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Physicians should try to reach an optimal cure rate with initial anti-Helicobacter therapy. Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is more likely to be cured then in patients with 'functional' dyspepsia (FD). Differences in cure rates of 5–15% are usually reported, which is considered to be clinically relevant. Different strains (virulent v. non-virulent) in PUD and FD may induce different alterations in the gastric mucosa, and thereby either facilitate or impair antimicrobial efficacy. A study in this journal showed that triple therapy with ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) was superior to triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), but only in the more-difficult-to-cure FD patients. Clinicians should be aware that most published treatment studies have included only PUD patients. This means that in clinical practice the cure rates obtained in patients with FD or even uninvestigated dyspepsia will usually be lower then those reported in the literature. One way to deal with this is to consider prolonging the duration of an initial anti-Helicobacter therapy from 7 to 10 or 14 days in patients without ulcers.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^1131QL3w]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

A recent network meta-analysis identified 15 eligible RCTs comparing prompt endoscopy, 'test and treat', 'test and scope', empirical acid suppression, and symptom-based management, recruiting 6162 patients. This demonstrated that, although no strategy was superior to another, 'test and treat' ranked first in terms of reducing the relative risk (RR) of remaining symptomatic at 12 months (RR of remaining symptomatic = 0.89; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02), with prompt endoscopy ranked second (RR of remaining symptomatic = 0.90; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02). In addition, patients allocated to 'test and treat' were significantly less likely to require endoscopy (RR vs prompt endoscopy 0.23; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.31) than with all other management strategies, except symptom-based management. Patients receiving prompt endoscopy were, however, significantly less likely to be dissatisfied with management, compared with those randomised to 'test and treat' or empirical acid suppression. Nevertheless, this suggests that 'test and treat' should be the preferred first-line management strategy for dyspepsia in primary care, although it is important to point out that many of the included trials were published over 15 years ago and, therefore, prevalence of H. pylori infection may have declined in Western populations during this time.

### Effectiveness of management strategies for uninvestigated dyspepsia: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111aRNbQ]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Symptom based management was ranked the lowest of all the strategies when considering effectiveness. Management of dyspepsia with drug treatments is unsatisfactory and often lacks an adequate evidence base because the underlying causes of symptoms are poorly understood. This makes targeted drug interventions empirical at best. Patients with dyspepsia might be treated with a variety of drugs, depending on local availability and approval, physicians' personal experience, and to some extent, on assessment of an individual patient's symptom profile. Recent guidelines recommend the use of empirical proton pump inhibitor treatment for patients younger than 60 in whom "test and treat" is unsuccessful and in those without H pylori infection. Although acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor might be effective for some patients, their long term efficacy is unclear and the optimal duration of treatment is not defined. In patients whose dyspeptic symptoms do not respond to a proton pump inhibitor, there is no value in continuing with this treatment. Furthermore, recent concerns about the long term safety of these drugs, although often based on weak evidence, could have altered perceptions of their appropriateness for the long term management of dyspepsia. Additional drug interventions that could be used for the management of dyspepsia include drugs with presumed prokinetic effectsand neuromodulators, including tricyclic antidepressants. The role of prokinetic agents is limited because of their lack of availability in many countries. Neuromodulators have an important role in the management of dyspepsia and other functional gastrointestinal disorders. However, the decision to use any of these drugs, and the order in which they might be tried, is based on choices made by individual physicians and patients, and to some extent is influenced by the factors listed here. Therefore, it is perhaps unsurprising that this largely empirical strategy was the least effective.

With the exception of predominant heartburn, the management of upper abdominal symptoms not caused by an organic disorder remains a challenge. Systematic reviews of large trials show that suppressing acid secretion and eradicating Helicobacter pylori, prokinetics, and antidepressants have inconsistent effects on the treatment of functional dyspepsia. This inconsistent therapeutic efficacy has been attributed to the heterogeneity of patients, and the contribution of multiple mechanisms to development of symptoms. To achieve greater therapeutic efficacy, it may be necessary to target the therapeutic approach to a specific pathophysiology, such as impaired gastric emptying.

### The role of endoscopy in dyspepsia [^111gSnTR]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Dyspepsia management recommendations — We recommend initial endoscopy for new-onset dyspepsia in patients 50 years of age or older or those with alarm features. We recommend that dyspeptic patients younger than 50 years of age and without alarm features undergo either an initial "test and treat" approach for H pylori or empiric therapy with a PPI, depending on the prevalence of H pylori infection in their population. For H pylori prevalence greater than 20%, "test and treat" is recommended. We suggest that dyspeptic patients who are younger than 50 years of age, lack alarm features, and are H pylori negative may be offered a trial of PPI acid suppression. We suggest that endoscopy be performed in dyspeptic patients who are H pylori negative and do not respond to empiric PPI therapy.

### Clinical practice: diagnosis and evaluation of dyspepsia [^115m7ABM]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

The main issue regarding the approach to the patient with uninvestigated dyspepsia is whether the symptoms are the result of an important clinical illness, which then determines the appropriate management strategy for the treatment of the symptoms. An initial trial of empiric antisecretory drugs is recommended for those without Helicobacter pylori infection and no alarm symptoms, whereas H. pylori eradication is recommended for those with an active H. pylori infection. Treatment expectations for H. pylori infections should theoretically be similar to other common infectious diseases. In most regions, clarithromycin resistance has undermined traditional triple therapy so that it is no longer a suitable choice as an empiric therapy. Four drug therapies, such as sequential, concomitant, and bismuth-quadruple therapy are generally still acceptable choices as empiric therapies. Posteradication testing is highly recommended to provide early identification of otherwise unrecognized increasing antimicrobial resistance. However, despite the ability to successfully cure H. pylori infections, a symptomatic response can be expected in only a minority of those with dyspepsia not associated with ulcers (so called nonulcer dyspepsia). Overall, from the patients stand point, symptomatic relief is often difficult to achieve and physicians must rely on reassurance along with empiric and individualized care.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^113Wnbpb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dyspepsia is a very common gastrointestinal (GI) complaint, with up to one in five individuals affected worldwide. Of those with dyspepsia, around 40% will seek the advice of their primary care physician. Consultation behaviour is influenced, in part, by the frequency and severity of symptoms, and increasing age of the patient. Almost 15% of patients with dyspepsia are referred to secondary care for further investigation and management. The overall costs to the health service associated with managing dyspepsia are considerable, estimated to be over $18 billion per annum in the United States of America (USA). Moreover, when one considers that dyspepsia impacts on physical, mental, and social aspects of health-related quality of life, the true overall costs to society are likely to be far higher, and also encompass loss of economic productivity due to sickness-related absence from work.

Consequently, the scale of the clinical and economic problem guarantees firstly, that there is ongoing interest in the evaluation of novel approaches to the investigation and management of dyspepsia, and, secondly, that there is a need for comprehensive clinical guidelines to assist the physician in providing the best care to patients with dyspepsia; care that is both evidence-based and cost-effective.

This review aims to highlight the most important recent developments in both the investigation and management of dyspepsia, and to explore recommendations from the latest clinical guidelines. The most recent of these were published jointly by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) in 2017. These guidelines include the results of a number of updated meta-analyses that evaluate the efficacy of a range of treatments for dyspepsia. United Kingdom (UK) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which are also those recommended by United European Gastro-enterology, in lieu of producing their own guidelines, were last updated in 2015. To provide a broader, global, perspective we also consider the Asian Consensus Report on Functional Dyspepsia (ACFD) from 2012, produced jointly by the Asian Neurogastroenterology and Motility Association and the Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology. Finally, we summarize the findings of a number of relevant updates to Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews that have been published over the last 2 years.

### ACG and CAG clinical guideline: management of dyspepsia [^1111xQXA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD) nonpharmacologic management — Statement 11: WE SUGGEST FUNCTIONAL DYSPEPSIA PATIENTS NOT RESPONDING TO DRUG THERAPY SHOULD BE OFFERED PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES (Conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence). An updated review identified a total of 12 RCTs involving 1,563 FD patients, with all trials reporting a statistically significant benefit of psychological therapies over control; in four papers with dichotomous outcomes in 789 FD patients, the effect was RR = 0.53 (95% CI = 0.44–0.65) with a NNT of three (95% CI = 3–4).

### Functional dyspepsia: evaluation and management [^113XP2W5]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is defined as at least one month of epigastric discomfort without evidence of organic disease found during an upper endoscopy, and it accounts for 70% of dyspepsia. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia include postprandial fullness, early satiety, and epigastric pain or burning. Functional dyspepsia is a diagnosis of exclusion; therefore, evaluation for a more serious disease such as an upper gastrointestinal malignancy is warranted. Individual alarm symptoms do not correlate with malignancy for patients younger than 60 years, and endoscopy is not necessarily warranted but should be considered for patients with severe or multiple alarm symptoms. For patients younger than 60 years, a test and treat strategy for Helicobacter pylori is recommended before acid suppression therapy. For patients 60 years or older, upper endoscopy should be performed. All patients should be advised to limit foods associated with increased symptoms of dyspepsia; a diet low in FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) is suggested. Eight weeks of acid suppression therapy is recommended for patients who test negative for H. pylori, or who continue to have symptoms after H. pylori eradication. If acid suppression does not alleviate symptoms, patients should be treated with tricyclic antidepressants followed by prokinetics and psychological therapy. The routine use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies has not shown evidence of effectiveness and is not recommended.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^1111WWqw]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

We used Review Manager V.5.4.1 (RevMan for Windows 2020, the Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) for updates to pairwise meta-analyses. We conducted an updated network meta-analysis using the frequentist model, with the statistical package 'netmeta' (V.0.9–0,) in R (V.4.0.2). Network meta-analysis usually gives a more precise estimate, compared with results from standard, pairwise meta-analysis. It allows ranking of treatments to inform clinical decisions, according to a P-score, which is a value between 0 and 1, with higher scores indicating a greater probability of a treatment being ranked as best. For both pairwise and network meta-analyses, we pooled data using a random effects model, to give a more conservative estimate of efficacy of individual therapies, and we assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic, which ranges from 0% to 100%, with 0% representing no observed heterogeneity, and larger values indicating increasing heterogeneity. We chose a value ≤ 50% to represent low levels of heterogeneity.

Recommendations

There is insufficient evidence to recommend dietary therapies, including a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, and monosaccharides, and polyols in FD (recommendation: weak; quality of evidence: very low).

Methodology for systematic reviews of drug therapy for FD

To inform this guideline, we updated a series of systematic reviews and pairwise or network meta-analyses, some of which were conducted by the authors. The aim was to assess the efficacy of H. pylori eradication therapy and licensed or unlicensed drugs in FD. We considered RCTs comparing drugs with placebo or each other, with cross-over trials eligible for inclusion, provided extractable data were available at the end of the first treatment period, prior to cross-over. Studies recruited adults from primary, secondary, or tertiary care with FD diagnosed by any criteria (including clinical impression). It is important to point out that, unlike in IBS, there is no accepted or approved endpoint to judge symptom response in FD, and therefore, most RCTs use measures such as improvement in, satisfactory relief of, or cure of, global FD symptoms or epigastric pain. Eligible trials had to report efficacy of treatment in terms of any of these endpoints as a dichotomous assessment.

### Effect and cost-effectiveness of step-up versus step-down treatment with antacids, H2-receptor antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors in patients with new onset dyspepsia (DIAMOND study): a primary-care-based randomised controlled trial [^113Q4P3s]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Substantial physician workload and high costs are associated with the treatment of dyspepsia in primary health care. Despite the availability of consensus statements and guidelines, the most cost-effective empirical strategy for initial management of the condition remains to be determined. We compared step-up and step-down treatment strategies for initial management of patients with new onset dyspepsia in primary care.

Methods

Patients aged 18 years and older who consulted with their family doctor for new onset dyspepsia in the Netherlands were eligible for enrolment in this double-blind, randomised controlled trial. Between October, 2003, and January, 2006, 664 patients were randomly assigned to receive stepwise treatment with antacid, H₂-receptor antagonist, and proton pump inhibitor (step-up; n = 341), or these drugs in the reverse order (step-down; n = 323), by use of a computer-generated sequence with blocks of six. Each step lasted 4 weeks and treatment only continued with the next step if symptoms persisted or relapsed within 4 weeks. Primary outcomes were symptom relief and cost-effectiveness of initial management at 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT); the ITT population consisted of all patients with data for the primary outcome at 6 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00247715.

Findings

332 patients in the step-up, and 313 in the step-down group reached an endpoint with sufficient data for evaluation; the main reason for dropout was loss to follow-up. Treatment success after 6 months was achieved in 238 (72%) patients in the step-up group and 219 (70%) patients in the step-down group (odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.7–1.3). The average medical costs were lower for patients in the step-up group than for those in the step-down group (euro228 vs euro245; p = 0.0008), which was mainly because of costs of medication. One or more adverse drug events were reported by 94 (28%) patients in the step-up and 93 (29%) patients in the step-down group. All were minor events, including (other) dyspeptic symptoms, diarrhoea, constipation, and bad/dry taste.

Interpretation

Although treatment success with either step-up or step-down treatment is similar, the step-up strategy is more cost effective at 6 months for initial treatment of patients with new onset dyspeptic symptoms in primary care.

### Effectiveness of management strategies for uninvestigated dyspepsia: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111qXd5F]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Dyspepsia is a common condition that could involve a variety of upper gastrointestinal symptoms, but the main symptom is upper abdominal pain or discomfort. At some point in their lives, one in five adults report epigastric pain, early satiety, postprandial distress, and other associated upper gastrointestinal symptoms, such as heartburn, regurgitation, or nausea. Although dyspepsia is not associated with higher mortality risk, the condition is chronic in many peopleand follows a fluctuating course. Dyspepsia has a substantial impact on patients' quality of life, and is associated with more time off work and lower productivity at work, and greater medical and prescription drug costs each year. The financial implications for society as a whole are huge.

Approximately 40% of people with dyspepsia symptoms will consult a primary care physician. The physician has to make a decision about how best to manage the individual patient. Patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia and alarm features, such as dysphagia, weight loss, or anaemia, or those older than a certain age threshold, require urgent endoscopy. However, the management of uninvestigated dyspepsia in the absence of alarm features represents a classic medical decision making problem because several strategies exist. These strategies include prompt endoscopy for all patients; test for Helicobacter pylori and perform endoscopy in those who test positive ("test and scope"); test for H pylori and eradication treatment in those who test positive ("test and treat"); empirical acid suppression for all patients; or symptom based management according to guideline recommendations or the physician's usual practice.

### Therapeutic role of probiotics for the treatment of dyspepsia: a review of the literature [^115GY5f5]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Dyspepsia is defined according to the Rome IV criteria as any combination of the following 4 symptoms: postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, and epigastric burning that are severe enough to interfere with the usual activities and occur at least 3 days per week over the last 3 months with an onset of at least 6 months in advance. Dyspepsia can be initially classified into three groups depending on whether upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has been performed and, if so, whether relevant pathology is detected: uninvestigated dyspepsia, organic dyspepsia, and functional dyspepsia (FD). After an accurate history taking and physical exam, in the absence of alarm symptoms and signs, patients are diagnosed as being affected by uninvestigated dyspepsia and can be treated empirically on the basis of their clinical manifestations. Uninvestigated dyspepsia prevalence varies between countries and ranges from 17.6% in studies defining uninvestigated dyspepsia according to Rome I criteria to 6.9% in those using Rome IV criteria. If the response is unsatisfactory or early relapses occur, a test and treat approach for(HP) infection is recommended. A recent systematic review estimated that more than 4 billion individuals would be positive for HP. Symptoms of patients diagnosed with HP ‐associated dyspepsia are treated by HP eradication. Moreover, patients undergoing endoscopy for suspected organic dyspepsia are often diagnosed with pathological findings that may be responsible for the symptoms, such as peptic ulcer, gastritis, or many other gastrointestinal or systemic causes.

### Dyspepsia [^116ZHZ4r]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review critically evaluates the current status of dyspepsia and, in particular, recent advances in epidemiology, pathophysiology and management. The very definition of dyspepsia and of functional dyspepsia, in particular, continues to generate controversy; the Rome III redefinition of functional dyspepsia remains to be proven to be of clinical value. Overlap with gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome further complicate clinical definitions.

Recent Findings

Most studies of pathophysiology continue to focus on gastric sensory and motor functions, though some intriguing early data raise the possibility of an infective or immunological contribution. There have been few, if any, major breakthroughs in treatment; most recent studies address instead the niceties of Helicobacter pylori eradication and acid suppressive strategies.

Summary

This continued lack of progress in the area can only lead one to question some very basic concepts in this disorder, such as does functional dyspepsia, as we have come to know it, really exist as a distinct entity?

Methods

Search strategy and study selection

We searched Medline (from 1947 to September 2019), Embase, Embase Classic (from 1947 to September 2019), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify potential studies. In addition, we searched national guidelines for the management of dyspepsia, clinicaltrials.gov for unpublished trials, and supplementary data for potentially eligible studies (all up to September 2019). Conference proceedings (Digestive Disease Week, American College of Gastroenterology, United European Gastroenterology Week, and the Asian Pacific Digestive Week) between 2001 and 2019 were hand searched to identify studies published only in abstract form. Finally, we performed a recursive search by using the bibliographies of all obtained articles.

Eligible randomised controlled trials examined the effect of various management strategies for uninvestigated dyspepsia (prompt endoscopy, "test and treat", "test and scope", empirical acid suppression, or symptom based management) in adult participants (age ≥ 18 years). The definition of dyspepsia was broad and included any upper gastrointestinal symptoms referable to the gastroduodenum. We only considered randomised controlled trials to be eligible when they examined the effectiveness of one of the strategies of interest and compared it with at least one of the other strategies. Because dyspepsia is a chronic fluctuating condition, a minimum follow-up of 12 months was required. We extracted all endpoints at the final point of follow-up to ensure as much homogeneity as possible among individual trial results, and to avoid overestimating the effectiveness of one management strategy relative to another. Studies had to report a dichotomous assessment of symptom status at the final point of follow-up (box 1). The study protocol was published on the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (registration number CRD42019132528).

### The role of endoscopy in dyspepsia [^112J9sms]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Dyspepsia — empiric acid suppression therapy (proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]): Many authors and societies advocate acid suppressive therapy as the initial strategy for dyspeptic patients, and empiric PPIs are more effective than antacids and histamine receptor antagonists; randomized trials show absolute risk reductions of 10% to 17%, and a meta-analysis of 7 studies reported that PPIs were superior to placebo for reducing dyspeptic symptoms (relative risk reduction, 10%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.7%-17.3%), with a significant benefit evident only in the reflux-type symptom group and not in those with dysmotility-like symptoms; empiric acid suppression will not address underlying H pylori infection in H pylori–associated peptic ulcer disease and may risk symptom recurrence when stopped; in one study of patients younger than 45 years of age, endoscopy was used more frequently in the PPI group than with a "test and treat" approach (88% vs 55%; P < .001); cost-effectiveness of "test and treat" versus empiric acid suppression depends on H pylori prevalence.

1 TREATMENT LANDSCAPE IN FD

Therapeutic options for FD are currently limited and include prokinetics, antisecretory agents, eradication of Helicobacter pylori, and centrally acting neuromodulators. 1 With gains over placebo not exceeding 10–20%, the efficacy is limited (see Table 1). 1, 2 Conventional chemically defined treatment approaches ideally target specific more or less well‐characterized pathophysiologic disease mechanisms while many first‐line treatments are recommended based upon specific symptom clusters (e.g. acid blockers in patients with epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) or prokinetic agents for the postprandial distress syndrome (PDS). 2

TABLE 1
Efficacy and limitations for different treatment classes in FD (adapted from Masuy 2019) 1

Possible explanations for the limited effects of available chemically defined therapies include the heterogeneity of putative pathophysiologies. 3 In addition, the links between disturbed functions and symptoms (e.g. gastric emptying and postprandial fullness) are weak, and consequentially, there is a lack of robust predictors of response. 1, 4 Substantial numbers of patients also fulfill both EPS and PDS criteria by the Rome III criteria, rendering a subgroup‐based initial therapy recommendation ineffective. 5 Thus, multiple pathophysiological disturbances may co‐exist in patients who manifest with more than one symptom cluster. Early data suggest that the Rome IV criteria may produce a sharper discrimination among the different subgroups. 6, 7 However, this has yet to be substantiated in clinic populations. 8

Furthermore, in the outpatient clinic there is substantial overlap of FD with other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) syndrome. In a pan‐Asian survey of primary and secondary care GI clinics, an estimated 83% of FD (by Rome III) had an overlapping condition. 9 This was reinforced by a study from Australia where in a tertiary center, the majority of FGID patients had overlapping FD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 10 Importantly, FD patients who have overlapping symptoms are more difficult to treat; they report greater symptom severity, treatment dissatisfaction, more physician visits, specialist referrals, and surgery. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

### Proton pump inhibitors for functional dyspepsia [^1165fiN9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Functional dyspepsia (FD or non-ulcer dyspepsia) is defined as continuous or frequently recurring epigastric pain or discomfort for which no organic cause can be found. Acid suppressive therapy, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), has been proposed as a therapeutic option in FD, but its efficacy remains controversial. While PPIs are generally considered safe and well tolerated, they have been associated with adverse events, especially in the long term. For this reason, decisions on whether to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be made based on an appropriate clinical indication. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate whether PPI therapy provides symptomatic relief in FD.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in the improvement of global symptoms of dyspepsia and quality of life compared to placebo, H2 receptor antagonists or prokinetics, in people with functional dyspepsia.

Search Methods

We searched in the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Library (to January 2016), MEDLINE (OvidSP; to February 2016), Embase (OvidSP; to February 2016), and SIGLE grey literature (up to February 2016) and clinical trial registries; we handsearched abstracts from conferences up to February 2016. We screened non-systematic reviews, systematic reviews and guidelines to identify any additional trials. We contacted trialists to obtain missing information.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any PPI with placebo, H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) or prokinetics for the treatment of FD. Participants were adults (aged 16 years or greater) with an adequate diagnosis of FD (any validated criteria such as Rome I, II, III or Lancet Working Group).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. We collected data on dyspeptic symptoms, quality of life and number of overall adverse events. Specific adverse events were beyond the scope of this review.

Main Results

We identified 23 RCTs from 22 papers (with 8759 participants) studying the effect of PPIs versus placebo, H2RAs or prokinetics for improvement of global symptoms of dyspepsia and quality of life in people with FD. Low-dose PPIs had similar efficacy as standard-dose PPIs, therefore we combined these subgroups for the analysis. Two to eight weeks of therapy with PPI was slightly more effective than placebo at relieving overall dyspepsia symptoms in people with FD (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.94; participants = 5968; studies = 16; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 13; moderate quality evidence). PPIs may be slightly more effective than H2RAs (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.04; participants = 740; studies = 2, NNTB 13; low quality evidence), and slightly more effective than prokinetics (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.00; participants = 892; studies = 4; NNTB 20; low quality evidence) at relieving overall dyspepsia symptoms in people with FD. PPIs plus prokinetics were possibly slightly more effective than PPIs alone at relieving overall dyspepsia symptoms (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08; participants = 407; studies = 2; NNTB 18; moderate quality evidence). The was no difference when subgrouped by Helicobacter pylori status, country of origin, or presence of reflux or Rome III subtypes. There were no differences in the number of adverse events observed between PPIs and any of the other treatments.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that PPIs are effective for the treatment of FD, independent of the dose and duration of treatment compared with placebo. PPIs may be slightly more effective than H2RAs for the treatment of FD; however, the evidence is scarce. The trials evaluating PPIs versus prokinetics are difficult to interpret as they are at risk of bias. Although the effect of these drugs seems to be small, the drugs are well tolerated.

### Is the antidepressant venlafaxine effective for the treatment of functional dyspepsia? [^1162oxTf]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Several studies have suggested that antidepressants might be beneficial in the treatment of patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders. This commentary discusses the results of a high-quality, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that showed no benefit of the antidepressant venlafaxine over placebo in the treatment of a large group of patients with functional dyspepsia. Moreover, venlafaxine was poorly tolerated by a considerable number of patients. The routine use of venlafaxine and other serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor antidepressants to treat patients with functional dyspepsia is, therefore, not recommended. Whether certain subgroups of patients, particularly those with anxious or depressive psychiatric comorbidities, might benefit from treatment with this class of antidepressants, however, remains to be elucidated. Antidepressants with different mechanisms of actions, for example mirtazapine, might still prove beneficial for the treatment of functional dyspepsia, but no clinical studies have yet investigated the efficacy of these drugs in this setting.

H. pylori eradication therapy

Given that 5% of dyspepsia in the community is attributable to H. pylori, and up to 80% of individuals with dyspepsia have FD, eradicating the bacterium in patients diagnosed with FD who are found to be H. pylori -positive is logical. Updating the prior meta-analysis of H. pylori eradication therapy for infected patients with FD, with 10 new trials recruiting 2896 patients, demonstrated a significant benefit over a control of antisecretory therapy or prokinetics, with or without placebo antibiotics, or a placebo alone in terms of symptom cure or improvement. The RR of symptoms not being cured or improving in 29 trials, containing 6781 patients, was 0.87 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.92) (online supplemental figure 1), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I² = 64%). The effect was even larger in individuals whose infection was eradicated successfully, compared with those receiving control therapy, in 16 trials containing 2809 patients (0.74; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.85) (online supplemental figure 2). When only those trials that reported symptom cure were included in the analysis, most of which assessed this at 12 months, there was still a significant benefit of H. pylori eradication therapy (RR of symptoms not being cured = 0.91; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.94) (online supplemental figure 3), with low heterogeneity between studies (I² = 7%). Total numbers of adverse events were only reported by eight RCTs, containing 1937 patients, but were significantly more common with eradication therapy. Individual adverse events were not reported in sufficient detail by the trials to allow further assessment. Withdrawals due to adverse events were reported by 18 trials and were again significantly more likely than with control therapy.

Although the treatment effect is modest, cure of symptoms at 12 months is a stringent endpoint, and it is likely that eradication therapy for H. pylori -positive patients with FD is cost-effective, as it only needs to be taken for 1–2 weeks. In terms of which patients are more likely to respond, one trial demonstrated a significant effect of eradication therapy on epigastric pain and burning, but not early satiation or postprandial fullness, suggesting the benefit may be more pronounced in EPS.

Recommendations

Eradication therapy is an efficacious treatment for H. pylori -positive patients with FD. Adverse events are more common than with a control therapy (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high).

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^116v4nbG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Indications for Helicobacter pylori testing and treatment — test-and-treat strategy and follow-up are outlined. Testing for, and treatment of, H. pylori infection should be viewed as dependent rather than independent actions, and therefore all patients with an indication for testing should be offered effective treatment if confirmed to have active infection — and should subsequently undergo a test-of-cure after treatment. The "test-and-treat" approach for uninvestigated dyspepsia is reasonable in patients under the age of 60 years, without alarm features and without other indications for endoscopy. In patients with functional dyspepsia, eradication of H. pylori infection only provides modest benefit.

Key Points

Chemically defined therapeutic targets appear inconsistent with the multifactorial nature of functional dyspepsia.
Mechanistic studies indicate that herbs individually and in combination have multiple concurrent pharmacological activities relevant to dyspepsia. Meta‐analyses provide signals of efficacy and safety for dyspepsia with several commercially available herbal compounds found to have at least RCTs published in mainstream journals.
Herbal medicines expand the scope for the treatment of functional dyspepsia, an underserved therapeutic area.

Acid-suppressive drugs

Acid suppression is a frequently used first-line treatment. It is well known that patients with concomitant symptom of heartburn are best candidates for acid suppression therapy. A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled, randomized trials with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in FD patients showed a significant benefit of 13% for this class of drugs over placebo. There was no significant difference in efficacy among various PPI doses. FD patients with epigastric pain (EPS group according to Rome III) rather than patients with meal-induced symptoms seem to respond to PPIs.

Based on all the above, we recommend urgent endoscopy only in patients aged ≥ 55 years with dyspepsia with evidence of weight loss. Non-urgent endoscopy can be considered in patients aged ≥ 55 years with treatment-resistant dyspepsia or dyspepsia with either a raised platelet count or nausea or vomiting. In those with aged ≥ 60 years with abdominal pain and weight loss urgent CT scanning should be considered. In patients from areas at high risk of gastric cancer, or those with a family history of gastro-oesophageal malignancy, the age limit for endoscopy should be reduced to > 40 years. Recommendations as to when to consider endoscopy in patients with dyspepsia and overlapping gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms are as for patients with dyspepsia alone.

In all other patients with dyspepsia a 'test and treat' strategy should be preferred, with those testing negative receiving a course of empirical acid suppression, using the lowest dose that improves their symptoms. Successful eradication of H. pylori after 'test and treat' should only be confirmed in those with an increased risk of gastric cancer, as recommended elsewhere in other guidance. As in any other condition, clinical judgement may still suggest the need for endoscopy in individual cases. Similarly, the patient may insist an endoscopy is performed. In the latter instance, it should be reiterated that the yield is likely to be low and the expected diagnosis is FD, with the patient counselled about the risks and benefits of a potentially unnecessary invasive investigation.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for functional dyspepsia, more specifically with respect to psychological interventions, BSG 2022 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following interventions for global symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia:

- interpersonal psychodynamic-informed psychotherapy

- cognitive-behavioral therapy and metacognitive therapy

- stress management approaches

- hypnotherapy.

### How to manage the difficult-to-treat dyspeptic patient [^114DjZ4Q]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

The main causes of dyspepsia are unexplained gastroduodenal symptoms (i.e. functional dyspepsia), peptic ulcer disease, reflux disease and, rarely, malignancy. A careful clinical evaluation and upper endoscopy will exclude most of the major causes of dyspepsia. The absence of alarm features is reassuring. The yield of other diagnostic tests in this clinical situation is low, and repeat endoscopy is unlikely to be cost-effective. By definition, the difficult-to-treat patient with functional dyspepsia has already had Helicobacter pylori infection excluded or eradicated, has failed to respond to an adequate trial of acid-suppression therapy that used appropriate doses and, therefore, seeks other solutions. It is likely that patients who have failed to respond to previous trials of a PPI will not experience therapeutic gains with high-dose PPI therapy. A major gastroduodenal motor disorder should be suspected if there is severe early satiation (inability to finish a normal-sized meal), postprandial fullness, or persistent nausea and vomiting; here, an assessment of gastric emptying or gastric accommodation can be considered, to tailor therapy. Antidepressants (especially low-dose tricyclic agents) and psychological therapies can be useful. Creation of a logical management plan that includes patient education and support remains key.

### Functional dyspepsia: a critical appraisal of the European consensus from a global perspective [^115s54eL]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Medium credibility.

The European Society for Neurogastroenterology and Motility's (ESNM) consensus document on functional dyspepsia (FD) has provided a critical review of the evidence for 36 statements highly relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of FD. We provide here our expert opinion on the North American, Australian and Asian assessments of the same topics discussed, and provide evidence where the ESNM consensus may deviate from those in the other continents. New and exciting data about the pathogenesis of FD are emerging including the possible central role of duodenal micro-inflammation (most notably eosinophilic duodenitis and intestinal mast cell disease), but this is a very dynamic field with several gaps remaining in our understanding that are summarized in this review. Identification of non-invasive biomarkers and testing of targeted therapies, including assessing the benefits of multidisciplinary teams in the management of FD, should be future priorities.

### Complementary and alternative medicine for functional gastrointestinal disorders [^112MmT2f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The relevance of functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and their impact on quality of life for many patients has become an increasingly important topic in gastroenterology. A gastroenterologist can expect to see 40% of patients for motility and functional GI disorders, thus highlighting the necessity for physicians to have a strong foundation of knowledge in treatment strategies for these patients with complex disorders. A significant number of patients who suffer with functional GI disorders turn to complementary and alternative therapies to maintain control over their symptoms and often are happy with therapeutic results. This narrative presents information and treatment algorithms for the gastroenterologist to better understand and use some of the most common complementary and alternative therapies for patients with functional dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting, and irritable bowel syndrome.

### Functional dyspepsia [^114pYgxi]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Dyspepsia is a complex of symptoms referable to the gastroduodenal region of the gastrointestinal tract and includes epigastric pain or burning, postprandial fullness, or early satiety. Approximately 80% of individuals with dyspepsia have no structural explanation for their symptoms and have functional dyspepsia. Functional dyspepsia affects up to 16% of otherwise healthy individuals in the general population. Risk factors include psychological comorbidity, acute gastroenteritis, female sex, smoking, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and Helicobacter pylori infection. The pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, but it is probably related to disordered communication between the gut and the brain, leading to motility disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, and alterations in gastrointestinal microbiota, mucosal and immune function, and CNS processing. Although technically a normal endoscopy is required to diagnose functional dyspepsia, the utility of endoscopy in all patients with typical symptoms is minimal; its use should be restricted to people aged 55 years and older, or to those with concerning features, such as weight loss or vomiting. As a result of our incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology, functional dyspepsia is difficult to treat and, in most patients, the condition is chronic and the natural history is one of fluctuating symptoms. Eradication therapy should be offered to patients with functional dyspepsia who test positive for Helicobacter pylori. Other therapies with evidence of effectiveness include proton pump inhibitors, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, prokinetics, and central neuromodulators. The role of psychological therapies is uncertain. As our understanding of the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia increases, it is probable that the next decade will see the emergence of truly disease-modifying therapies for the first time.

### ACG and CAG clinical guideline: management of dyspepsia [^116Knxcb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD) pharmacologic management — Statement 9: WE RECOMMEND FUNCTIONAL DYSPEPSIA PATIENTS NOT RESPONDING TO PPI OR H. PYLORI ERADICATION THERAPY (IF APPROPRIATE) SHOULD BE OFFERED TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANT THERAPY (Conditional recommendation, moderate quality evidence). Evidence includes three trials involving 339 FD patients comparing TCAs with placebo showing a statistically significant reduction in dyspepsia symptoms (RR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.61–0.91) with an NNT of six (95% CI = 6–18), whereas two trials involving 388 FD patients comparing SSRIs with placebo found no statistically significant effect (RR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.89–1.15). TCAs are associated with adverse events (which include constipation, dry mouth, urinary retention, and somnolence), and we recommend TCA before prokinetic for treatment of FD based on the superior evidence for TCA in this indication.

### Effectiveness of management strategies for uninvestigated dyspepsia: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116BN9AU]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Box 1
Eligibility criteria

Randomised controlled trials
Adults (aged ≥ 18 years)
Uninvestigated dyspepsia, before first investigation
Compared strategy of interest with at least one other strategy: prompt endoscopy, "test and scope", "test and treat", empirical acid suppression, or symptom based management
Minimum follow-up duration of 12 months
Dichotomous assessment of dyspeptic symptoms at minimum of 12 months

Two investigators (LHE and ACF) conducted the literature search independently from each other. We report the search strategy in the supplementary materials. There were no language restrictions. Two investigators (LHE and ACF) evaluated all abstracts identified by the search for eligibility, again independently from each other. We obtained all potentially relevant papers and evaluated them in more detail by using predesigned forms to assess eligibility independently, according to the predefined criteria. We translated foreign language papers if required. Disagreements between investigators were resolved by discussion.

Outcome assessment

We assessed the effectiveness of all five management strategies of uninvestigated dyspepsia by comparing the probability of being symptomatic at the final point of follow-up. Additionally, because individual trials reported several other secondary endpoints, we were able to assess the likelihood of participants receiving endoscopy in each treatment arm, and dissatisfaction with management. Finally, we recorded rates of upper gastrointestinal cancer detection.

Data extraction

Two investigators (LHE and ACF) extracted all data independently onto a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (XP professional edition) as dichotomous outcomes (symptomatic or asymptomatic at final point of follow-up). For all included studies, we also extracted the following data for each trial, when available: country of origin, setting, duration of follow-up, age range of included participants, proportion of female participants, proportion of participants with H pylori infection, and exact management strategy used. Data were extracted as intention to treat analyses, with dropouts assumed to be treatment failures (that is, symptomatic at final point of follow-up), by using the total number of participants randomised to each treatment arm as the denominator, wherever trial reporting allowed. Given the duration of follow-up in individual trials, we also performed a sensitivity analysis by using a per protocol analysis and including all participants with reported evaluable data at the final point of follow-up.

### Diagnosis and treatment of functional dyspepsia… [^113CmGEp]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Her laboratory tests were normal, except for Helicobacter pylori testing, for which she was treated. Despite treatment, Mrs. C's symptoms persisted. She ultimately had a normal endoscopy, and was diagnosed with functional dyspepsia. Recommendations: The work-up of functional dyspepsia includes a complete blood count to rule out anemia. Other laboratory tests should be targeted to symptoms. H. pylori testing is recommended, whereas endoscopy should be reserved for patients older than 55 years with alarm symptoms, or those who fail medical therapy with H. pylori eradication or antisecretory agents. Treatment of functional dyspepsia is nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic. Nonpharmacologic approaches include dietary modification, such as limiting dietary fat, avoiding meals too late in the day, and eating smaller meals.

Patients should avoid specific foods if they correlate with symptoms. There are few trials on psychological treatment and hypnotherapy, but these can be recommended as adjuncts to conventional treatment. Pharmacologic treatments may be beneficial. There may be a small positive impact on symptoms with H. pylori eradication, but this should be initiated only with proven infection. Although study results are inconsistent, proton pump inhibitors should be tried in patients not infected with H. pylori or in patients not responding to H. pylori eradication, especially those with reflux-predominant symptoms. Prokinetic agents may be tried, but larger studies showed no benefit compared with placebo. The use of metoclopramide is questionable because it causes sedation, and domperidone is not available in the United States. Other mixed or partial 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 agonists have been withdrawn from the U. S.

market because of adverse cardiac effects. Antidepressants were shown to be of benefit in one systematic review. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have not been studied, but tricyclics are thought to have beneficial impact on symptoms through their anticholinergic effect. Doses required for functional dyspepsia are lower than those for depression. Symptom improvement was found at four and eight weeks with one herbal agent, Iberogast.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the… [^117WKZHT]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the latest evidence-based guidelines for the management of functional dyspepsia. Bottom Line The thoughtful, evidence-based guidelines provide a helpful framework for evaluating and treating patients with dyspepsia. The guidance regarding imaging and the use of upper endoscopy may be conservative for U. S. physicians. The authors acknowledge that approximately half of the recommendations are based on low- or very low-quality evidence. Synopsis The 2022 guideline, last updated in 1996, was based on a series of systematic reviews and network meta-analyses. The authors recommend urgent evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal alarm symptoms, such as dysphagia in all patients, weight loss with dyspepsia, upper abdominal pain, or reflux in patients 55 years and older. All patients with dyspepsia should be evaluated for the presence of Helicobacter pylori by obtaining a stool or breath test.

If the results are abnormal, the patient should be treated to eradicate H. pylori. Confirmation of H. pylori eradication is recommended only for patients at increased risk of gastric cancer, although it should be considered in patients whose symptoms persist. The guidelines recommend against the routine use of gastric emptying tests or 24-hour pH monitoring. For patients who are negative for H. pylori, first-line treatment includes acid-suppressive therapy with a histamine H 2 antagonist or proton pump inhibitor and regular aerobic exercise; the guidelines do not recommend specific diets such as a FODMAP diet. Prokinetics may be an effective treatment, and the strongest evidence supports tegaserod. Second-line therapies include low to moderate dosages of tricyclic antidepressants. The authors recommend against selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone. Cognitive behavior therapy, psychodynamic interpersonal psychotherapy, stress management, and hypnotherapy may be effective. Patients with refractory or persistent symptoms should be referred to a gastroenterologist.
