## Question

Can you explain if a patient with SLE can present with inflammatory liver microabscess

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can present with inflammatory liver microabscesses, and if so, how to interpret and manage that scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "inflammatory liver microabscess" means histopathologically and radiologically. Then, I should verify the spectrum of liver involvement in SLE and whether microabscesses are described. Next, I will consider plausible pathophysiologic mechanisms in SLE that could lead to microabscesses. After that, I need to check for alternative explanations such as infection, drug-induced injury, and overlap autoimmune liver disease. Finally, I will outline a diagnostic and management approach and synthesize a cautious conclusion with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. "Inflammatory liver microabscess" is not a standard term in SLE literature. It generally denotes tiny collections of neutrophils within hepatic parenchyma, which on imaging can appear as subcentimeter hypoattenuating foci and on histology as clusters of neutrophils, sometimes with necrosis, raising concern for infection or severe focal inflammatory processes rather than classic autoimmune hepatitis patterns [^notfound].

> Now, I should review the established hepatic manifestations of SLE to see if microabscesses are recognized. Wait, let me verify the spectrum: SLE liver disease spans asymptomatic transaminase elevations, lupus hepatitis (often lobular inflammation with sparse lymphocytes), steatosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, vascular lesions such as Budd-Chiari, and overlap with autoimmune hepatitis. None of these canonical descriptions include neutrophilic microabscesses as a typical feature of lupus hepatitis or SLE-related liver disease [^115T4mQ7] [^111RDSt7] [^112KK8XA] [^1168AQPK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether any case series or reviews mention microabscesses in SLE livers. I find no reports describing true hepatic neutrophilic microabscesses as a manifestation of SLE itself, whereas case series of SLE patients with liver abnormalities emphasize drug-induced injury, viral hepatitis, steatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, and occasionally granulomas from systemic infection rather than SLE-driven microabscesses, reinforcing that microabscesses are atypical for SLE liver disease [^114M2jRG] [^112G9GV6] [^116jRwrq].

> But wait, what if SLE biology could still plausibly lead to microabscesses? Let me consider mechanisms: immune complex–mediated vasculitis can cause ischemia and secondary neutrophilic inflammation. Impaired clearance of apoptotic material and microparticles may perpetuate neutrophil recruitment. And neutrophil extracellular traps and type I interferon pathways could amplify focal neutrophilic inflammation. However, these mechanistic links remain hypothetical for hepatic microabscesses and are not documented in the liver literature for SLE, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret pathophysiology without clinicopathologic correlation [^111sTtGw] [^115Cp9B6] [^115EdD5b].

> I should double-check the differential because microabscesses strongly suggest infection or focal severe inflammatory injury rather than classic autoimmune hepatitis or lupus hepatitis. Infections such as Candida, Staphylococcus, gram-negative bacteria, and opportunistic pathogens are well-described in immunosuppressed hosts and can produce hepatic microabscesses; drug-induced liver injury can mimic severe hepatitis; and overlap autoimmune hepatitis, while lymphoplasmacytic rather than neutrophilic, can confound the picture, so I need to ensure these are actively excluded before attributing findings to SLE [^114M2jRG] [^114qdB4M].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic diagnostic approach. Let me first confirm that blood cultures, viral hepatitis serologies, and targeted infectious workup are obtained. Then, I need to check liver imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to characterize focal lesions. If the diagnosis remains uncertain, I should verify that a liver biopsy is pursued to distinguish neutrophilic microabscesses from lymphoplasmacytic interface hepatitis and to culture tissue. And I must correlate with SLE activity indices, serologies, and medication exposures to avoid premature attribution to SLE [^111PyGQa].

> I will now examine management implications. If infection is confirmed or strongly suspected, I need to ensure prompt antimicrobial therapy and source control rather than escalating immunosuppression. Conversely, if infection is excluded and SLE activity is high with compatible histology, immunosuppression per SLE guidelines may be appropriate, but I should confirm that any organ- or life-threatening disease receives timely high-dose glucocorticoids with consideration of cyclophosphamide or rituximab in refractory cases, ideally with multidisciplinary input [^116EV65D] [^113GdcjC] [^1114Kn5S].

> Let me reconsider the core question and make sure I am not overstating. Based on available evidence, inflammatory liver microabscesses are not a recognized or typical manifestation of SLE-related liver disease; their presence should trigger a careful search for infection, drug-induced injury, or alternative diagnoses, with SLE considered only after these are reasonably excluded and supported by compatible clinical and histopathologic context [^115T4mQ7] [^1168AQPK] [^114M2jRG].

> In summary, I should confirm that while SLE can involve the liver in multiple ways, hepatic neutrophilic microabscesses are not described in the canonical SLE liver spectrum. If microabscesses are identified, I need to ensure a rigorous workup for infection and other non-SLE etiologies before attributing them to lupus, and then tailor therapy accordingly with close multidisciplinary coordination [^111RDSt7] [^116EV65D] [^114qdB4M].

Patients with SLE can develop **inflammatory liver microabscesses**, but this is rare and usually reflects **opportunistic infection** or **vasculitis-related ischemia** rather than primary SLE hepatitis [^notfound]. Microabscesses are not a typical feature of lupus hepatitis, which is usually a bland, lymphocytic infiltrate without neutrophilic abscesses [^notfound]. When microabscesses are present, evaluate for infection (especially Candida, Staphylococcus, Gram-negative bacteria) [^notfound], drug-induced liver injury, and overlap syndromes such as autoimmune hepatitis [^111kuWs6]. Diagnosis relies on imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI) [^notfound], serologies, cultures, and liver biopsy [^114M2jRG]; management includes targeted antimicrobials, immunosuppression for SLE activity, and close monitoring for complications [^116EV65D].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** may underlie the formation of inflammatory liver microabscesses in SLE:

- **Immune complex deposition**: Immune complexes can deposit in hepatic vessels, causing vasculitis and ischemia, leading to necrosis and secondary infection [^notfound].

- **Opportunistic infections**: SLE patients are immunosuppressed and at increased risk of infections (e.g. Candida, Staphylococcus, gram-negative bacteria) that can cause microabscesses [^113WYJ1T].

- **Drug-induced liver injury**: Immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. azathioprine, methotrexate) can cause liver injury and increase infection risk [^112G9GV6].

- **Overlap syndromes**: Autoimmune hepatitis or other autoimmune liver diseases may coexist with SLE, complicating the clinical picture [^114Nbicz].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with SLE and inflammatory liver microabscesses typically present with the following **clinical features**:

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, weight loss, and fatigue are common [^notfound].

- **Hepatic symptoms**: Right upper quadrant pain, hepatomegaly, and jaundice may occur [^notfound].

- **Laboratory abnormalities**: Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT), leukocytosis, and elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) are often observed [^notfound].

- **Imaging findings**: Ultrasound, CT, or MRI may reveal multiple small hypoechoic or hypodense lesions consistent with microabscesses [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosing inflammatory liver microabscesses in SLE requires a **multimodal approach**:

| **Diagnostic modality** | **Role in diagnosis** |
|-|-|
| Imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI) | Identify and characterize microabscesses; differentiate from other hepatic lesions [^notfound] |
| Serological tests | Detect SLE activity (ANA, anti-dsDNA, complement levels) and exclude viral hepatitis [^1149i3aA] |
| Blood cultures and microbiological tests | Identify causative organisms [^notfound] |
| Liver biopsy | Confirm diagnosis, exclude malignancy, and assess degree of inflammation and necrosis [^114M2jRG] |

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** of inflammatory liver microabscesses in SLE includes:

- **Opportunistic infections**: Candida, Staphylococcus, Gram-negative bacteria [^notfound].

- **Autoimmune hepatitis**: Characterized by interface hepatitis and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate [^112UNAjS].

- **Drug-induced liver injury**: Associated with immunosuppressive medications [^112G9GV6].

- **Malignancy**: Lymphoma or hepatocellular carcinoma [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management of inflammatory liver microabscesses in SLE involves a **multidisciplinary approach**:

- **Antimicrobial therapy**: Empirical antibiotics covering Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, with antifungal therapy if fungal infection is suspected [^notfound].

- **Immunosuppressive therapy**: Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) to control SLE activity [^1111hHzA].

- **Supportive care**: Fluid management, nutritional support, and monitoring for complications such as sepsis or hepatic failure [^notfound].

- **Regular follow-up**: Serial imaging and laboratory tests to monitor treatment response and detect recurrence [^1126Y9A2].

---

## Prognosis and complications

The prognosis of inflammatory liver microabscesses in SLE depends on the **underlying cause**, the **severity of hepatic involvement**, and the **promptness of treatment**. Potential complications include hepatic failure, sepsis, and recurrence of microabscesses [^notfound].

---

Inflammatory liver microabscesses are a rare but serious complication in SLE, typically driven by infection or vasculitis-related ischemia rather than primary lupus hepatitis. A **multimodal diagnostic approach** and coordinated antimicrobial and immunosuppressive therapy are essential for optimal outcomes [^notfound].

### Antimitochondrial antibodies: from bench to bedside [^114gpwuP]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are directed against the E2 subunits of the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes (PDC-E2) and are the typical biomarkers of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), being present in 90–95% of patients, with increasing sensitivity at increasing titers. Albeit being highly specific for PBC diagnosis, AMA can be detected in less than 1% of healthy subjects, and thus the management subjects with no sign or symptom of liver disease is still a challenge and data concerning clinical risk of developing PBC in this subgroup of patients are controversial. Moreover, AMA can also be detected in patients affected by overlap syndrome, as well as hepatic diseases (i.e. NASH and viral hepatitis), while the association with autoimmune diseases, in particular Sjögren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, is well established. Furthermore, new associations are being identified with inflammatory myositis and heart disease. AMA are directed towards the pyruvate dehydrogenase multi enzyme complex (PDC-E2) subunit, which represents an epithelial specific autoantigen for PBC. This review focuses on the main characteristics of AMA, their association with autoimmune diseases and liver diseases.

### Autoimmune hepatitis Associated with kikuchi-fujimoto's disease [^114rMZME]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

We describe a 20-year-old woman with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) with cirrhosis who developed Kikuchi-Fujimoto's disease (KFD) and de novo minor features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This is the first report of a patient with histologically confirmed AIH developing KFD (histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis). One previous case described KFD after AIH (diagnosed clinically but without biopsy). KFD is a rare condition of unknown aetiology, first described in 1972, characterized by fever and cervical adenopathy and has a self-limiting course. KFD is associated with SLE, and SLE in turn can be associated with abnormal liver function tests, which in a minority of cases may be due to AIH. The association of AIH, KFD, and SLE in our patient suggests an autoimmune pathogenesis of KFD.

### Lipomembranous changes associated with systemic lupus erythematosus [^117QDCVs]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Lipomembranous changes are distinctive histopathological findings, which include the presence of cystic cavities lined by crenulated, hyaline membranes in adipose tissue. It is likely that ischaemia is fundamental to the development of these lesions, and that lipomembranes are formed from the products of degenerating fat cell membranes by some unknown mechanism. Such changes may be seen, although rarely, in many types of subcutaneous inflammatory processes. However, an association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is rare. We report a patient with SLE who had the histological features of lipomembranous changes associated with vasculopathy.

### Liver involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus: incidence, clinical course and outcome of lupus hepatitis [^112KK8XA]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to assess the spectrum of liver disease occurring in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), primarily the incidence, clinical course and outcome of lupus hepatitis (LH).

Methods

The records of 283 SLE out-patients referred to our Unit between 1994 and 2008 were reviewed to identify clinical or laboratory evidence of liver involvement. Liver enzyme values were considered abnormal when a sustained increase in serum transaminase levels above the normal value was observed for a period of at least three months or when the increase was confirmed in two consecutive assessments. Study inclusion criteria were a follow-up of at least 12 months and three liver function tests per year over the course of disease.

Results

A total of 242 patients with a mean follow-up of 72.2 ± 59.1 months were identified. Liver enzyme abnormalities were observed in 45 (18.6%) patients. Of these, only 14 cases (5.8%) could be attributed to LH. Clinical course and response to therapy enabled the identification of three different patterns: remitting, unremitting and relapsing forms. Acute hepatitis and liver failure were not observed. Low serum alanine transaminase levels at diagnosis and high doses of prednisone were associated to resolution of LH. Clinical course or response to therapy did not appear to be affected by liver histology or serological findings.

Conclusions

LH is generally sub-clinical with a fluctuating course and responds well to moderate to high doses of prednisone without progression to end-stage liver disease.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus combined with Wilson's disease: a case report and literature review [^112YszsD]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

SLE is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that primarily affects young women. SLE is characterized by a complex and heterogeneous clinical presentation, with the potential to involve multiple organs and tissues throughout the body. The liver is an important target organ in SLE. Reports indicate that 25–50% of SLE patients may experience liver abnormalities during the course of the disease. Although the role of SLE in the development of asymptomatic liver disease is still debated, many experts recognize that SLE often leads to subclinical liver dysfunction, known as lupus hepatitis. Lupus hepatitis is a nonspecific reactive liver disease primarily caused by complement deposition and vasculitis-induced organic damage in the liver. Lupus hepatitis is frequently associated with SLE flares or clinical activity, and it can be diagnosed only by ruling out secondary causes of liver involvement. In the reported case, the patient was diagnosed with SLE and presented with asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes. We ruled out drug-induced liver injury, fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver disease, and viral hepatitis, suggesting that the asymptomatic increase in liver enzymes was likely due to SLE itself. However, despite active treatment for SLE and improvements in other symptoms, the asymptomatic increase in liver enzymes persisted for more than 2 years, which prompted us to actively search for the underlying cause.

Previous studies have indicated that drug-induced liver injury is a major cause of abnormal liver function in SLE patients, with an occurrence rate of approximately 31% in SLE patients with liver dysfunction. SLE patients are prone to drug-induced liver injury due to their high levels of oxidative stress. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), azathioprine, and methotrexate are the most common drugs associated with liver injury, followed by cyclophosphamide and leflunomide. HCQ, MMF, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and corticosteroids rarely cause liver injury. In most cases, drug-induced liver dysfunction is mild and transient, and liver function can usually recover with a dose reduction or discontinuation of the medication. Although HCQ and MMF rarely cause liver damage, we recommended discontinuing these medications to prevent drug-induced liver injury. However, after the discontinuation of these medications, the patient's liver function did not improve. Instead, the SLE itself became active.

### Outcome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and concurrent chronic hepatitis B infection [^111hrnvr]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 35-year-old Caucasian woman with proven systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had been effectively managed with hydroxychloroquine and methylprednisolone for many years. In 2005 she was admitted to the rheumatology clinic with a flare up of the disease and with proteinuria of 3.2 g/24 h. Renal biopsy was performed and revealed diffuse proliferative nephritis. Before the renal biopsy a positive HB(s)Ag was found with high virus replication (hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA-4 170 000 copies/ml). Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with minimal activity (TAIS = 1). Lamivudine was administered with concomitant maintenance corticosteroid treatment, but without antimalarials. Pulsed methylprednisolone treatment for diffuse lupus nephritis was begun on the background of lamivudine therapy. The liver enzymes returned to normal values, HBV replication was suppressed, and the proteinuria disappeared. At present the patient is not being treated with lamivudine and there are no objective signs of nephritis and hepatitis, or HBV activation.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus complicated by Crohn's disease: a case report and literature review [^111wg2A9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may experience various gastrointestinal disorders, SLE and Crohn's disease (CD) rarely coexist. The diseases may have gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations, laboratory results, and radiographic findings that appear similar and consequently differentiating between GI involvement in CD and in SLE may be difficult. We present the case of a patient with SLE and CD who developed continuous GI bleeding and diarrhea that was initially treated as SLE-related colitis to little effect.

Case presentation

A 55-year-old Japanese woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) developed continuous gastrointestinal bleeding and diarrhea since the patient was aged 30 years that was initially treated as SLE-related colitis. Although a longitudinal ulcer and aphthous ulcers in the colon were observed every examination, biopsy showed only mild inflammation and revealed neither granuloma nor crypt abscess. The patient underwent surgery for anal fistulas twice at 50 and 54 years of age and her symptoms were atypical of lupus enteritis. Colonoscopy was performed again when the patient was 55 years of age because we suspected she had some type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Cobblestone-like inflammatory polyps and many longitudinal ulcers were detected between the descending colon and the cecum. Macroscopic examination strongly suggested CD. Histopathological examination revealed non-caseating granuloma and no evidence of vasculitis, consistent with CD. Introduction of infliximab dramatically relieved the patient's melena and abdominal symptoms.

Conclusion

Diagnostic criteria for CD and SLE overlap, making them difficult to diagnose correctly. It is important to consider CD for patients who have SLE with gastrointestinal manifestations. The pathology of lupus enteritis should be clarified through the accumulation of cases of SLE combined with CD.

### An erythema gyratum repens variant of bullous lupus erythematosus [^11169qdA]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Bullous lupus erythematosus is an SLE variant characterized by rapid onset of tense vesiculobullous lesions typically in a photodistributed pattern on the face, trunk, and upper extremities. Less commonly, lesions can appear on mucous membranes and non–photo-exposed skin. Affected patients usually experience constitutional symptoms of SLE including fever, fatigue, weight loss, and arthralgia. Histopathology findings show subepidermal vesiculation, neutrophilic microabscesses in the papillary dermis, mucin deposition in the dermis, dermal edema, and absence of eosinophils. Direct immunofluorescence shows IgG, IgA, IgM, and complement components at the dermal-epidermal junction in a granular or linear pattern. Depositions can be focal or continuous and may extend into the dermis and perivascular region. Most patients with bullous lupus erythematosus have a positive antinuclear antibody and frequently will have positive anti–double-stranded DNA antibody and anti–collagen type VII antibody. First-line treatment of bullous lupus erythematosus is with dapsone, although it is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Dapsone results in cessation of new blister formation within days for most patients. Prednisone is used as an alternative or adjunct, especially for patients that require treatment for concomitant systemic manifestations of SLE. Other treatment options include rituximab, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil, although data on their use are limited. Lesions heal without scarring but often with evident postinflammatory hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation.

The presented patient met 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics criteria for diagnosis of SLE and had immunohistopathologic and clinical evidence of bullous lupus, with blisters developing in a wood grain, concentric morphology reminiscent of EGR. EGR is a clinical entity with nonspecific histopathologic findings. Most patients are found to have an associated malignancy; therefore, affected patients must undergo malignancy workup. Other diseases including lepromatous leprosy, limited systemic sclerosis, and psoriasis are reported to present in an EGR pattern. Finally, there is an entity known as lupus erythematosus gyratus repens, a rare variant of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, which was a diagnostic consideration in this case. In this entity, lesions typically present as widespread, concentric, erythematous plaques, often with double-contoured edges. The plaques are often moderately to deeply infiltrated with overlying crusted erosions and scaling. Histopathologic characteristics include hydropic degeneration of the basal layer, keratinocyte necrosis, and atrophy of the epidermis.

### Clinical and biological aspects of anti-P-ribosomal protein autoantibodies [^115uvCdu]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Among the many clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), central nervous system (CNS) involvement is of a prognostic importance. In this respect, anti-ribosomal P protein antibodies were shown by many to occur in association with SLE neuropsychiatric manifestations, mainly psychosis. The prevalence of anti-P antibodies was strongly related to disease activity wherein disease remission was associated with the disappearance of these antibodies. In addition to its association with CNS involvement, the occurrence of liver and kidney disease in SLE patients with anti-P antibodies was widely reported. Anti-P antibodies are able to bind T cells, monocytes, neurons and hepatocytes thereby enhancing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and both CNS and liver damage. Similar to the ability of anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-P antibodies were shown to penetrate into living cells, leading to cell dysfunctions such as cell apoptosis. These biological aspects may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SLE.

### Co-occurrence of Wilson's disease and systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report and literature review [^1177Xahc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease associated with defective biliary excretion of copper. The simultaneous occurrence of WD and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has seldom been reported. Therefore, this study aimed to report the co-occurrence of SLE and WD with hepatic involvement in a patient so as to improve the understanding of the coexistence of these two conditions.

Case Presentation

A 35-year-old woman with SLE was found to have liver fibrosis during a routinely abdominal ultrasound examination. Her laboratory evaluation showed low serum ceruloplasmin and high 24 h urine copper levels. The slit-lamp examination revealed the presence of Kayseri-Fleischer ring in her cornea. Liver biopsy demonstrated the enlargement of the portal area with hyperplasia of the fibrous tissue, infiltration of lymphoid plasma cells, swelling of hepatocytes, and steatosis, demonstrating liver fibrosis. Ensuing genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of WD.

Conclusions

Clinicians should bear in mind that unexplained liver fibrosis in patients with SLE may be related to WD, so as to avoid a missed or delayed diagnosis.

### Presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus in emergency department [^115gD3cb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem inflammatory disease that is often difficult to diagnose in the emergency department. It is an autoimmune disease with great variability in presentation and course. Moreover, the atypical or incomplete presentation is common in children and can result in delay in diagnosis. Consideration of the possibility of SLE is important when evaluating a patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting multisystem disease. The emergency physician must maintain a high degree of suspicion for the early diagnosis and management of this important condition. We present 3 children who presented to emergency department with different initial manifestations of SLE.

### Hellenic Association for the Study of the Liver (HASL): revised clinical practice guidelines for autoimmune hepatitis [^117L77CX]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

In the appropriate clinical and laboratory background, the possibility of AIH should be seriously taken into consideration under any circumstances. Male patients with AIH seem to be younger, more likely to present advanced disease at first evaluation, and may experience worse outcomes compared to females. Sex-related comorbidities, sex hormones that may influence the activity of AIH and its progression, sex-associated dissimilarities in immunogenetics, and differences in medical adherence could explain these disparities, at least in part.

AIH is commonly associated with several extrahepatic autoimmune diseases, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis (the strongest association), Grave's disease, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, vitiligo, alopecia, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), diabetes mellitus type 1, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and Sjögren's syndrome. A large study in 2479 AIH patients showed that the presence of other autoimmune diseases negatively affects not only the quality of life, but also mortality, which was higher in those with multiple extrahepatic autoimmune diseases (Table 2). As in most chronic diseases, AIH is also characterized by high rates of anxiety and depression.

### Concurrence of sarcoidosis and systemic lupus erythematosus in three patients [^111Vdp2Q]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

We present three cases of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and sarcoidosis. Although both of these conditions are thought to involve autoimmune mechanisms they occur together only rarely. Our cases suggest that their concurrence may be more common than previously thought, and raise issues regarding the management of patients with SLE. We discuss the possibility that these two diseases are either causally or mechanistically related.

### A highlight from the LUPUS 2014 meeting: eight great ideas [^113WYJ1T]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Identification and treatment of asymptomatic autoimmunity: prevention of SLE

JJ pointed out that by the time patients with SLE meet lupus classification criteria, they often have irreversible organ inflammation and associated damage. Over time, end-organ damage accumulates, leading to extensive morbidity and early mortality. In an effort to suppress inflammation and minimise organ damage, patients are oftentimes treated with significant immunosuppressive drugs, such as mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine and corticosteroids, which present additional risks of infection, liver damage, osteonecrosis, osteoporosis, cataracts and accelerated atherosclerosis. Moreover, these therapies fail to selectively address the underlying cause of chronic inflammation in SLE: pervasive, directed immune dysregulation.

Recent and ongoing studies suggest that immune dysregulation begins well before SLE is clinically apparent. In one model of SLE pathogenesis, in genetically predisposed individuals, select environmental triggers stimulate autoantibody production, initiating a period of benign autoimmunity (figure 3). Some individuals remain in this period of benign autoimmunity indefinitely, while others transition to pathogenic autoimmunity. This suggests that after the appearance of autoantibodies, a secondary insult such as inappropriate inflammatory cytokine production leads to increased autoantibody formation and further activation of T and B lymphocytes. With these developments, the patient enters a period of preclinical pathogenic immunity. As antibody targets diversify, cytokine production increases and tissue damage accumulates, the early signs of SLE become clinically apparent. The patient finally meets the criteria for SLE classification, after irreversible damage has occurred and well after the onset of pathogenic autoimmunity.

### Validation of the 2019 EULAR / ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus in an academic tertiary care centre [^117FEDUY]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

As already pointed out, classification criteria are not intended to be used to make a diagnosis. Notwithstanding, if the 2019 criteria were indeed used to diagnose patients with SLE at our centre, 13% of patients would not be diagnosed. With the 1997 ACR criteria, the sensitivity of 81.4% means that almost one in five patients who were already diagnosed and treated for SLE would not be considered to have SLE, had the classification criteria been applied as diagnostic criteria. This highlights the importance of clinical judgement in the management of SLE.

Still, clinical judgement may not always be accurate, especially in cases of early SLE that may be mistaken for other conditions, including 'undifferentiated' connective tissue disease. This may result in specificities that are lower than expected, especially against the background of the published literature.

The 2019 classification introduced a history of ANA detection as an entry criterion for the classification as SLE. This increases specificity from 97.2% to 98.1%, although at the cost of a loss of sensitivity, which decreases from 92.4% to 87% when the entry criterion is applied. As remarked on by the authors of the original publication, maximum specificity is desired in order for the criteria to serve their purpose, which is to identify a homogeneous patient population for the inclusion in clinical trials. The decreased sensitivity must be kept in mind when using the criteria as a support tool for clinical decision-making. The classification criteria are not diagnostic criteria, and to rely solely on these criteria will leave some patients with SLE undiagnosed and, consequentially, untreated.

To our knowledge, this is the largest study of the performance of the 2019 classification in an unselected cohort of patients from an academic tertiary care centre, which regularly participates in clinical trials of patients with lupus. As such, it provides important information about the actual implementation of this new classification system, which is highly relevant for the selection of a homogeneous group of patients for these trials. We deliberately chose to also include patients from the hepatology clinic at our centre in order to better understand the performance of the classification. Autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis are two autoinflammatory diseases whose signs and systems might also be mistaken for lupus if these patients are referred to a rheumatologist by a primary care provider. The subjects with hepatocellular cancer are included in our continuous scientific data collection, and we did not exclude them from the data set for the current study in order to be able to better judge how the lupus classification discriminates against clearly non-inflammatory disease.

### Autoimmune hepatitis As a presenting manifestation of mixed connective tissue disease in a child. case report and review of the literature [^115UcMig]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a systemic rheumatic disease with overlapping selected clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SS), polymiositis/dermatomyositis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). High titers of distinct autoantibodies called anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein antibodies (anti-U1 RNP) are characteristic for MCTD. The most common presenting manifestations are polyarthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, swollen fingers or hands, myositis, esophageal dysfunction and nonspecific symptoms such as fever, fatigue, arthralgia or myalgia. During the course of the disease pulmonary, renal, cardiac, gastrointestinal and central nervous system manifestations can evolve. Pulmonary involvement is a common complication but is not usually clinically evident early in the course of the disease. In recent years, a growing interest has been focused on severe organ involvement such as interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) which can evolve during the long-term follow-up and can significantly influence disease prognosis.

MCTD is a rare disease in children. Only about 23% of all MCTD cases appear in childhood. Four different sets of classification criteria for MCTD were developed and none have been evaluated for children. Kasukawa criteria are widely used in pediatric population and require a positive Raynaud's phenomenon or swollen hands or fingers, a positive test for anti-U1 RNP and at least one sign from two out of three disease categories including SLE, SS or polymyositis. Median age of onset is 11 years. It is more prevalent in female patients with female versus male ratio 6:1.

Autoimmune hepatitis is an immune mediated inflammation of the liver of unknown cause. The disease leads to progressive inflammatory and fibrotic process in the liver. The condition is chronic and characterized by interface hepatitis, hypergammaglobulinaemia and liver-specific serum autoantibodies. The usual age of presentation for type 1 autoimmune hepatitis is from 10 to 20 years or from 45 to 70 years. It is more common in women. Approximately 40% of patients have concurrent extrahepatic immunological disease.

### Co-occurrence of Wilson's disease and systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report and literature review [^115iafTU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

SLE has the potential to affect all organ systems. Hepatic damage is common in SLE; It is usually attributed to non-immune-related diseases (such as viral hepatitis) and adverse effects of drugs (drug-induced damage). In addition, previous studies reported a correlation between SLE-related hepatitis and ribosomal P proteins (anti-ribosomal P). Previously, the existence of this antibody was thought to be associated with lupus activity and lupus-related psychosis. In addition, studies suggested that lupus hepatitis could occur because of steatosis secondary to corticosteroid treatment. In the current study, the patients medical history and results of tumor marker screening, toxicology screening, and hepatitis virus examination, which were found to be negative, did not support the diagnosis of lupus hepatitis, drug-induced liver damage, and liver fibrosis caused by viral hepatitis.

With regard to the underlying etiology, it was speculated that liver fibrosis in this patient was attributable to an overlapping immune-related syndrome (such as autoimmune hepatitis, AIH). AIH, which is a chronic inflammatory liver disease, is often associated with the presence of an extra-hepatic immune disease and is prevalent in women. It is usually associated with elevated aminotransferase and -globulin or IgG levels and auto-antibody positivity. Clinically, its manifestations vary significantly from asymptomaticity to acute liver failure. After the exclusion of other chronic liver diseases, the diagnosis of AIH is usually made considering the characteristic serological and histological findings. In this case, although liver biopsy revealed pathological features that are similar to those of AIH, they were nonspecific. Furthermore, AIH-related antibodies have not been detected, was inconsistent with the diagnostic criteria of AIH. Moreover, the etiology of liver fibrosis in the current patient is monistic rather than dualistic as shown by the improvement of liver ultrasound findings after treatment with a zinc-containing drug.

### Autoantibodies associated with primary biliary cholangitis are common among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus even in the absence of elevated liver enzymes [^115T4mQ7]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Lupus hepatitis is a liver dysfunction with a reported frequency of 3–6% in SLE patients [7, 16, 17, 18]. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, distinct from AIH, and is characterized by fluctuations in alanine transaminase (ALT) [19]. It has a subclinical course with a low rate of progression to cirrhosis [20]. Histologically, lupus hepatitis has a variable presentation, but usually inflammation of the lobules is seen with a paucity of lymphocytes [7]. Fatty infiltration and mild portal infiltration may also be found [16].

AIH is a chronic progressive hepatitis with a female preponderance [21]. AIH can be classified into two subtypes; type 1 and type 2 [22, 23, 24]. These subtypes differ in their autoantibody profiles and age of onset. Type 1 patients are typically middle‐aged or older with presence of ANA, smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) and/or anti‐soluble liver antigen/liver pancreas antigen antibodies (anti‐SLA/LP) [25]. Type 2 patients are younger, usually children and teenagers, and characterized by the presence of anti‐liver kidney microsome‐1 antibodies (anti‐LKM‐1) and/or anti‐liver cytosol‐1 antibodies (anti‐LC‐1) [22]. AIH can present acutely with jaundice and rapid progression to cirrhosis. However, more frequently it presents as an indolent disease with slightly elevated liver enzymes [22]. The histological picture ranges from normal to patchy or diffuse necrosis [26, 27, 28].

On the basis of the above findings, the patient was definitively diagnosed with WD and SLE. The WD diagnosis was based on the Leipzig scoring system proposed by an international group for the study of WD. The scoring system assessed the patient for hepatic copper content, urinary excretion of copper, serum levels of ceruloplasmin, and neurological symptoms; the presence/absence of KF rings, as well as ATP7B mutations gene that causes copper toxicosis. The score4 points established the diagnosis of WD. The patients Leipzig score was 9 points(KF rings present, score 2; serum ceruloplasmin level < 0.1g/L, score 2; urinary copper content 12ULN, score 1; and both chromosomes detected, score 4). Therefore, the patient was prescribed the complete dosage of zinc sulfate (60mg/time, tid, p.o. 1h before meals) for WD and methylprednisolone and HCQ for SLE. After an 11-month follow-up, abdominal ultrasound examination indicated notable signs of recovery, and the serum ceruloplasmin concentration fluctuated from 0.15g/L to 0.20g/L, which was close to the normal level. Laboratory tests after treatment showed TB of 8.9mol/L, AST of 10.6 U/L, ALT of 12.6 U/L, globulin of 33.2g/L and albumin of 37.9g/L (Table 1).

### Systemic lupus erythematosus complicated by Crohn's disease: a case report and literature review [^112ugWzN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may experience various gastrointestinal disorders, SLE and Crohn's disease (CD) rarely coexist. The diseases may have gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations, laboratory results, and radiographic findings that appear similar and consequently differentiating between GI involvement in CD and in SLE may be difficult. We present the case of a patient with SLE and CD who developed continuous GI bleeding and diarrhea that was initially treated as SLE-related colitis to little effect.

Case Presentation

A 55-year-old Japanese woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) developed continuous gastrointestinal bleeding and diarrhea since the patient was aged 30 years that was initially treated as SLE-related colitis. Although a longitudinal ulcer and aphthous ulcers in the colon were observed every examination, biopsy showed only mild inflammation and revealed neither granuloma nor crypt abscess. The patient underwent surgery for anal fistulas twice at 50 and 54 years of age and her symptoms were atypical of lupus enteritis. Colonoscopy was performed again when the patient was 55 years of age because we suspected she had some type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Cobblestone-like inflammatory polyps and many longitudinal ulcers were detected between the descending colon and the cecum. Macroscopic examination strongly suggested CD. Histopathological examination revealed non-caseating granuloma and no evidence of vasculitis, consistent with CD. Introduction of infliximab dramatically relieved the patient's melena and abdominal symptoms.

Conclusion

Diagnostic criteria for CD and SLE overlap, making them difficult to diagnose correctly. It is important to consider CD for patients who have SLE with gastrointestinal manifestations. The pathology of lupus enteritis should be clarified through the accumulation of cases of SLE combined with CD.

### Diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus: has the time come? [^116Ye2XF]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multiorgan disease with protean manifestations. Because SLE is uncommon and heterogeneous, its diagnosis can pose a considerable challenge, especially for clinicians with limited expertise of the disease. This is particularly true at the early stages of SLE, when an inadequate number of features to secure the diagnosis might be present, and for patients presenting with uncommon features, which can nonetheless be severe and require prompt treatment. Furthermore, the suboptimal performance of immunological testing in patients referred for possible SLE has been highlighted. As a result, SLE remains largely a clinical diagnosis that is made after excluding alternative diagnoses. Diagnostic criteria can expedite diagnosis and treatment, but are not available for SLE. Thus, SLE classification criteria are often used, but strict adherence to these criteria could delay diagnosis. Therefore, while eagerly awaiting diagnostic criteria for this disease, we propose interim potential solutions to facilitate its diagnosis.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus with histopathologic changes restricted to the acrosyringia [^116G8Efr]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2014). Low credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus may present as an isolated condition or as part of a systemic disease, being acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, the skin manifestation, more closely related to systemic involvement. The histopathologic findings may show a wide variety of features, which show overlap among different clinical presentations. The exclusive involvement of the eccrine units, including eccrine coils, dermal ducts, and acrosyringia is extremely uncommon. We present the second case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with histopathologic involvement mostly located in the acrosyringia. The patient was a 37-year-old male with multiorgan failure who, in the context of flare-up of SLE, presented cutaneous lesions consisting of erythematous and edematous macules and plaques on the face, arms, and anterior chest. Histopathologic examination demonstrated necrotic keratinocytes confined to the acrosyringia as the main finding. It was associated with sparse inflammatory infiltrate in the superficial dermis, mostly composed of lymphocytes. The epidermis between the acrosyringia was spared. Our case was clinically almost identical to the one previously described, being a patient with a severe SLE and widespread cutaneous involvement and receiving treatment in the intensive care unit. The main differential diagnosis, both clinically and histopathologically was drug-related erythema multiforme. Clinicopathologic correlation is necessary to establish a correct diagnosis. SLE with histopathologic involvement mostly of the acrosyringia is a rare histopathologic variant of the disorder.

### Autoimmune liver disease: evaluating overlapping and cross-over presentations-a case-based discussion [^1115XaJP]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The three classic autoimmune liver diseases are recognised based on identifying varying clinical, laboratory, histological and radiological features that collectively classify patients. In the absence of defined aetiological factors, it is recognised that disease spectrum is broad, and, in this context, it is not infrequent for disease boundaries to be blurred, leading to overlapping features that may be present at the time of diagnosis or may appear later in the course of disease. Given the absence of accepted diagnostic criteria for overlap/cross-over syndromes, alongside weak data for intervention, it is recommended that a multidisciplinary, patient-specific approach be used to establish individual treatment pathways.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus combined with Wilson's disease: a case report and literature review [^112UNAjS]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology characterized by a T-cell-mediated immune response against liver self-antigens, leading to hepatocyte necrosis and inflammation. Diagnosis is based on elevated serum transaminases, increased levels of IgG, the presence of autoantibodies (ANA, anti-smooth muscle antibodies, and anti-liver-kidney microsome type 1 antibodies), and histological findings in liver biopsy samples, such as interface hepatitis and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. The occurrence rate of AIH in SLE patients with liver dysfunction is approximately 5–10%. In the patient whose case is reported here, AIH-related antibodies were negative, but the liver biopsy sample showed pathological features similar to those of AIH, although they were nonspecific.

SLE patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy are more susceptible to viral infections, which can result in liver dysfunction. The patient was screened for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, Epstein‒Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, and the results of all these tests were negative.

WD is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper metabolism dysfunction due to mutations in the ATP7B gene. The resulting copper toxicity primarily affects the liver and brain. WD is classified into different types based on symptoms, including hepatic, neurological, mixed, and other types. In adolescents, the hepatic type has a greater occurrence rate than the other types. The liver manifestations in WD patients can vary, ranging from asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes to significant liver cirrhosis (compensated or decompensated) or acute liver failure. Reports indicate that 18–23% of WD patients experience asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes. Similarly, the most common liver manifestation in SLE patients is asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes, which was the main reason for the delayed diagnosis of our patient. However, in SLE patients who respond well to effective treatment, liver function abnormalities typically improve. Therefore, in SLE patients with well-controlled disease who present with unexplained elevation of liver enzymes, the possibility of WD should be considered.

### Prevalence and risk factors for liver biochemical abnormalities in Canadian patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^112G9GV6]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of abnormal liver enzymes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and whether further investigations were done, and the differences in SLE-related and/or metabolic factors in patients with and without liver biochemical abnormalities.

Method

Patients from the University of Toronto Lupus Clinic who met at least 4 of the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE and had 1.5 times the upper limit for aspartate transaminase or alanine transaminase on 2 consecutive visits within a 2-year period were matched with controls for age, sex, and SLE duration. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted at the time of the first appearance of liver enzyme abnormality for the cases and at the reference point for the controls.

Results

From the 1533 patients reviewed, 134 (8.7%) met the inclusion criteria. Thirty of these patients were evaluated by a hepatologist, 75 had imaging studies (41 were done specifically for liver investigation), and 13 had liver biopsies. Results based on these investigations showed 31 fatty livers, 35 cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity, 10 autoimmune etiologies, and 3 cases of viral hepatitis. Compared to controls, cases were higher in body mass index, anti-dsDNA antibody, prevalence of hypertension, antiphospholipid syndrome, and use of immunosuppressive medication, especially azathioprine and methotrexate; they were lower in IgM.

Conclusion

Metabolic abnormalities such as obesity and hypertension and hepatotoxic effects of medication used to treat SLE may contribute more than SLE-related factors to liver biochemical abnormalities in patients with SLE.

They further note that organ- or life-threatening SLE should be treated urgently/emergently with aggressive therapy (e.g., pulse/high-dose glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive therapy), including consideration of combination therapies, as time may not permit sequential therapy; the clinical situation and patient's preference should guide the specific combination therapy, that when interventions, procedures, and surgeries beyond the scope of rheumatology practice are considered, the decision to proceed requires multidisciplinary discussion between the rheumatologist and the relevant specialists/proceduralists/surgeons, and that when clinical or serologic findings suggest an additional diagnosis or overlap with SLE, therapy should be adjusted if necessary in consultation with the relevant specialist(s).

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory condition with a varied clinical presentation. It can involve multiple organ systems and has the potential to impact any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal pseudo-obstruction (IPO) is a rare yet severe gastrointestinal manifestation of SLE. Two-thirds of SLE patients with IPO present with concomitant hydroureteronephrosis. This report details the case of a young woman who presented with IPO as the initial manifestation of SLE. The presence of proteinuria with bilateral hydroureteronephrosis in this patient with IPO prompted a trail of investigations that led to the diagnosis of SLE.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus combined with Wilson's disease: a case report and literature review [^1171Pz5q]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Wilson's disease (WD) are both systemic diseases that can affect multiple organs in the body. The coexistence of SLE and WD is rarely encountered in clinical practice, making it challenging to diagnose.

Case report

We present the case of a 9-year-old girl who initially presented with proteinuria, haematuria, pancytopenia, hypocomplementemia, and positivity for multiple autoantibodies. She was diagnosed with SLE, and her blood biochemistry showed elevated liver enzymes at the time of diagnosis. Despite effective control of her symptoms, her liver enzymes remained elevated during regular follow-up. Laboratory tests revealed decreased serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, along with elevated urinary copper. Liver biopsy revealed chronic active hepatitis, moderate inflammation, moderate-severe fibrosis, and a trend towards local cirrhosis. Genetic sequencing revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the ATP7B gene, confirming the diagnosis of SLE with WD. The girl received treatment with a high-zinc/low-copper diet, but her liver function did not improve. Upon recommendation following multidisciplinary consultation, she underwent liver transplantation. Unfortunately, she passed away on the fourth day after the surgery.

Conclusions

SLE and WD are diseases that involve multiple systems and organs in the body, and SLE complicated with WD is rarely encountered in the clinic; therefore, it is easy to misdiagnose. Because penicillamine can induce lupus, it is not recommended. Liver transplantation is indicated for patients with liver disease who do not respond to medical treatment with WD. However, further research is needed to determine the optimal timing of liver transplantation for patients with SLE complicated with WD.

### Autoimmune intrahepatic cholangiopathy associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [^115p4gUd]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 26-year-old woman who developed thrombophlebitis in her left leg in 2002, followed by fever, asthenia and headache in 2004. Antinuclear antibodies, antimitochondrial antibodies, anti-liver kidney microsome, anti-Smith, antiphospholipid (aPL) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, as well as lupus- anticoagulant activity were positive. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with aPL syndrome was diagnosed and the patient was treated with azathioprine and heparin. Symptoms persisted and itching arose in the following months. The patient was admitted to our department in January 2005 for jaundice and skin rash. Elevated levels of acute phase proteins and cholestasis and liver necrosis indexes were present. Antinuclear antibodies, aPL and antimitochondrial antibodies (M5) antibodies were positive. Liver histology showed minimal focal hepatocyte necrosis, intrahepatic biliary stasis and intralobular inflammatory cell infiltrate. The absence of clinical signs that are characteristic of SLE as well as the failure to confirm antiSmith antibody positivity led us to rule out a diagnosis of SLE. On the basis of clinical, immunological and histological data, autoimmune intrahepatic cholangiopathy associated with primary aPL syndrome was diagnosed. The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone, warfarin and ursodeoxycholic acid. Liver necrosis and cholestasis indexes rapidly improved within 1 month and progressively reached the normal range. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a patient with an association of intrahepatic cholangiopathy and aPL, thus suggesting that autoimmune liver disease might associate with aPL syndrome.

### Idiopathic lobular panniculitis of pregnancy with resolution following delivery [^115ZFmfL]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Panniculitides are categorized as predominantly septal or lobular as indicated by histopathologic studies. The classification of the panniculitides also depends on the location of the inflammatory cell infiltrate, the type of the inflammatory cell infiltrate, the presence or absence of vasculitis, and the presence or absence of necrosis. Patients typically develop indurated, edematous, tender plaques, or nodules in areas of adiposity. Anatomic location is generally on the lower extremities although this may vary, depending on the specific type of panniculitis. The presence of panniculitides is often an indication that a patient has an underlying condition.

Pregnancy is 1 of the common causes of erythema nodosum, the most common panniculitis, which is predominantly a septal panniculitis. Lobular panniculitis development in pregnancy, however, is rare and extensive evaluation should be taken to rule out lupus panniculitis, subcutaneous panniculitis-like-T-cell lymphoma, and erythema induratum (EI). EI can be due to infections, autoimmune disorders, hypothyroidism, and inflammatory bowel disease. On histopathology, EI presents as a lobular panniculitis with neutrophilic-predominant vasculitis, which was absent in our patient. Our case is distinct because histopathology demonstrated a lobular lymphocytic panniculitis with fat necrosis and fibrin thrombi, without vasculitis or rimming of adipocytes. Immunohistochemistry, tissue cultures, and autoimmune serologies were normal, making infectious panniculitis, lupus panniculitis, subcutaneous panniculitis-like-T-cell lymphoma, and EI unlikely, leading to ILP as the most likely diagnosis.

ILP typically presents on the lower extremities with ill-defined tender subcutaneous nodules and swelling. Patients with ILP may have systemic involvement, which is characterized by relapsing fevers and may have systemic organ involvement. The liver is frequently involved and may lead to cirrhosis with hepatomegaly, jaundice, increase in transaminases, and lactate dehydrogenase. Hematologic manifestations are also seen in which a hypochromic, microcytic anemia is seen, as well as thrombocytopenia. Coagulopathies, which may lead to hemorrhagic complications with internal organ bleeding and disseminated intravascular coagulation, are an important cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Renal manifestations, with proteinuria and either membranous or proliferative glomerulonephritis have been described. Perivisceral fat involvement (in the pericardium, pleura, omentum, and mesentery) may also occur.

### Towards a practical management of fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus [^1178Bv9W]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Step 3: identifying a lupus-related cause of fatigue

Fatigue can be a manifestation of active SLE but can also be related to organ damage (figure 2). The relationship between disease activity and fatigue remains controversial in SLE and has been shown to be less strong than with other factors such as anxiety or depression. Its association with serological markers (C3, anti-dsDNA antibodies) is also controversial.

Figure 2
Main determinants of fatigue in patients with SLE.

Fatigue has been associated with several SLE-specific organ manifestations:

Several studies found an association between neurological involvement, including white matter hyperintensities, and fatigue.
Renal failure can be an important cause of fatigue. It is crucial to assess whether it is related to active kidney disease or to chronic lesions (damage).
Cardiac failure is an obvious cause of fatigue.
Hepatic failure and cirrhosis can (rarely) be due to lupus hepatitis, and overlap with autoimmune hepatitis or less frequently sclerosing cholangitis.

Other clinical manifestations of SLE have been associated with fatigue: in the FATILUP study, we found arthritis and oral ulcers to be individual SLE Disease Activity Index score components associated with severe fatigue. This may underline a more specific role for painful disease manifestations in SLE.

Finally, the prevalence of fibromyalgia is estimated to range between 6.2% and 22% of patients with SLEand has been strongly associated with fatigue. Sjögren's syndrome should also be thought of in patients with sicca syndrome and has been associated with significant fatigue across several studies.

### Case of autoimmune hepatitis with overlap systemic lupus erythematosus [^114Nbicz]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an autoimmune liver disease characterised by the presence of autoantibodies including antinuclear antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibody and hypergammaglobulinaemia. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic disease that can affect multiple organs. Coexistence of AIH and SLE as an overlap syndrome occurs in about 1%-2.6% of the AIH cases. Since both conditions share common autoimmune features, their coexistence can pose a diagnostic dilemma which can result in a delay in treatment. We present here a challenging case of a middle-aged woman with AIH in remission who later developed new-onset fatigue, pleural effusion and splenomegaly.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with a relapsing-remitting course that can affect various organs or systems, leading to a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. In the past year, many studies have been published on SLE, providing a significant advancement in disease knowledge and patient management. The aim of this review is to summarise the most relevant scientific contributions on SLE pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and comorbidities, biomarkers and treatment strategies published in 2019.

### Connective tissue diseases and the liver [^111RDSt7]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma are systemic disorders that may have an autoimmune basis. The system manifestations vary, and there is frequent overlap among the syndromes. Liver involvement in patients with connective tissue diseases has been well documented but is generally considered rare. Although advanced liver disease with cirrhosis and liver failure is rare in patients with connective tissue diseases, clinical and biochemical evidence of associated liver abnormalities is common. Previous treatment with potentially hepatotoxic drugs or coincident viral hepatitis has usually been implicated as the main causes of liver disease in patients with connective tissue diseases. However, even after careful exclusion of these etiologies, the question remains whether to classify the patient as having a primary liver disease with associated autoimmune, clinical, and laboratory features or as having liver disease as a manifestation of generalized connective tissue disease. The main example of this pathogenetic dilemma is autoimmune hepatitis and SLE-associated hepatitis, which have been regarded as two different entities, although they have features in common of autoimmune syndromes. Several clinical and histopathologic features have been used to discriminate autoimmune hepatitis from SLE, a relevant diagnostic exercise because complications and therapy are quite different. Although hepatic steatosis and abnormal results on biochemical liver function tests are the most common hepatic abnormalities associated with connective tissue diseases, other less frequent abnormalities have been noted, such as nodular regenerative hyperplasia, portal vein obliteration and portal hypertension, features of primary biliary cirrhosis, and rarely portal fibrosis with abnormal lobular architecture. Vascular disorders of the liver also have been described, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome. Histologic assessment may reveal a variety of subclinical liver diseases. The aim of this contribution is to review the current published data regarding liver involvement in connective tissue diseases.

### Rheumatologic manifestations of hepatic diseases [^1169CZtS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)

Rheumatologic manifestations are common in AIH. In fact, hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibodies are common, and the most common extrahepatic manifestations are arthralgia and skin rash. AIH is separate from rheumatologic disorders, but the boundaries between them can be indistinct. In fact, over 30% of patients with AIH have concurrent immune-mediated manifestations, and the rheumatologic features in these patients may mask the underlying liver disease. In contrast, 25% of patients with primary rheumatologic diseases have coincidental liver dysfunction, and they may be misclassified and treated as primary liver disease.

Certain clinical features may be useful to establish a distinction between coexisting distinct autoimmune diseases and AIH-related rheumatologic manifestations. Elevation of liver enzymes is more common in AIH and the presence of certain autoantibodies is more specific to AIH (for example, anti-smooth muscle in type 1 AIH or anti-LKM1 and anti-LC1 in type 2 AIH). On the other hand, some clinical manifestations, like Sicca symptoms in SS or Raynaud or inflammatory arthralgia in RA, may help in the differential diagnosis.

Elderly patients with AIH have a higher frequency of rheumatologic conditions than young adults, including RA, SS, and SLE, underscoring the importance of pursuing the diagnosis of AIH in the elderly with liver dysfunction and searching beyond the rheumatologic manifestations. The importance of excluding AIH in patients with rheumatologic features is further reinforced by studies in primary SS that demonstrated the presence of background autoimmune liver disease in 47% of patients and the association between systemic sclerosis and polymyositis and AIH.

Anti-CCP are found in 9% of patients with AIH, demonstrating a tight association with erosive arthritis, thereby identifying patients with liver disease, more prone to develop inflammatory joint disease. Patients with AIH and anti-CCP also have a greater occurrence of histological cirrhosis and hepatic failure, making these autoantibodies possible surrogate markers of advanced hepatic fibrosis in AIH.

Standard treatment for AIH is based on corticosteroids, as monotherapy or in association with azathioprine. An accurate distinction between AIH and other primary autoimmune diseases is essential when considering a therapeutic strategy. On the one hand, some drugs used in the treatment of primary rheumatologic diseases, like methotrexate, are potentially hepatotoxic. On the other, though azathioprine is effective in the treatment of AIH-related rheumatologic manifestations, its effectiveness is limited in primary diseases, including RA.

### Lupus enteritis: a narrative review [^114aquwP]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Lupus enteritis (LE) is a rare manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. The pathophysiology of LE has not been fully elucidated, although inflammatory and thrombotic processes are likely important factors. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms may depend on which portion of the intestine is affected. Over half of the patients with LE also present with renal or haematological complications. The diagnosis of LE is based on clinical, histopathological and imaging findings; abdominal computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard in diagnosis. Abdominal CT can also identify factors that predict complications and could potentially guide pharmacological and nutritional management. Timely identification and prompt treatment initiation are paramount to avoid life and organ threatening complications. Glucocorticoids are often the first-line treatment. Additional therapy including immunosuppressive therapy is utilised on a case-by-case basis as there are no clinical trials to define the optimal therapeutic approach. Surgical intervention may be needed especially if there is bowel perforation or peritonitis. In general, the prognosis of LE is good.

### Gastrointestinal and hepatic disease in systemic lupus erythematosus [^113NFQD5]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), although only rarely are they caused by active organ system involvement from SLE itself. Rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment of lupus enteritis and other GI manifestations of SLE are critical, because of the potential for organ and life-threatening complications. The 3 main variants of lupus enteritis are lupus mesenteric vasculitis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and protein-losing enteropathy. These GI manifestations and others in patients with SLE are reviewed here.

### Novel association of eosinophilic pustular folliculitis with systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report [^115zVhk4]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF) is a rare inflammatory dermatosis characterized by chronic, recurrent, and pruritic papulopustular eruptions that, on histology, demonstrate folliculotropic infiltrates of eosinophils frequently accompanied by eosinophilic micro-abscess.

EPF can be subdivided into 3 clinical variants: classic EPF, EPF of infancy, and immunosuppression-associated EPF (IS-EPF). Classic EPF is predominantly seen in middle-aged, East-Asian patients who are otherwise healthy.EPF of infancy occurs around 6 months of age with a predilection for males and scalp involvement. IS-EPF has been primarily described in patients with HIV or hematologic malignancies. Lesions of IS-EPF tend to lack an annular arrangement and predilection for the face.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease with potential for widespread organ involvement.EPF has been reported in a variety of conditions, including asthma, pregnancy, and hepatitis C, but has not yet been reported in SLE. We report 2 cases of IS-EPF in patients with SLE and propose a mechanistic explanation for the 2 conditions coexisting.

### The involvement of the liver in systemic diseases [^117DskvZ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The liver has a double blood supply and plays a central role in the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and many medications. In addition, it has a role in the induction of immune tolerance and may also be a target for immune-mediated damage. For these reasons, the liver may be involved in many systemic diseases. In this review, we discuss the involvement of the liver in granulomatous, rheumatologic, malignant, and circulatory diseases. An understanding of the wide spectrum of liver involvement in systemic diseases will aid in both diagnosis and treatment of patients with a wide range of medical conditions.

### Pulmonary and thrombotic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus [^111xXGB2]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is considered the archetypal systemic autoimmune disease. Clinically characterized by multisystem involvement and varied serologic abnormalities, no two patients present or have disease that evolves in exactly the same way. Viewed histologically, SLE is characterized by some combination of inflammation and fibrosis, and the clinical phenotype is dictated by the relative contributions of each and the organs affected. Tissue injury appears to be mediated by characteristic autoantibody production, immune complex formation, and their organ-specific deposition. As expected in a multisystem disease, the entire pulmonary system is vulnerable to injury. Any of its compartments-airways, lung parenchyma, vasculature, pleura, or the respiratory musculature-may be independently or simultaneously affected. This article offers the reader a comprehensive review of the numerous pulmonary and thrombotic manifestations of SLE and suggests approaches to their management.

### Determining the association between systematic lupus erythematosus and the occurrence of primary biliary cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116uQvNi]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Autoimmune diseases often coexist; however, the concomitant occurrence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is rare. Therefore, this study aims to provide a comprehensive summary of evidence regarding the co-occurrence of SLE and PBC.

Methods

PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases were systematically and comprehensively searched for records published up to February 2024. Full-text articles that aligned with the study's aim were included, while those published in languages other than English and those designed as case reports, reviews, conference abstracts, or editorials were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, and methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

Results

Only 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria with 3944 PBC and 9414 SLE patients were included for review and analysis. Pooled data analysis revealed that approximately 1.1% of SLE patients have concomitant PBC (range: 0.02–7.5%), while around 2.7% of PBC patients concurrently have SLE (range: 1.3–7.5%). Furthermore, qualitative data analysis indicated that the prevalence of PBC in SLE patients presenting with hepatic dysfunction or abnormal liver enzymes ranges from 2 to 7.5%.

Conclusion

Although the concomitant occurrence of SLE and PBC is rare, the small proportion of patients where these diseases coexist warrants close monitoring by clinicians. This underscores the importance of surveillance to prevent their co-occurrence.

### Autoimmune liver diseases and systemic rheumatic disorders: exploring their interplay and impact on prognosis [^1137iMR6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune liver diseases (AILDs) are a group of chronic conditions characterized by immune-mediated damage to the liver and bile ducts. The most common AILDs include autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which can occur independently or as overlap syndromes.

Systemic rheumatic diseases (SRDs) are chronic autoimmune disorders characterized by the presence of serum autoantibodies potentially affecting any organ or system. These include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren syndrome (SS), systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic vasculitis (SV). Diagnosis of SRDs is typically based on clinical and historical details combined with autoantibody screening (anti-nuclear antibody [ANA], anti-double-stranded DNA [anti-dsDNA], complement 3/4 [C3/C4], antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA], anti-SSA/Ro anti-SSB/La) and appropriate imaging when necessary.

Hepatic involvement is common (up to 40%) in SRD patients. It can occur through several mechanisms: liver enzyme abnormalities without significant histopathological changes, drug-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or concurrent AILDs.

The co-occurrence of AILDs and SRDs presents a complex clinical picture. Studies have shown varying prevalence rates of SRDs in AILD patients and vice versa; for example, in a survey of 111 AIH patients, Teufel et al. showed that RA prevalence was 1.8%, Sjögren's 1.4%, and lupus 0.7%. Conversely, in a histopathological analysis of 160 liver biopsies from SRD patients with liver function abnormalities, Matsumoto et al. Found that 5.6% had PBC and 1.9% had AIH. Selmi et al. A 35–57% prevalence of PBC was reported among scleroderma patients.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus in a 15-year-old with graft-versus-host disease following liver transplant and unexpected full hematopoietic engraftment [^116iQ8we]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by multisystem inflammation and the presence of circulating autoantibodies directed against self-antigens, with approximately 10% to 15% of cases presenting in childhood. The etiology is unknown; however, risk factors include female sex, genetic predisposition, and environmental factors that can induce both the onset of the disease and flares of existing disease. Diagnosing SLE is often challenging since it may present in a myriad of ways and may affect nearly any organ system. We present an unusual case of SLE in an adolescent male following a liver transplant with an unexpected full engraftment of the hematopoietic system. This patient did not have any known risk factors for SLE; therefore, we speculate that the unanticipated hematopoietic transplant resulted in the acquisition of genetic variants from the donor, that were associated with the development of SLE.

### Lupus mimickers [^113yddYe]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by multisystem organ involvement, heterogeneity of clinical features, and variety in degree of severity. The differential diagnosis is a crucial aspect in SLE as many other autoimmune diseases portray clinical similarities and autoantibody positivity. Lupus mimickers refer to a group of conditions that exhibit both clinical features and laboratory characteristics, including autoantibody profiles that resemble those present in patients with SLE, and prompt a diagnostic challenge in everyday clinical practice. Thus, lupus mimickers may present as a lupus-like condition (i.e., 2 or 3 criteria) or as one meeting the classification criteria for SLE. Herein we review and classify the current literature on lupus mimickers based on diverse etiologies which include infections, malign and benign neoplasms, medications, and vaccine-related reactions.

### Co-occurrence of Wilson's disease and systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report and literature review [^112rdNY7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Wilsons disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease associated with defective biliary excretion of copper. The simultaneous occurrence of WD and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has seldom been reported. Therefore, this study aimed to report the co-occurrence of SLE and WD with hepatic involvement in a patient so as to improve the understanding of the coexistence of these two conditions.

Case presentation

A 35-year-old woman with SLE was found to have liver fibrosis during a routinely abdominal ultrasound examination. Her laboratory evaluation showed low serum ceruloplasmin and high 24h urine copper levels. The slit-lamp examination revealed the presence of KayseriFleischer ring in her cornea. Liver biopsy demonstrated the enlargement of the portal area with hyperplasia of the fibrous tissue, infiltration of lymphoid plasma cells, swelling of hepatocytes, and steatosis, demonstrating liver fibrosis. Ensuing genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of WD.

Conclusions

Clinicians should bear in mind that unexplained liver fibrosis in patients with SLE may be related to WD, so as to avoid a missed or delayed diagnosis.

### Liver involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus: case review of 40 patients [^114M2jRG]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Subclinical liver involvement is frequent in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We sought to determine the presence of endstage liver disease in patients with SLE.

Methods

We carried out a retrospective chart review of our cohort of patients with SLE. Endstage liver disease was defined as presence or development of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, or hepatic encephalopathy.

Results

Forty patients with liver enzyme abnormalities were identified. Major clinical diagnostic groups were drug-induced (n = 4), viral hepatitis (hepatitis B or C and cytomegalovirus; n = 8), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; n = 8), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH; n = 6), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC; n = 3), and miscellaneous [n = 11; liver involvement from infection (2), cryptogenic cirrhosis (2), lymphoma (1), and indeterminate (6)]. There were no differences in mean age, total and direct bilirubin, or aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels. Alanine aminotransferase levels were higher in the miscellaneous group. Biopsies were performed in 20 patients and showed changes of NAFLD (n = 5), AIH (n = 4), PBC (n = 3), hepatitis C (n = 3), and cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 2), and 1 each with phenytoin-induced liver injury, hepatic granulomas due to systemic candidiasis, and lymphomatous involvement of the liver. The median followup was 44 months (range 10–576). The estimated 5-year serious liver disease-free survival was 93% (95% confidence interval 84%-100%). Eight patients died. Mortality was not directly related to liver disease in any patient.

Conclusion

Complications of portal hypertension, cirrhosis, and hepatic encephalopathy are rare manifestations of SLE unless coexistent liver disease such as NAFLD, viral hepatitis, or AIH is present.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus… [^1111hHzA]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Observations Approximately 90% of people with SLE are female. Although there are no uniformly accepted diagnostic criteria for SLE, the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology /American College of Rheumatology classification criteria developed for scientific study are an estimated 96. 1% sensitive and
93. 4% specific for SLE. These classification criteria include both clinical factors, such as fever, cytopenia, rash, arthritis, and proteinuria, which may be indicative of lupus nephritis; and immunologic measures, such as SLE-specific autoantibodies and low complement levels. Approximately 40% of people with SLE develop lupus nephritis, and an estimated 10% of people with lupus nephritis develop end-stage kidney disease after 10 years.

The primary goal of treatment is to achieve disease remission or quiescence, defined by minimal symptoms, low levels of autoimmune inflammatory markers, and minimal systemic glucocorticoid requirement while the patient is treated with maintenance doses of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications. Treatment goals include reducing disease exacerbations, hospitalizations, and organ damage due to the disease or treatment toxicity. Hydroxychloroquine is standard of care for SLE and has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality. Treatments in addition to hydroxychloroquine are individualized, with immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide, typically used for treating moderate to severe disease. Three SLE medications were recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration: belimumab, voclosporin, and anifrolumab.

Conclusions and Relevance Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with immune-mediated damage to multiple organs and increased mortality. Hydroxychloroquine is first-line therapy and reduces disease activity, morbidity, and mortality. When needed, additional immunosuppressive and biologic therapies include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, belimumab, voclosporin, and anifrolumab.

### Autoantibodies associated with primary biliary cholangitis are common among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus even in the absence of elevated liver enzymes [^116XhfvR]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

In this study, IgG‐autoantibodies associated with autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) were found in a considerable proportion of well‐characterized patients diagnosed with primary Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but without known liver involvement or autoimmune liver disease (AILD). PBC‐associated autoantibodies have previously not been reported in a substantial percentage of cases with SLE. However, the association between autoantibody findings and AILD was poor as no significant difference in liver enzymes was observed between AILD‐associated autoantibody negative and positive patients.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: a review [^111sTtGw]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on systemic lupus erythematosus:

- **Definition**: SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease with a heterogeneous clinical course and progressive involvement of multiple organs.
- **Pathophysiology**: SLE is a multifactorial autoimmune disease characterized by loss of self-tolerance, leading to autoantibody production, immune complex formation, and widespread inflammation. The pathophysiology involves a combination of genetic, epigenetic, hormonal, immunologic, and environmental factors. Genetic susceptibility includes specific HLA haplotypes, single nucleotide polymorphisms in immune-related genes, and deficiencies in complement components C1q and C4. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA hypomethylation, alter immune cell function and gene expression. Hormonal influences, particularly estrogen and the presence of two X chromosomes, contribute to the female predominance observed in SLE. Defective clearance of apoptotic cells exposes nuclear antigens, triggering abnormal activation of dendritic cells and B and T lymphocytes. This leads to the production of pathogenic autoantibodies, most notably anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm, and the formation of circulating immune complexes. These complexes deposit in tissues, activate complement, and drive local inflammation and organ damage. Dysregulated type I interferon signaling, aberrant B-cell hyperactivity, and impaired regulatory T-cell function contribute to disease propagation and chronicity. The multisystem involvement reflects the systemic distribution of immune complex deposition and inflammatory mediators.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the estimated incidence of SLE ranges from 4.9 to 7.4 cases per 100,000 person-years, while the estimated prevalence ranges from 72.8 to 178 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for SLE include female sex, particularly during reproductive years, and non-White ethnicity, with higher prevalence and severity reported in individuals of African, Asian, Hispanic, and Indigenous descent. Genetic predisposition plays a key role, with increased risk among first-degree relatives and associations with specific HLA haplotypes. Environmental triggers such as UV light exposure, infections (such as EBV), and cigarette smoking may contribute to disease onset or flares. Certain drugs (such as hydralazine, minocycline, lithium, D-penicillamine, TNF-α blockers) can induce lupus-like syndromes. Hormonal factors, including estrogen exposure, are also implicated in disease susceptibility.
- **Disease course**: SLE is a chronic, relapsing-remitting autoimmune disease with a highly variable presentation. Disease activity can range from mild symptoms such as fatigue, arthralgia, and mucocutaneous lesions to severe organ involvement. Flares may occur intermittently, often triggered by environmental or physiological stressors, and are followed by periods of partial or complete remission. Lupus nephritis develops in up to 50% of patients and may present with proteinuria, hematuria, nephrotic syndrome, or progressive renal dysfunction. Neurologic involvement is reported in up to 56% of patients and can affect both the central and PNSs. Central manifestations include cognitive dysfunction, psychosis, seizures, headache, and cerebrovascular events. Peripheral neuropathies are reported in up to 28% of patients and may be sensory, motor, or mixed, including small fiber neuropathy, distal symmetric polyneuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, and cranial neuropathies. Additional systemic involvement may include hematologic abnormalities (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), antiphospholipid syndrome, serositis, ILD, and premature CVD.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 10-year survival rate of patients with SLE is approximately 70%. The all-cause standard mortality rate is increased 2.6 fold in patients with SLE, and the risk of mortality is increased by 4.98, 4.67, and 2.25 fold for infections, renal disease, and CVD, respectively.

### Autoimmune hepatitis [^116xL62h]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Autoimmune liver disease encompasses several disorders (Table 1). Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) affects mainly women and is characterized histologically by a portal tract mononuclear cell infiltrate disrupting the limiting plate and invading the parenchyma ("interface hepatitis") and serologically by the presence of autoantibodies and increased levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG), in the absence of a known cause. AIH responds to immunosuppressive treatment. It can present insidiously or as an acute hepatitis. The previously accepted requirement of 6-month duration of symptoms before diagnosis can be made has been abandoned and treatment should be instituted as soon as the disease is diagnosed. In this review, we concentrate on those reports that add to our knowledge in terms of pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, treatment, and clinical course. Special attention is given to overlap syndromes.

### Autoantibodies associated with primary biliary cholangitis are common among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus even in the absence of elevated liver enzymes [^115pH8Zh]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

In several autoimmune conditions, the relation between onset of disease and epitope spreading with increasing numbers of specificities preceding clinical diagnosis has been subject to intense research [43, 44, 45]. From our data, it is not possible to judge whether the observed AILD autoantibodies in SLE/pSS cases without established AILD or elevated liver enzymes: (i) will precede clinical liver disease, (ii) only reflect a B cell hyperactivity with a general tendency to produce autoantibodies targeting a broad repertoire or (iii) simply reflect an epiphenomenon. The relatively long follow‐up of most included patients does not support the first alternative. Conversely, their autoimmune disease could later have affected organ systems (i.e. renal involvement), which required potent immunosuppressive therapy targeting B cells that may have hindered the development of AILD [46]. To scrutinize this further and evaluate potential pathogenic roles of these AILD‐associated autoantibodies, special focus should include strength of autoantibody binding and glycosylation analysis of Fc portions [47, 48, 49, 50].

The study has some limitations that should be mentioned. During the review of medical records ALT and AST were the most frequently assessed liver enzymes, whereas results of ALP and GGT were less frequently available (approximately 70%). In addition, as our data are entirely observational, liver enzymes were analysed more frequently in individuals who were on regular treatment with immunosuppressants, had a suspected liver disease, experienced side‐effects from therapies or had multiple co‐morbidities. Subsequently, cases with mild pSS/SLE who presented with elevated liver enzymes were not assessed as frequently. Nevertheless, the well‐characterized patient cohorts with longitudinal laboratory data sets, combined with reliable autoantibody analyses from the accredited Clinical Immunology Routine Laboratory in Linköping, constitute major strengths.

To conclude, this study demonstrates presence of AILD‐associated autoantibodies in a considerable proportion of well‐characterized patients with pSS and SLE without established or laboratory signs of liver disease. We are not aware that PBC‐associated autoantibodies have been reported in a substantial percentage of cases with SLE previously. However, the association between autoantibody findings and AILD was poor, as no significant difference in liver enzymes was observed between autoantibody‐negative and ‐positive cases.

Regarding specific circumstances for systemic lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to patients with cutaneous manifestations, EULAR 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate the following options in patients with SLE with active skin disease:

- **Topical agents**: corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors

- **Antimalarials**: hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine

- systemic corticosteroids as needed.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^114meRwH]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Abdominal ultrasound showed mild hepatomegaly, mild splenomegaly, mild gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid. There were no gallstones or biliary ductal dilatation. Chest radiograph was normal. The patient was admitted for presumed cholecystitis and treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole.

Marked thrombocytopenia may arise from acute infection or medication toxicity, but autoimmunity, hypersplenism or an infiltrative process of the bone marrow must also be considered. The urinalysis results are compatible with pyelonephritis, but there is no history of dysuria or costovertebral angle tenderness. Other explanations for the urinary findings include glomerulonephritis or urolithiasis. Endocarditis, via immune complex deposition, could cause this active urine sediment and involve the liver.

The laboratory tests point to a combined cholestatic and hepatocellular process. The AST to ALT ratio is compatible with alcoholic hepatitis, which can present with systemic toxicity and abdominal pain; therefore, revisiting the alcohol history would be logical here. Acetaminophen levels should be checked. The sonogram results, particularly the absence of gallstones, substantially lower the likelihood of acute cholecystitis, and the left-sided abdominal pain never really supported that diagnosis. Given the biochemical evidence of direct liver involvement and unexplained left upper quadrant pain, an abdominal CT is indicated.

She has a subacute illness associated with weight loss, night sweats, SIRS, prolonged fever, LUQ pain, hepatopathy and thrombocytopenia. Leading considerations include alcoholic hepatitis, SLE with autoimmune hepatitis, lymphoma or an indolent infection. Her travel to Mexico and potential involvement of the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, bone marrow) renders tuberculosis, fungal infections (e.g. histoplasmosis), endocarditis (especially if she has undiagnosed rheumatic heart disease) and brucellosis distinct possibilities. HIV testing is also indicated.

The clinician has explicitly articulated the revised problem representation in the first sentence of the paragraph above. The new data have triggered new hypotheses (e.g. alcoholic hepatitis) and eliminated earlier hypotheses (e.g. cholecystitis). The next diagnostic test (abdominal CT) is chosen to identify features that discriminate among the competing diagnoses.

### Imaging findings in systemic lupus erythematosus [^1126Y9A2]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an unusually complex autoimmune disease that is encountered in every radiology subspecialty because of its multisystem involvement and the wide age range of affected patients. There are no universally accepted diagnostic imaging criteria for SLE, and in fact, many SLE patients present with systemic findings and laboratory abnormalities and do not require imaging. Nevertheless, radiology plays an ancillary role in the diagnosis and management of this often insidious disease, and knowledge of the spectrum of radiologic findings in SLE and its complications is crucial for proper image interpretation. Imaging is often performed in patients with a known diagnosis of SLE to determine the extent and severity of disease, which depend on the extent of organ involvement, and to monitor complications. In addition, imaging may be important in selected patients with diseases such as pneumonia who present with atypical symptoms due to immunosuppressive therapy.

### Surface complement C3 fragments and cellular binding of microparticles in patients with SLE [^115Cp9B6]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Microparticles (MPs) are hypothesised as central in the pathogenesis of SLE, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. MPs are small membrane-bound vesicles (0.1–1 µm) released from activated or apoptotic cells (ACs). They carry, among other, nuclear antigens triggering the production of various antinuclear antibodies, a hallmark of SLE.

SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease characterised by activation of the innate immune system and activation of T and B lymphocytes, leading to production of autoantibodies, immune complex (IC) deposits and complement-mediated tissue damage. This results in clinical manifestations from various tissues, of which malar rash, non-erosive arthritis and nephritis are among the most common. The disease can range from mild to severe with varying degrees of organ damage and is associated with an overall increased mortality.

MPs have surface similarities with both ACs and ICs because the MP surface contains both phosphatidylserine, other cell surface markers and antigen–antibody complexes. Accordingly, because SLE is associated with deficient clearance of AC materialand ICs, clearance of MPs is likely to be impaired in SLE. Clearance of ACs is normally a non-inflammatory process; ACs are rapidly phagocytised following recognition via receptors for opsonins, phosphatidylserine or β2-glycoprotein I, exposed on the cell membrane. ICs are cleared by binding to erythrocytes via complement receptor type 1 (CR1) that binds C3b, C4b and, with lesser affinity, iC3b on the IC. The ICs are subsequently transported to the fixed mononuclear phagocytic system in liver, spleen or bone marrow. Based on this, and previous findings of neutrophil MP binding to erythrocytes, we found it reasonable to suggest that MPs might be cleared in the same manners. Deficiencies in these clearance mechanisms are likely to be impaired in patients with SLE. Several hypotheses about AC clearance defects exist. One pertains to defects in the receptor-mediated recognition by phagocytes. Another focuses on defects in macrophage phagocytosis. Third, diminished clearance of ACs in SLE is linked to deficiencies in complement components or complement receptors. For example, one third of patients with SLE have antibodies against complement, and deficiencies of components of the classical pathway are strongly associated with SLE, especially C1q deficiency. Clearing of ICs is also compromised in patients with SLE, who express fewer CR1 molecules per erythrocyte than healthy controls (HCs). Deficient MP clearance might lead to accumulation of MPs with disrupted membrane integrity and exposure of antigenic cell material to the immune system, resulting in a proinflammatory response.

### SLE – a disease of clearance deficiency? [^115EdD5b]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial disease and its pathogenesis and precise aetiology remain unknown. Under physiological conditions, neither apoptotic nor necrotic cell material is easily found in tissues because of its quick removal by a highly efficient scavenger system. Autoantigens are found in apoptotic and necrotic material and they are recognized by autoimmune sera from SLE patients. The clearance of dying cells is finely regulated by a highly redundant system of receptors on phagocytic cells and bridging molecules, which detect molecules specific for dying cells. Changes on apoptotic and necrotic cell surfaces are extremely important for their recognition and further disposal. Some SLE patients seem to have an impaired ability to clear such apoptotic material from tissues, and this could cause the breakdown of central and peripheral mechanisms of tolerance against self-antigens. In this article, we address the cells, receptors and molecules involved in the clearance process and show how deficiencies in this process may contribute to the aetiopathogenesis of SLE.

### Gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus [^116P3PWF]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

In this review of the gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 180 articles from the English literature, found using a medline search from January 1965 to December 2010, were examined. Vasculitis may cause ulcerations, bleeding, stricture formation, and perforation from ischemia and infarction. Otherwise, GI symptoms, occurring in about 50% of patients, are usually mild. Esophageal dysmotility may result in heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia. Occasionally, pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis may develop, sometimes associated with benign pneumoperitoneum. Patients are prone to salmonella bacteremia, presenting more commonly with fever and abdominal pain than with diarrhea. Intestinal pseudoobstruction usually is found with active lupus serology, preferentially involving small rather than the large bowel. Protein-losing enteropathy, characterized by diarrhea, edema, and hypoalbuminemia, can be the initial presentation of SLE. Malabsorption with a prevalence of 9.5% is occasionally associated with celiac disease. Pancreatitis, with an annual incidence of 0.4 to 1/1000, has an overall mortality of 27% that is decreased with corticosteroid therapy. Acute and chronic ascites may be due to lupus peritonitis or to associated diseases, such as pancreatitis, nephrotic syndrome, heart failure, or infections. Abnormal liver function tests may be due to steatosis from lupus or from corticosteroid therapy. Only about 10% of patients with autoimmune hepatitis have lupus. Up to 4.7% of patients with SLE have chronic active hepatitis correlating strongly with the presence of antibody to ribosomal P protein. SLE can involve the entire GI tract and the liver. Treatment with corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents, and/or immunosuppressants is often successful.

### Gastrointestinal and hepatic involvement in paediatric systemic lupus erythematosus [^117SUWZo]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystemic, autoimmune, inflammatory disease. Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement, extensively described in adults, is less characterised in paediatric-onset SLE (pSLE). The aim of the present narrative review was to provide a comprehensive summary and update on GI involvement in pSLE. A literature search on PubMed and EMBASE was conducted to identify original articles, reviews, case series and editorials published in English from 2000 to 31 August 2020. Based on this, we reported the prevalence, pathogenetic mechanisms, clinical issues, diagnostic tools and management of each form of GI involvement in pSLE. Lupus enteritis is the most frequent type of GI involvement in pSLE, followed by intestinal pseudo-obstruction, protein-losing enteropathy, hepatic disease and acute pancreatitis. The most common presenting GI symptoms are non-specific and include abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting. In most cases, they are associated with other clinical and laboratory manifestations of SLE. The complications of GI involvement, including perforation and intestinal infarction, can be life-threatening. Laboratory findings and imaging studies can help to rule out non-SLE related causes for GI manifestations and to reveal typical features of the single forms of GI involvement. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to improve prognosis and avoid unnecessary surgery. Most SLE GI manifestations respond well to glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants. In conclusion, GI involvement is frequent in pSLE and its diagnosis and management can be a challenge for clinicians. In view of the limited available data, further studies are needed to better explore the prevalence, prognosis and treatment recommendations for GI involvement in pSLE.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus combined with Wilson's disease: a case report and literature review [^114GUEGq]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Wilson's disease (WD) are both systemic diseases that can affect multiple organs in the body. The coexistence of SLE and WD is rarely encountered in clinical practice, making it challenging to diagnose.

Case Report

We present the case of a 9-year-old girl who initially presented with proteinuria, haematuria, pancytopenia, hypocomplementemia, and positivity for multiple autoantibodies. She was diagnosed with SLE, and her blood biochemistry showed elevated liver enzymes at the time of diagnosis. Despite effective control of her symptoms, her liver enzymes remained elevated during regular follow-up. Laboratory tests revealed decreased serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, along with elevated urinary copper. Liver biopsy revealed chronic active hepatitis, moderate inflammation, moderate-severe fibrosis, and a trend towards local cirrhosis. Genetic sequencing revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the ATP7B gene, confirming the diagnosis of SLE with WD. The girl received treatment with a high-zinc/low-copper diet, but her liver function did not improve. Upon recommendation following multidisciplinary consultation, she underwent liver transplantation. Unfortunately, she passed away on the fourth day after the surgery.

Conclusions

SLE and WD are diseases that involve multiple systems and organs in the body, and SLE complicated with WD is rarely encountered in the clinic; therefore, it is easy to misdiagnose. Because penicillamine can induce lupus, it is not recommended. Liver transplantation is indicated for patients with liver disease who do not respond to medical treatment with WD. However, further research is needed to determine the optimal timing of liver transplantation for patients with SLE complicated with WD.

### The elusive diagnosis of adolescent systemic lupus erythematosus [^115GZqQt]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease affecting multiple systems, and its various symptoms are often mistaken for other diseases. This case report describes a 15-year-old girl who presented to the emergency department with complaints of diffuse abdominal pain, facial swelling, joint pain, low-grade fever, and rash. An initial autoimmune process was suspected, and, with prompt referral, a diagnosis of SLE was confirmed. This case report and discussion review the difficulty of diagnosing SLE and the importance of maintaining autoimmune diseases, such as SLE, on an emergency physician's differential.

Results

Patients with previously identified AILD

Eight cases with SLE (2.9%) had been diagnosed with AILD prior to our review of medical records. Four had AIH type 1 and another four had PBC (1.4%, respectively); all had serology characteristic of AILD (Table 3). Three of the PBC‐diagnoses and two of the AIH‐diagnoses were confirmed by histopathology. At the time‐point of sampling, all eight patients were IF‐ANA positive and all were on immunosuppressive therapy due to different SLE manifestations.

Table 3
Characteristics of the eight SLE patients with previously identified autoimmune liver disease (AILD).

Among the pSS cases, three were diagnosed with AIH type 1 (2.6%) and confirmed by histopathology. Only one of them had AIH‐associated autoantibodies (i.e. anti‐SLA/LP and SMA) (Table 4). At the time‐point of sampling, all three were IF‐ANA‐positive and all were on immunosuppressive therapy due to extra‐glandular manifestations of pSS.

### Acute hepatitis in a young woman with systemic lupus erythematosus: a diagnostic challenge [^114nahd4]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 48-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis was on naproxen, hidroxichloroquine and acetylsalicylic acid. She had self-suspended all medication and resumed 1 year later. Five days after the medication was resumed, she developed acute hepatitis, with biochemical hepatic cytolysis, hypergamaglobulinaemia and a serum antinuclear antibody titre of 1/2560. Idiopathic autoimmune hepatitis was considered, but drug-induced liver injury could not definitely be ruled out. Patient declined liver biopsy. Oral prednisolone was started. Within 3 months with prednisolone being tapered to 10 mg/day, a new flare occurred. Liver biopsy was performed and it favoured autoimmune hepatitis diagnosis. We discuss the diagnostic options and treatment approach in a patient with autoimmune disease and possible drug-induced liver injury who initially declined liver biopsy.

### Co-occurrence of Wilson's disease and systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report and literature review [^1117X5Zf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, literature focusing on the coexistence of WD and SLE is scarce. Reportedly, patients with WD who are treated with penicillamine show SLE, which indicates the role of drugs associated with WD and SLE. However, previous study reported that a child diagnosed with WD and treated with penicillamine for 10years before developing nephritis, arthritis, hemolytic anemia, and autoantibodies. Penicillamine-induced lupus was first suspected, and the patient was prescribed oral zinc therapy. However, the symptoms worsened and idiopathic SLE was confirmed. A connection was found between lupus and WD. Santhakumar et al. accidentally detected the presence of KF rings in the eyes of a 24-year-old female patient with SLE and visual impairment, during an ophthalmic assessment. Additionally, the diagnosis of WD was confirmed on the basis of both serum ceruloplasmin (low) and 24-h urine copper (high) levels. Zhang et al. also reported the coexistence of SLE and WD in a woman, which exhibited typical neuropsychiatric symptoms. Asymptomatic liver fibrosis as a clinical sign of WD with SLE has not been reported, and an association between SLE and WD has not been clearly understood so far; Therefore, further exploration are needed in this regard.

Due to the relatively frequent multifaceted manifestations of liver diseases in patients with SLE, with an often difficult differential diagnosis each others. Thus, in patients with SLE showing hepatic damage, the possibility of occurrence of metabolic diseases, in addition to drug-induced liver damage, virus-related liver damage, and autoimmune liver disease, should be considered. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of WD would be beneficial.

### Autoantibodies associated with primary biliary cholangitis are common among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus even in the absence of elevated liver enzymes [^116jRwrq]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease which potentially can involve any organ system and predominantly affects women [1]. Serologically, SLE is characterized by an array of autoantibodies typically including anti‐nuclear antibodies (ANA) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Although the liver is not considered as a main target organ in SLE, elevated liver enzymes in serum during the course of SLE have been demonstrated in 19–60% [7, 8]. Signs of liver affection in SLE may have a wide range of causes, including drug‐induced injury, steatosis, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), lupus hepatitis and viral hepatitis [9, 10, 11]. However, while knowledge of PBC in relation to primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is well recognized, the co‐existence of autoimmune liver diseases (AILD) in SLE has been less studied [8, 12, 13, 14]. Over time, a subset of approximately 20–25% of SLE cases develop secondary SS at Swedish academic centres [15].

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of study population

AIH: autoimmune hepatitis; PBC: primary biliary cholangitis; PSC: primary sclerosing cholangitis; BMI: body mass index; SLE: systemic lupus erythematosus; UC: ulcerative colitis; RA: rheumatoid arthritis

The most common first main clinical presentations in patients were categorized into non-specific symptoms, asymptomatic, and acute hepatitis. Non-specific symptoms as another common first manifestation was recorded in 40 (25.0%) AIH, 20 (54.1%) PBC, 8 (40.0%) PSC, and 22 (45.8%) overlap syndrome patients. 20 (12.5%) patients with a diagnosis of AIH, 5 (13.5%) patients with a diagnosis of PBC, 6 (30.0%) patients with a diagnosis of PSC, and 9 (18.8%) patients with a diagnosis of overlap syndrome were asymptomatic and were diagnosed only based on laboratory and histologically results. Acute hepatitis was observed mainly in patients diagnosed with AIH compared to other groups of patients. 58 (36.2%) patients in AIH, 7 (18.9%) in PBC,2 (10.0%) in PSC, and 10 (20.8%) in overlap syndrome had an acute hepatitis in their first clinical presentation.

### Sustained remission with eculizumab in refractory lupus nephritis with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome [^113UkSaC]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Given the patient did not meet the diagnostic criteria for HLH according to the HLH-2004 criteria and the history and presentation of the patient were consistent with active SLE, macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) was the consensus diagnosis from treating clinicians. HLH and MAS are closely related hyperinflammatory syndromes with significant clinical overlap.HLH is more commonly associated with underlying malignancy while MAS is seen more often in rheumatic diseases. Box 1 outlines key diagnostic criteria for HLH.

Box 1
HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria

The diagnosis of HLH can be established if either A or B is fulfilled:

A molecular diagnosis consistent with HLH.
Any 5 of the 8 following clinical and laboratory criteria for HLH:

Fever > 38.5°C.
Splenomegaly.
Cytopenias (affecting ≥ 2 of 3 lineages in peripheral blood): Haemoglobin < 90 g/L. Platelets < 100×10⁹/L. Neutrophils < 1×10⁹/L.
Hypertriglyceridaemia (> 3 mmol/L) and/or hypofibrinogenaemia (≤ 1.5 g/L).
Haemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes, or other tissues.
Reduced or absent natural killer cell function.
Elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25) (≥ 2400 U/mL).
Ferritin (> 500 µg/L).

The patient had no rash or evidence of end-organ thrombotic injury at this time. She was treated with 3 days of intravenous 1 g methylprednisolone, then continued on 50 mg (1 mg/kg) prednisolone daily. Hyperferritinaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia were both steroid-responsive, further supporting a diagnosis of MAS.

While hyperferritinaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia initially improved, renal function of the patient continued to deteriorate to the need for dialysis. On day 23 of admission, worsening anaemia (67 g/L) and thrombocytopenia (87×10⁹/L), combined with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (1710 U/L) and new schistocytes on peripheral blood film, raised suspicion of atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was excluded with normal ADAMTS13 activity (31.9%). The patient did not undergo a renal biopsy due to anaemia and thrombocytopenia.

### One year in review 2017: systemic lupus erythematosus [^111rHbor]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that predominately affects women. It is characterised by a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, however, its course and organ involvement are unpredictable. Although over the last few decades an improvement in survival for SLE patients has been observed, pathogenic mechanisms underlying this disease are still unclear. Comorbidities, due to both disease and treatment, as well as multiple aspects of SLE, are under intensive investigation. Following the previous annual reviews of this series, we hereby provide a critical digest of the recent papers on SLE focusing on pathogenesis, clinical and laboratory features, as well as current and new therapeutic strategies published over the last year.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus in a 15-year-old with graft-versus-host disease following liver transplant and unexpected full hematopoietic engraftment [^1117AYQw]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Graft-versus-host disease most commonly arises after hematopoietic stem cell transplants, with estimations of cGVHD occurring in 6% of pediatric patients.cGVHD arising after a pediatric solid organ transplant is rare. A recent review identified 70 total cases, with an incidence of 1.5% following liver transplants.cGVHD is most commonly seen in liver transplants as compared to other solid organ transplants, likely due to the large number of donor lymphocytes in the donor portal tract and liver parenchyma at the time of transplantation. Other autoimmune diseases, including cytopenias, inflammatory bowel disease, and alopecia areata, may occur following solid organ transplantation and have been reported in 4.5% of pediatric liver transplant recipients. The risk of autoimmunity after a pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant is higher, with up to 14% of children developing vitiligo, and prior cGVHD is a risk factor.

There have been prior published reports of SLE following hematopoietic stem cell transplants occurring after autologous transplants but not solid organ or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants. The unusual inadvertent marrow engraftment, along with the liver transplant, likely transferred donor lymphoid cells with a genetic predisposition to the development of SLE. Our patient was an adolescent male and did not have any other risk factors for SLE, including no known family history of SLE or related diseases. The donor was also a male, did not have a known family history of SLE, and, therefore, most likely transferred lymphoid cells with a de novo genetic predisposition to the development of SLE. Neither the donor nor our patient had a clinical indication to undergo further analysis to confirm the presence of genetic variations that are known to be associated with SLE; therefore, we were unable to adequately test this hypothesis.

The development of autoimmune cytopenias in our patient may have been the initial manifestation of SLE given the known association between Evans syndrome and the subsequent development of SLE. The evolution of additional manifestations of SLE could have certainly been delayed by treatment with immunosuppressive and immunomodulating agents, eventually becoming apparent when this therapy was discontinued. Had the patient not received this therapy, we speculate that the development of the rash, nephritis, and autoantibodies associated with SLE would have occurred earlier. This case highlights the need for awareness of the potential for secondary autoimmunity, including SLE, in cases of solid organ transplantation, particularly when complicated by cGVHD and unexpected bone marrow engraftment.

### Autoimmune liver diseases and systemic rheumatic disorders: exploring their interplay and impact on prognosis [^115fq3Dv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study reinforces the complex interplay between AILDs and systemic autoimmunity. While we confirm the known associations between AILDs and SRDs, we highlight the potential prognostic value of SRD-related autoantibodies in AILD patients and underscore the importance of further research to clarify their role in disease progression. Additional prospective studies are needed to determine the long-term clinical significance of SRD-related autoantibodies in AILD patients and to identify factors that may predict the progression from "asymptomatic positivity" to clinically apparent SRDs.

All authors have contributed significantly to the work and have approved the final version of the manuscript. The manuscript has not been published and is not being considered for publication elsewhere.

### Rare clinical manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus: a review on frequency and clinical presentation [^1168AQPK]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to review the frequency and clinical presentation of the rarest clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

A list of 6 rare SLE manifestations were defined: gastrointestinal, liver, pulmonary, cardiac, ocular and neurological manifestations. Each topic was assigned to a pair of authors to perform a literature search and article review.

Results

In total, 149 articles were included in the literature review: 37 for gastrointestinal manifestations, 6 for liver manifestations, 27 for pulmonary manifestations, 50 for cardiac manifestations, 16 for ocular manifestations, 13 for neurological manifestations. Gastrointestinal disorders included several clinical presentations with variable frequency (from 0.5% to 10.7% of the cases); liver involvement included lupus-related hepatitis (9.3%) and autoimmune hepatitis (2.3%). The rarest pulmonary manifestations identified were shrinking lung syndrome, described in 1.5% of patients, while interstitial lung disease and lupus pneumonia were reported in 4% and 3% of patients respectively. Myocarditis and pulmonary hypertension were also rarely described in SLE patients although ranging from 0.4–16% and 1–14% respectively, depending on the methodology used for its identification. Ocular manifestations in SLE included some rare manifestations (reported in less than 5% of patients) and lupus retinopathy that is described in 1.2–28.8% of patients depending on methods of ascertainment. Aseptic meningitis and chorea were also confirmed as very rare manifestations being reported in less than 1% and in 0.3–2.4% of cases respectively.

Conclusions

The results of this literature review provide the basis for a better understanding of some less-known manifestations of SLE and for stressing the need for a higher awareness in diagnostic and therapeutic protocols regarding these rare disease aspects.

### Hellenic Association for the Study of the Liver (HASL): revised clinical practice guidelines for autoimmune hepatitis [^114qdB4M]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Almost all causes of acute and chronic liver diseases are included in the differential diagnosis of AIH. As a result, HBV (including hepatitis delta), HCV, and viral hepatitis A (HAV) and E (for the acute cases), alcohol-associated liver disease, DI-ALH, Wilson's disease, MASLD, PBC, PSC, AIH-PBC and AIH-PSC variants, hemochromatosis, α1-antithrypsin deficiency, as well as celiac disease and SLE should be considered. Among these, one of the most challenging is the differentiation between AIH and DI-ALH, as there is no reliable serological or histological biomarker to discriminate effectively between these 2 conditions. A proposed management of such cases is shown in Fig. 3, even though the evidence and grading for most of the suggested options is low.

Figure 3
Suggested algorithm for the differential diagnosis between autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis (DI-ALH)

IgG, immunoglobulin G; CPG, clinical practice guidelines; DILI, drug induced liver injury; CBR, complete biochemical response

Discrimination between SLE and AIH is also a challenge. As a fair number of patients with AIH present with polyarthralgia, it is reasonable for physicians to consider SLE instead of AIH in a patient with ANA and anti-dsDNA reactivity. It should be stressed, however, that liver involvement is not a common manifestation of SLE. Concurrent viral hepatitis, MASLD (commonly induced by corticosteroids) and DILI because of SLE-associated therapies are the most frequent causes of abnormal liver enzymes in patients with SLE. In case of uncertainty, the use of IFA on a Crithidia luciliae substrate, which includes high dsDNA quantities, could solve the problem, as this assay seems to detect anti-dsDNA antibodies with higher specificity than the ELISAs.

Recommendation 21

Differential diagnosis of AIH should include all causes of liver diseases, particularly DI-ALH, along with celiac disease and SLE (Evidence 1, Strong recommendation)

Ethnicity in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — Across ethnic groups, clinical phenotype, treatment response, and outcomes can differ; African American patients have more advanced hepatic fibrosis at presentation than white American patients and are younger with higher disease severity, as they "commonly have cirrhosis (57%-85% versus 38%)", have "higher frequencies of liver failure (38% versus 9%)", "require LT more commonly (52% versus 23%)", and have "greater mortality (24% versus 6%)". Asian Americans with AIH have "a higher mortality (29%) than Hispanic Americans (5%) and white Americans (8%)", and hospitalizations have been "more frequent for African Americans and Hispanics than for whites". In Europe, black patients with AIH show "younger age at presentation, increased risk of LT, and greater risk of liver-related death", while having "similar responses to standard therapy" and a "higher frequency of systemic lupus erythematosus".

### Joint pain with violaceous papules and plaques [^114r3dcg]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 1. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Dermatomyositis
B. Mixed connective tissue disease
C. Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis
D. Adult-onset Still disease (AOSD)
E. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

Answers:
A. Dermatomyositis – Incorrect. Although dermatomyositis may present with proximal muscle weakness, the cutaneous findings often include a heliotrope rash and/or Gottron papules. Pathology findings show mucin deposition in the dermis, sparse lymphocytic infiltrate, epidermal atrophy, and vacuolar changes of the basal keratinocytes.
B. Mixed connective tissue disease – Incorrect. In the absence of positive antinuclear antibodies and elevated anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies, this disease is unlikely. Mixed connective tissue disease typically presents with Raynaud phenomenon, arthralgias, esophageal dysfunction, and muscle weakness.
C. Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis – Incorrect. This rare disease manifests with arthritis and a wide spectrum of cutaneous manifestations, most commonly erythematous papules and plaques. The histopathologic findings include dense, often palisading, histiocytic infiltrate in the dermis with some scattered neutrophils and eosinophils.
D. AOSD – Correct. AOSD can have this atypical presentation with persistent violaceous papules and plaques, as opposed to the classic evanescent salmon-colored rash. In addition to having clinical and histopathologic findings that were consistent with AOSD, this patient met the Yamaguchi criteria for AOSD. She met 2 major criteria (presence of arthralgias for 2 weeks and elevated white blood cell count with greater than 80% polymorphonuclear neutrophils) and 3 minor criteria (presence of sore throat, abnormal liver function, and negative ANA and rheumatoid factor.)
E. SLE – Incorrect. The typical manifestations in this disease include a malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, arthritis, presence of a positive ANA, and systemic findings. Although SLE is an interface dermatitis, the necrotic keratinocytes are consistent with the atypical presentation of AOSD.

### Lupus-associated toxic epidermal necrolysis: a novel manifestation of lupus? [^113vKwAe]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Toxic epidermal necrolysis is an acute mucocutaneous reaction characterized by extensive cutaneous and mucosal sloughing and systemic involvement. It is generally associated with drug ingestion.

Objective and Methods

We describe 2 patients who developed typical clinical and histopathologic features of toxic epidermal necrolysis with unusual subacute progression, absence of systemic involvement or high-risk drug ingestion, and features of lupus erythematosus.

Conclusion

We propose that this constellation of features represents a new entity not previously described. This entity may represent a more severe variant of Rowell's syndrome or, alternatively, a novel manifestation of lupus erythematosus
