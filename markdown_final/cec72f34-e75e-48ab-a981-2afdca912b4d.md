## Question

What follow-up is recommended for a partial empty sella with mild prolactin elevation, stable on imaging for 9 months, with no other hormonal abnormalities?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what follow-up is recommended for a patient with a stable partial empty sella at 9 months and a mild prolactin elevation, with no other hormonal abnormalities, including what to do about MRI intervals, visual field testing, endocrine surveillance, and whether any treatment is needed for prolactin elevation [^111TBWN1] [^112HyemM]. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether empty sella should be managed like a pituitary incidentaloma or as its own entity. Then, I should verify imaging follow-up intervals specific to empty sella. Next, I will assess the significance of a mild prolactin elevation and necessary laboratory caveats. After that, I need to determine the indications for visual field testing. Finally, I will synthesize a surveillance plan, specify red flags for earlier reassessment, and confirm whether any therapy is indicated now [^111TBWN1] [^114z6gzx] [^112jNhUb] [^113iwuqn].

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity, because I need to ensure we do not conflate an empty sella with a pituitary tumor, as the surveillance paradigms differ meaningfully [^111TBWN1]. Primary or partial empty sella is typically a radiological configuration with CSF herniation into the sella and flattening of the gland, and in most cases is an incidental, non-mass-forming finding rather than an adenoma, so pituitary incidentaloma algorithms are not automatically applicable here [^111TBWN1] [^112HyemM].

> I will now examine imaging stability and appropriate follow-up intervals, and I should verify whether empty sella-specific guidance exists rather than defaulting to adenoma surveillance schedules [^114z6gzx]. The 2024 update on empty sella suggests that if no alterations are detected, careful reevaluation at 24–36 months is reasonable owing to the low risk of progression to clinically significant empty sella syndrome, which aligns with a less intensive imaging cadence than for nonfunctioning adenomas and seems appropriate in a stable, asymptomatic partial empty sella at 9 months [^111TBWN1]. Hold on, I should verify individualized care is endorsed by higher-credibility consensus statements as well; the Pituitary Society consensus emphasizes tailoring follow-up to clinical context for incidental sellar findings, including empty sella, supporting a spaced MRI interval barring new symptoms [^112HyemM].

> Next, I should review the significance of a mild prolactin elevation and, wait, let me verify common assay pitfalls and benign variants that can mislead management [^1145k2GN]. In asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia, measurement for macroprolactin is recommended to prevent overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and dynamic testing of prolactin is not needed for diagnosis, while a single serum PRL above ULN suffices if obtained without venipuncture stress; I should also remember to exclude hook effect in the appropriate discordant clinical scenario and recognize inter-assay variability that can overestimate PRL on some platforms, which argues for corroboration if the clinical picture does not match the biochemistry [^112jNhUb] [^1176YCHj] [^112Yvr5J] [^113KpDLA] [^112gmSwi] [^1145k2GN].

> Let me consider how frequently mild prolactin elevations occur with empty sella and whether they progress, because that could influence surveillance rather than immediate therapy [^1147CTD6]. Primary empty sella cohorts report endocrine abnormalities in a minority, with hyperprolactinemia present in roughly a tenth of cases in older series and broader endocrine dysfunction prevalences reported in clinic-based studies, yet many abnormalities are mild and often nonprogressive, supporting judicious rechecking rather than treatment in asymptomatic patients [^1147CTD6] [^115QR1a7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using incidentaloma imaging schedules here; I need to check that the Endocrine Society incidentaloma guidance is explicitly adenoma-focused and that we should avoid over-imaging in empty sella absent new symptoms [^114z6gzx]. Indeed, incidentaloma guidelines recommend 6–12 month MRI for adenomas and VF testing if growth abuts the chiasm, but they do not directly apply to an empty sella without mass effect, whereas empty sella-specific guidance supports 24–36 month reevaluation when stable, with earlier MRI triggered by symptoms or change, which fits this case [^114z6gzx] [^111TBWN1].

> I need to ensure I address visual field testing correctly, and let me verify when it is indicated in this context, because unnecessary ophthalmic testing can be avoided in low-risk anatomy [^113iwuqn]. Visual field testing is indicated if a sellar lesion abuts or compresses the chiasm or if there are new visual symptoms; in a stable partial empty sella without suprasellar compression, routine VF testing is not warranted, though if suprasellar extension were present and surgery deferred, some consensus statements recommend interval VF checks, which is not the situation described here [^113iwuqn] [^115nNKxC] [^111LmPRh]. Hmm, wait a minute, the draft line says "Document 22 confirms headache and visual disturbances are common symptoms but are signs of need need need earlier earlier earlier" — that phrasing is clearly a drafting error; the intended point is that new or worsening headache or visual disturbance are red flags that should prompt earlier reassessment and not routine VF testing in an otherwise stable, non-compressive partial empty sella [^115QR1a7] [^113iwuqn].

> Next, I should review endocrine surveillance beyond prolactin, and I need to ensure we do not over-test when baseline screening is normal and the patient is asymptomatic [^116EtSwT]. Consensus supports baseline pituitary hormone testing in patients with incidentally discovered empty sella, recognizing symptoms do not always correlate with dysfunction, and thereafter individualized monitoring is reasonable; with normal baseline results and no new symptoms, focused follow-up of the mild prolactin abnormality is sufficient, reserving broader re-evaluation for symptom change [^116EtSwT] [^111TBWN1].

> Let me think about the cadence of prolactin monitoring, and I should double-check whether trend data can safely inform imaging decisions in the absence of a tumor, while avoiding over-interpretation from prolactinoma literature [^112N5pvQ]. A practical approach is to recheck prolactin in 6–12 months to confirm stability and then annually if stable, ensuring macroprolactin was excluded and assay issues addressed; while data linking stable PRL to tumor quiescence come from prolactinomas, the principle of non-escalation when biochemistry is stable and imaging is non-tumoral is consistent with conservative management here [^112jNhUb] [^1145k2GN] [^112N5pvQ].

> I should confirm whether any immediate therapy is indicated for the mild prolactin elevation, and hold on, I will verify thresholds and indications to avoid overtreatment [^1119DMso]. Dopamine agonist therapy is indicated for symptomatic prolactinomas to normalize PRL, restore gonadal function, and shrink tumor, but in asymptomatic, mild hyperprolactinemia without evidence of prolactinoma or hypogonadism, observation with verification of macroprolactin and periodic reassessment is favored, with reassurance that macroprolactinemia is a benign variant that does not require treatment or extended follow-up when monomeric PRL is normal [^1119DMso] [^1154fnNT] [^112jNhUb].

> But wait, what if there are special contexts like MEN1 or pregnancy that could change surveillance or treatment thresholds; I should acknowledge these exceptions even if they do not apply here [^11655AAx]. In MEN1, relying on prolactin trends alone is insufficient and more frequent MRI is advised, and in pregnancy with a prolactinoma, management and visual monitoring differ, but neither scenario is suggested by the current presentation, so standard empty sella surveillance remains appropriate here [^1127ucW8] [^115FCvTu] [^11655AAx].

> I need to ensure the red flags for earlier evaluation are explicit, and let me verify they align with guideline triggers for intensified follow-up [^113DNtHx]. New or worsening headaches, visual symptoms, menstrual irregularities or progressive galactorrhea, features of hypopituitarism, or a marked increase in prolactin should prompt earlier clinical review and imaging rather than waiting for the routine interval, consistent with watchful-waiting frameworks that escalate as clinically indicated [^113DNtHx] [^111TBWN1].

> Synthesizing this, I should state the plan clearly and methodically, and I will now confirm each element is supported by the references before concluding [^111TBWN1]. For this stable partial empty sella with mild prolactin elevation and otherwise normal pituitary function, repeat pituitary MRI at 24–36 months from the baseline is appropriate, earlier only if symptoms arise; no routine visual field testing is needed unless there is chiasmal proximity or new visual complaints; confirm macroprolactin if not already done, recheck prolactin in 6–12 months and then annually if stable, and no dopamine agonist therapy is indicated now; provide clear return precautions for symptoms that would trigger earlier reassessment, with overall individualized follow-up consistent with consensus guidance for incidental sellar findings and empty sella [^111TBWN1] [^113iwuqn] [^112jNhUb] [^112HyemM].

---

For a patient with partial empty sella, mild prolactin elevation, stable MRI over 9 months, and no other hormonal abnormalities, the recommended follow-up is **annual clinical review with prolactin and pituitary hormone testing** [^116EtSwT] and **MRI every 2–3 years if stable** [^111TBWN1]. Macroprolactin should be checked once to exclude **assay artifact** [^112jNhUb] [^1145k2GN], and dopamine agonists are not needed unless symptoms develop or prolactin rises significantly [^1119DMso]. Escalate follow-up if **new symptoms**, visual changes, or hormonal abnormalities occur [^113DNtHx].

---

## Clinical significance of partial empty sella with mild prolactin elevation

Partial empty sella is **often incidental and benign** [^111TBWN1], though it may be associated with mild hyperprolactinemia from stalk effect [^1147CTD6] or macroprolactin artifact; **most patients remain stable without progression** [^1154fnNT].

---

## Recommended follow-up strategy

### Clinical evaluation

Annual clinical assessment should monitor for headaches, visual changes, menstrual irregularities, galactorrhea, or **hypopituitarism symptoms** [^116EtSwT]. Visual field testing [^113ZoJNW] is indicated only with **new visual symptoms** or when MRI shows **chiasmal proximity** [^113iwuqn].

---

### Hormonal evaluation

- **Annual prolactin measurement**: Track stability or progression [^112SvHm8].

- **Macroprolactin testing**: Perform once to exclude assay artifact [^112jNhUb].

- **Annual pituitary panel**: Morning cortisol, TSH/free T4, IGF-1, LH/FSH, testosterone (men), estradiol (premenopausal women) [^113HUKxm] [^116EtSwT].

---

### Imaging follow-up

Schedule **MRI every 2–3 years** if the patient remains stable and asymptomatic [^111TBWN1] [^112HyemM]. Obtain an **earlier MRI if symptoms** arise or new hormonal abnormalities develop [^113DNtHx].

---

## Indications for escalation of follow-up or intervention

Escalate follow-up or consider intervention if any of the following occur [^112SvHm8]:

- **Prolactin rise**: Significant increase or symptomatic hyperprolactinemia (e.g. galactorrhea, amenorrhea, hypogonadism).

- **New hormonal deficits**: Development of hypopituitarism.

- **Visual symptoms**: New visual field defects or chiasmal compression on MRI.

- **Lesion growth**: MRI progression.

In these cases, consider dopamine agonists (e.g. cabergoline) [^1119DMso] and refer to endocrinology or neurosurgery as appropriate [^116EtSwT].

---

## Long-term prognosis

The **long-term outlook is excellent** [^111TBWN1]; most patients remain stable without progression or significant endocrine dysfunction [^1147CTD6]. Regular follow-up ensures early detection of rare progression or new hormonal abnormalities [^112HyemM].

---

## Summary of recommended follow-up schedule

| **Follow-up component** | **Frequency** | **Indication for escalation** |
|-|-|-|
| Clinical assessment | Annually | New symptoms (headache, visual changes, menstrual irregularities, galactorrhea, hypopituitarism) |
| Prolactin measurement | Annually | Significant increase or symptomatic hyperprolactinemia |
| Macroprolactin testing | Once | Confirmed macroprolactin artifact |
| Pituitary hormone panel | Annually | New hormonal abnormalities |
| MRI | Every 2–3 years | Lesion growth or new symptoms |

---

## Conclusion

For partial empty sella with mild prolactin elevation, stable imaging, and no other hormonal abnormalities, use **annual clinical and hormonal review** with **MRI every 2–3 years** if stable [^111TBWN1]. Escalate follow-up only if symptoms, visual changes, or new hormonal abnormalities arise [^113DNtHx].

- **Follow-up testing of the pituitary incidentaloma**: Patients with incidentalomas who do not meet criteria for surgical removal of the tumor should receive nonsurgical follow-up. Clinical assessments and the following tests are recommended:

	- **MRI Scan**: An MRI scan of the pituitary should be conducted 6 months after the initial scan if the incidentaloma is a macroincidentaloma and 1 year after the initial scan if it is a microincidentaloma. For patients whose incidentaloma does not change in size, it is suggested to repeat the MRI every year for macroincidentalomas and every 1–2 years for microincidentalomas for the following 3 years, gradually decreasing frequency thereafter.

	- **Visual Field (VF) Testing**: VF testing is recommended for patients with a pituitary incidentaloma that enlarges to abut or compress the optic nerves or chiasm on a follow-up imaging study. It is suggested that clinicians do not need to test VF in patients whose incidentalomas are not close to the chiasm, have no new symptoms, and are being followed closely by MRI.

	- **Clinical and Biochemical Evaluations for Hypopituitarism**: Evaluations should be conducted 6 months after the initial testing and yearly thereafter in patients with a pituitary macroincidentaloma, although typically hypopituitarism develops with an increase in size of the incidentaloma. It is suggested that clinicians do not need to test for hypopituitarism in patients with pituitary microincidentalomas whose clinical picture, history, and MRI do not change over time.

### Empty sella syndrome: an update [^111TBWN1]. Pituitary (2024). Low credibility.

Empty sella is characterized by a flattened profile of the pituitary gland that represents, in most cases, only a radiological incidental finding. When endocrine, ophthalmic, and neurological symptoms occur, this condition is described as empty sella syndrome.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed database) with the data filter 2024–2009 using the keywords listed above. The articles met the following inclusion criteria: 1) written in English; 2) published between 1 January 2009, and 31 December 2023; 3) original studies and case series on the epidemiology, characteristics, and treatment of empty sella and empty sella syndrome. Exclusion criteria included articles written in languages other than English and single case reports.

- **Results**: The incidence of empty sella is about 12% when it comes to neuroimaging, while in clinical practice it can reach 35%. Endocrine pituitary disorders, defined as at least one hormone deficit, were reported in 19% to 40% of patients. Magnetic nuclear imaging (MRI) is confirmed to be the gold standard for radiological diagnosis of empty sella. If no alterations are detected, it is suggested to have a careful reevaluation at 24–36 months, due to the low risk of progression to PES syndrome.

- **Conclusions**: Empty sella is, in most cases, a radiological finding without clinical manifestations. In people carrying empty sella, hormonal pituitary evaluation should be assessed at the moment of diagnosis, along with careful imaging using MRI.

### Primary empty sella [^1147CTD6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The term primary empty sella (PES) refers to a number of endocrine and/or neurological disturbances that may be caused by the herniation of subarachnoid space within the sella.

- **Setting**: The records of all patients with a diagnosis of empty sella between 1985 and 2002 seen at the Catholic University of Rome and University of Brescia were examined retrospectively.

- **Patients**: We have observed 171 female and 42 male patients affected by PES (over 4:1 sex ratio). The mean age at diagnosis in our subjects was 51.8 ± 2.1 years. The mean body mass index was 27.3 ± 3.5 kg/m².

- **Main outcome measure**: All the patients have been analyzed first either with sellar computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging. All patients underwent neurological, ophthalmological, and baseline endocrine evaluation (appropriate stimulation tests were performed when hypopituitarism was suspected).

- **Results**: In the overall population, 40 of 213 patients had documented endocrine abnormalities, specifically 31 females and nine males. Twenty-two patients (10.3% of total patients; 18 women, 10.5% of all women, with a mean age of 38.6 ± 1.1 years and four males, with a mean age 46.5 ± 3.52 years) presented with hyperprolactinemia. Global anterior hypopituitarism was confirmed in nine patients. Eight patients presented an isolated GH deficiency. One hundred thirty-eight of our patients presented a so-called partial empty sella at computed tomography scan/magnetic resonance imaging, and 75 had total PES.

- **Conclusions**: PES may be associated with variable clinical conditions ranging from mild endocrine.

### Ten-year clinical follow-up of a cohort of 51 patients with macroprolactinemia establishes it as a benign variant [^1154fnNT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Macroprolactinemia is a common finding in patients with hyperprolactinemia. There are no published long-term follow-up studies.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to describe findings after prolonged follow-up in a previously published cohort of patients with macroprolactinemia.

- **Study population**: We studied 51 patients identified as having macroprolactinemia after polyethylene glycol precipitation.

- **Design**: Clinical assessment and serum prolactin assay were repeated in 51 patients with macroprolactinemia following a median follow-up of 9.9 years (range, 9–11 years).

- **Results**: Median age at presentation was 41 years (range, 18–55 years). Mean serum prolactin concentration at presentation was 1885 mU/liter, and after follow-up 1370 mU/liter. At follow-up, headache had been experienced in 12 patients (24%) and oligomenorrhea in five (10%). Galactorrhea was present in only two patients (4%). No visual deterioration was noted in 50 patients. One had a transient bitemporal hemianopia. No patients developed an autoimmune condition. Microadenoma had been identified in four patients at presentation with no new pituitary imaging abnormalities identified at follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: During prolonged follow-up, no symptomatic progression was noted in any of our patients. This study suggests that patients with macroprolactinemia and normal concentrations of monomeric prolactin can be reassured, and extended endocrine review of such patients is not required.

### ESE clinical practice guideline on functioning and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas in pregnancy [^113QXqYL]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperprolactinemia, more specifically for patients contemplating pregnancy, the ESE 2021 guidelines recommend initiating medical treatment as first-line therapy in patients with prolactinoma who are actively seeking pregnancy. Initiate a dopamine agonist to normalize prolactin concentrations and restore regular ovulatory cycles. Administer cabergoline at the lowest possible effective dose until pregnancy is confirmed. Consider performing transsphenoidal surgery in individual cases.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114HFHVD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Evidence**: The options for treating patients with asymptomatic, clinically nonfunctioning pituitary incidentalomas include conservative follow-up without surgery or immediate surgery despite the lack of specific indications. Conservative follow-up was recommended, recognizing that the appropriate algorithm for its application and safety has not been prospectively tested. There is limited data supporting or opposing a nonsurgical approach to managing asymptomatic pituitary incidentalomas. Consequently, the guidelines rely on the clinical experiences of Task Force members.

	- The appropriate algorithm for endocrine testing during follow-up has not been tested, as only 49 patients with pituitary incidentalomas followed without surgery have been reported in prospectively conducted endocrine testing. Follow-up endocrine testing is recommended for patients with macroincidentalomas due to their risk of developing hypopituitarism. In prospectively followed macroincidentalomas, worsening hypopituitarism developed in one of seven and three of 28 patients, all of whom experienced tumor enlargement. Additionally, hypopituitarism developed in four of 37 and one of 248 patients who experienced apoplexy on follow-up. Despite the lack of extensive data, follow-up endocrine testing is recommended because of the potential high risk of untreated hypopituitarism to the patient. A meta-analysis of incidentaloma studies indicated that new endocrine dysfunction developed in 2.4% of patients per year.

### Biochemical diagnosis in prolactinomas: Some caveats [^1145k2GN]. Pituitary (2020). Low credibility.

Prolactinomas are the most frequently seen pituitary adenomas in clinical practice. A correct biochemical diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is a prerequisite for further investigation but may be hampered by analytical difficulties, as well as a large number of potentially overlapping conditions associated with increased prolactin levels. Suspicion should arise in patients whose symptoms and biochemical results do not match.

- **Assay problems**: Macroprolactinemia and high-dose hook effect are discussed as possible reasons for false positive or false negative prolactin levels.
- **Physiological and pathological causes**: The implications of these causes for interpreting prolactin results are reviewed.

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: a case report [^112HLeKN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Arginine vasopressin deficiency, also known as central diabetes insipidus, is characterized by a reduction in the release of arginine vasopressin (AVP), leading to varying degrees of polyuria. Partial empty sella refers to an enlarged sella turcica that is not completely filled by the pituitary gland. It can be primary or secondary, with manifestations ranging from asymptomatic cases to isolated dysfunctions of the posterior pituitary, anterior pituitary, or both. Diabetes insipidus caused by a partially empty sella is rare.

- **Case presentation**: The patient, an 18-year-old Ethiopian woman, presented with a long-standing headache, increased urination, increased thirst, absence of menses, and weight loss. Urine and serum osmolality tests were conducted, suggesting diabetes insipidus. Further workup, including brain magnetic resonance imaging, revealed a partially empty sella.

- **Conclusion**: Diabetes insipidus secondary to a partially empty sella is uncommon. In patients presenting with headaches and anterior or posterior pituitary dysfunction, empty sella should be considered, whether partial or complete.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115nNKxC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Follow-up testing of the pituitary incidentaloma**:

- **Patients with incidentalomas**: Those who do not meet criteria for surgical removal of the tumor should receive nonsurgical follow-up with clinical assessments and the following tests:

	- **MRI scan**: An MRI scan of the pituitary should be conducted 6 months after the initial scan if the incidentaloma is a macroincidentaloma and 1 year after the initial scan if it is a microincidentaloma. In patients whose incidentaloma does not change in size, repeating the MRI every year for macroincidentalomas and every 1–2 years for microincidentalomas is suggested for the following 3 years, and then gradually less frequently thereafter.

	- **VF testing**: Perform VF testing in patients with a pituitary incidentaloma that enlarges to abut or compress the optic nerves or chiasm on a follow-up imaging study. VF testing is not necessary for patients whose incidentalomas are not close to the chiasm, have no new symptoms, and are being followed closely by MRI.

	- **Clinical and biochemical evaluations**: Conduct evaluations for hypopituitarism 6 months after the initial testing and yearly thereafter in patients with a pituitary macroincidentaloma, although hypopituitarism typically develops when there is an increase in the size of the incidentaloma. Testing for hypopituitarism is not necessary for patients with pituitary microincidentalomas whose clinical picture, history, and MRI do not change over time.

### Pituitary tumors in MEN1: Do not be misled by borderline elevated prolactin levels [^1127ucW8]. Pituitary (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this case report is to demonstrate that the simple expedient of periodically measuring prolactin levels in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) who have modest hyperprolactinemia and normal pituitary MRI scans is insufficient to monitor for the development of pituitary adenomas.

- **Methods**: Review of relevant literature and chart review.

- **Results**: A 25-year-old man with known MEN1, manifested by hyperparathyroidism and a gastrin-producing neuroendocrine tumor, was found to have a prolactin (PRL) level of 20.0 ng/mL (reference range: 1.6–16 ng/mL) but a normal pituitary MRI scan. The impression then was that he had a prolactinoma too small to be visualized on the MRI. Over the next 3.5 years, his PRL levels remained in this mildly elevated range, but he then presented with severe headaches and visual field defects. An MRI showed a 3.1 × 1.7 × 1.9 cm pituitary adenoma with compression of the optic chiasm and invasion of the left cavernous sinus. Surgery revealed a gonadotroph adenoma, and he subsequently required gamma knife radiotherapy for the residual tumor. Postoperative PRL levels were normal.

- **Conclusions**: Small, intrasellar microadenomas may be associated with elevated PRL levels due to possible direct hormone production (prolactinoma) or possibly to interference with portal vessel blood flow. In monitoring hyperprolactinemic MEN1 patients for the development of pituitary adenomas, measuring PRL levels is insufficient; periodic MRI scans are necessary at a more frequent interval than every 3–5 years. This may also pertain to patients with "idiopathic" hyperprolactinemia.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113DNtHx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, specifically concerning watchful waiting, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining more frequent or detailed evaluations as clinically indicated in patients who develop any signs or symptoms potentially related to the incidentaloma, or who show an increase in the size of the incidentaloma on MRI.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114yj6UT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for amenorrhea, specifically concerning the management of hyperprolactinemia through medical therapy, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend considering the tapering and eventual discontinuation of dopamine agonist therapy. This should be done with careful clinical and biochemical follow-up in patients who have been treated for at least two years, who no longer have elevated serum prolactin levels, and who do not have a visible tumor remnant on MRI.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117AMu8k]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Indications for surgical therapy of the pituitary incidentaloma**: We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma be referred for surgery if they have the following conditions:
	- A visual field (VF) deficit due to the lesion.
	- Other visual abnormalities, such as ophthalmoplegia or neurological compromise due to compression by the lesion.
	- Lesion abutting or compressing the optic nerves or chiasm on MRI.
	- Pituitary apoplexy with visual disturbance.
	- Hypersecreting tumors other than prolactinomas as recommended by other guidelines of The Endocrine Society and The Pituitary Society.

We suggest that surgery be considered for patients with a pituitary incidentaloma if they have the following conditions:
	- Clinically significant growth of the pituitary incidentaloma.
	- Loss of endocrinological function.
	- A lesion close to the optic chiasm and a plan to become pregnant.
	- Unremitting headache.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115oNMXV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Summary of recommendations**:

1.0 Initial evaluation of a patient with a pituitary incidentaloma

- **Complete history and physical examination**: We recommend that patients presenting with a pituitary incidentaloma undergo a complete history and physical examination. This should include evaluations for evidence of hypopituitarism and a hormone hypersecretion syndrome. Patients with evidence of either of these conditions should undergo an appropriately directed biochemical evaluation.

- **Hormone hypersecretion evaluation**: We recommend that all patients with a pituitary incidentaloma, including those without symptoms, undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations for hormone hypersecretion.

- **Hypopituitarism evaluation**: We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma, with or without symptoms, also undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations for hypopituitarism.

- **Visual field examination**: We recommend that all patients presenting with a pituitary incidentaloma abutting the optic nerves or chiasm on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) undergo a formal visual field (VF) examination.

- **MRI scan**: We recommend that all patients have a MRI scan, if possible, to evaluate the pituitary incidentaloma. This is recommended particularly if the incidentaloma was initially only diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan, to better delineate the nature and extent of the incidentaloma.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^115QR1a7]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The findings of the study denote primary empty sella syndrome (PES) to be more than an incidental finding since a high prevalence of co-existing endocrine abnormalities was found. Most cases are not properly evaluated by non-endocrinologists due to the lack of appropriate loop feedback from the primary gland to the pituitary, which is a part of the normal physiological response to the absence of primary gland function. This makes it difficult and challenging for non-endocrinologists to recognize these abnormalities in different axes based on the available normal range values of hormones. The lack of referral to endocrinologists and gross under-evaluation of hormonal assessment point towards poor clinical management and the risk of not replacing the deficit hormones. This is our main concern, with considerable clinical implications.

- **Clinical implications**: Clinical implications of the present study include concerns regarding not referring the suspected cases to experts in the field of endocrinology for further diagnosis and management. There is a substantial need for the formulation of a standard protocol for diagnosis and follow-up by a multi-disciplinary team of experts, involving ophthalmologists and neurologists in addition to endocrinologists, advocated for the holistic management of PES, hormonal dysfunction, and all abnormalities related to it.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1111aFv6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Values and preferences**: The recommendations for screening for hypersecretion needed to balance the potential benefits of early detection with the relatively low likelihood of finding certain abnormalities in a given patient, as well as the costs and burden of potentially unnecessary testing. Screening for certain hormone hypersecretion syndromes was considered important, even if the patient was asymptomatic or if the abnormality was unlikely in the patient population. Screening for hyperprolactinemia was considered essential because of the potential for successful treatment with an oral dopamine agonist. Screening for GH excess with a serum IGF-I level was recommended because early detection of a GH-secreting tumor, which would likely be asymptomatic, could reduce long-term morbidity and increase the likelihood of surgical cure. Some consider screening also for glucocorticoid excess in all patients, but others may limit screening to patients for whom there is a clinical suspicion, due to the high false-positive rate and low rate of true-positive testing in the former group of patients.

- **Remarks**: The pros and cons of detailed vs. limited screening for hypersecretion syndromes (other than for prolactinoma) were debated, and the Task Force was split on this point. The quality of evidence for, or against one particular testing strategy was weak.

- **Recommendation**: We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma with or without symptoms also undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations for hypopituitarism (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

### Pituitary incidentaloma: A Pituitary Society international consensus guideline statement [^112HyemM]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

This Pituitary Society Consensus article presents an evidence-based consensus on the management of pituitary incidentaloma, defined as an unexpected sellar or parasellar finding incidentally discovered on an imaging study that was not performed for a clinically suspected pituitary lesion. Recommendations are offered for when endocrinology, neurosurgery, and ophthalmology consultation, dedicated pituitary imaging, pituitary hormone testing, and visual assessment are warranted for macroadenomas, microadenomas, cystic lesions, and empty sella, as well as when surgical resection is indicated for incidental pituitary adenomas and cystic sellar lesions.

Special considerations in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, children and adolescents, older people, and pregnant women are addressed. The Consensus workshop concluded that diagnostic and management approaches should be individualized to the specific clinical context of an incidentally discovered pituitary lesion. Consultation with a multidisciplinary pituitary tumour centre of excellence should be considered in the presence of new or deteriorating lesion-specific signs or symptoms, particularly when surgical or other adjuvant interventions are being considered and when there is uncertainty about the most appropriate subsequent management.

### Long-term follow-up of a large prospective cohort of patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas: The outcome of a conservative management policy [^115QqSdW]. Clinical endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

To assess the clinical outcome of a strategy of conservative monitoring of patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) after pituitary surgery and in patients without surgery, a retrospective study of outcomes was conducted using a clinical information system.

- **Patients**: An unselected clinical series of patients seen in a single center between 1989 and 2015.

- **Measurements**: Review of clinical information system data was done to obtain details and dates of surgery, radiotherapy, pituitary imaging, and outcomes.

- **Results**: We identified 190 cases of NFPA. Trans-sphenoidal surgery (TSS) had been performed as primary therapy in 132 cases (all macro-adenomas). At a mean 7.6-year follow-up after TSS without immediate pituitary radiotherapy, recurrence occurred in 10.7% of cases with no visible postoperative residual adenoma, 38.8% with intrasellar, and 66.7% with extrasellar residuum. Recurrence was defined as the growth of residual tumor requiring intervention. On survival analysis, at 10 years, recurrence-free survival was 75% in patients with no residual tumor and 40% with intrasellar residuum. Recurrence occurred in 12.5% of 24 patients who had received postoperative radiotherapy. Patients were monitored conservatively without initial surgery in 65 patients. After a mean of 5-year monitoring, only 20% required intervention during follow-up (18.5% TSS), and 30.8% died of nonpituitary causes during follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: This study suggests that a conservative approach may be safe and appropriate in patients with NFPA if followed up with appropriate imaging surveillance.

### Clinical profile and long-term follow-up of children and adolescents with prolactinomas [^114ag4yu]. Pituitary (2009). Low credibility.

We report the clinical presentation, response to medical treatment, and long-term follow-up of 39 children and adolescents with prolactinoma (female:male ratio; 30:9) (30 macroadenomas and 9 microadenomas) diagnosed at the ages of 9–20 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 56 months. All patients were treated with bromocriptine (BC) at doses ranging from 2.5 to 20 mg/day or cabergoline at doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg/week orally. Two patients received external conventional radiotherapy after surgery.

In patients with macroprolactinoma (female:male ratio; 21:9), headache and/or visual defects were the first symptoms. All females had primary or secondary amenorrhea. Growth arrest was not observed in any patient, and pubertal development was appropriate for their age. Spontaneous or provocative galactorrhea was observed in 23 patients (all females), and none of the male patients had gynecomastia.

The mean serum prolactin (PRL) concentration at the time of diagnosis was 322.50 ng/ml in patients with microadenoma, 522.38 ng/ml in patients with macroadenoma, and 2,294.86 ng/ml in patients with macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. In 25 patients, BC normalized PRL levels and caused variable, but significant, tumor shrinkage. Cabergoline normalized PRL concentrations in 14 patients. Pregnancy occurred in 6 patients while on treatment, with pregnancies being uncomplicated. The patients delivered normal newborns at term. Impairment of other pituitary hormone secretion was documented at the time of diagnosis in only one patient. Postoperatively, six patients had other pituitary hormone deficiencies.

In conclusion, these findings suggest that medical treatment is effective for this patient population.

### Approach to the patient with prolactinoma [^116wUjWG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

In December 2009, a 26-year-old woman was referred to endocrinological consultation for infertility. Her medical history revealed oligo-amenorrhea and mild hirsutism (Ferriman–Gallway score = 9) over the past 10 years, associated with progressive weight gain in the past 3 years. Gynecological ultrasounds performed over several years showed the ovaries had a multifollicular appearance, with no clear evidence of polycystic ovary syndrome. Hormonal assessment revealed normal androgen levels but mild hyperprolactinemia (up to 36 µg/L; normal range, 5–25 µg/L). The patient was treated with oral contraceptives for 2 years, from 2004 to 2006, with a rapid relapse of the clinical syndrome upon withdrawal of the contraceptives.

At the first endocrinological assessment, the patient reported amenorrhea over the past 9 months, headaches, and moderate hyperprolactinemia (PRL, 126.7 µg/L). A pituitary MRI scan revealed a microadenoma with a maximal diameter of 8 mm. The patient's facial characteristics — prominent frontal and zygomatic bones, enlarged nose, and mandibular prognathism — were suggestive of concomitant GH hypersecretion. However, GH and IGF-I levels were within the normal range (GH, 0.3 µg/L; IGF-I, 206 µg/L). The diagnosis of pituitary microadenoma with hyperprolactinemia was confirmed, and cabergoline therapy was initiated at a dose of 0.5 mg per week. The clinical course was indolent over the years, and the response to cabergoline was optimal, with complete PRL normalization (PRL, 18 µg/L) and a 50% reduction in the microadenoma size.

### Normal pituitary hypertrophy as a frequent cause of pituitary incidentaloma: a follow-up study [^113r2dFD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Enlargement of the pituitary gland is a frequent cause of incidentaloma and referrals to endocrinologists for hormonal evaluation and therapeutic advice. In neuroradiological series, 25–50% of healthy women aged 18–35 years have a convex superior pituitary contour, but pituitary height exceeds 9 mm in less than 0.5% of cases. This study was performed to provide thorough clinical and hormonal data, along with long-term endocrinological and imaging follow-up data on subjects with incidentally discovered pituitary hypertrophy (height > 9 mm).

Seven eugonadal nulliparous women, aged 15–27 years, referred between 1989 and 1998 with incidentally diagnosed pituitary gland enlargement (height > 9 mm) and a suspected pituitary tumor, were studied. At presentation and at yearly intervals, prolactin (PRL) plasma levels and corticotropic, somatotropic, and thyrotropic pituitary function were measured. Pituitary dimensions and signal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), before and after intravenous gadolinium-diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid injection, were assessed. PRL plasma levels were normal, and corticotropic, somatotropic, and thyrotropic pituitary function was considered normal in all cases.

In all the women, the upper boundary of the pituitary was convex on MRI and touched the optic chiasm in four cases. The width and anteroposterior diameter of the gland were normal. The pituitary itself appeared normal, with a homogeneous signal on plain and dynamic studies with intravenous contrast injection. Despite normal initial hormone values, two women underwent surgery by the transsphenoidal approach.

### A comprehensive review of empty sella and empty sella syndrome [^117LhtCB]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Incidental radiographic findings of an empty sella are prevalent in up to 35% of the general population. While empty sella was initially considered clinically insignificant, a subset of patients exhibits endocrine or neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations which are diagnostic of empty sella syndrome (ESS). Recent studies suggest that more patients are affected by ESS than previously recognized, necessitating a deeper understanding of this condition. This comprehensive review describes a practical approach to evaluating and managing ESS.

- **Methods**: Literature review was conducted on etiologies and risk factors associated with primary and secondary empty sella, the radiologic features that differentiate empty sella from other sellar lesions, and the role of clinical history and hormone testing in identifying patients with ESS, as well as treatment modalities.

- **Results**: Pituitary function testing for somatotroph, lactotroph, gonadotroph, corticotroph, and thyrotroph abnormalities is necessary when suspecting ESS. While an isolated empty sella finding does not require treatment, ESS may require pharmacologic or surgical interventions to address hormone deficits or intracranial hypertension. Targeted hormone replacement as directed by the endocrinologist should align with guidelines and patient-specific needs. Treatment may involve a multidisciplinary collaboration with neurology, neurosurgery, or ophthalmology to address patient symptoms.

- **Conclusion**: This review underscores the evolving understanding of ESS, stressing the significance of accurate diagnosis and tailored interventions.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114z6gzx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, specifically in the context of watchful waiting, the Endocrine Society's 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining an MRI of the pituitary 6 months after the initial imaging if the incidentaloma is a macroincidentaloma and 1 year after the initial imaging if it is a microincidentaloma. If the incidentaloma does not change in size, consider repeating the MRI every year for macroincidentalomas and every 1–2 years for microincidentalomas for the following 3 years, and gradually less frequently thereafter.

### Endocrine disturbances in empty sella syndrome: Case reports and review of literature [^116g4An8]. Endocrine Practice (2005). Low credibility.

To report five cases of empty sella syndrome (ESS) manifesting with various degrees of pituitary dysfunction, we describe the initial manifestations in five patients with primary ESS. This is compared with previous cases of ESS reported in the English language literature.

A review of our recent medical records identified five patients referred for evaluation of pituitary deficiencies in whom ESS was diagnosed. Glucocorticoid replacement was required in three patients, two of whom initially presented with symptoms of severe glucocorticoid deficiency. In each case, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated an empty sella.

Our cases suggest that endocrine abnormalities are not rare as the initial manifestation of ESS. Contrary to many studies in the literature, these endocrine abnormalities may be quite severe.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: A retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^112DbCsS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Once considered a rare disorder, the diagnosis of primary empty sella syndrome (PES) has been increasing, as it is primarily regarded as an incidental finding on brain imaging scans like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), predominantly, computed tomography (CT), or rarely plain X-ray. However, very often the patient may present with various symptoms attributed to PES in the absence of any other likely causation. The clinical significance related to the incidental finding is ambiguous, and some studies elucidate it to be more than a mere incidental finding. Several isolated case reports and case series have been published over the last three decades, with statistics collectively compiled from single-center or multicenter retrospective studies reporting prevalence as low as 2.3% to as high as 38% in autopsy studies, with a large predominance in the female gender.

Studies from the Saudi Arabian region are scant, except for a report from the western region documenting a brief description of 537 patients with PES without exploring further details on clinical significance, symptoms, and hormonal assessments. Moreover, no specific guidelines or recommendations exist in the diagnosis and management of PES, resulting in most cases being managed without a referral to an endocrinologist. However, experts in the field have advised endocrine assessment even for asymptomatic cases and a multi-disciplinary approach in the management of PES. The objective of the present study is to report a 10-year retrospective review of primary empty sella from a single-center registry, aiming to determine the epidemiology.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: A retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^116DEdix]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Primary Empty Sella (PES) syndrome is an increasingly common disorder, mostly diagnosed as an incidental finding during brain imaging scans. We intended to review the clinical management and hormonal profile of patients with PES.

- **Methods**: The study included a ten-year retrospective analysis of a registry containing PES cases from 2007 to 2017, collected from a single tertiary care center. The keyword 'primary empty sella' was used to retrieve patient details from the radiology unit. The clinical and biochemical profile of PES patients was analyzed. Additionally, the case management of PES patients and their rate of referral to endocrinologists was explored.

- **Results**: The registry had 765 cases with a male-to-female ratio of 1:3.8, indicating a female predominance by almost four times. Although not significant, the onset of the disease was earlier for males (Mean ± standard deviation (SD): 46.7 years ± 17.3 vs. 48.8 years ± 14.1, p = 0.110). Nearly 79% of the cases were discovered incidentally during Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Of the total PES cases, only 20% were referred to endocrinologists; the rest were managed by general physicians. Only 1–2.5% of the cases were evaluated for gonadal, growth, and adrenal hormones by the general physicians. The hormonal evaluation by endocrinologists was also found to be sub-optimal. Headache and visual disturbances were the most common presenting complaints, followed by menstrual abnormalities. Endocrine abnormalities such as thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, hypogonadism, and hypocortisolism were highly prevalent among those assessed.

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: a case report [^114Jigy6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is a rare presentation in patients with partial empty sella, despite the association of an empty sella with other pituitary hormone abnormalities. The neurohypophysis is protected from excessive injury compared to the anterior pituitary due to the specific anatomical difference between the anterior and posterior pituitary. In particular, the vascular supply in the neurohypophysis has an anastomotic ring along the infundibular process from the medial and lateral arteries of the inferior hypophyseal arteries. This may be the reason why posterior pituitary involvement is less common than anterior pituitary involvement.

There is limited literature on arginine vasopressin deficiency associated with empty sella. The first of these was published in 1973 and described a 43-year-old woman with diabetes insipidus and postpartum galactorrhoea. Marano et al. described a posterior empty sella in two children with central diabetes insipidus. In our patient, the anterior pituitary hormone function tests were all normal. She presented as a case of posterior pituitary deficiency and empty sella. The association could be coincidental.

Lambert et al. have also described a similar case but with both anterior and posterior pituitary dysfunction. They hypothesized that an empty sella may be due to necrosis of a previous pituitary adenoma, most commonly a prolactinoma, but again in our patient, we did not suspect this from the clinical presentation as the prolactin level was normal and the involvement was exclusively posterior pituitary.

### Long-term follow-up of 84 patients with giant prolactinomas-a Swedish nationwide study [^111KmdPr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Overall response to treatment

The median follow-up after diagnosis was 9 years (IQR 4–15). At the last follow-up, the median serum PRL was 12 µg/L (IQR 4–126), with a median decrease in PRL of 99% (IQR 98–100) from diagnosis (P < .001). Forty-six patients (55%) had normalized PRL, and 54 (64%) had a PRL level < 2× ULN, with no difference between sexes (P = 1.0 and P = 0.48, respectively). At the last follow-up, the median maximum tumor diameter had decreased to 22 mm (IQR 3–40), with a median tumor diameter reduction of 50% (IQR 23–94) (P < .001). Tumor response was reported in 58 patients (69%), of whom 16 had complete tumor regression on MRI. Tumor enlargement was observed in 1 patient. A combined response occurred in 36 patients (43%).

In 49 patients with VFD at diagnosis and available follow-up data, an improvement was observed in 82% of the patients (n = 40), no change in 14% (n = 7), and deterioration in 4% (n = 2). Among 33 patients with reduced visual acuity at diagnosis, the corresponding percentages were 73% (n = 24), 21% (n = 7), and 6% (n = 2), respectively.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113aWSPq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The proposed algorithms for the MRI follow-up of pituitary incidentalomas took into account those adopted in prior studies. However, these algorithms varied considerably from study to study, and none was validated, so the imaging follow-up proposed in this guideline incorporated the experiences of the Task Force's members. Follow-up MRI scans were recommended for macroincidentalomas because it has been demonstrated that, although generally these lesions grow slowly, some do enlarge and become symptomatic. In data combined from several studies, macroincidentalomas enlarged in 85 of 353 (24%) patients.

- **VF abnormalities**: Developed in 28 (8%) patients over time, indicating that the enlargement adversely affected the patient's health.
- **Pituitary apoplexy**: Developed in seven of 353 (2%) patients, most of whom developed permanent hypopituitarism, and one had permanent vision impairment.

In a meta-analysis of these studies, 8.2% of incidentalomas enlarged per year with a follow-up of 472 person-years. Less frequent surveillance of microincidentalomas was recommended because their rate of enlargement was low, being reported in 17 of 160 patients (10.6%) followed from 2.3 to 7 years. In the meta-analysis, 1.7% of microincidentalomas enlarged per year. Importantly, none of the patients with these microincidentalomas developed new VF abnormalities that would have necessitated surgery.

### Does pituitary compression/empty sella syndrome contribute to MRI-negative Cushing's disease? A single-institution experience [^116KwSmq]. Neurosurgical Focus (2020). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease arises from functioning adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas. These tumors can be very small and evade detection by MRI. Empty sella syndrome is a phenomenon in which an arachnoid outpouching of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the sella leads to compression of the pituitary, likely due to intracranial hypertension — a common issue in Cushing's disease. This compression may further complicate the visualization of the pituitary gland on MRI, contributing to the difficulty in identifying a tumor, hence the term MRI-negative Cushing's disease. The authors aimed to examine the association between empty sella syndrome and MRI-negative Cushing's disease.

A single-institution database of Cushing's disease cases from 2000 to 2017 was reviewed, including 197 cases in the analysis. Among these, 180 patients had a tissue diagnosis of Cushing's disease, and 17 achieved remission through surgery but without a definitive tissue diagnosis. Macroadenomas (tumors > 1 cm) were excluded from the study. The degree of empty sella syndrome was assessed based on the extent of CSF visualized in the sella on midline sagittal T1-weighted MRI.

Of the 197 identified cases, 40 (20%) exhibited MRI-negative disease, while empty sella syndrome was present in 49 cases (25%). MRI-negative disease was observed in 18 (37%) of 49 cases with empty sella syndrome, compared to 22 (15%) of 148 cases without empty sella syndrome. The presence of empty sella syndrome was significantly associated with MRI-negative disease (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.61–6.74, p = 0.0018). Decreased thickness of the pituitary gland was also associated with the condition.

### Ten-year follow-up of a giant prolactinoma [^111KCRbd]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Giant prolactinomas are rare pituitary tumors, and their management can be challenging. A 28-year-old man presented with headaches, visual impairment, and behavioral changes. Clinically, the patient was found to have hypogonadism and bitemporal hemianopsia. An MRI demonstrated a pituitary tumor 76 mm in diameter, and blood tests revealed a serum prolactin level of 158,700 µU/mL (reference range 58–254). Initially, a craniotomy was performed. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor identified a prolactinoma with a high proliferative index, and the patient was started on treatment with a dopamine agonist. A year later, neurological symptoms worsened due to the regrowth of the lesion's cystic component, necessitating further surgery. After 10 years of treatment with dopamine agonists, the prolactin levels decreased by 96.8%, there was an effective reduction in tumor size, and the neurological signs and symptoms resolved.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112o9XQJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Although silent somatotroph-secreting tumors are rare, evaluation for this possibility is recommended. In a prospective study, one of 11 macroincidentalomas was found to have an elevated IGF-I, consistent with subclinical GH excess. In another study, two out of 13 surgically removed incidentalomas were positive for GH on immunohistochemistry. A series of 3,048 autopsies reported 334 pituitary adenomas, of which 1.8% stained positive for GH. Because the initial treatment for a GH-secreting tumor is surgery, and GH-secreting microadenomas can often be cured surgically, screening for a GH-secreting tumor by measuring the IGF-I level is warranted. If elevated, further evaluation for GH excess is suggested.

Screening for glucocorticoid excess due to a possible corticotroph tumor may also be considered when suspected clinically. In the series of 3,048 autopsies, 13.8% of 334 pituitary adenomas stained positive for ACTH. Although no systematic screening of incidentalomas for subclinical glucocorticoid excess has been reported, patients with adrenal incidentalomas may have Cushing's syndrome-associated morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity and osteoporosis. Therefore, in patients with pituitary incidentalomas and a clinical suspicion for glucocorticoid excess, laboratory screening is suggested. Detection of subclinical hypercortisolism should be followed by evaluation for possible Cushing's disease.

### What is the natural history of nonoperated nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas [^111Hrjin]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Series of patients systematically investigating the outcome of clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFAs) not treated by surgery or radiotherapy during long follow-up periods are limited. Most reports involve the follow-up of selected cases of incidentally found lesions, rendering their results unreliable on the assessment of the pros and cons of a 'watch and wait' policy.

- **Objective**: To investigate the outcome of a series of consecutive patients with presumed NFA (microadenoma or macroadenoma), who were not offered treatment at presentation (for a number of reasons) and were regularly followed up, and to identify possible factors predicting subsequent increase in tumour size.

- **Patients and methods**: All patients presenting to the Department of Endocrinology in Oxford between 1989 and 2005 with presumed NFA were studied retrospectively. Inclusion criteria were: (i) imaging features suggestive of a pituitary adenoma, (ii) no clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hormonal hypersecretion by the tumour, (iii) monitoring being the initial choice of management, and (iv) at least one repeat scan during the follow-up period. Subjects presenting with acute apoplexy were excluded. Follow-up management included clinical evaluation, assessment of visual acuity and fields, and imaging at regular intervals. The duration of observation was estimated from the dates of first and last scan.

- **Results**: Forty subjects were included in the study [18 males/22 females, median age 52 years (range 18–89), 16 with microadenoma/24 with macroadenoma]. The mean follow-up period

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: A case report [^112xRkMD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

About 29.6% of patients had arginine vasopressin deficiency in a series of patients with Sheehan's syndrome; all of these patients had an increased thirst threshold. Our patient has no history of pregnancy and does not have Sheehan's syndrome. The presentation of central diabetes insipidus in this patient is due to a primary partial empty sella.

The prevalence of migraine headaches is higher in women, with a ratio of 3 to 1. This may have contributed to the higher prevalence of incidental partial empty sella in this population, as they may be exposed to neuroimaging modalities that diagnose and detect asymptomatic (and clinically silent) partial empty sella. In our case, the patient is a female with a four-year history of intermittent severe headaches that have worsened in the last two years, which is similar to other studies and case reports.

This patient had a classic presentation of central diabetes insipidus and amenorrhea of four years' duration, possibly caused by her significant weight loss. Hormonal analysis showed normal levels of cortisol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, thyroid function test, and prolactin. Her initial urine specific gravity was low (1.005), corresponding to diluted urine with an osmolarity of 150 mosmol/L. Only urine osmolality above 700 mOsm/kg excludes diabetes insipidus. Her serum sodium concentration is also in the higher part of the reference range, which is more suggestive of diabetes insipidus. After the overnight water deprivation test, the serum osmolality increased to 298 mOsm/kg, and the urine osmo

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113KpDLA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyperprolactinemia, specifically concerning serum prolactin levels, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend performing serial dilution of serum samples. This helps eliminate an artifact that can occur with some immunoradiometric assays, leading to a falsely low prolactin value ("hook effect") in patients who have a discrepancy between a very large pituitary tumor and a mildly elevated prolactin level.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111SM5Pt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

**Evidence**: The evidence for, or against a recommendation for surgery because of the growth of a pituitary incidentaloma is limited. Surgery is suggested for incidentalomas that demonstrate clinically significant growth on follow-up imaging studies, which could pose a health risk to the patient, such as affecting their vision. Such growing incidentalomas typically continue to grow, and surgery is most effective for smaller lesions. A specific size cutoff for the incidentaloma is not considered a requirement for surgery because some large incidentalomas are predominantly intra- and infrasellar. Although there are no established changes in size or growth rate that would automatically trigger the need for surgery, the pattern of growth of the incidentaloma is considered more important. For example, a 1-mm enlargement within the sella of a 5-mm intrasellar microadenoma is not clinically significant, but a 1-mm enlargement toward the chiasm in a lesion only 3 mm from the chiasm would be significant. Therefore, incidentalomas exhibiting significant growth (including growth that is rapid, occurring over a 1- to 2-year period, and/or that is toward the optic chiasm and, if continued, could threaten vision in the near future) should be considered for surgery before the incidentaloma progresses to abut the chiasm or produce visual deficits. Consideration of the clinical characteristics of the patient, including their age and other risks for surgery, needs to be incorporated into the decision to proceed to surgery.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1117P25b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The recommendations for surgical therapy of a pituitary incidentaloma were based on the Task Force's expectations for outcome and improvements in vision and endocrine function. These expectations were based on known literature and Task Force members' clinical experience with surgery performed by a surgeon experienced in transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. The success of surgery for hormone-secreting tumors is highly dependent on the expertise, skill, and case volume of a pituitary surgeon supported by an experienced team. This is likely to also be true for pituitary surgery of other types of lesions. The availability of such a pituitary surgeon needs to be considered when following these guidelines.

- **Recommendation**: We suggest that surgery be considered for patients with a pituitary incidentaloma if they have the following:
	- Clinically significant growth of the pituitary incidentaloma
	- Loss of endocrinological function
	- A lesion close to the optic chiasm and a plan to become pregnant
	- Unremitting headache

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: A retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^1161Uwcr]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Empty sella (ES) is a rare pituitary condition often characterized by the herniated appearance of the pituitary gland, which appears flattened with partial or complete filling of the sella turcica space by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although termed 'empty', the pituitary may still function normally. The severity of the syndrome depends on the absence of one or more pituitary hormones due to the extent of involvement of the pituitary stalk.

The empty sella is categorized as primary empty sella (PES) or secondary empty sella based on etiology. The etiology is mostly unclear, although many hypotheses have been proposed. The congenital absence of the diaphragm sellae is the only established etiology for PES, while other causes may include relative changes in intracranial pressure from CSF. Secondary empty sella may result from causes such as traumatic factors, side effects of radiotherapy and drugs, infections and necrosis, pituitary tumors, or even autoimmune-related factors. Although the term was first coined by Busch in 1951, Schaeffer, in 1924, first observed this condition in 125 patients and described the radiological variations from dense to a small peripheral rim of the sellar space.

In general, the etiology of empty sella is not clear, and many hypotheses have been studied. The cause of empty sella is either primary (idiopathic), most likely related to a congenital defect in the diaphragmatic sella, or secondary (acquired) due to factors like pituitary surgery, radiation, and pituitary apoplexy. The most common clinical presentation of empty sella syndrome is…

Patients who develop any signs or symptoms potentially related to the incidentaloma or who show an increase in size of the incidentaloma on MRI should undergo more frequent or detailed evaluations as indicated clinically.

- **Indications for surgical therapy of the pituitary incidentaloma**: We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma be referred for surgery if they have the following:
	- A VF deficit due to the lesion.
	- Other visual abnormalities, such as ophthalmoplegia or neurological compromise due to compression by the lesion.
	- Lesion abutting or compressing the optic nerves or chiasm on MRI.
	- Pituitary apoplexy with visual disturbance.
	- Hypersecreting tumors other than prolactinomas as recommended by other guidelines of The Endocrine Society and The Pituitary Society.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115Kc1Rc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Evidence**: The goals of the endocrine evaluation of pituitary incidentalomas are to identify hormone hypersecretion and hypopituitarism. The recommendations for the evaluation of pituitary function considered the likelihood of an abnormality in a given patient. However, valid estimates of the pretest probability of an abnormal test of pituitary function could not be definitively determined because literature on this topic is sparse. Therefore, recommendations for the evaluation relied heavily on clinical experience.

Data on the prevalence of hormone hypersecretion in patients with an incidentaloma are available from small observational studies (most retrospective) and estimated from autopsy data. Screening for hypersecretion is important to perform because the prevalence of clinically evident pituitary adenomas has recently been appreciated to be as high as 1/1000 in a Belgian population, and 0.776/1000 (of which 0.542/1000 were hormone-secreting) in a region of the United Kingdom, or as low as 0.04/1000 in Finland. The incidence of incidentally discovered pituitary adenomas was recently reported as 0.016/1000 in a retrospective review from Finland.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^111jv7TU]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The present study analyzed the clinical presentation and management of PES patients. The clinical picture of patients with PES is quite intricate due to the involvement of the extent of hormones from none to all. Since the causation mechanism is not established, it is not clear if the symptoms are due to PES or coincidental. There is extreme variation in the prevalence of endocrine abnormalities reported with PES ranging from normal pituitary function to certain grades of pituitary dysfunction, depending on the pituitary stalk compression by CSF or intracranial hypertension.

Except for a few comprehensive reviews reporting the clinical diagnosis and management, there are no standard guidelines available for the diagnosis and management of PES. This has resulted in case-handling by non-endocrinologists and under-evaluation of hormones. Primary empty sella syndrome (PES) is considered one of the causes of hypopituitarism.

Structural causes of hypopituitarism like pituitary adenoma, pituitary abscess, apoplexy, and traumatic brain injury are associated with a sequential pattern of hormonal deficiencies. Usually, the development of hypopituitarism occurs in a sequence of loss of function of the somatotrophic axis, subsequently followed by gonadotrophin, thyrotrophic, and finally corticotrophic axis, due to the anatomical location of the somatotropic, gonadotropic, thyrotropic, and corticotropic cells, respectively. Whether this sequence is respected in empty sella or not is uncertain. Usually, low IGF-1 levels are the first sign of hypopituitarism.

### Is a stable or decreasing prolactin level in a patient with prolactinoma a surrogate marker for lack of tumor growth [^112N5pvQ]. Pituitary (2014). Low credibility.

The optimal interval for follow-up imaging of patients with prolactinomas is unclear. We aimed to determine the likelihood of tumor enlargement in patients with prolactinomas who have a stable or reduced prolactin (PRL) level over time, irrespective of treatment with a dopamine agonist (DA). We identified 80 patients with prolactinomas (34 men, 46 women) who had at least two paired sets of serum PRL levels and pituitary MRIs, 3 or more months apart. Patients with hyperprolactinemia due to drug or stalk effects were excluded. The median age was 45 years, with a range of 25 to 77 years.

Sixty-three patients (78.8%) were treated with DA. PRL levels (ng/mL) at the initial and latest sets were 114 (range: 0.3–15,732) and 16 (range: 0.3–1,204), respectively. In patients with identifiable tumors, the maximum tumor diameters (mm) at the initial and latest MRI studies were both 12.5, with ranges of 2–60 and 2–39, respectively, over an interval of 2.9 years (range: 0.3–9.7). Sixty percent of patients (n = 48) had a macroadenoma.

- **Tumor outcomes**: Forty-two (52.5%) patients had either disappearance of the tumor (n = 22) or reduction (n = 20) in tumor size. In the remainder, tumor size was stable in 35 but increased in 3 patients. One of these patients, observed off therapy, had a concomitant rise in PRL level. The other 2 had evidence of pituitary hemorrhage with no PRL increase.

Tumor growth in prolactinoma patients with a stable or decreasing PRL level, regardless of size, is a rare event. Repetitive pituitary imaging in these patients may not be warranted.

The patient has no personal or family history of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, or heart disease. On examination, her vital signs are normal, and her body mass index is 16 kg/m². Axillary and pubic hair appeared normal, and there are no other significant findings. Her initial urine specific gravity was low at 1.005, with an initial random urine osmolality test of 150 mOsm/kg.

After an overnight water deprivation test, serum osmolality increased to 298 mOsm/kg; however, urine osmolality remained low at 210 mOsm/kg. The urine output during the water deprivation test was 3 L over 8 hours. Her urine specific gravity after the test was 1.006. An intravenous desmopressin challenge test was not conducted due to unavailability. Despite this, her symptoms significantly improved after starting a low dose of oral desmopressin, with her urine specific gravity normalizing to 1.020 during a follow-up visit. Her urine osmolality reached 600 mOsm/kg.

Serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) level was 1.2 mIU/mL (normal: < 5 mIU/mL), serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was 7 ng/mL (normal: 0 to 40 ng/mL), serum IgG4 level was 28 mg/dL (normal: < 140 mg/dL), and serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor was 203 U/mL (normal: 158–623 U/mL).

She had a normal chest x-ray. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed partial filling of the pituitary region.

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: a case report [^115zT5PF]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The pituitary gland is a structure that protrudes from the base of the brain at the sella turcica. In adults, it measures approximately 12 mm in transverse diameter and 8 mm in anterior-posterior diameter, weighing between 500 and 1000 milligrams. The pituitary gland consists of two distinct lobes: the anterior pituitary, or adenohypophysis, and the posterior pituitary, or neurohypophysis. The mature pituitary gland has a dual embryonic origin; the anterior and intermediate lobes are derived from the oral ectoderm, while the posterior pituitary originates from the neural ectoderm.

Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) is characterized by a decreased release of arginine vasopressin (AVP), also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in varying degrees of polyuria. It can be caused by disorders affecting one or more of the sites involved in AVP synthesis and secretion: the hypothalamic osmoreceptors, the supraoptic or paraventricular nuclei, or the superior part of the supraopticohypophyseal tract, but rarely by damage to the neurohypophysis.

Partial empty sella is defined as an enlarged sella turcica that is not completely filled by pituitary tissue, as seen by imaging. It is the loss of pituitary concavity while the gland still occupies more than 50% of the sella, with a thickness of ≥ 3 mm. In contrast, a complete empty sella is radiographically defined as a pituitary gland thickness of ≤ 2 mm, with more than 50% of the sella occupied by cerebrospinal fluid. If the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened, it cannot be seen on an MRI.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^112NhQrb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The overall hormonal assessment of the pituitary function in primary empty sella (PES) has been traditionally considered normal. However, many recent studies report growing evidence of impaired pituitary function. Pituitary insufficiency displays enormous variations, ranging from isolated hormone deficiency to complete deficiency like panhypopituitarism. The present study found a gross under-evaluation of the hormonal profile. In the overall sample, only 10% were assessed for luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), 8% for cortisol, 5% for testosterone, 2% for estradiol, and less than 1.3% were assessed for growth hormone. Thyroid and prolactin hormones were assessed slightly more frequently, at 40% and 14%, respectively. Although these latter two are the most prevalent endocrine abnormalities, case referral and hormonal assessment remain sub-optimal. The findings suggest that under-evaluation leads to under-reporting the prevalence of pituitary hormones insufficiency, which is of significant concern.

- **Endocrine dysfunction and clinical management of cases**: One principal finding of the study is the gross difference in the assessment of hormones and the prevalence of deficiencies between evaluations by general physicians and endocrinologists. Marked differences in the prevalence of hormonal deficiencies were observed concerning the gonadal axis and somatotrophic axis, followed by adrenal hormones and the thyrotrophic axis. These findings reflect the major consequences of poor referral and under-assessment of cases by general physicians.

### Serum prolactin overestimation and risk of misdiagnosis [^112gmSwi]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Falsely elevated prolactin measurements risk overdiagnosis, unnecessary imaging, and treatment. We conducted a clinical audit of 18 patients who presented with hyperprolactinaemia, followed by a laboratory audit of 40 split samples across a range of serum prolactin (5–5051 mIU/L). In each case (total n = 58), serum prolactin was measured on both Roche and Siemens platforms.

Serum prolactin as measured by Roche was higher than the corresponding Siemens value in every case, despite similar reference ranges. The mean discrepancy in serum prolactin by Roche versus Siemens was +81% in the clinical audit and +50% in the laboratory audit. This led to unnecessary interventions in 7 out of 18 patients (39%) in the clinical audit.

Serum prolactin is overestimated on the Roche relative to the Siemens platform. Laboratories should review Roche reference intervals for serum prolactin, and clinicians should consider repeating serum prolactin on another platform if the serum prolactin is incongruent with the clinical scenario.

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: A case report [^1142bMXK]. BMC endocrine disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Arginine vasopressin deficiency, or central diabetes insipidus, is defined as a reduction in the release of arginine vasopressin (AVP), resulting in a variable degree of polyuria. Partial empty sella refers to an enlarged sella turcica that is not completely filled by the pituitary gland. It can be either primary or secondary, with manifestations ranging from asymptomatic cases to isolated posterior pituitary, isolated anterior pituitary, or both anterior and posterior pituitary dysfunctions. Diabetes insipidus caused by a partially empty sella is rare.

- **Case presentation**: The patient, an 18-year-old Ethiopian woman, presented with a long-standing headache, increased urination, increased thirst, absence of menses, and weight loss. Urine and serum osmolality tests suggested diabetes insipidus. On further workup, brain magnetic resonance imaging was conducted, leading to the diagnosis of partially empty sella.

- **Conclusion**: Diabetes insipidus secondary to partially empty sella is uncommon. When patients present with headache and anterior or posterior pituitary dysfunction, empty sella should be considered, whether partial or complete.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1171T1Cy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Evidence**: The decision to recommend surgery as initial therapy for a patient with a pituitary incidentaloma needs to be individualized (Fig. 1). Few data are available that specifically examine the outcome of surgery for incidentalomas. Some of the evidence considered in developing the recommended criteria for surgery was from transsphenoidal surgical series of symptomatic and often large pituitary lesions. From these data and based on the clinical experiences of the Task Force members, it is clear that substantial evidence supports the need for surgery for pituitary incidentalomas causing visual or neurological compromise.

The presence of visual or neurological abnormalities due to compression of the optic nerves or chiasm by the incidentaloma is the strongest indication for surgery. Although the risks of not performing surgery on tumors that abut the chiasm, or those within certain proximity of the chiasm where no visual field (VF) abnormalities are present, have not been quantified, in the Task Force's experience, significant risk of future vision disturbance in these patients exists to warrant surgery. The age of the patient is also an important consideration. Surgery may be favored in younger versus older patients given the higher lifetime probability of tumor enlargement in the former and the greater risks of surgical intervention in the latter group of patients.

Some may elect to follow elderly patients with significant risks to surgery conservatively and closely for any deterioration in vision. The decision to recommend surgery should also consider whether future fertility is a concern.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acromegaly, particularly in the management of incomplete treatment response, ACC 2018 guidelines recommend individualizing treatment. This should be based on the presence or absence of clinically relevant residual tumor and impaired glucose tolerance if biochemical control is not achieved after administering the maximal dose of first-generation somatostatin receptor ligands.
