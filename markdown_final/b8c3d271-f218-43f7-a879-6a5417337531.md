## Question

contrainication of elliquis in LLA positive?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Eliquis (apixaban) is contraindicated in "LLA positive" patients, which I should interpret as lupus anticoagulant (LA) positive, likely in the context of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the terminology and whether "LLA" is indeed "LA" within APS. Then, I should verify what the regulatory labeling and safety communications say for apixaban and for the DOAC class in APS. Next, I will review the clinical evidence comparing DOACs versus warfarin in APS, paying special attention to triple-positive APS. After that, I need to check the laboratory interference of DOACs with LA assays and its implications for diagnosis and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and note nuances for isolated LA positivity without full APS criteria, along with any ongoing research that might modify current practice [^1155dUxX] [^1117udCQ].

> Let me first confirm the terminology. "LLA positive" almost certainly refers to "LA positive", i.e., lupus anticoagulant positivity, which is one of the three antiphospholipid antibodies used to classify APS alongside anticardiolipin and anti-β2-glycoprotein I, with triple-positivity conferring the highest thrombotic risk, recurrence risk, and treatment complexity [^1117udCQ].

> I should confirm what the labels and regulatory communications say. The U.S. apixaban label describes approved indications and major warnings but does not list APS or LA positivity as a labeled contraindication; however, FDA communications for another DOAC, dabigatran, specifically advise against DOAC use in triple-positive APS due to higher thrombotic event rates compared with warfarin, which is often extrapolated as a DOAC class concern and has been echoed by European regulators and hematology guidance [^113FUJ53] [^116qdVzb] [^1117udCQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I initially thought I should call this a strict absolute contraindication for all APS patients on apixaban, but that may overstate the labeling language. Let me reconsider and phrase this precisely: current expert guidance and regulatory advisories strongly recommend against DOACs in APS, especially in triple-positive patients, and many reviews extend this caution to all APS profiles, while acknowledging the strongest evidence pertains to triple-positivity and that applying this to single- or double-positive profiles may represent an over-interpretation of the data [^1117udCQ] [^116qdVzb].

> Next, I should review the efficacy and safety evidence. The key randomized and meta-analytic signals showing excess thrombotic events with DOACs versus warfarin in APS primarily involve rivaroxaban and triple-positive cohorts, leading to broad caution or avoidance of DOACs in APS; apixaban-specific randomized experience in APS is limited, with ongoing work suggesting the question remains under investigation, but does not overturn the current preference for VKAs in APS at this time [^1117udCQ] [^112GL6FY].

> Wait, let me verify whether apixaban trials in adjacent high-risk states excluded APS, which would limit generalizability. Indeed, major apixaban VTE extension trials in cancer explicitly excluded patients with APS, signaling recognized safety and outcome uncertainty in this subgroup and reinforcing caution when extrapolating benefits seen in non-APS populations to APS patients [^116hpq7u].

> I will now examine laboratory implications because they directly affect diagnosis and monitoring. DOACs, including apixaban, interfere with LA testing and can yield false-positive or false-negative results, leading ISTH-SSC guidance to advise against attempting LA detection while on DOACs; while DOAC adsorbents such as DOAC-Remove may mitigate interference in some assays, performance is assay-dependent and not a complete solution, and spiking and clinical studies consistently show clinically meaningful interference risks with DOAC therapy during LA evaluation [^116SCV5x] [^113HjVXw] [^114ZD79e] [^113PnUZa].

> But wait, what if the patient is LA-positive without fully meeting APS criteria; does the same caution apply. I need to ensure I differentiate risk profiles. The strongest evidence and consensus against DOACs is in triple-positive APS; many experts extend "not recommended" language to all APS, but explicitly note that evidence is less definitive for single- or double-positive patients, and this broader application may over-interpret the data, arguing for individualized assessment when only isolated LA positivity is present without clinical APS, although caution remains prudent given testing interference and potential risk amplification in LA-positive states [^1117udCQ].

> Next, I should review how LA status behaves over time, because a transient negative LA while on or off anticoagulation might tempt a change in therapy. Hold on, I should verify this carefully. Multiple cohort analyses show that LA status can fluctuate and that a negative LA test does not reliably reduce future thrombotic risk; moreover, anticoagulation, especially VKA, can itself alter test results, which reinforces that decisions about anticoagulant choice and duration in APS should not be based solely on transient LA negativity [^116FQiXT] [^115AiVrS] [^1114A8wF].

> Putting this together, I should double-check the practical bottom line. For patients with thrombotic APS who are LA-positive, particularly those who are triple-positive, DOACs such as apixaban are not recommended because of increased thrombotic risk observed with the class versus VKAs, compounded by the inability to reliably monitor LA on DOACs; warfarin remains the standard of care for secondary prevention in APS, while apixaban should generally be avoided outside of a clinical trial or a highly individualized scenario after specialist consultation [^1117udCQ] [^116qdVzb] [^116SCV5x] [^112mBE9v].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm the precise wording to answer the user's question about "contraindication". Strictly speaking, apixaban's U.S. label does not list APS as a formal contraindication; however, authoritative regulatory communications and hematology guidance support a strong "do not use/not recommended" stance for DOACs in triple-positive APS and a broad caution against DOACs across APS phenotypes, so in clinical practice this functions as a de facto contraindication for APS with LA positivity, especially when triple-positive, while recognizing that "not recommended" is the technically accurate phrasing for labeling purposes [^113FUJ53] [^116qdVzb] [^1117udCQ].

> Finally, if a patient is already on apixaban and found to be LA-positive with confirmed thrombotic APS, I need to ensure a safe transition plan. I should confirm diagnosis off-DOAC where feasible due to assay interference, then transition to warfarin with appropriate bridging and follow-up per specialist protocols; given the diagnostic pitfalls on DOACs, repeating antibody testing off interfering agents and anchoring decisions in clinical APS criteria are crucial steps before making long-term anticoagulation changes [^116SCV5x] [^114ZD79e] [^113PnUZa].

Eliquis (apixaban) [^1155dUxX] is not absolutely contraindicated in patients who are lupus anticoagulant (LA) positive, but it is **not recommended** for patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) [^116qdVzb] due to increased thrombotic risk [^1117udCQ]. For LA-positive patients with single or double antibody positivity, use Eliquis with caution and **consider warfarin as the preferred option**, especially if there is a history of arterial thrombosis or recurrent events [^112mBE9v]. Eliquis is **contraindicated** in patients with active pathological bleeding, severe hypersensitivity to apixaban, or severe hepatic impairment.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Triple-positive APS is a setting in which DOACs, including apixaban, are **not recommended** [^1117udCQ] because of increased thrombotic risk compared with VKAs [^116qdVzb]. For **single or double antibody positivity**, evidence is limited; use caution and **consider VKAs**, especially with arterial thrombosis or recurrent events.

---

## Specific contraindications and precautions

- **Active pathological bleeding**: Contraindicated due to bleeding risk.

- **Severe hypersensitivity reactions**: Contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to apixaban.

- **Severe hepatic impairment**: Contraindicated due to increased bleeding risk.

- **Renal impairment**: Use caution; dose adjustments may be necessary [^113w3q2p] [^1142oqX1].

- **Drug interactions**: Use caution with strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors or inducers [^114dw672] [^113w3q2p].

---

## Laboratory considerations

Interference with LA testing may occur [^116SCV5x], as apixaban can produce **false-positive or false-negative LA results**; interpret with caution [^113PnUZa].

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **Triple-positive APS**: Avoid Eliquis; use VKAs [^116qdVzb].

- **Single or double antibody positivity**: Use caution; consider VKAs, especially with arterial thrombosis or recurrent events [^1117udCQ].

- **Active bleeding or severe hepatic impairment**: Contraindicated.

- **Renal impairment or drug interactions**: Use caution and adjust dose as needed [^1142oqX1] [^114dw672].

---

Eliquis is **not absolutely contraindicated** in LA-positive patients [^1155dUxX], but it is **not recommended for triple-positive APS** [^116qdVzb] due to increased thrombotic risk [^1117udCQ]. Use caution in single or double antibody positivity, and **consider VKAs**, especially with arterial thrombosis or recurrent events.

### Pradaxa [^116qdVzb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

There is an increased risk of thrombosis in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including Pradaxa, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS, especially those who are triple-positive (positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.

### What is the appropriate anticoagulation strategy for thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome [^1117udCQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune prothrombotic disorder mediated by a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies collectively known as antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), which include lupus anticoagulant (LA), IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), and anti-β2-glycoprotein I (anti-β2GPI) antibodies. It has been shown that patients with all three aPL (triple positive) are at the highest risk of both a first thrombotic event and recurrence, despite anticoagulation.

In response to the publication of a meta-analysis and a randomised controlled trial assessing the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban versus warfarin in triple-positive APS with venous and/or arterial thrombosis, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued recommendations. They advised that direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) should not be used for secondary prevention of thrombosis in all APS patients, although specific attention was drawn to the high risk of triple-positive patients. As there is less evidence for patients with single- or dual-positive APS, this may represent an over-interpretation of the data.

In this review, we explore the available evidence on the safety and efficacy of DOACs in thrombotic APS, discuss the problem of detecting LA while on DOAC, and provide some practical guidance for managing this issue.

### Differences in preferences between clinicians and patients for the use and dosing of direct oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation [^112YfsJA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are effective in reducing stroke risk for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation if prescribed at the labeled dose; however, underdosing is frequent. Little is known about clinician knowledge and patient or clinician preferences for DOAC dosing.

- **Methods and results**: From April 2019 to March 2020, 240 clinicians and 343 patients with atrial fibrillation completed an assessment of anticoagulation knowledge/preferences. Clinician knowledge of DOAC dosing was tested with four hypothetical patient scenarios. Patients and clinicians were asked to grade the importance of 25 factors in anticoagulation decision-making.

Among clinicians, the median age was 55 years, and 23% were primary care clinicians. In scenarios of a patient indicated for full-dose DOAC, 41.2% of clinicians underdosed apixaban and 17.6% underdosed rivaroxaban. In scenarios of a patient indicated for reduced-dose DOAC, 64.6% and 71.7% of clinicians chose to use reduced-dose apixaban and rivaroxaban, respectively. Only 35.0% of clinicians correctly answered all four scenarios with the label-indicated dose; this knowledge gap was similar between clinicians who did and did not underdose.

Among patients with atrial fibrillation, the median age was 65 years, and 89% were currently anticoagulated. Patients and clinicians ranked stroke prevention and avoiding severe bleeding as very important to anticoagulation decision-making. Patients were more likely than clinicians to rank the ability to reduce anticoagulation dose if needed as very important (70.5% versus 43.6%; P < 0.0).

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: Method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^113EQKfx]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

The proportion of the population taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban is rapidly increasing, and critical clinical situations occur frequently. A simple and readily available laboratory test that accurately determines these anticoagulants' concentration in various healthcare settings would improve care in this vulnerable population. Routine coagulation tests, which are widely available, are not suitable for determining DOAC drug levels. Anti-Xa assays, which are successfully used for the monitoring of heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), were introduced, and a linear relationship was demonstrated in samples spiked with rivaroxaban. DOAC-calibrated anti-Xa activity correlated well with drug concentrations when measured in healthy volunteers and even in patients. However, widespread implementation in clinical practice is hampered by two major problems.

- **The need for extensive validation**: A large study investigating the accuracy of all Xa inhibitors over the full spectrum of concentrations in clinical practice is still missing.

- **24/7 service challenges**: Providing different assays for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug levels in a '24/7' service is elaborate and expensive.

It would be very convenient if laboratories could use a test that is already available in 24/7 service to determine all three Xa inhibitors. Such a universal anti-Xa assay for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug levels would simplify laboratory procedures and foster widespread implementation.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^11565XGm]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

A universal anti-Xa assay for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug concentrations would simplify laboratory procedures and facilitate widespread implementation. Following two pilot studies analyzing spiked samples and material from 698 patients, we conducted a prospective multicenter cross-sectional study. This study included 867 patients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban in clinical practice to comprehensively evaluate a simple, readily available anti-Xa assay that would accurately measure drug concentrations and correctly predict relevant levels in clinical practice.

Anti-Xa activity was measured by an assay calibrated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in addition to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). As an external validation, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity was also determined in nine external laboratories. The LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity correlated strongly with rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban drug levels [r_s = 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–0.98]. The sensitivity for the clinically relevant cut-off levels of 30, 50, and 100 µg/l was 96.2% (95% CI 94.4–97.4), 96.4% (95% CI 94.4–97.7), and 96.7% (95% CI 94.3–98.1), respectively. Concordant results were obtained in the external validation study. In conclusion, a universal, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assay accurately measured rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban concentrations and correctly predicted relevant drug concentrations in clinical practice.

### Direct oral anticoagulant dose selection: Challenging cases [^1165bg7H]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are given in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring of their anticoagulant effect based on the results of pivotal phase III trials. In some of these trials, patients were randomly allocated to receive a higher or lower dose of a DOAC, whereas in others, most patients were given a standard dose and only a subset deemed to be at risk of drug accumulation was given a lower dose. Treatment guidelines recommend dosing DOACs according to the way that they were tested in the trials, but for some patients, the optimal dosing remains uncertain. One example is patients with atrial fibrillation who are thought to have an unacceptably high risk of bleeding but do not meet the guideline criteria for dose reduction. A second is patients with venous thromboembolism who have completed 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation and are eligible for extended treatment with a standard or reduced dose of DOAC. In this review, we present a case-based approach to DOAC dose selection in these two settings.

### Performance characteristics of DOAC-Remove for neutralization of the effects of apixaban and rivaroxaban in lupus anticoagulant assays [^113HjVXw]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

This study established the performance characteristics of DOAC-Remove for the neutralization of the effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban in lupus anticoagulant (LAC) testing. Normal donor, LAC control, and patient samples were spiked with rivaroxaban or apixaban to simulate their effects on the dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and dilute prothrombin time (dPT). Anti-Xa activity was measured after spiking and after DOAC-Remove neutralization. Accuracy, complex precision, and reference interval verification were evaluated.

DOAC-Remove neutralized rivaroxaban and apixaban concentrations as high as 415 ng/mL and 333 ng/mL, respectively. Percentage positive and negative agreement between the baseline and post-neutralization interpretations were 75% or higher for the dRVVT and APTT methods but not for the dPT method. Coefficients of variation (CVs) were 10% or less for all assays except the Staclot-LA delta, which had a standard deviation of 2.5 seconds or CV of 25% or less depending on the level. The laboratory's reference intervals were verified for the dRVVT and APTT assays after DOAC-Remove treatment but not for the dPT assays.

DOAC-Remove appears to have acceptable performance characteristics for neutralizing the effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban in the dRVVT and APTT methods but not in the dPT method.

### Apixaban for extended treatment of provoked venous thromboembolism [^114FRCm3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The appropriate duration of anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients who have a transient provoking factor (e.g. surgery, trauma, or immobility) and concomitant enduring risk factors is uncertain.

- **Methods**: In this single-center, double-blind, randomized trial, adults with VTE after the occurrence of a transient provoking factor who had at least one enduring risk factor and had completed at least 3 months of anticoagulation were assigned to receive oral apixaban (at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was the first symptomatic reVTE. The primary safety outcome was the first episode of major bleeding according to the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis.

- **Results**: A total of 600 patients underwent randomization (mean age, 59.5 years; female sex, 57.0%; non-White race, 19.2%). The trial population had a broad range of provoking factors and enduring risk factors. Symptomatic reVTE occurred in 4 of the 300 patients (1.3%) in the apixaban group and in 30 of the 300 patients (10.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.36; P < 0.001). Major bleeding occurred in 1 patient in the apixaban group and none in the placebo group. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was observed in 14 of 294 patients (4.8%) in the apixaban group and in 5 of 294 patients (1.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.68; 95% CI, 0.96 to 7.43; P = 0.06). One patient in the apixaban group and 3 patients in the placebo group died, with no definitive dea…

### Efficacy and safety of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and extremes in body weight [^113KsGMo]. Circulation (2019). Low credibility.

Guidelines caution against the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with extremely high (> 120 kg) or low (≤ 60 kg) body weight because of a lack of data in these populations.

- **Methods**: In a post hoc analysis of ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation; n = 18,201), a randomized trial comparing apixaban with warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, the randomized treatment effect (apixaban versus warfarin) was estimated, stratified by body weight (≤ 60 kg, > 60–120 kg, > 120 kg) using a Cox regression model. The interaction between body weight and randomized treatment was also tested. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding.

- **Results**: Of the 18,139 patients with available weight and outcomes data, 1,985 (10.9%) were in the low-weight group (≤ 60 kg), 15,172 (83.6%) were in the midrange weight group (> 60–120 kg), and 982 (5.4%) were in the high-weight group (> 120 kg). The treatment effect of apixaban versus warfarin for the efficacy outcomes of stroke/systemic embolism, all-cause death, or myocardial infarction was consistent across the weight spectrum (interaction P value > 0.05). For major bleeding, apixaban had a better safety profile than warfarin in all weight categories and showed a greater relative risk reduction in patients in the low (≤ 60 kg; HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36–0.82) and midrange (> 60–120 kg) weight groups (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61–0.83; interaction P value = 0.016).

### Laboratory testing in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants: A practical guide for clinicians [^114pDwJ3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

One of the key benefits of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is that they do not require routine laboratory monitoring. Nevertheless, assessment of DOAC exposure and anticoagulant effects may become useful in various clinical scenarios. The five approved DOACs — apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran etexilate, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban — have different characteristics impacting assay selection and the interpretation of results.

- **Which tests to use**: This article provides an updated overview on the advantages and limitations of various tests for monitoring DOACs.
- **When to assay DOAC levels**: The situations in which to test for DOAC levels are still debated and must be carefully considered.
- **How to interpret results**: Key considerations include bleeding risk, emergency situations, and perioperative management.
- **Impact of DOACs on assays**: The impact of DOACs on routine and specialized coagulation assays is important, as it may cause false-positive or false-negative results; however, these can be minimized by using specific assays and collecting blood samples at trough concentrations.

Assays for anti-Xa or anti-IIa activity are the preferred methods when quantitative information is useful. Different reagent sensitivities and variabilities in laboratory calibrations impact assay results, and international calibration standards for all specific tests for each DOAC are needed to reduce inter-laboratory variability and allow inter-study comparisons. Finally, prospective clinical trials are needed to validate these findings.

### Apixaban vs rivaroxaban in patients with atrial fibrillation at high or low bleeding risk: A population-based cohort study [^115deiNH]. Heart Rhythm (2025). High credibility.

Despite many atrial fibrillation (AF) patients being at risk of bleeding, very limited data are available on bleeding rates of different direct oral anticoagulants based on the spectrum of bleeding risk.

- **Objective**: We aimed to compare the risk of major bleeding and thromboembolic events with apixaban vs rivaroxaban for AF patients stratified by bleeding risk.

- **Methods**: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all adult patients (66 years or older) with AF in Ontario, Canada, who were treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban between April 1, 2011, and March 31, 2020. Bleeding risk was estimated by the HAS-BLED score, with high bleeding risk defined as a score of ≥ 3. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding, and the primary efficacy outcome was thromboembolic events. Comparisons were adjusted for baseline comorbidities by inverse probability of treatment weighting.

- **Results**: This study included 18,156 AF patients with high bleeding risk and 55,186 AF patients with low bleeding risk. Apixaban use was more common in patients with high bleeding risk; 63% of high-risk patients used apixaban compared with 56% of low-risk patients. Apixaban users had lower rates of major bleeding in high-risk patients (2.9% vs 4.2% per year; hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58–0.81) and in low-risk patients (1.8% vs 2.9% per year; HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.56–0.70) compared with rivaroxaban. There were no differences in rates of thromboembolic events, 3.1% vs 3.0% per year (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.86–1.22) in high-risk patients and 1.9% vs 1.9% per year (HR, 1.00; 95% CI).

### Eliquis [^113FUJ53]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Evidence for the efficacy and safety of Eliquis was derived from the ARISTOTLE study, a multinational, double-blind study in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. It compared the effects of Eliquis and warfarin on the risk of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) systemic embolism. In the ARISTOTLE study, patients were randomized to receive Eliquis 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in subjects with at least two of the following characteristics: age greater than or equal to 80 years, body weight less than or equal to 60 kg, or serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL) or warfarin (targeted to an INR range of 2.0–3.0).

Patients had to have one or more of the following additional risk factors for stroke: prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), prior systemic embolism, age greater than or equal to 75 years, arterial hypertension requiring treatment, diabetes mellitus, heart failure classified as New York Heart Association Class 2 or higher, or left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%.

The primary objective of the ARISTOTLE study was to determine whether Eliquis 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily) was effective, and noninferior to warfarin, in reducing the risk of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism. The superiority of Eliquis over warfarin was also examined for the primary endpoint (rate of stroke and systemic embolism), major bleeding, and death from any cause.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and antiphospholipid syndrome [^112mBE9v]. Rheumatology (2016).

The treatment of thrombotic APS patients includes long-term anticoagulation with oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), with warfarin being the one most commonly used. However, the use of VKAs can be challenging, especially in patients with APS. VKAs monitoring in patients with aPL is complicated by the heterogeneous responsiveness to LAs of reagents used in the International Normalized Ratio test, potentially resulting in instability of anticoagulation.

For decades, VKAs were the only available oral anticoagulants. However, non-VKA oral anticoagulants, including a direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran etexilate) and direct anti-Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban), are currently available. The use of these agents may represent a major step forward since, unlike VKAs, they have few reported drug interactions and they do not interact with food or alcohol intake, thereby resulting in more stable anticoagulant intensity. Most importantly, monitoring their anticoagulant intensity is not routinely required due to their predictable anticoagulant effects.

In this review, we discuss the clinical and laboratory aspects of non-VKA oral anticoagulants, focusing on the available evidence regarding their use in patients with APS.

### Extended reduced-dose apixaban for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism [^116hpq7u]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The API-CAT study was published in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study addresses cancer-associated thrombosis. The trial question investigated whether extended anticoagulation with reduced-dose apixaban is noninferior to full-dose apixaban in patients with active cancer and proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The study population included 1,766 patients, comprising 1,000 females and 766 males. Inclusion criteria specified patients with active cancer and proximal DVT or PE who had completed at least six months of anticoagulation therapy. Key exclusion criteria were isolated subsegmental PE without associated DVT, isolated distal DVT of the legs, isolated upper extremity DVT or superior vena cava thrombosis, presence of a mechanical heart valve, antiphospholipid syndrome, conditions increasing the risk of serious bleeding, life expectancy of less than 12 months, and pregnancy or lactation.

The interventions included administering reduced-dose apixaban at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily for 12 months to 866 patients, and full-dose apixaban at a dose of 5 mg twice daily for 12 months to 900 patients. The primary outcome was the difference not exceeding the non-inferiority margin in recurrent venous thromboembolism (reVTE), with rates of 2.1% for reduced-dose and 2.8% for full-dose (sub-hazard ratio [sHR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41 to 1.41).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in clinically relevant bleeding (12.1% vs. 15.6%; sHR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.97).
	- No significant difference in death from any cause (17.7% vs. 19.6%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06).

### Apixaban compared with warfarin to prevent thrombosis in thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome: a randomized trial [^112GL6FY]. Blood Advances (2022). High credibility.

Patient satisfaction with anticoagulation was assessed using the ACTS survey. Patients on apixaban had significantly higher scores compared with patients on warfarin from month 1 through month 12, indicating that patients reported higher satisfaction with apixaban over warfarin.

- **Patient satisfaction assessment**: The assessment of patient satisfaction with anticoagulation treatment was conducted using the ACTS among patients randomized to apixaban or warfarin. It provided a comparison of patient satisfaction with anticoagulation treatment measured with a validated assessment tool (ACTS) at the shown time points. The midline in each box represents the median, and the top and the bottom of each box represent the cutoffs of the interquartile range. The whiskers represent 1.5 times the interquartile range, and outliers are represented as dots. Apixaban was significantly favored over warfarin at every interval assessment.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety between apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban among patients with atrial fibrillation: A multinational population-based cohort study [^115wjaDf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Guidelines recommend using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) because head-to-head trial data do not exist to guide the choice of DOACs. This study aims to conduct a large-scale comparison between all DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) in routine clinical practice.

The design of the study was a multinational population-based cohort study. It utilized five standardized electronic healthcare databases, which covered 221 million people in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The participants were patients newly diagnosed with AF from 2010 through 2019 who received a new DOAC prescription.

Measurements included database-specific hazard ratios (HRs) of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and all-cause mortality between DOACs. These were estimated using a Cox regression model stratified by propensity score and pooled using a random-effects model.

A total of 527,226 new DOAC users met the inclusion criteria, consisting of apixaban (n = 281,320), dabigatran (n = 61,008), edoxaban (n = 12,722), and rivaroxaban (n = 172,176). Apixaban usage was associated with a lower risk for GIB compared to dabigatran (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.94]), edoxaban (HR, 0.77 [CI, 0.66 to 0.91]), or rivaroxaban (HR, 0.72 [CI, 0.66 to 0.79]). No substantial differences were observed for other outcomes or DOAC-DOAC comparisons. The results remained consistent for patients aged 80 years or older. The study further confirmed consistent associations between lower GIB risk and apixaban versus rivaroxaban.

### How I treat anticoagulated patients undergoing an elective procedure or surgery [^1118PP1p]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including the use of heparin bridging therapy to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients undergoing selected minor procedures. However, in major procedures that necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate risk.

Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging. Their relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

### Efficacy and safety considerations with dose-reduced direct oral anticoagulants: A review [^114pb5s3]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Dose-reduced regimens of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be used for two main purposes: dose-adjusted treatment intended as full-intensity anticoagulation (e.g. for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [AF] in patients requiring dose reduction) or low-intensity treatment (e.g. extended-duration treatment of venous thromboembolism [VTE]). We reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to understand the scenarios in which dose-adjusted or low-intensity DOACs were tested and reviewed the labeled indications by regulatory authorities, using data from large registries to assess whether the use of dose-reduced DOACs in routine practice aligned with the findings of RCTs.

- **Observations**: Among 4191 screened publications, 35 RCTs that used dose-adjusted DOACs were identified for dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban. Of these 35 RCTs, 29 were related to stroke prevention in AF. Efficacy and safety results for dose-adjusted DOACs in large RCTs of AF were similar to those found for full-dose DOACs. To our knowledge, dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban have not been studied as dose-adjusted therapy for acute VTE treatment. Low-intensity DOACs were identified in 37 RCTs. Low-intensity DOACs may be used for extended-duration treatment of VTE (apixaban and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in orthopedic surgeries (dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in ambulatory high-risk cancer patients (apixaban and rivaroxaban), or postdischarge high-risk medical patients (rivaroxaban) in stable atherosclerotic vascular disease, or following a recent re-evaluation.

### Apixaban vs. standard of care after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: The ATLANTIS trial [^1135z5wc]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

The respective roles of oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remain debated. ATLANTIS is an international, randomized, open-label, superiority trial comparing apixaban to the standard of care.

- **Methods and results**: After successful TAVI, 1500 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive apixaban 5 mg (2.5 mg if impaired renal function or concomitant antiplatelet therapy) (n = 749) twice daily, or standard of care (n = 751). Randomization was stratified by the need for chronic anticoagulation therapy. Standard-of-care patients received a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) (Stratum 1) or antiplatelet therapy (Stratum 2) if there was an indication for anticoagulation or not, respectively. The primary endpoint was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, systemic embolism, intracardiac or bioprosthesis thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and life-threatening, disabling, or major bleeding over 1-year follow-up. The primary safety endpoint was major, disabling, or life-threatening bleeding. The primary outcome occurred in 138 (18.4%) and 151 (20.1%) patients receiving apixaban or standard of care, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73–1.16] and there was no evidence of interaction between treatment and stratum (Pinteraction = 0.57). The primary safety endpoint was similar in both groups (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.72–1.44). In Stratum 1 (n = 451), an exploratory analysis showed no difference for all endpoints between apixaban and VKA.

### Lupus anticoagulant test persistence over time and its associations with future thrombotic events [^1114A8wF]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Our primary objective was to assess whether a change in LA status was a predictor of future events, such that a negative test could inform clinicians and the patient about the patient's future risk of thrombosis. We found that in patients persistently positive for LA, having a negative LA test did not affect the patient's prospective risk of future thrombotic events or mortality. Thus, a negative LA test cannot be used to risk-stratify patients or individualize therapy. Neither Gkrouzman et al. nor Khawaja et al. analyzed the risk of prospective events.

Our study has several limitations. First, our findings cannot be generalized to all APS patients or aPL+ patients as we included only patients who were persistently positive for LA. However, this can also be seen as a strength as LA is considered the strongest aPL risk factor for thrombotic events. Second, given the regularity with which patients underwent antibody testing, we were unable to complete all testing for LA while patients were off VKA. Although this accurately represents routine LA testing in clinical practice, LA interpretation under VKA is controversial and challenging. However, the proportion of patients in our cohort who remained persistently LA+ (72%) was similar to the rates in other studies that used different definitions of LA stability and positivity (78% in the study by Gkrouzman et al, 71% in the study by Zen et al, and 87% in the study by Erkan et al.). Finally, we only analyzed the effect of the first negative test on future events. We did not compare patients who became transiently LA negative to patients.

### Eliquis [^116FP4cB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warning**:
	- **Premature discontinuation of Eliquis increases the risk of thrombotic events**: Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including Eliquis, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with Eliquis is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or the completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

	- **Spinal/epidural hematoma**: Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with Eliquis who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:
		- Use of indwelling epidural catheters
		- Concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, and other anticoagulants
		- A history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures
		- A history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery

	- Optimal timing between the administration of Eliquis and neuraxial procedures is not known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary.

### Lupus anticoagulant laboratory diagnosis by applying the 2020 ISTH-SSC guidelines [^116mzPhZ]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Low credibility.

The ISTH-SSC guidelines for lupus anticoagulant (LA) testing recommend using in-house determined cut-off values, pooled normal plasma (PNP) for ratio normalization, and a ratio for the mixing test interpretation. They strongly support the role of the mixing step in the diagnostic process.

- **Objectives**: To investigate and compare the LA testing results and interpretations obtained following the ISTH-SSC guidelines or the available alternatives.

- **Patients/Methods**: Blood samples for LA testing from 462 consecutive patients were evaluated for screening, mixing, and confirmatory tests. The analysis focused on the interpretation differences between using: (1) the in-house cut-off values versus the manufacturer's cut-off values, (2) a normalized ratio calculated using PNP at each run versus the mean of the reference interval, (3) a normalized ratio versus the index of circulating anticoagulant to interpret the mixing step, and (4) a two-step versus three-step procedure.

- **Results**: LA testing outcomes were comparable when using the in-house and manufacturer's cut-off values. More positive dilute Russell's viper venom (DRVV) time results were obtained with the normalized ratio based on PNP than with the mean of the reference interval. Overall, the mixing test results obtained with the normalized ratio and the index of circulating anticoagulant showed good agreement. Among the 97 DRVV screen test-positive samples, 33 and 89 were classified as LA-positive with the 3-step and the 2-step procedure, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The cut-off value used and the way to normalize ratios had a significant impact on the LA testing outcomes and interpretations.

### A universal anti-xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: Method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^113EzNca]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

**Application of the universal assay**: The study validates a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)-calibrated, universal assay for measuring the anti-Xa activity of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. The universal assay was assessed for its diagnostic accuracy and external validation. Results support its use in clinical settings for these anticoagulants due to its reliable and consistent performance across different scenarios.

### Eliquis [^1142oqX1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Recommended dose**: For the reduction of risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, the recommended dose of Eliquis for most patients is 5 mg taken orally twice daily. However, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics: age greater than or equal to 80 years, body weight less than or equal to 60 kg, or serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL.

- **Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following hip or knee replacement surgery**: The recommended dose of Eliquis is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. The initial dose should be taken 12 to 24 hours after surgery. In patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 35 days. For patients undergoing knee replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 12 days.

- **Treatment of DVT and PE**: The recommended dose of Eliquis is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days of therapy. After 7 days, the recommended dose is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

- **Reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE**: The recommended dose of Eliquis is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily after at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE.

- **Missed dose**: If a dose of Eliquis is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day, and twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.

- **Temporary interruption for surgery and other interventions**: Eliquis should be discontin…

### Reversal of antithrombotic agents [^115bNhtK]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Anticoagulants are the mainstay of therapy for thromboembolic diseases. In addition to traditional agents, new oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, have been shown to be effective across several indications. Bleeding is a serious complication associated with any anticoagulant. However, many traditional parenteral and new oral agents currently lack specific antidotes. This review describes available and future options for reversing the effects of anticoagulants, particularly the new oral agents, and discusses management strategies for bleeding events in clinical practice.

### Apixaban-induced haematoma causing small bowel intussusception [^115sKweC]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Apixaban (Eliquis) is a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) indicated for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis, non-valvular atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, and postoperative venous thromboprophylaxis following hip or knee replacement. Complications are minimal and include, but are not limited to, bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, and haematoma formation.

Our patient is a 73-year-old woman who presented with clinical and radiographic findings of small bowel obstruction. She was found to be taking apixaban for atrial fibrillation. A CT scan showed small bowel intussusception. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy and resection of the small bowel intussusception with primary side-to-side anastomosis. Histopathological examination showed that the intussusception was caused by an intramural haematoma.

This case presents a rare instance of adult intussusception caused by a DOAC. To our knowledge, no case of intussusception caused by apixaban has yet been found in the literature.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: Evidence and unresolved issues [^1155dUxX]. Lancet (2020). High credibility.

Currently, licensed direct oral anticoagulants selectively target thrombin (e.g. dabigatran) or coagulation factor Xa (e.g. apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban). Designed to be administered in fixed doses without routine monitoring, direct oral anticoagulants have a lower propensity for food and drug interactions than vitamin K antagonists. In randomized controlled trials involving around 250,000 patients, they were at least as effective for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis and were associated with a lower risk of life-threatening bleeding. Although the absolute benefits of direct oral anticoagulants over vitamin K antagonists are modest, guidelines recommend them in preference to vitamin K antagonists for most indications due to their ease of use and superior safety.

The greatest benefits of direct oral anticoagulants are likely to be observed in patients who were previously deemed unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy. The emergence of generic preparations is expected to further increase the uptake of direct oral anticoagulants, particularly in countries where they are currently not widely used because of cost. Direct oral anticoagulants are contraindicated in patients with mechanical heart valves and should be used with caution or avoided in patients with advanced kidney or liver disease.

In this therapeutics paper, we review the pharmacology of direct oral anticoagulants, summarize the evidence that led to their approval and incorporation into treatment guidelines, and explore key unresolved issues. We also briefly discuss future perspectives for their development.

### Eliquis [^115a7p9B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Nonclinical toxicology**:

	- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**:

		- **Carcinogenesis**: Apixaban was not carcinogenic when administered to mice and rats for up to 2 years. The systemic exposures (AUCs) of unbound apixaban in male and female mice at the highest doses tested (1500 and 3000 mg/kg/day) were 9 and 20 times, respectively, the human exposure of unbound drug at the MRHD of 10 mg/day. Systemic exposures of unbound apixaban in male and female rats at the highest dose tested (600 mg/kg/day) were 2 and 4 times, respectively, the human exposure.

		- **Mutagenesis**: Apixaban was neither mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, nor clastogenic in Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro. In a 1-month in vivo/in vitro cytogenetics study in rat peripheral blood lymphocytes, or in a rat micronucleus study in vivo, apixaban showed no mutagenic effects.

		- **Impairment of fertility**: Apixaban had no effect on fertility in male or female rats when given at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day, a dose resulting in unbound apixaban exposure levels that are 3 and 4 times, respectively, the human exposure. Apixaban administered to female rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day from implantation through the end of lactation produced no adverse findings in male offspring (F1 generation) at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day, a dose resulting in exposure to unbound apixaban that is 5 times the human exposure. Adverse effects in the F1-generation female offspring were limited to decreased mating and fertility indices at ≥ 200 mg/kg/day (a dose resulting in exposure to unbound apixaban that is ≥ 5 times the human exposure).

### Evaluation of apixaban in stroke and systemic embolism prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in clinical practice setting in France, rationale and design of the NAXOS: SNIIRAM study [^1134yHhv]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Study objectives**: The primary objectives of this study are twofold.

- **Effectiveness objective**: To estimate the risk of stroke or systemic thromboembolic events according to the newly initiated anticoagulant treatment in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

- **Safety objective**: To estimate the risk of major bleeding according to the newly initiated anticoagulant treatment in NVAF patients.

Secondary objectives are outlined as follows for patients with NVAF and according to oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment:

- To describe demographic and clinical characteristics.
- To estimate the risk of occurrence of a composite morbidity criterion, including stroke, systemic embolism, and major bleeding.
- To estimate the risk of all-cause mortality.
- To describe treatment patterns at anticoagulant initiation and over time.
- To estimate healthcare resource utilization.
- To estimate the off-label use of apixaban in the French valvular atrial fibrillation population initiating apixaban.
- **In OAC-naive patients only**: To compare baseline characteristics and outcomes (stroke and systemic thromboembolic events, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality) as well as healthcare resource utilization rates between patients initiated with apixaban versus those initiated with other anticoagulant treatments.

### Lupus anticoagulant test persistence over time and its associations with future thrombotic events [^115AiVrS]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

In our cohort of LA+ patients, rigorously followed for a long observation period, we found that most patients remain positive for LA over an extended period or only transiently test negative. The use of VKA is associated with negative LA tests, probably due to methodological problems. Importantly, a negative LA test did not attenuate the risk of thromboembolism. We conclude that the decision for the duration of anticoagulation cannot be based on a negative LA test if a patient has previously been persistently positive. Additionally, based on our findings, there is no evidence for the clinical utility of routine monitoring of LA status in persistently positive patients.

The study aims to evaluate the use of apixaban for stroke and systemic embolism prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in France.

- **Study population**: Patients will be included if they are covered by the French national health insurance general scheme, have at least one reimbursement of anticoagulant treatment initiated with an index anticoagulant, are aged 18 or older at initiation, and have been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the 24 months prior to treatment initiation. Patients will be excluded if they receive different types of anticoagulant treatment at the index date, are diagnosed with a valvular condition 24 months before initiation, or are treated for an indication other than stroke prevention in AF within the 6 weeks before their first anticoagulant reimbursement.

The study population will be identified in the database through consecutive steps as illustrated in Figure 2, detailed in Supporting Information Appendix 2.

- **Anticoagulant-naive and experienced patients**: Anticoagulant-naive patients will be defined as those with no dispensation of anticoagulant treatment during the 24 months before the index date, whereas anticoagulant-experienced patients will include the others. Patients in the experienced group will be included at their first entry. All patients aged ≥ 18 years and covered by the French national health insurance general scheme, with at least one reimbursement for oral anticoagulant treatments such as vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs), apixaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran between January 2014 and December will be considered.

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112F87kz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Apixaban Dosage Calculator" is designed for managing perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk for noncardiac surgery, periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, cancer-associated thrombosis, acute ischemic stroke, portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and atrial fibrillation.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator is a clinical tool that determines the appropriate dosage of apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) used for thromboprophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The dosage depends on three factors: age, weight, and renal function (creatinine clearance). The recommended dose in atrial fibrillation is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following three characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL.

The calculator determines the appropriate apixaban dosage based on specific patient information. This involves considering the patient's age, weight, creatinine clearance, and the reason for using apixaban. Here's how the process works:

- **Inputs**:
	- Age is captured in years, with a range of 18 to 120.
	- Weight can be entered either in kilograms (30 to 300 kg) or pounds (66 to 660 lb). If in pounds, it is converted to kilograms using a conversion rate (1 kg = 2.20462 lb).
	- Creatinine clearance is measured in mL/min, ranging from 0 to 150.
	- The indication for use includes four options: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and thromboprophylaxis.

### Lupus anticoagulant test persistence over time and its associations with future thrombotic events [^111VFEdw]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

In our cohort of patients persistently positive for lupus anticoagulant (LA), the majority remained positive throughout the observation period. However, over one-quarter of patients had at least one negative test for LA during the observation period of almost 10 years. There was a clear association between vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment and experiencing a negative LA test. Most patients had just a transiently negative LA test, as 68% of those who had a negative test result and had follow-ups turned positive again. Most importantly, a negative test for LA did not impact a patient's future risk of thrombotic events (arterial thromboembolism [ATE], venous thromboembolism [VTE], or thromboembolism [TE]), and time-dependent VKA status did not explain the lack of association between LA status and thrombotic outcomes.

VKA use at baseline and factors likely associated with VKA exposure over time, including a history of thrombosis, were the strongest predictors of experiencing a negative LA test. The interpretation of LA tests for patients on VKAs remains controversial, as VKA use is associated with false negative and false positive LA results. We hypothesize that some of the negative LA tests for patients on VKAs may have been false negatives. Nevertheless, when an alternative definition of LA positivity was applied to all LA tests independent of VKA status, again, no association between experiencing a negative LA test and subsequent thrombotic outcomes was found. The most recent guidance from the Subcommittee on Standardization and Control (SSC) of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) recommends testing patients for LA when they have stopped anticoagulation treatment whenever possible.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^114svfRp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have revolutionized anticoagulant management and are becoming the cornerstone treatment for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis and treatment. The list of other indications is expanding. There are many factors that will affect appropriate efficacy and safety endpoints when prescribing DOAC therapy, and this review aims to address these scenarios.

Patient comorbidities must be considered when selecting the most appropriate anticoagulant. It is now recognized that routine monitoring of renal and hepatic function, signs and symptoms of bleeding, and parameters of compliance should be considered for all patients. Clinicians should incorporate patient preferences, clinical outcomes data, patient characteristics, and quality-of-life considerations when recommending an anticoagulant. Cost can play a critical role in this decision, with DOAC affordability for individual patients varying based on medication benefit copayment tiers.

As the future of anticoagulant therapies continues to evolve, DOACs will remain a critical therapy for preventing thrombotic events.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^115meMtu]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Rapid and accurate determination of anticoagulant drug levels is essential in critical clinical situations, such as urgent surgery, planned thrombolysis, or major bleeding. Any anticoagulation treatment is inevitably associated with an increased risk of bleeding, which can be as high as 15% per year in certain patient populations. Besides, approximately 25% of intracranial haemorrhages, which are the most dangerous adverse events, are linked to anticoagulation treatment. The bleeding risk associated with anticoagulants is particularly important in trauma patients because uncontrolled bleeding is the leading cause of death. In patients with massive bleeding, early and targeted treatment is crucial to saving lives, as 80% of trauma deaths occur within the first hour after injury.

Laboratory tests that can quickly verify the presence of a relevant anticoagulant drug level will support prompt treatment with reversal agents. Moreover, knowing the anticoagulant drug level is essential in cases of urgent surgery and planned thrombolysis. Rapid intervention is required in these situations, but an increased bleeding risk exposes patients to high procedural risks. Therefore, simple laboratory tests that accurately determine the anticoagulant drug level would improve care for patients undergoing anticoagulation treatment.

### Interference of DOACs in different DRVVT assays for diagnosis of lupus anticoagulants [^114ZD79e]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

The determination of lupus anticoagulants (LA) is an important yet challenging test in the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), particularly for patients using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). The aim of this study was to examine the influence of these drugs on DRVVT assays from two companies, including screening tests, confirming tests, and calculated ratios, as well as on aPTT and lupus-sensitive aPTT.

Methods: Plasma samples from healthy volunteers were spiked with the DOACs dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban at concentrations of 0, 10, 30, 50, and 100 ng/mL for testing. Furthermore, samples from patients receiving a DOAC were investigated. The plasma concentrations of the DOACs were determined using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS).

Results: Depending on type and concentration, all the DOACs resulted in pathological values in the DRVVT screening assays. In samples spiked with apixaban, no influence on the DRVVT normalized ratio of the two assays was observed; however, 7 to 15% of samples from patients receiving apixaban displayed pathological values. In contrast, up to 71% of dabigatran-spiked samples showed normalized ratio values above the cut-off, whereas there was no influence in the patients' samples. In both spiked and patient samples containing rivaroxaban, the DRVVT assays were influenced.

Conclusion: LA diagnostics under DOAC therapy should be limited to situations where time-critical evaluation is warranted. It is crucial to consider the findings even when…

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113iFX4a]. Chest (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary embolism, particularly in the choice of anticoagulation, the ACCP 2016 guidelines recommend considering dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban as long-term anticoagulant therapy. This is advised instead of VKA therapy in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the leg or pulmonary embolism (PE) who have no evidence of cancer.

### Advantages and limitations of the new anticoagulants [^117Qf83g]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

During recent years, three new anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) have been introduced to the market, with the possibility of one more anticoagulant (edoxaban) in the next two years. This review does not aim to compare the efficacy and risks of these new agents; instead, it focuses on detailing their advantages and limitations.

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these drugs include few drug and food interactions, predictable dose responses, and rapid onset and offset, resulting in simplified management for patients requiring anticoagulant therapy. Notably, no routine laboratory monitoring is required. An exciting observation about these new anticoagulants is the uniform reduction in intracranial bleeding by half compared with warfarin.

Potential limitations of the new anticoagulants include uncertainty regarding the assessment of drug levels, safe drug levels for major surgery, management of major bleeding, renal dependence, multiple dose regimens, adherence in the absence of frequent monitoring, and unknown rare side effects unobserved in trials. This review aims to clarify some of these concerns.

### Perioperative management of patients taking direct oral anticoagulants: A review [^116nqRDb]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), comprising apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, are commonly used medications to treat patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Decisions about how to manage DOACs in patients undergoing a surgical or nonsurgical procedure are important to decrease the risks of bleeding and thromboembolism.

- **Observations**: For elective surgical or nonsurgical procedures, a standardized approach to perioperative DOAC management involves classifying the risk of procedure-related bleeding as minimal (e.g. minor dental or skin procedures), low to moderate (e.g. cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair), or high risk (e.g. major cancer or joint replacement procedures). For patients undergoing minimal bleeding risk procedures, DOACs may be continued, or if there is concern about excessive bleeding, DOACs may be discontinued on the day of the procedure. Patients undergoing a low to moderate bleeding risk procedure should typically discontinue DOACs 1 day before the operation and restart DOACs 1 day after. Patients undergoing a high bleeding risk procedure should stop DOACs 2 days prior to the operation and restart DOACs 2 days after. With this perioperative DOAC management strategy, rates of thromboembolism (0.2%-0.4%) and major bleeding (1%-2%) are low, and delays or cancellations of surgical and nonsurgical procedures are infrequent. Patients taking DOACs who need emergent (< 6 hours after presentation) or urgent surgical procedures (6–24 hours after presentation) experience bleeding rates up to 23% and thromboembolism.

### Lupus anticoagulant test persistence over time and its associations with future thrombotic events [^117BXFZ4]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

As there are no clearly defined criteria for LA positivity in patients on VKA treatment, and as it is not possible to interrupt VKA in patients with a history of thrombosis just for study purposes, we used the Rosner Index in addition to the predefined LA criteria. In this study, for patients receiving VKA therapy, an LA test was considered positive if the confirmatory assay was positive and the mixing study had a Rosner Index ≥ 15. The Rosner Index was calculated as 100 × [(clotting times of the 1:1 mixture, normal plasma)/(patient's plasma)].

For patients not receiving anticoagulation or those on unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with an anti-Xa level ≤ 1.0 internal unit (IU) per mL, an LA test was positive if either the confirmatory test was positive or the mixing study was positive (again defined by the Rosner Index). Mixing and confirmatory tests were not completed for patients receiving LMWH with an anti-Xa level > 1.0 internal unit per mL, and these LA tests were excluded from this analysis. LA tests completed while patients were receiving direct oral anticoagulants were also excluded.

### SPL drug information for andexanet alfa [^111C9STp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Contraindication regarding the use of andexanet alfa IV (also known as Andexxa) and concomitant use of heparin: avoid using andexanet alfa for the reversal of direct factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban and rivaroxaban) before heparinization, as andexanet alfa may cause unresponsiveness to heparin. Use an alternative anticoagulant to heparin if anticoagulation is needed.

### Andexxa [^113Fm9Eq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Thromboembolic and ischemic risks**: The thromboembolic and ischemic risks were assessed in 419 bleeding patients in the ANNEXA-4 study who received ANDEXXA and were treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban. There were 45 out of 419 (10.7%) patients who experienced a thrombotic event. The median time to the first event was 10 days, and 17 patients experienced the event within three days of treatment. Of the 419 patients who received ANDEXXA, 266 received at least one anticoagulation dose within 30 days after treatment as a prophylactic measure. Of these 266 patients, 14 (5.3%) had a thrombotic event after resumption [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- It is essential to monitor patients treated with ANDEXXA for signs and symptoms of arterial and venous thromboembolic events, ischemic events, and cardiac arrest. To reduce thromboembolic risk, resume anticoagulant therapy as soon as medically appropriate following treatment with ANDEXXA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

	- The safety of ANDEXXA has not been evaluated in patients who experienced thromboembolic events or disseminated intravascular coagulation within two weeks prior to the life-threatening bleeding event requiring treatment with ANDEXXA. Additionally, the safety of ANDEXXA has not been evaluated in patients who received prothrombin complex concentrates, recombinant factor VIIa, or whole blood products within seven days prior to the bleeding event.

- **Unresponsiveness to unfractionated heparin**: Unresponsiveness to unfractionated heparin, leading to non-prolongation of activated clotting times and serious thrombotic events, has occurred following ANDEXXA treatment.

### Quantitative risk for single-positive lupus anticoagulant results with different anticoagulants [^113PnUZa]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). High credibility.

Clinical experts recommend against testing for lupus anticoagulant (LAC) during anticoagulation. We quantitated the risk of a single-positive dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) result or partial thromboplastin time-based phospholipid neutralization (PN) result on anticoagulation.

Any anticoagulation led to a fourfold greater likelihood of single-positive results, primarily by rivaroxaban (odds ratio [OR] = 8.6) and warfarin (OR = 6.6), resulting in a positive dRVVT test with a normal PN test. Heparin and apixaban were twofold more likely to show single-positive results, but enoxaparin did not show significant single positivity.

Our results quantitatively support experts' avoidance of LAC testing during anticoagulation.

### Lupus anticoagulant test persistence over time and its associations with future thrombotic events [^116FQiXT]. Blood Advances (2022). High credibility.

During the observation period, 118 patients (72%) had stable LA status, defined by having only positive LA tests. The other quarter of the study cohort (n = 46, 28%) had at least one negative LA test. Among these 46 patients, we observed a median of two within-patient changes in LA status (25th-75th percentile, 1–2; range, 1–6), and a median of 0.3 changes per year of observation time (25th-75th percentile, 0.2–0.5; range, 0.05–1.7). This corresponded to a 10-year cumulative incidence of a negative LA test of 28% (95% confidence interval, 20–35).

- **Change in LA test status over time**:
	- **Cumulative incidence of first negative LA test**: The line shows the risk of developing a first negative LA test in the study cohort (n = 164), with the x-axis representing the time in years from study inclusion.
	- *Cumulative incidence of next positive LA test after first negative LA test*: The line reports the risk of a positive LA test after the first negative LA test in the n = 42 patients who experienced a first LA negative test and had follow-up. The x-axis represents the time elapsed since the first negative LA test. Curves were estimated with competing risk estimators. The gray shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval.

Among the 46 patients who turned LA negative, five patients did not have further follow-up. Of the remaining 41 patients, 28 (68%) turned LA positive again, corresponding to a 10-year cumulative incidence of turning positive again of 64% (95% CI, 48–77).

### Presence of direct thrombin inhibitors can affect the results and interpretation of lupus anticoagulant testing [^1168QaDW]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

In vitro experiments were conducted to determine whether the direct thrombin inhibitors argatroban and lepirudin can interfere with the results of lupus anticoagulant (LA) testing. Concentration-response curves were generated to calculate the concentration of anticoagulant that prolongs the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to 75 seconds (2.5 times the baseline average). Corresponding concentrations of anticoagulant were added to plasma samples before running dilute Russell viper venom tests (DRVVTs) and LA-sensitive aPTTs (PTT-LAs). Because the DRVVT test system contains an antiheparin agent, DRVVT results were not prolonged in the presence of heparin.

With argatroban added to normal plasma samples, neither the DRVVT percent correction of ratio nor the DRVVT test/confirm ratio were elevated, but when added to LA-positive plasma, some false-negative results were observed. Lepirudin increased the DRVVT percent correction of ratio and the DRVVT test/confirm ratio into a range that could lead to false-positive identifications of LAs. In sharp contrast to the DRVVT test system, distinction between LA-positive and LA-negative plasma samples was maintained and possibly even enhanced in the platelet neutralization procedure correction phase of the PTT-LA test system.

### Rationale and design of PROACT Xa: A randomized, multicenter, open-label, clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with a mechanical On-X aortic heart valve [^111WJu8z]. American Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists are the only approved oral anticoagulants for long-term prophylaxis against valve thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients with a mechanical heart valve. Despite the proven efficacy and safety of anticoagulation with the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor apixaban compared with warfarin in high-risk populations, including subjects with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism, it remains unknown whether patients with a mechanical heart valve can be safely managed with apixaban. The On-X Aortic Heart Valve and On-X Ascending Aortic Prosthesis with the Vascutek Gelweave Valsalva Graft may have lower rates of valve thrombosis and thromboembolism than conventional bileaflet and tilting disc valves due to its unique pyrolytic carbon composition and flared inlet design.

- **Design**: PROACT Xa is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial comparing apixaban with warfarin in patients with an On-X Aortic Heart Valve or On-X Ascending Aortic Prosthesis with the Vascutek Gelweave Valsalva Graft. The study will randomize approximately 1,000 patients from about 60 sites in North America who underwent aortic valve replacement at least 3 months prior. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive apixaban 5 mg twice daily or warfarin with a target international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0. The last randomized participant will be followed for at least 2 years. The primary efficacy outcome is the composite of valve thrombosis and valve-related thromboembolism, and the primary safety outcome is major bleeding.

### Lupus anticoagulant test persistence over time and its associations with future thrombotic events [^111Ppc8R]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Using an alternative definition of LA positivity that is only based on the LA test and the Rosner Index, and applied to patients regardless of VKA status (described in Supplemental Paragraph 1), we found that 63 patients (38%) developed at least one negative LA test during follow-up. This corresponds to a 10-year cumulative incidence of 39% (95% CI, 31–47). However, even with this alternative classification, we did not observe evidence for an association between turning LA negative and subsequent thrombotic outcomes (see Supplemental Table 5).

### SPL drug information for enoxaparin sodium [^113zzJub]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Contraindication regarding the use of enoxaparin sodium IV (also known as Lovenox) and history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: Do not use enoxaparin in patients with a history of immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia within the past 100 days or in the presence of circulating antibodies.

### Oral apixaban for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism [^115x3Xmn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The study AMPLIFY (apixaban) was published in 2013 in the journal *N Engl J Med* and is related to pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. The trial sought to evaluate the role of apixaban in patients with acute VTE. It was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 5,395 patients (2,228 female and 3,167 male). Patients with acute VTE were included, while key exclusion criteria involved active bleeding, a high risk of bleeding, or other contraindications to treatment with enoxaparin and warfarin. Additionally, exclusion applied to those with cancer planning long-term treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin or dual antiplatelet therapy.

- **Interventions**: The study involved two groups. One group received apixaban (n = 2,609), starting with 10 mg PO BID for 7 days, then 5 mg PO BID for six months. The other group was administered warfarin (n = 2,635), with subcutaneous enoxaparin followed by warfarin.

- **Primary outcome**: The study found a difference not exceeding the non-inferiority margin in symptomatic VTE or death related to VTE (2.3% vs. 2.7%; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.18).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was no significant difference in VTE or death from cardiovascular causes (2.3% vs. 2.9%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.11) and no significant difference in VTE or death from any cause (3.2% vs. 3.9%; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.08). However, there was a significant decrease in VTE, death related to VTE, or major bleeding (2.8% vs. 4.5%; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92).

### Eliquis [^114dw672]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Approximately 25% of an orally administered apixaban dose is recovered in urine and feces as metabolites. Apixaban is metabolized mainly via CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2J2. O-demethylation and hydroxylation at the 3-oxopiperidinyl moiety are the major sites of biotransformation. Unchanged apixaban is the major drug-related component in human plasma; there are no active circulating metabolites.

- **Elimination**: Apixaban is eliminated in both urine and feces. Renal excretion accounts for about 27% of total clearance. Biliary and direct intestinal excretion contribute to the elimination of apixaban in the feces. Apixaban has a total clearance of approximately 3.3 L/hour and an apparent half-life of approximately 12 hours following oral administration. Apixaban is a substrate of transport proteins: P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein.

- **Drug interaction studies**: In vitro apixaban studies, at concentrations significantly greater than therapeutic exposures, showed no inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, or CYP2C19, nor induction effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, apixaban is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Apixaban is not a significant inhibitor of P-gp.

The effects of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban are summarized in Figure 2 [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)].

### Eliquis [^116dBr2w]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Apixaban is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound FXa, and prothrombinase activity. It has no direct effect on platelet aggregation but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban decreases thrombin generation and thrombus development.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: As a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected therapeutic dose are small, subject to a high degree of variability, and not useful in monitoring the anticoagulation effect of apixaban.

	- The Rotachrom® Heparin chromogenic assay was used to measure the effect of apixaban on FXa activity in humans during the apixaban development program. A concentration-dependent increase in anti-FXa activity was observed in the dose range tested and was similar in healthy subjects and patients with AF. This test is not recommended for assessing the anticoagulant effect of apixaban.

- **Effect of PCCs on pharmacodynamics of Eliquis**: There is no clinical experience to reverse bleeding with the use of 4-factor PCC products in individuals who have received Eliquis. Effects of 4-factor PCCs on the pharmacodynamics of apixaban were studied in healthy subjects. Following the administration of apixaban dosed to steady state, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) returned to pre-apixaban levels four hours after the initiation.

### Andexxa [^113WX4eq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Andexxa is indicated for patients treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on the change from baseline in anti-FXa activity in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Studies (14)]. An improvement in hemostasis has not been established, and continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon the results of studies that demonstrate an improvement in hemostasis in patients.

Andexxa (coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo) is a recombinant modified human factor Xa (FXa) protein indicated for patients treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. This indication is also approved under accelerated approval based on the change from baseline in anti-FXa activity in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Studies (1, 14)].

- **Limitations of use**: Andexxa has not been shown to be effective for, and is not indicated for, the treatment of bleeding related to any FXa inhibitors other than apixaban or rivaroxaban.

### Heparin anti-Xa activity, a readily available unique test to quantify apixaban, rivaroxaban, fondaparinux, and danaparoid levels [^113z5PPm]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Low credibility.

Despite their usefulness in perioperative and acute care settings, factor-Xa inhibitor-specific assays are scarcely available, contrary to the heparin anti-Xa assay. We assessed whether the heparin anti-Xa assay can (1) be used as a screening test to rule out apixaban, rivaroxaban, fondaparinux, and danaparoid levels that contraindicate invasive procedures according to guidelines (> 30 ng·mL-1, > 30 ng·mL-1, > 0.1 µg·mL-1, and > 0.1 IU·mL-1, respectively) and (2) quantify the anticoagulant level if found significant, that is, if it exceeded the aforementioned threshold.

- **Methods**: In the derivation cohort and then in the validation cohort, via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we evaluated the ability of the heparin anti-Xa assay to detect levels of factor-Xa inhibitors above or below the aforementioned safety thresholds recommended for an invasive procedure (screening test). Among samples with relevant levels of factor-Xa inhibitor, we determined the conversion factor linking the measured level and heparin anti-Xa activity in a derivation cohort. In a validation cohort, the estimated level of each factor-Xa inhibitor was inferred from heparin anti-Xa activity. The agreement between measured and estimated levels of factor-Xa inhibitors was assessed.

- **Results**: Among 989 (355 patients) and 756 blood samples (420 patients) in the derivation and validation cohort, there was a strong linear relationship between heparin anti-Xa activities and factor-Xa inhibitors measured level (r = 0.99 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.99–0.99]).

### Eliquis [^113CsqZT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including Eliquis, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from Eliquis to warfarin in clinical trials involving patients with atrial fibrillation. If Eliquis is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Lupus anticoagulant detection in anticoagulated patients. Guidance from the Scientific and Standardization Committee for lupus anticoagulant/antiphospholipid antibodies of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [^116SCV5x]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

The laboratory detection of lupus anticoagulants (LA) in anticoagulated patients represents a challenge, and there is no consensus on the types of assays/procedures to be adopted.

- **Objectives**: This communication of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), Scientific and Standardization Committee (SSC) aims to give guidance on the procedures to be adopted.

- **Methods**: Members of the ISTH-SSC on Lupus Anticoagulant/Antiphospholipid Antibodies reviewed the literature to search for evidence on the most appropriate assays/procedures to be adopted.

- **Results**: Anticoagulants are able to interfere with the tests used for LA detection, giving rise to occasional false-positive or false-negative LA. Some commercial tests include in their composition heparin-neutralizers able to quench unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin up to 1.0 U/mL. LA tests are less affected by low molecular weight heparin, but caution is needed in the interpretation of results. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) may affect LA detection. Dilution of test plasma into pooled normal plasma is not a reliable solution, as false-negative or false-positive LA may occur. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) affect LA detection; hence, it is not recommended to attempt LA detection in those patients. The use of DOAC adsorbents is a promising solution and should be further investigated on LA-positive and LA-negative patient populations. Taipan/Ecarin tests may be a solution for VKAs and anti-FXa DOACs, but independent evidence on their value and standardized kits is needed.
