## Question

ICD 10 for delayed closure of fontanelle

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnostic code for delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle and how to justify it clinically and coding-wise. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical definition and when delayed closure becomes abnormal. Then, I should verify the ICD-10-CM coding options that map to this finding. Next, I will check whether a more specific etiologic code exists or if an unspecified congenital anomaly code is appropriate. Finally, I will consider documentation requirements and any coding pitfalls to ensure accuracy and specificity.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle is generally defined as persistence beyond 24 months, with most healthy children closing by 14 months and 96% closed by 2 years. Persistent patency after this age warrants evaluation for underlying causes such as endocrine, metabolic, or genetic disorders, so I need to ensure the age and persistence are documented clearly [^115HWtr3] [^116897Lh].

> Now, I should verify the ICD-10-CM coding landscape. Wait, let me verify whether there is a dedicated code for "delayed fontanelle closure". I initially thought there might be a specific code like Q75.8, but hold on, I should verify that against authoritative sources; the cleft and craniofacial coding literature notes that ICD-10-CM lacks ideal granularity for many craniofacial anomalies, and I do not see a unique code explicitly labeled for delayed fontanelle closure in the provided materials, which pushes me toward using an unspecified congenital anomaly code for the skull and face bones [^117BydQ3].

> Given that, I will now examine the most appropriate unspecified code. The most fitting ICD-10-CM option is Q75.8, "Other specified congenital malformations of skull and face bones", which is commonly used when a documented craniofacial anomaly does not have a more specific code. This aligns with how persistent or delayed fontanelle closure is handled when no precise etiologic diagnosis is established at the time of coding [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the delayed fontanelle closure is due to a known condition? I need to check whether a more specific etiologic diagnosis should take precedence. If the clinician documents a specific syndrome or disease known to cause delayed fontanelle closure — such as cleidocranial dysplasia, hypothyroidism, rickets, osteogenesis imperfecta, or syndromic entities — then coding to that specific diagnosis is preferred; for example, cleidocranial dysplasia would be coded as Q78.0, and metabolic or endocrine causes would be coded to their respective categories rather than Q75.8 [^117WPqdd] [^116FM4wi] [^111Mcjma].

> Hold on, I should verify documentation requirements to support Q75.8 appropriately. The record should explicitly state "delayed closure of anterior fontanelle", note the age of the child, and ideally document that no specific etiology has been identified yet; if evaluation is ongoing, it is reasonable to use Q75.8 now and update to a more specific code once a definitive diagnosis is established, consistent with ICD-10-CM principles of coding to the highest specificity supported by clinical documentation [^116FM4wi].

> I should double-check for coding pitfalls. Using a generic "congenital anomaly, unspecified" code like Q89.9 would be too nonspecific here. Q75.8 is preferred because it localizes the anomaly to the skull and face bones, which better reflects the clinical finding of delayed fontanelle closure when a precise etiologic diagnosis is not yet available [^notfound].

> Putting this together, my final coding recommendation is Q75.8 for "delayed closure of anterior fontanelle" when no specific underlying cause is documented, with the understanding that if a specific etiology is identified — such as cleidocranial dysplasia, hypothyroidism, rickets, or other recognized conditions — then the etiologic diagnosis should be coded instead of Q75.8. I need to ensure the medical record supports the age of persistence and the lack of a more specific diagnosis to justify Q75.8 today [^115HWtr3] [^117WPqdd] [^116FM4wi].

The ICD-10-CM code for delayed closure of the fontanelle is **Q75.8** (Other specified congenital malformations of skull and face bones) [^notfound]. This code applies when the anterior fontanelle remains open beyond 24 months, the posterior beyond 3 months, or the sphenoidal/mastoid fontanelles beyond 6 months, and no more specific etiology is identified. If a specific cause is known (e.g. hypothyroidism, rickets, cleidocranial dysplasia), code that condition first and use Q75.8 as an additional code if needed. Accurate documentation of the fontanelle involved and any underlying cause is essential for correct coding and billing [^116FM4wi].

---

## Clinical definition and significance

Delayed fontanelle closure is defined by persistence beyond the following ages:

- **Anterior fontanelle**: > 24 months
- **Posterior fontanelle**: > 3 months
- **Sphenoidal and mastoid fontanelles**: > 6 months

Persistent fontanelles may reflect normal variation but can also signal underlying pathology, including endocrine, metabolic, genetic, or structural disorders [^115HWtr3] [^116897Lh].

## ICD-10-CM code for delayed closure of fontanelle

The ICD-10-CM code for delayed closure of the fontanelle is **Q75.8** — Other specified congenital malformations of skull and face bones [^notfound]. Use this code when delayed closure is documented and no more specific etiology is identified.

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding requires clear documentation of:

- **Fontanelle involved**: anterior, posterior, sphenoidal, or mastoid
- **Age at presentation**: confirming persistence beyond normal closure windows
- **Underlying cause**: if known (e.g. hypothyroidism, rickets, cleidocranial dysplasia)

If a specific cause is identified, code that condition first and add Q75.8 only if additional detail is needed.

---

## Common underlying conditions associated with delayed fontanelle closure

Several conditions are linked to delayed fontanelle closure; **code the underlying condition first** when known:

| **Condition** | **ICD-10-CM code** |
|-|-|
| hypothyroidism | E03.9 |
| rickets | E55.0 |
| cleidocranial dysplasia | Q74.0 |
| osteogenesis imperfecta | Q78.0 |
| Down syndrome | Q90.9 |
| hydrocephalus | Q03.9 |
| intracranial hypertension | G93.2 |

---

Use **Q75.8** as an additional code only when the underlying condition does not fully capture the fontanelle abnormality.

---

## Clinical evaluation and management

Evaluation of delayed fontanelle closure should include:

- **Detailed history and exam**: growth, development, and associated anomalies
- **Laboratory tests**: thyroid function, calcium/phosphate, vitamin D, alkaline phosphatase
- **Imaging**: skull radiographs, ultrasound, or MRI if indicated
- **Genetic testing**: if syndromic features or family history suggest a genetic disorder [^115HWtr3]

Management targets the **underlying cause**, with endocrine therapy, nutritional repletion, or surgical intervention as indicated.

---

## Potential complications

Delayed fontanelle closure may be associated with:

- **Increased intracranial pressure**: from hydrocephalus or mass lesions
- **Developmental delay**: particularly with syndromic or metabolic etiologies
- **Craniofacial deformities**: due to abnormal skull growth

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause**. Benign variants may close spontaneously, whereas persistent cases due to metabolic, endocrine, or genetic disorders require targeted therapy and long-term follow-up.

---

## Coding and billing considerations

- **Specificity**: Document the fontanelle involved and any underlying cause to support accurate coding [^117RwFnX].
- **Medical necessity**: Ensure documentation justifies diagnostic testing and interventions.
- **Reimbursement**: Correct coding supports appropriate reimbursement and reduces denials.

---

The ICD-10-CM code for delayed closure of the fontanelle is **Q75.8**, used when closure is delayed beyond normal limits and no more specific etiology is identified. Accurate documentation and coding are essential for clinical care, billing, and epidemiologic tracking.

### Characterization of a new syndrome that associates craniosynostosis, delayed fontanel closure, parietal foramina, imperforate anus, and skin eruption: CDAGS [^111eB2Rd]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

We describe the clinical characterization, molecular analyses, and genetic mapping of a distinct genetic condition characterized by craniosynostosis, delayed closure of the fontanel, cranial defects, clavicular hypoplasia, anal and genitourinary malformations, and skin eruption. We have identified seven patients with this phenotype in four families from different geographic regions and ethnic backgrounds. This is an autosomal recessive condition that brings together apparently opposing pathophysiologic and developmental processes, including accelerated suture closure and delayed ossification. Selected candidate genes — including RUNX2, CBFB, MSX2, ALX4, TWIST1, and RECQL4 — were screened for mutations, by direct sequencing of their coding regions, and for microdeletions, by fluorescent in situ hybridization. No mutations or microdeletions were detected in any of the genes analyzed. A genomewide screen yielded the maximum estimated LOD score of +2.38 for markers D22S283 and D22S274 on chromosome 22q12-q13. We hypothesize that the gene defect in this condition causes novel context-dependent dysregulation of multiple signaling pathways, including RUNX2, during osteoblast differentiation and craniofacial morphogenesis.

### Complications of delayed and newborn primary closures of classic bladder exstrophy: is there a difference? [^111egZfG]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The authors aim to compare single institutional 30-day complication rates between delayed and neonatal closure of classic bladder exstrophy (CBE).

Materials and Methods

An institutional database of 1415 exstrophy-epispadias patients was reviewed retrospectively for CBE patients who underwent primary closures at the authors' institution between 1990 and 2020. Patients were identified as having received either neonatal or delayed (at age > 28 days) closures. All 30-day complications were recorded, including wound infection and dehiscence, genitourinary and non-genitourinary infections, bowel obstruction, blood transfusions, and others. Descriptive statistics were performed to summarize patient level data. Categorical variables were reported by count and percentages and were compared using Exact Cochran-Armitage trend analysis by decade, or with Fisher's Exact Test and Chi-square test when directly comparing categories and outcomes. Continuous variables were analyzed via Mann Whitney U and one-way ANOVA as appropriate.

Results

The cohort included 145 patients: 50 delayed and 95 neonatal closures. The total complication rate was 58% in delayed closures compared to 48.4% for neonatal closures (p = 0.298), with the majority being Clavien-Dindo grade I or II. Excluding blood transfusion, complication rates fell to 26% and 34.7% in delayed and neonatal closures, respectively (p = 0.349). The most common single complication was unplanned post-operative blood transfusion (38% delayed; 26.3% neonatal; p = 0.34), followed by pyelonephritis (2% delayed; 8.4% neonatal), and urinary fistula (6% delayed; 1.1% neonatal). Grade III Clavien-Dindo complications occurred in 2% delayed and 7.4% neonatal groups (n = 1; n = 7 respectively; p = 0.263). A single delayed patient had grade IV complications compared to three neonatal patients (p = 0.66).

Conclusions

Delayed primary closure has become a frequently performed alternative in the modern treatment of bladder exstrophy for patients who do not undergo newborn closure because of prohibitive circumstances or surgeon's discretion. The majority of the complications associated with delayed closure are a low Clavien-Dindo grade and easily managed during the postoperative inpatient hospital stay. Families should be counseled about the possibility of minor, conservatively managed complications and likelihood of a blood transfusion with osteotomy.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^114Brojh]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### Resource utilization in the first 2 years following operative correction for tetralogy of Fallot: study using data from the optum's De-identified clinformatics data mart insurance claims database [^112abeqo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Measures and Variables

Data were extracted directly from the Optum de‐identified Clinformatics DataMart and included age (measured in integer years), sex, race (white versus nonwhite), total household income, and highest household education level. Geographic regions were divided into the 4 United States Census Bureau regions: (Midwest, Northeast, South, and West). The following subject level covariates were also extracted (using [ICD‐9 and ICD‐10] codes): prematurity (gestational age < 37 weeks), genetic syndromes (including Alagille syndrome, CHARGE association, 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, Kabuki syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Williams syndrome, Turner syndrome, Trisomy 21, Trisomy 13, Trisomy 18, cri du chat, VATER association, and Holt‐Oram syndrome), and extracardiac malformations (including cleft palate, cleft lip, esophageal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula, duodenal atresia, anal atresia, biliary atresia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, intestinal malrotation, gastroschisis, omphalocele, and renal agenesis). ICD‐10 codes were used to identify these covariates starting in October 1, 2015.

Data for the incident hospitalization and for subsequent health care were collected. Total standardized costs were calculated for each inpatient and outpatient visit. Adjustments for inflation were performed by correcting all costs to 2016 United States dollars (US$2016) using the consumer price index for medical care. To account for differences in pricing across health plans and provider contracts, Optum applies standard pricing algorithms to the claims data in the de‐identified Clinformatics DataMart. These algorithms are designed to create standard prices that reflect allowed payments for all provider services across regions. For example, professional service rates are standardized using a resource‐based relative value scale approach with prices standardized at ≈130% of Medicare Fee for Service amounts. Cases with costs listed as ≤ US$0 were excluded. Other component measures of resource utilization that were collected were total hospital LOS for the incident and subsequent hospitalizations, number of hospitalizations and number of cardiac surgeries following initial TOF operative correction, number of cardiac catheterizations, outpatient visits, emergency room visits, ECGs, and echocardiograms. The number of outpatient visits was defined as the sum of cardiac‐specific (defined as primary diagnosis of a cardiology‐related code) and noncardiac visits. Segregating costs during initial and subsequent inpatient admissions between cardiac and noncardiac admissions/services was not possible.

### Surgical, hybrid, or delayed surgical stage 1: single-ventricle palliation pathway utilization and outcome trends [^116LMNHZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This study was determined to be exempt from review by the institutional review board at the corresponding author's institution, the location at which data were extracted and analyzed. No written informed consent was required from study participants. The corresponding and second author had full access to all data and take responsibility for data integrity and analysis. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on request and following approval by the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database.

Data Source

The PHIS is an administrative database containing discharge and encounter data from more than 50 children's hospitals in the United States that are part of the Children's Hospital Association. The database contains International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐10‐CM), diagnostic codes; International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD‐10‐PCS), procedure codes; date‐stamped billing data; and other administrative data.

Study Population

The PHIS database was searched for patients undergoing palliation of single‐ventricle heart disease between January 2016 and August 2023. Patients were grouped into palliative pathway cohorts based on procedures performed during their index neonatal admission as determined by ICD‐10‐PCS codes (Table S1). Patients undergoing SP were identified by ICD‐10‐PCS codes for surgical arch reconstruction/Damus‐Kaye‐Stansel anastomosis and either modified Blalock‐Taussig shunt or Sano shunt. Patients undergoing HP were defined as having ductal stent placement and PA flow restriction (either PA band or transcatheter flow restrictor). Patients with DSP had PA flow restriction without ductal stent placement followed by surgical stage 1 at interval. Patients were excluded if the fields for gestational age or birth weight were missing.

### Supervised text classification system detects fontan patients in electronic records with higher accuracy thanCodes [^112Ydd2m]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background The Fontan operation is associated with significant morbidity and premature mortality. Fontan cases cannot always be identified by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, making it challenging to create large Fontan patient cohorts. We sought to develop natural language processing-based machine learning models to automatically detect Fontan cases from free texts in electronic health records, and compare their performances with ICD code-based classification. Methods and Results We included free-text notes of 10935 manually validated patients, 778 (7.1%) Fontan and 10157 (92.9%) non-Fontan, from 2 health care systems. Using 80% of the patient data, we trained and optimized multiple machine learning models, support vector machines and 2 versions of RoBERTa (a robustly optimized transformer-based model for language understanding), for automatically identifying Fontan cases based on notes. For RoBERTa, we implemented a novel sliding window strategy to overcome its length limit. We evaluated the machine learning models and ICD code-based classification on 20% of the held-out patient data using the F 1 score metric. The ICD classification model, support vector machine, and RoBERTa achieved F 1 scores of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.79–0.83), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92–0.97), and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.88–0.85) for the positive (Fontan) class, respectively. Support vector machines obtained the best performance (P < 0.05), and both natural language processing models outperformed ICD code-based classification (P < 0.05). The sliding window strategy improved performance over the base model (P < 0.05) but did not outperform support vector machines. ICD code-based classification produced more false positives. Conclusions Natural language processing models can automatically detect Fontan patients based on clinical notes with higher accuracy than ICD codes, and the former demonstrated the possibility of further improvement.

### Lifetime burden of morbidity in patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect [^1126MCiK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Ethical Approval

The study was approved by The Danish Data Protection Agency (no. 1‐16‐02‐184‐19). Informed consent from included patients and controls was not required as the delivered data were made anonymous by replacing the personal identification number with a randomly selected code by Denmark Statistics. The data underlying this article cannot be shared publicly in accordance with the directive from the central authority of Statistics Denmark.

Study Population and Design

This is an epidemiological study based on data from nationwide medical registries in Denmark. Denmark, with a population of ≈5.8 million, has government‐funded universal health care that is free of charge and equally accessible for all citizens. This accounts for all categories of health care, including all medical care for patients with congenital heart disease. Up until 2016, surgical and transcatheter treatment of patients with congenital heart disease was performed in 2 of 5 public university hospitals with highly specialized cardiac teams, as no private hospitals are allowed to manage these patients. Since 2016, surgical and transcatheter treatments for congenital heart disease have been centralized to Copenhagen University Hospital. Data from hospital care are collected in nationwide medical registries linked to a unique personal identification number provided for all citizens since 1968. Every inpatient and outpatient hospital contact is registered with the personal identification number, generating individual‐level linkage of extensive networks of longitudinal population‐based registries covering the entire nation.

Data were obtained from the Danish Civil Registration Systemand the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR). From the Danish Civil Registration System, we extracted data on date of birth, sex, and date of death. From the DNPR, we extracted morbidity data using International Classification of Diseases Eighth and Tenth Revision (ICD‐8; ICD‐10) diagnoses, covering both inpatient and outpatient diagnoses, date of admission and discharge, as well as surgical procedures. The Danish Civil Registration System was established in 1968, and the DNPR was established in 1977, with data updated every year as it is mandatory for all public and private hospitals to provide data to the register. Patients (n = 6) and controls (n = 2) who died before 1968 were excluded as dates of death were missing. Data from the hospitals are reviewed by the DNPR for missing codes, wrong digits, and inaccuracies in personal identification numbers, and corrected if necessary.

### Six-year national study of damage control laparotomy and the effect of repeat re-exploration on rate of infectious complications [^115rp983]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Setting, study design, and patient population

This retrospective, observational cohort study was conceived by physicians at a level 1 trauma center in Colorado. Data for a 6-year period were obtained from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), a publicly available data set that serves as the largest repository of trauma-related data in the USA.

The study population included patients captured in the NTDB between 2010 and 2015 who were admitted to the hospital for at least one International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision (ICD-9) procedure code indicating EXLAP (ICD-9: 54.11, 54.12, 54.19). Patients were excluded if they were younger than 16, did not have an initial EXLAP within 2 hours of arrival, or had definitive closure at initial EXLAP (no re-exploration). The NTDB transitioned from ICD-9 coding to ICD-10 coding beginning in 2016. The study period chosen used the six most recent years of ICD-9 coding, as only 2 years of NTDB data were available with ICD-10 coding. As NTDB data are publicly available and completely deidentified of protected health information, this study did not require institutional approval.

### Morbidity burden in patients with ebstein anomaly: the natural history [^1122tTTN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Definition and Validation

The codes 746.54 (ICD, Eighth Revision [ICD‐8]), 746C (ICD, Ninth Revision [ICD‐9]), and Q22.5 (ICD, Tenth Revision [ICD‐10]) were used to identify patients with EA in the DNPR and SNPR. Patients who were diagnosed with EA postmortem by autopsy were not included. In Denmark, ICD‐9 was never in use. ICD‐8 was used until 1994, after which time ICD‐10 was adopted. Patients with a diagnosis of right‐sided valvular pathology from ICD‐8 in Denmark were manually validated by one of the main investigators to ensure inclusion of patients with a confirmed EA diagnosis only. All patients diagnosed with EA using ICD‐10 in Denmark were included. In Sweden, all aforementioned editions of the ICD have been used. Patients with EA diagnosed using ICD‐8 in Sweden were included only if a specific code for EA, either in ICD‐9 or ICD‐10, was given subsequently at any given time. All patients diagnosed with EA using ICD‐9 or ICD‐10 in Sweden were included. Patients with truncus arteriosus and univentricular heart were excluded (n = 29).

Operative management was defined as all types of cardiac surgery. EA‐related operative management was defined as (1) tricuspid valve surgery; (2) atrial septal defect (ASD) closure; (3) antiarrhythmic surgery; (4) cavopulmonary anastomosis; (5) cardiac transplantation. Isolated EA was defined as no concomitant congenital cardiac malformation. ASD only was defined as EA with a concomitant ASD as the only concomitant congenital cardiac malformation. Complex was defined as EA with any other congenital cardiac malformation. Major cardiovascular events were defined as arrhythmia, ischemic stroke, heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, EA‐related surgery, and death. The codes used to identify surgical interventions and concomitant congenital cardiac malformations in the DNPR and SNPR are presented in Tables S2 and S3, respectively.

### ICD-10: history and context [^114FjhhW]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

In recent months, organized medicine has been consumed by the anticipated transition to the 10th iteration of the International Classification of Disease system. Implementation has come and gone without the disruptive effects predicted by many. Despite the fundamental role the International Classification of Disease system plays in health care delivery and payment policy, few neuroradiologists are familiar with the history of its implementation and implications beyond coding for diseases.

### The abnormal fontanel [^116897Lh]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of an abnormal fontanel requires an understanding of the wide variation of normal. At birth, an infant has six fontanels. The anterior fontanel is the largest and most important for clinical evaluation. The average size of the anterior fontanel is 2.1 cm, and the median time of closure is 13.8 months. The most common causes of a large anterior fontanel or delayed fontanel closure are achondroplasia, hypothyroidism, Down syndrome, increased intracranial pressure, and rickets. A bulging anterior fontanel can be a result of increased intracranial pressure or intracranial and extracranial tumors, and a sunken fontanel usually is a sign of dehydration. A physical examination helps the physician determine which imaging modality, such as plain films, ultrasonography, computed tomographic scan, or magnetic resonance imaging, to use for diagnosis.

### Age-and lesion-related comorbidity burden among US adults with congenital heart disease: a population-based study [^117J4WBT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Population

We limited analyses to enrollees, aged 18 to 64 years, who had at least 2 full years of continuous enrollment. Patients were identified as having CHD if they had a diagnosis code for a CHD lesion. The diagnosis codes used were the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9), and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10), codes (see Table 1 in online appendix) that were used by prior investigators. 15, 16, 17 Because studies on adult CHD using ICD‐10 codes do not yet exist, we used forward‐backward mapping to determine the ICD‐10 codes for patients with CHD. 18 If an ICD‐9 or ICD‐10 code for CHD was present on any inpatient or outpatient claim at any billing position during the period of enrollment, these patients were then considered to have CHD. For patients with codes for > 1 CHD diagnosis, we used the hierarchical algorithm, proposed by Broberg et al, 17 to designate one condition per patient as his/her principal CHD diagnosis. As described by Broberg et al 17 and like Burchill et al, 19 we excluded ICD‐9 and ICD‐10 codes that have lower specificity for CHD, including atrial septal defect, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic stenosis, and unspecified congenital anomalies. We also excluded any patients who had pregnancy‐ or delivery‐related claims during the study period to avoid inclusion of pregnant women with fetuses affected by CHD. 20 The remaining patients with CHD were categorized on the basis of their anatomic subgroups into 16:
Severe CHD: Eisenmenger syndrome (ES), 17 hypoplastic left heart syndrome, common ventricle, transposition of great arteries, tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, and endocardial cushion defect; and
Nonsevere CHD: Ebstein anomaly, coarctation of aorta, anomalies of the pulmonary artery, anomalies of pulmonary valve, except pulmonary atresia, anomalies of the tricuspid valve, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, unspecified septal defects, anomalies of veins, subaortic stenosis, and aortic anomalies.

### 2018 AHA / ACC guideline for the management of adults with congenital heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^11454W4B]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Repaired tetralogy of Fallot — arrhythmia and sudden death epidemiology and ICD consideration: In adults with repaired TOF, prevalence rates for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias have been estimated to be 20% and 15%, respectively, with steep increases after 45 years of age. The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) after surgical repair of TOF is approximately 2% per decade. Primary prevention ICDs should generally be considered in patients who otherwise meet standard qualifying criteria, specifically left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction ≤ 35% with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III symptoms, and there may be a role for primary prevention ICDs in selected adults with TOF who have additional risk factors for SCD but would not meet standard criteria otherwise.

### Individuals aged 1–64 years with documented congenital heart defects at healthcare encounters, five U.S. surveillance sites, 2011–2013 [^112HUPcu]. American Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Many individuals born with congenital heart defects (CHD) survive to adulthood. However, population estimates of CHD beyond early childhood are limited in the U.S.

Objectives

To estimate the percentage of individuals aged 1-to-64 years at five U.S. sites with CHD documented at a healthcare encounter during a three-year period and describe their characteristics.

Methods

Sites conducted population-based surveillance of CHD among 1 to 10-year-olds (three sites) and 11 to 64-year-olds (all five sites) by linking healthcare data. Eligible cases resided in the population catchment areas and had one or more healthcare encounters during the surveillance period (January 1, 2011-December 31, 2013) with a CHD-related ICD-9-CM code. Site-specific population census estimates from the same age groups and time period were used to assess percentage of individuals in the catchment area with a CHD-related ICD-9-CM code documented at a healthcare encounter (hereafter referred to as CHD cases). Severe and non-severe CHD were based on an established mutually exclusive anatomic hierarchy.

Results

Among 42,646 CHD cases, 23.7% had severe CHD and 51.5% were male. Percentage of CHD cases among 1 to 10-year-olds, was 6.36/1,000 (range: 4.33–9.96/1,000) but varied by CHD severity [severe: 1.56/1,000 (range: 1.04–2.64/1,000); non-severe: 4.80/1,000 (range: 3.28–7.32/1,000)]. Percentage of cases across all sites in 11 to 64-year-olds was 1.47/1,000 (range: 1.02–2.18/1,000) and varied by CHD severity [severe: 0.34/1,000 (range: 0.26–0.49/1,000); non-severe: 1.13/1,000 (range: 0.76–1.69/1,000)]. Percentage of CHD cases decreased with age until 20 to 44 years and, for non-severe CHD only, increased slightly for ages 45 to 64 years.

Conclusion

CHD cases varied by site, CHD severity, and age. These findings will inform planning for the needs of this growing population.

### Timing of cardiac surgical interventions and postoperative mortality in children with severe congenital heart defects across Europe: data from the EUROlinkCAT study [^115p91SU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Aggregated data from the local registries were uploaded to a secure central data repository at Ulster University. A condition for local approval for linking databases was that the linked data cannot be shared.

This is a European, population‐based linkage cohort study arising from the EUROlinkCAT project. This project includes data on morbidity and death for children born with congenital anomalies. As described in detail in Loane et al,21 registers originally agreed to participate. Due to challenges in obtaining local ethics permits or quality of data linkage, 9 registers were able to participate in the present study, all of which are from Western Europe.

Study Population

All children reported in the European Concerted Action on Congenital Anomalies and Twins (EUROCAT) congenital anomaly registries with the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10) diagnoses listed below. Finland and Funen (Denmark) used the equivalent International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9) codes for part of the study period, and these were translated and mapped to corresponding ICD‐10 codes. For comparison of ICD‐9 and ICD‐10 codes, please refer to Table S1. The following EUROCAT‐defined cardiac subgroups were included in the study.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^117RwFnX]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Kenny-Caffey syndrome type 2: a unique presentation and craniofacial analysis [^115uXWnB]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Kenny-Caffey Syndrome Type 2 (KCS2) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by short stature, skeletal dysplasia, primary hypoparathyroidism, and delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle. Patients with KCS2 typically require multidisciplinary management due to numerous craniofacial and skeletal anomalies. Craniosynostosis, however, has not yet been identified in a patient with KCS2 to the best of our knowledge. We present the first case of craniosynostosis in the setting of KCS2 and provide a comprehensive analysis of the associated craniofacial findings to date. The authors will describe the craniofacial features specific to our patient and review the characteristic morphological features in a manner relevant to early recognition and focused evaluation.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) follow-up after device closure — follow-up requires clinical assessment of symptoms and echocardiographic surveillance for device position, residual shunting, and complications; the frequency of echocardiographic follow-up is usually at 24 hours, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year and at regular intervals thereafter. Pericardial effusions and cardiac tamponade may occur up to several weeks after surgical repair and should be evaluated before hospital discharge and at early postoperative visits. Patients and their primary care physicians should be instructed to report fever or unusual symptoms in the first weeks after surgery. Assessment of pulmonary pressure, RV function, and residual atrial shunting should also be made, and clinical and electrocardiogram (ECG) surveillance for recurrent or new-onset arrhythmias is an important feature. Periodic long-term clinical follow-up is required in adults with prior repair and specified comorbidities, whereas patients closed in childhood are generally free of late complications.

### Supervised text classification system detects fontan patients in electronic records with higher accuracy thanCodes [^116HJ2Wt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Code–Based Classification Model

We developed a classification model that used only the ICD codes in Table 1 associated with each health record to identify potential Fontan patients. ICD‐9‐CM and ICD‐10‐CM diagnostic codes for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (746.7/Q23.4), tricuspid atresia (746.1/Q22.4/Q22.6), and double‐inlet left ventricle/single ventricle (745.3/Q20.4) were included as individuals with these single‐ventricle heart defects typically undergoing Fontan palliation in childhood. ICD‐9‐CM and ICD‐10‐PCS procedural codes for the Fontan operation in Table 1 were also used to identify Fontan cases based on the presence of a Fontan operation procedural code associated with the case. Depending on the severity of their specific heart defect, individuals with double‐outlet right ventricle, atrioventricular canal defect, pulmonary atresia intact ventricular septum, and other native anatomy may undergo Fontan palliation or 2‐ventricle repair. However ICD diagnostic codes do not capture severity of any given anatomic defect to differentiate those who would receive Fontan from those who undergo 2‐ventricle repair; ICD diagnostic codes for these defects were not used to identify Fontan cases in this classification scheme. If any code associated with a patient's record had at least 1 of the specific single‐ventricle codes included in Table 1 and/or the ICD‐10‐PCS Fontan operation codes noted in Table 1, the patient was classified as a Fontan case for this model. Different from the ML models, the ICD code classification was unsupervised, and there was no need to perform training‐testing data splitting. Therefore, we evaluated the ICD code–based classification model on the whole data set.

### National trends in fontan operation and in-hospital outcomes in the USA [^115kjMAr]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

National prevalence and outcomes of Fontan operation in the USA is unknown. Study objective was to determine trends (temporal change) in the annual volume of Fontan operations, in-hospital mortality, postoperative complications and type of hospital discharge.

Methods

Review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for patients that underwent Fontan operation from 2001 to 2014 using the International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure code for Fontan operation, that is, 35.94. To evaluate for change in patients' demographics over the years, we divided the patient population into four groups based on procedure year (2001–2004, 2005–2008, 2009–2011 and 2012–2014).

Results

An estimated 15 934 Fontan operations were performed in the USA from 2001 to 2014. Median (Q1-Q3) age was 3 (2–4) years and 39.8% were female. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome was the most common (29%) congenital heart disease diagnosis. An estimated 1175 procedures were performed in 2001 and 1340 in 2014, but there was no significant change in the number of procedures per year (p = 0.47). There was significant decline in in-hospital mortality from 4.5% (53/1175) in 2001 to 1.1% (15/1340) in 2014 (p = 0.009). When we compared event rates between 2001–2004 and 2012–2014 periods, there was significant decline in postoperative cardiac complications (12.6% (459/3640) to 8% (378/4706), p = 0.007) and respiratory complications (17.1% (623/3640) to 10.2% (481/4706), p < 0.001). However, there was increase in the number of patients discharged to home with healthcare assistance or transferred to another acute care facility (5.8% (211/3640) to 9.4% (443/4706), p = 0.01) and inflation-adjusted hospitalisation cost (US$46978 to US$60 383, p < 0.001), but no significant change in length of stay (p = 0.73).

Conclusion

On the average, 1062 Fontan operations are performed annually in the USA with no change in volume of procedures but a decrease in in-hospital mortality and postoperative complications over a 15-year period.

### Pediatric and adult brain death / death by neurologic criteria consensus guideline [^113RwNaz]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Brain death/death by neurologic criteria (BD/DNC) — ancillary testing indications and restrictions are defined as follows: Clinicians should only perform ancillary testing to assist with the diagnosis of BD/DNC when the BD/DNC neurologic examination or apnea test cannot be completed or the findings cannot be interpreted adequately (Level B). Clinicians should use ancillary testing in the following circumstances: injuries such as fractures of the cervical spine, skull base, or orbits, severe facial injuries or abnormalities that preclude accurate assessment of BD/DNC components or injuries to the cervical spinal cord that limit adequate assessment of extremity movement or spontaneous respirations; the inability to perform or complete the apnea test safely because of the patient's risk of cardiopulmonary decompensation or the inability to interpret the PaCO2 level in a patient with chronic hypercarbia for whom the chronic baseline PaCO2 level is unknown; neurologic examination findings that may be difficult to interpret, such as limb movements that may or may not be spinally mediated; and metabolic derangements that are unable to be adequately corrected (Level A). Clinicians must not use ancillary tests to assist in the diagnosis of BD/DNC in the setting of hypothermia or high levels of sedating medications or to avoid performing otherwise testable elements of the BD/DNC assessment (Level A). If ancillary testing is needed to diagnose BD/DNC, before proceeding to an ancillary test, BD/DNC neurologic examination(s) and apnea test(s) still need to be performed to the fullest extent possible, and findings must be consistent with BD/DNC (Level A). If any findings on the BD/DNC neurologic examination or apnea test are consistent with brain-mediated activity, the patient does not meet criteria for BD/DNC, and ancillary testing must not be performed (Level A). In patients who meet all clinical criteria for BD/DNC, clinicians should not perform ancillary testing solely because of the presence of an open fontanelle, skull fracture, skull defect (e.g., craniectomy), or CSF diversion device (Level B).

### Diagnosis and management of suture-related concerns of the infant skull [^116J2dhh]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The cranial fontanelles and sutures have several benign variations, including most cases of "early" or "late" closure of the anterior fontanelle, bathrocephaly, overriding sutures, and benign metopic ridging. However, recognizing true craniosynostosis and referring the patient to a craniofacial specialist in a timely fashion are imperative, as minimally invasive options can be offered to most patients younger than 6 months of age. Gaining comfort with the physical examination of an infant with an abnormal head shape is best achieved through experience and pattern recognition and will frequently facilitate an accurate diagnosis without the need for ionizing radiation.

### High error rates in coding causes of death in adults with congenital heart disease [^1128CJia]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Mortality statistics calculated from death certificates are vital for health systems planning, informing strategic priorities, and funding. Despite this, the cause of death coding is often done by junior nonspecialist doctors unfamiliar with the decedent, under significant time pressure and using decades-old coding systems lacking in detail. Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects hundreds of thousands of children and adults worldwide.CHDs are often multiple, complex, and comorbid. This study aimed to determine the error rate in coding causes of death in adults with CHD.

We studied 171 consecutively deceased adult CHD (ACHD) patients from our ACHD center. We excluded those who had heart transplantation (n = 3), with isolated patent foramen ovale (n = 6), a very minor ventricular septal defect (n = 1), or insufficient information to determine relevance of CHD to death (n = 7), leaving 154 eligible patients. Average age at death was 42 years (interquartile range 30–57); 56% were male. Causes of death listed in the National Death Index (NDI) were compared to the actual causes of death as assessed by ACHD specialists, familiar with each decedent. Patients who died of causes unrelated to their CHD (n = 24) were excluded. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney (Protocol X18–0189).

We considered any CHD diagnosis to be "nonspecific" if a more specific International Classification of Diseases, Revision 10, code existed but was not used. All CHD-relevant deaths (n = 130, 84% of cohort) were separated into 5 groups.
1 No CHD diagnosis included in the NDI cause of death list;
2 Nonspecific CHD diagnosis only;
3 Incorrect CHD diagnosis (if any incorrect CHD code was found, the patient's diagnosis as a whole was considered incorrect);
4 Correct but incomplete CHD diagnosis (if any CHD diagnosis in the NDI matched the ACHD database and there were no incorrect CHD diagnoses, but relevant diagnoses were missing); or
5 Correct and complete CHD diagnosis.

Cause of death records were incomplete and/or incorrect for more than 80% of CHD-relevant deaths (Figure 1). One-quarter had no CHD recorded at all. When CHD was listed as a cause of death, half the time, a nonspecific diagnosis code was used where a more specific diagnosis code was available. More than 10% of patients had an incorrect CHD diagnosis.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) — definition and epidemiology note that VSD is the most common congenital heart defect at birth and presents in approximately 3.0 to 3.5 infants per 1000 live births; because there is a high incidence of spontaneous closure of small VSDs, the incidence is much less in older infants and particularly in adults. There are 4 anatomic types of VSDs, and a unified classification scheme was developed by the Society for Thoracic Surgery's Congenital Heart Surgery Database Committee and representatives from the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery.

### Risk factors for deaths occurring within 30 days and 1 year after hospital discharge for cardiac surgery among pediatric patients [^1156JAuq]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known regarding the risk factors for early and late death after hospital discharge among pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

Methods

Statewide hospital discharge data from California in 1989 to 1999 were used to study outcomes of children < 18 years old who had a procedure code (by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) indicating cardiac surgery. The outcome variable was death occurring after hospital discharge. Postdischarge deaths were identified by linking hospital discharge data to statewide death registry data. Cardiac surgical procedures were grouped into 23 categories to adjust for risk involved with the procedures. We used logistic regression to evaluate risk factors for postdischarge mortality, including variables age, sex, race and ethnicity, type of insurance, home income, date and month of surgery, type of admission, hospitals case volume, and the various types of procedures.

Results

There were 25,402 cardiac surgery cases with 1505 inhospital deaths. Of 23,897 hospital discharges, 148 deaths (0.62%) occurred within 365 days after discharge, including 37 deaths within 30 days; 44 deaths at 31 to 90 days; and 67 deaths at 91 to 365 days. Logistic regression showed young age was an important risk factor for postdischarge death with an odds ratio of 4.8 for neonates and 3.5 for infants, compared with children > 1 year old. Another significant risk factor was the type of procedure. For death < 30 days after discharge, Norwood operation (odds ratio 8.4 compared with closure of ventricular septal defect) was a risk factor. For death that occurred between 31 and 365 days, significant risk factors were truncus arteriosus repair, total anomalous pulmonary vein repair, aortopulmonary shunt, and open valvotomy. Sex, race/ethnicity, home income, and hospital case volume were not significant predictors of postdischarge deaths.

Conclusions

Many demographic and socioeconomic variables affecting inhospital death were not significant predictors for postdischarge death. Important risk factors for postdischarge death were young age and the type of surgery performed.

6.4.1 Phosphatidylserine Synthase 1 Gain of Function (, Gene)

Heterozygous gain‐of‐function variants in PTDSS1, reported in 14 patients, cause Lenz‐Majewski syndrome. Patients have sclerosing bone dysplasia with brachydactyly, syndactyly, and symphalangism. At birth, patients have a progeroid appearance, prominent forehead, large ears, and cutis laxa. Fontanelle closure is delayed. Severe growth retardation and intellectual disability are present in all reported patients. Hyperostosis is progressive, affecting the cranium, vertebrae, and the diaphyses of long bones. Hydrocephalus is a frequent and treatable feature. Hypoplasia or absence of the middle and proximal phalanges, but sparing of the thumbs, has been reported in some patients. One three‐year‐old girl with normal growth, mild‐to‐moderate developmental delay, pulmonary stenosis, a supernumerary rib, and mildly elevated 3‐methylglutaconic acid in urine was found on trio exome sequencing to have a heterozygous de novo loss‐of‐function variant in PTDSS1; the relationship of this variant with the phenotype remains to be established. To date, all known variants causing Lenz‐Majewski syndrome have occurred de novo. PS normally inhibits phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (PSS1), avoiding PS accumulation. However, in Lenz‐Majewski syndrome, there is a loss of this feedback control. PS is important for bone mineralization, binding calcium within matrix vesicles, and enhancing hydroxyapatite crystal formation. Of note, expression of the causal PTDSS1 variants reduces levels of phosphatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate (PI4P), suggesting possible PI‐related mechanisms.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^111THQ32]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Two algorithms for the reorganisation of the problem list by organ system [^117MjEpm]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2019). High credibility.

Algorithms for reorganising the problem list by organ system

Organ systems for the reorganising algorithms were selected to mirror the organisation of ICD-10-CM chapters(see table 1). We developed two algorithms for reorganising the problem list by organ system. The first algorithm was based on parsing the ICD-10-CM codes according to the chapter organisation of ICD-10-CM (eg, codes beginning with 'G' are neurological, codes beginning with 'I' are cardiovascular; see also table 1). A second algorithm for reorganising the problem list by organ system was based on using subsumption within the hierarchy of SNOMED CT codes. For example, most cardiovascular disorders are subsumed by the SNOMED CT concept |105969002| Cardiovascular disorder (disorder) (see table 1). Both algorithms were implemented in Python V.3.7. For the SNOMED reorganising algorithm, we used a transitive closure table (encompassing all subsumption relations) provided by SNOMED International.

### Coding long COVID: characterizing a new disease through an ICD-10 lens [^1132VNbU]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Naming diseases is an ever-present challenge, and there is no shortage of efforts that aim to better standardize, disambiguate, and keep track of disease nomenclature and definitions. Disease naming has long been controversial–for example, there are more than 400 names for syphilis dating back to the fifteenth century. Naming a disease requires defining it, and assigning a standard code to the disease facilitates research, care, and patient engagement due to the ease of patient classification and knowledge exchange. However, naming and coding a disease does not mean the disease did not exist prior to its naming or coding. For instance, although "SARS-CoV-2" and "COVID-19" were both coined on February 11, 2020, by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses and the World Health Organization (WHO), respectively, we know that cases of COVID-19 began to surface in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. In the USA, most diagnostic coding uses the International Classification of Diseases 10th edition, clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) terminology; however, the ICD-10-CM code for COVID-19, U07.1, was not made available for use until April 1, 2020. The implications of this naming delay are wide-ranging. To this day, US COVID-19 cases prior to April 1, 2020, are difficult to retrospectively ascertain. Even after that date, use of U07.1 for COVID-19 phenotyping came with caveats–use of the new code was inconsistent and of variable sensitivity and specificity, and studies have shown both underuse and overuse of U07.1 in different contexts and health systems.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^11523574]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

Recommendation 4 — delayed sternal closure: Patients with delayed sternal closure may be considered for an ERP when chest closure is achieved (Table 3; COR = 2b; LOE = C-LD), recognizing that delayed sternal closure implies patients are likely to have a more prolonged postoperative course and not benefit from enhanced recovery strategies, is used variably among institutions, and in some centers is routinely performed for specific complex operations such as the Norwood procedure.

### Cleft and craniofacial coding in ICD-10 [^117BydQ3]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

With the gradual replacement of the ICD-9 coding system by the newer ICD-10 system, there is a need to critically evaluate how the system improves-or fails to improve-the coding of specific cleft and craniofacial anomalies. The following review examines the new system and the key components for practitioners who treat patients with such anomalies.

Conclusions

While seemingly beneficial in certain respects, the newer ICD-10 system remains far from ideal for cleft and craniofacial anomalies. With future iterations of the system, a more concerted effort to precisely code such anomalies is warranted, which will likely require input from key practitioners.

### Severe fontan-associated liver disease and its association with mortality [^112hMypg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Literature has not reached an agreement on the definition of FALD. The diagnosis of FALD is based on the interpretation of imaging and laboratory findings of each Fontan patient, where the clinicians and treating group reach an agreement on what to call FALD. In this study, we focus on severe FALD, defined as a liver complication that leads to hospitalization. We thus link the diagnosis of FALD to what is clinically meaningful in terms of health care use. Using the severe FALD diagnosis, our study observed an ≈10% cumulative incidence of severe FALD within 10 years after Fontan operation. This finding is consistent with previous work on invasive hepatic screening in Fontan patients, which showed that liver fibrosis was almost universal, with 1 of 4 Fontan patients having high‐grade liver fibrosis early after Fontan completion.

Our definition of severe FALD yielded similar results in the incidence of FALD to what has been reported in literature. In a recent study of 1260 Fontan patients using imaging (mainly) and biopsy for FALD diagnosis, 54% were expected to be alive, free of liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, at 30 years after Fontan completion. This result is consistent with our findings of a cumulative risk of 52.2% of severe FALD at 35 years after Fontan operation. However, variations in the incidence of FALD were seen in many studies, that were at least partially attributable to the lack of a standardized definition and staging of FALD. Our definition used ICD‐9 / ICD‐10 codes for liver disease that are well known and universal and vary less in time, as imaging surveillance for FALD is a tool introduced later in the course of FALD surveillance (> 2000s). We hope that our carefully designed attempt in defining severe FALD with an administrative database would promote efforts in diagnosing and defining FALD, leading to a clear and standard way to measure FALD.

### Positive predictive value of, and, codes for identification of congenital heart defects [^112BY6v7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Administrative data permit analysis of large cohorts but rely on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM), and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐10‐CM) codes that may not reflect true congenital heart defects (CHDs).

Methods and Results

CHDs in 1497 cases with at least 1 encounter between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019 in 2 health care systems, identified by at least 1 of 87 ICD‐9‐CM / ICD‐10‐CM CHD codes were validated through medical record review for the presence of CHD and CHD native anatomy. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability averaged > 95%. Positive predictive value (PPV) of ICD‐9‐CM / ICD‐10‐CM codes for CHD was 68.1% (1020/1497) overall, 94.6% (123/130) for cases identified in both health care systems, 95.8% (249/260) for severe codes, 52.6% (370/703) for shunt codes, 75.9% (243/320) for valve codes, 73.5% (119/162) for shunt and valve codes, and 75.0% (39/52) for "other CHD" (7 ICD‐9‐CM / ICD‐10‐CM codes). PPV for cases with > 1 unique CHD code was 85.4% (503/589) versus 56.3% (498/884) for 1 CHD code. Of cases with secundum atrial septal defect ICD‐9‐CM / ICD‐10‐CM codes 745.5/Q21.1 in isolation, PPV was 30.9% (123/398). Patent foramen ovale was present in 66.2% (316/477) of false positives. True positives had younger mean age at first encounter with a CHD code than false positives (22.4 versus 26.3 years; P = 0.0017).

Conclusions

CHD ICD‐9‐CM / ICD‐10‐CM codes have modest PPV and may not represent true CHD cases. PPV was improved by selecting certain features, but most true cases did not have these characteristics. The development of algorithms to improve accuracy may improve accuracy of electronic health records for CHD surveillance.

### Missense substitutions at a conserved 14–3–3 binding site in HDAC4 cause a novel intellectual disability syndrome [^112h3Czh]. HGG Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Gain-of-function variants in HDAC4 raise the possibility of therapeutic intervention by use of HDAC inhibitors, although whether such treatment could halt or reverse developmental problems is open to question. While a number of HDAC inhibitors are available for pharmacological use, class IIa HDACs are in fact poor responders to these drugs due to the lower deacetylase activity of these enzymes compared to other HDACs. Effective therapy would therefore require development of inhibitors with specificity for class IIa enzymes (and preferably HDAC4 alone); a recent study reported the development of improved cyclopropane hydroxamic acid derivatives for inhibition of HDAC4 deacetylase activity, while an alternative approach has been to target the interaction with MEF2.

In summary, we present evidence that variants within the key 14–3–3 binding motif spanning residues 242–248 of HDAC4 cause a novel phenotype, as a result of reduced 14–3–3 binding, which we hypothesize leads to reduced cytoplasmic retention and thus an increase in the nuclear activity of HDAC4. This phenotype includes significant DD/ID, seizures, distinctive facial features, scoliosis, delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle, and non-specific brain MRI anomalies; thus, it is distinct from the BDMR phenotype previously reported in individuals carrying HDAC4 loss-of-function alleles. Identification of additional individuals with variants within this region of HDAC4 will enable further genotype-phenotype correlation and understanding of the clinical spectrum in similar individuals.

### Supervised text classification system detects fontan patients in electronic records with higher accuracy thanCodes [^1133Sww9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The Fontan operation is typically performed in early childhood to palliate single‐ventricle congenital heart defects (CHDs), with heterogeneous native anatomy. Following the Fontan operation, the absence of a pulsatile pulmonary circulation and chronically elevated hepatic venous pressures lead to numerous comorbid complications with age, including arrhythmias, heart failure, hepatic fibrosis, renal disease, and other late complications. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM), and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐10‐CM), diagnostic codes can be used to identify the categories of patients by their native anatomy and are commonly used in research for retrieving targeted cohort data. In addition, ICD‐9‐CM and ICD‐10 Procedure Coding System (PCS) procedural codes can be used to identify procedures a patient may have undergone. Although all Fontan patients have similar postsurgical anatomy and complications regardless of the native anatomy, not all patients with the same native anatomy require a Fontan operation. Therefore, it is difficult to identify Fontan cases strictly by their ICD codes.

### Anterior fontanelle closure and size in full-term children based on head computed tomography [^1154cH2b]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

This study investigates radiographically acquired normative ranges of anterior fontanelle closure (AFC) and surface area (SA) in healthy full-term infants.

Methods

High-resolution head computed tomography (CT) scans were retrospectively reviewed for AFC and AF dimensions to allow approximation of AF SA.

Results

Between 15 and 23 head CT scans per monthly age-group (0–24 months) were reviewed, totaling 464 scans. AFC frequency increased steadily from age 10 (16%) to 20 months (88%), reaching higher than 50% at age 16 months (53%). The AF was closed in 3% to 5% of infants at 5 to 6 months. AF median SA increased from 769.3 mm(2) (age 0 months) to 1022.2 mm(2) (2 months), then declined steadily.

Conclusions

This study provides reference charts detailing AFC frequency and AF SA as a function of age. Wide variability of AFC timing and AF size among healthy infants suggest that early or delayed AFC may represent normal variants.

Progenitor Cell Differentiation– Cleidocranial Dysplasia

Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a skeletal dysplasia with a frequency of one in one million individuals worldwide. Clinically, individuals with CCD present with a triad of delayed closure of the cranial sutures and the anterior fontanelle, hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles, and dental abnormalities. Other features include delayed ossification of the skull, maxillary hypoplasia, moderate short stature, and other skeletal abnormalities. Interestingly, Wormian bones are a common feature in CCD, which have been proposed to stabilize the skull anatomy in cases of delayed suture closure.

The bony changes underlying CCD are due to autosomal dominant pathogenic variants of RUNX2. RUNX2 is a transcription factor critical for osteoblast progenitor proliferation and differentiation in both intramembranous and endochondral ossification. It is considered a master organizer of bone formation, which through cooperative binding to DNA sequences regulates the transcription of a variety of osteogenic genes. The pathogenic variants identified in patients with CCD are most commonly located in the Runt domain of the gene, which abolishes the transactivation potential of the protein resulting in functional haploinsufficiency. As a result, complexes of RUNX2 with other transcriptional co-activators required for cell differentiation cannot efficiently bind to osteogenic target genes, as RUNX2 on its own is a weak transcriptional regulator.

For patients with CCD, treatment is largely symptomatic as a team of craniofacial specialists is required to address multiple head and neck implications. A primary challenge is dental crowding, which requires orthodontic interventions. If expansion of the cranial sutures is severe, a protective device or helmet may be required. Normally, the anterior fontanelle closes around 10–24 months of age; in CCD, this closure is delayed, sometimes resulting in a persistent anterior fontanelle into adulthood. Some studies warn clinicians to weigh risks and benefits of repair of bone defects in individuals with CCD due to compromised RUNX2 activity. However, cranioplasty techniques using autologous and alloplastic materials have been successful and non-union in the axial skeleton has been treated with vascularized free fibula grafts. Older patients are monitored and commonly administered preventative treatment for osteoporosis. Better understanding of how pathogenic variants of RUNX2 affect osteogenic capacity is required to develop precision treatments and assess their compatibility in the clinic.

### Age at time of craniosynostosis repair predicts increased complication rate [^113AYX7K]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This study uses administrative data to assess the optimal timing for surgical repair of craniosynostosis and to identify factors associated with risk of perioperative complications.

Design

Statistical analysis of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database (2006, 2009, 2012).

Setting

KID-participating hospitals in 44 states.

Patients

Children 0 to 3 years of age with ICD-9 codes for surgical correction of craniosynostosis (756 and 0124, 0125, 0201, 0203, 0204, or 0206).

Main Outcome Measure

Age-based cohorts were assessed for perioperative complications. We performed a multivariable analysis to determine characteristics associated with increased risk of complications.

Results

21 million admissions were screened and 8417 visits met criteria for inclusion. Seventy-five percent of procedures occurred before age 1. Complications occurred in 8.6% of patients: 6.6% of patients at age 0 to 6 months, 10.3% of patients aged 7 to 12 months, and 13.9% of patients 12 to 36 months. Patients with acrocephalosyndactyly or associated congenital anomalies experienced complications in 22.9% of cases (OR = 3.07, 95% CI = 2.33, 4.03).

Conclusion

Craniosynostosis repair is safe; however, the risk of complications increases with age at intervention. Presence of a syndromic congenital deformity at any age carries the greatest increased risk of perioperative complications. This suggests that optimal timing of intervention is within the first year of life, especially in those cases with additional factors increasing perioperative risk. These data support the importance of counseling patients of the increased risk associated with delaying craniosynostosis repair.

### Severe fontan-associated liver disease and its association with mortality [^114apUkF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design and Population

Retrospective cohort studies were adopted for all 3 study objectives. Using the Quebec CHD database, a cohort of Fontan patients was assembled, including patients who had a history of Fontan operation defined by procedural codes that were available for all patients in the database. Patients were excluded if they died within 30 days after Fontan completion as death in these cases was most likely attributed to surgical mortality. To evaluate the association between Fontan and the incidence of severe FALD, we used patients with ventricular septal defects (VSDs) as the control group, as previously described, because there is no known association between VSD and liver disease. For each Fontan patient, a total of 20 patients with VSD were randomly selected and matched on age, sex, and surgery calendar time, using the date of Fontan completion as the index date. We thus established a retrospective longitudinal cohort of Fontan patients and patients with VSD, referred to as the Fontan‐VSD cohort. This cohort was used to estimate and compare the incidence of severe FALD in Fontan patients and severe liver complications in patients with VSD, for the purpose of assessing the extra burden of severe liver complication in Fontan patients compared with general patient population with CHD. Severe FALD and severe liver complications were defined as having a hospitalization attributable to liver disease using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9), and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10), codes (Tables S1 and S2). Thus, our definition of FALD is a genuinely significant form of liver disease. To assess the association between severe FALD and mortality, each Fontan patient with severe FALD was matched with 2 Fontan patients who did not have severe FALD on a propensity score that was calculated using sex, age at Fontan, calendar year of Fontan, and diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF), heart block, pulmonary hypertension, arterial hypertension, acute renal failure, supraventricular tachycardia, and protein‐losing enteropathy (see Table S3 for the ICD‐9 / ICD‐10 codes for identification). By adjusting these factors using propensity score matching, the 2 groups with and without FALD were made alike in the probability of developing FALD, except the true occurrence of FALD, thus to reduce confounding for assessing the association between FALD and mortality. In addition, using propensity score matching enables the calculation of absolute risk of mortality associated to FALD by means of Kaplan‐Meier curve analysis, with adjustment for selected sociodemographics and comorbidities. For each patient, the propensity score of developing FALD was calculated using a binary logistic regression model including the aforementioned 11 sociodemographics and comorbidities (Figure S1). Nearest neighbor matching was used to select the patients with the closest propensity scores to comprise the matching sets. However, if the closest propensity score for a patient with FALD was > 0.2 SDs away, the patient was dropped from the analysis. The index date (time 0) for matching was defined as the first hospitalization date of the patient with severe FALD. For each matching set, the follow‐up time was also matched between the patients with and without severe FALD by taking the shortest duration of the 3 patients in the matching set.

### How well doCodes predict true congenital heart defects? A centers for disease control and prevention-based multisite validation project [^114Bhmfx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Ideally, constructing an algorithm that utilizes data from administrative and eHRs will help to identify true CHD cases with improved accuracy and sensitivity. Machine learning is one possibility to improve both the PPV and sensitivity of CHD codes for CHD, and specific CHD type, based on ICD codes and other variables from clinical and administrative data sets, using the most predictive factors, while reducing the false negative rate. Restricting analyses to certain ICD codes and age categories may also improve the PPV. As a result of the current findings and previous research, researchers may consider excluding the following codes from administrative data sets to improve the PPV for analyses seeking to study CHD:
ICD‐9‐CM and anatomically equivalent ICD‐10‐CM codes that code for conditions other than heart defects, including congenital heart block (746.86, Q24.6), pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (747.32, Q25.72), absent/hypoplastic umbilical artery (747.5, Q27.0), other anomalies of peripheral vascular system (747.6x, Q27.9), and other specified anomalies of circulatory system (747.8x, Q28.8). These codes were also excluded in the surveillance methodology.
The "Other" CHD anatomic group (as noted in Figure 1 and Data S1) and nonspecific ICD‐9‐CM codes and the equivalent ICD‐10‐CM codes including: other specified congenital anomalies of heart 746.8 (Q24.8), obstructive anomalies of heart, not elsewhere classified 746.84, coronary artery anomaly 746.85 (Q24.5), malposition of heart and cardiac apex 746.87 (Q24.0), other specified congenital anomalies of heart 746.89 (Q24.8), unspecified congenital anomaly of heart 746.9 (Q24.9), other congenital anomalies of aorta 747.2 (Q25.49), anomaly of aorta, unspecified 747.20 (Q25.40), anomalies of aortic arch 747.21, other anomalies of aorta 747.29 (Q25.49), congenital anomalies of great veins 747.4 (Q26.1), anomaly of great veins, unspecified 747.40 (Q26.9), other anomalies of great veins 747.49 (Q26.8), unspecified anomaly of circulatory system 747.9 (Q28.9, personal history of congenital malformations of heart and circulatory system V13.65 (Z87.74)
Patent foramen ovale / atrial septal defect 745.5 / Q21.1 alone or in combination with the "Other" CHD category.

### An aetiological classification of birth defects for epidemiological research [^111ytYYu]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital anomaly registers collect data on antenatally and postnatally detected anomalies for surveillance, research, and public health purposes. Each anomaly is coded using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-9/ICD-10) based on body systems, allowing accurate comparisons between registers for individual anomalies. When commencing an environmental, epidemiological study, it became clear to us that there is no standard classification that takes aetiology into account. This paper describes a new classification for use in studies addressing aetiology.

Method

A classification system was evolved and piloted using cases in a study of geographical variation in congenital anomaly prevalence.1 Cases that were difficult to categorise were noted, and after discussion with a team of experts, the classification was adjusted accordingly.

Results and Conclusion

A robust, hierarchical method of classifying birth defects into eight categories has been produced, for use at source of data registration in conjunction with, but independent of, ICD coding.

### Limited accuracy of administrative data for the identification and classification of adult congenital heart disease [^113iVttn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure. Study approval did not include the use of such repositories, and there is an abundance of personal identifiers in the data set. The study was approved by the institutional review board at the Oregon Health and Science University. The informed consent requirement was waived.

Identification of Patients

The electronic health record (EHR) system for Oregon Health and Science University Hospital was queried for all adults receiving care in 2010. Patients with any ICD‐9 code of 745 to 747 related to CHD were identified as the initial cohort of interest. To better ensure representation of all applicable patients, relevant codes from any year were included as long as the patient received care during the target calendar year. For example, a patient coded in 2009 with "coarctation" and then seen in 2010 for an ophthalmology examination would be included.

Using the available codes, we applied a hierarchical algorithm (1) to determine whether CHD was truly present and (2) to classify patients into 1 of 14 major defect subgroups based on the codes (Table 1). This algorithm was previously tested, revised, and validated in a limited clinical setting in which CHD patients are common. 5 The hierarchical algorithm ranks codes by diagnostic complexity. For example, code 745.2 ("tetralogy of Fallot") would take precedence over code 745.4 ("ventricular septal defect") in a given patient, and code 745.1 ("transposition of the great arteries") would be superseded by code 745.3 ("common ventricle"). The algorithm included limited physiologic codes ("cyanosis", "pulmonary hypertension"), syndromes ("Shone syndrome", "hypoplastic left heart syndrome"), and modifiers for past procedures ("s/p Fontan"), given their association with CHD, whenever available.

### How well doCodes predict true congenital heart defects? A centers for disease control and prevention-based multisite validation project [^117WgWY5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Surveillance of Congenital Heart Defects Across the Lifespan project uses large clinical and administrative databases at sites throughout the United States to understand population-based congenital heart defect (CHD) epidemiology and outcomes. These individual databases are also relied upon for accurate coding of CHD to estimate population prevalence. Methods and Results This validation project assessed a sample of 774 cases from 4 surveillance sites to determine the positive predictive value (PPV) for identifying a true CHD case and classifying CHD anatomic group accurately based on 57 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Chi-square tests assessed differences in PPV by CHD severity and age. Overall, PPV was 76.36% (591/774 [95% CI, 73.20–79.31]) for all sites and all CHD-related ICD-9-CM codes. Of patients with a code for complex CHD, 89.85% (177/197 [95% CI, 84.76–93.69]) had CHD; corresponding PPV estimates were 86.73% (170/196 [95% CI, 81.17–91.15]) for shunt, 82.99% (161/194 [95% CI, 76.95–87.99]) for valve, and 44.39% (83/187 [95% CI, 84.76–93.69]) for "Other" CHD anatomic group (X 2 = 142.16, P < 0.0001). ICD-9-CM codes had higher PPVs for having CHD in the 3 younger age groups compared with those > 64years of age, (X 2 = 4.23, P < 0.0001). Conclusions While CHD ICD-9-CM codes had acceptable PPV (86.54%) (508/587 [95% CI, 83.51–89.20]) for identifying whether a patient has CHD when excluding patients with ICD-9-CM codes for "Other" CHD and code 745.5, further evaluation and algorithm development may help inform and improve accurate identification of CHD in data sets across the CHD ICD-9-CM code groups.

### Untitled [^115HWtr3]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

When a clinician is presented with a patient with widened sutures or fontanelles with delayed closure, it warrants a thorough pediatrics assessment. The mean age of closure for the anterior fontanelle is approximately 14 months of age. By 2 years of age the anterior fontanelle is closed in 96% of children. Non-genetic causes of a large fontanelle include hydrocephalus, hypothyroidism, and rickets. It is important not to miss these treatable conditions. If these conditions have been ruled out and the fontanelle is open after 2 years of age, consideration should be given to an evaluation by a medical geneticist. Red flags that warrant medical genetics consultation, including early referral, are dysmorphic features, developmental delay, congenital anomalies, or additional skeletal anomalies such as unusual body proportions. Genetic testing may involve chromosomal microarray, single gene testing, gene panel testing or exome sequencing depending on the findings of the assessment. The results of genetic testing not only aid the diagnosis of rare diseases but also help inform recurrence risks for future pregnancies. The challenge with rare genetic disease is that there are very few cases and there are rarely established medical management guidelines. Frequently, the natural history of these conditions is not well established. Treatment and surveillance are typically tailored to the individual patient. We highlighted several conditions in this narrative review. The only condition we reviewed for which a targeted therapeutic intervention exists is hypophosphatasia. The therapeutic intervention consists of an enzyme replacement therapy for the infantile and juvenile types, we should be initiated early for best outcomes. Cleidocranial dysostosis, Yunis-Varón syndrome, and pycnodysostosis do not currently have medical management guidelines. While the enlarged fontanelle may eventually close over time in these conditions, there are individuals with cleidocranial dysostosis whose fontanelle remains open throughout life. Individuals with these conditions are managed in a multidisciplinary team with a considered approach to surgical intervention when appropriate. Identification and proactive consideration of underpinning genetic mechanisms should inform these personalized, interdisciplinary treatment plans whenever possible.

### Supervised text classification system detects fontan patients in electronic records with higher accuracy thanCodes [^115JFmU9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Although we did not directly compare NLP with CHD registries, registry studies, such as those performed with the Society for Thoracic Surgeons registry, are an important method for evaluating outcomes of individuals undergoing congenital heart disease surgery. Registry data are typically verified and accurate, but are limited to those who had surgery at a participating institution, and may miss individuals in a health care system who had Fontan operation at a different health care system or had surgery before creation of the registry. NLP is a complementary method of identifying patients with prior Fontan operations who may be decades out from their surgery or have migrated into or out of a different health care system, and thus may be most helpful in looking at late outcomes. In addition, NLP could potentially be used to identify late Fontan‐related complications in patients identified through registries.

Applying NLP‐based ML models on the clinical notes can improve the precision of the system, reduce the risk of mistakenly detecting non‐Fontan patients, and capture Fontan cases missed by an ICD code–based approach. This work is an example of how NLP is more accurate than the ICD code–based approach for identifying individuals with single‐ventricle heart defects who have undergone Fontan palliation, allowing identification of more cases with greater accuracy. Individuals who have undergone Fontan palliation face complications that increase with time following Fontan operations. Limited data are available to understand factors that contribute to these adverse outcomes. The NLP‐driven method that we have developed may improve longitudinal surveillance of individuals who have undergone Fontan palliation in childhood, allowing the incorporation of individuals who may be followed up outside of tertiary referral centers.

Methods

Study Setting and Data Source

The data that support the findings of this study are available from Statistics Finland and the FHDR (Finnish Hospital Discharge Register), but restrictions apply to data availability, which were used under license for the current study and so are not publicly available. Data are, however, available from the authors upon reasonable request and with permission from Statistics Finland and the FHDR.

The research was conducted in Finland, which has a population of approximately 5.5 million people. Finnish health services offer tax‐supported health care to all Finnish people.

We gathered the information of all patients diagnosed with ASD from the FHDR (Dnro THL/4814/14.02.00/2020). Primum‐type defects were not included in the study. The FHDR is an old, individual‐level data register widely used for research purposes. Nationwide hospital discharge data with personal identification numbers have been collected in the register since 1969. Procedural codes were added to the register in 1986. Register coverage is reportedly over 95%, and the positive predictive value for common diagnoses is between 75% and 99%. The validity of many diagnosis codes has been studied previously.

The register contains information on admission and discharge dates, surgical procedure codes, and diagnosis codes according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The Eighth Revision of the ICD (ICD‐8) was used until the end of 1986, the Ninth Revision (ICD‐9) from 1987 to 1995, and the Tenth Revision (ICD‐10) thereafter. The ICD codes were coded in 2 decimal accuracies. Procedure codes were named according to the Finnish hospital alliance codes until 1995 and according to the Nordic Classification of surgical procedures after that.

All patients with ICD‐8, ICD‐9, or ICD‐10 codes for ASD, except for primum defects, were included (Table S1). Patients with ICD‐8, ICD‐9, or ICD‐10 codes for more severe congenital heart disease were excluded, except codes not specific to congenital heart disease (747.7–747.9 [ICD‐8], 7474x–7479x [ICD‐9], and Q26.5–Q26.6 [ICD‐10]). Out of all congenital heart diseases, only the patent arterial duct was considered a less severe defect. All the included patients had relevant data elements available, and no patients were excluded because of the missing data.

### Supervised text classification system detects fontan patients in electronic records with higher accuracy thanCodes [^113TzjPq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

We chose to compare our NLP model with an ICD code–based classification system as ICD code–based classification is often used for population‐based cohort studies of patients who have undergone the Fontan procedure, without determining the accuracy of these ICD codes. The ICD code–based classification has several limitations leading to both false positives and false negatives and may affect conclusions drawn from ICD ‐based studies of Fontan populations. When using a combination of ICD‐9‐CM and ICD‐10‐CM / ICD‐10‐PCS diagnostic and procedural codes to identify Fontan cases, the PPV of ICD codes to detect Fontan cases was 58% in the AHS data set, 83% in the PHS data set, and 74% in the combined data set. ICD diagnostic codes classify cases by native anatomy, which can vary in severity not accounted for by ICD codes. Thus, although some patients may require a Fontan operation, others may not despite having the same anatomic CHD. Although there are ICD procedural codes for the Fontan operation, these are typically only used at the time of the operation, limiting their usefulness for cases when the operation occurred outside of the surveillance period or outside of the data set. If the operation did not occur within the surveillance window and data set, the only code‐based indicators that may be used in follow‐up encounters to document prior Fontan operation are nonspecific diagnosis codes for "personal history of congenital heart surgery" (ie, V13.65 and Z87.74). Researchers may instead decide to identify Fontan patients using only ICD codes for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tricuspid atresia, double‐inlet left ventricle, and single ventricle, because patients with these defects most likely have had a Fontan operation; however, individuals with other heart defects who may undergo Fontan operation, such as atrioventricular canal defect, unbalanced, or pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, would be missed. Alternatively, including more ICD codes for these other heart defects to identify Fontan cases would result in false positives, because some of these cases may have 2‐ventricle repair in place of Fontan palliation, depending on the severity of their specific heart defect. Understanding longitudinal and late outcomes of Fontan patients with administrative data is limited by the poor PPV of ICD codes to identify the cohort. Although contemporary EHR systems developed in the past decade may allow identification of a cohort using the problem list, provider entries may vary, the Fontan operation may not be entered, and older legacy electronic record systems did not have this same functionality, thus limiting the identification of cases.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^1114pUyw]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — clinical stages and manifestations: The clinical presentation of vitamin D–deficiency rickets includes symptoms and signs of bone deformity and/or pain and may be associated with hypocalcemia and associated clinical features. The disease can be divided into 3 stages; the first stage is characterized by osteopenia and subclinical or overt hypocalcemia, followed in the second stage by rising PTH levels, and in the final stage bone changes become more severe with hypocalcemia again evident. Symptoms range from none to irritability, delay in gross motor development, and bone pain, and signs include widening of the wrists and ankles, genu varum or valgum, prominence of the costochondral junctions (rachitic rosary), delayed closure of fontanelles, craniotabes, and frontal bossing. Vitamin D deficiency presenting as hypocalcemic seizures or tetany is reported more frequently in infancy and adolescence than in childhood; hypocalcemic children may have apneic spells, stridor or wheezing, hypotonia, muscular weakness, and brisk reflexes, and severe deficiency may be associated with cardiomyopathy related to hypocalcemia that normalizes with treatment.

### Supervised text classification system detects fontan patients in electronic records with higher accuracy thanCodes [^1162HLwT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Validation

Fontan cases were confirmed in 1 of 4 ways: (1) Their Fontan operation was identified and noted by clinicians and trained abstractors during a manual abstraction and clinical review of health records for 1500 CHD cases of all types in the PHS and AHS. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability was measured by reabstracting 10% of cases to ensure reliability of the annotations, and exceeded 95%. (2) Their Fontan operation was documented in the pediatric Society of Thoracic Surgeons database, which includes data entered by trained research coordinators in the PHS and classification reviewed by a clinician. (3) The Fontan patient was included in an adult clinical Fontan tracking list created and maintained by clinicians to monitor clinical care for adult Fontan patients and verified by congenital cardiology clinicians. (4) An NLP‐driven search was conducted on all text notes available for patients with at least 1 select single‐ventricle diagnosis code or Fontan procedure code (Table 1) who were not already labeled as Fontan cases from 1 of the first 3 mechanisms. The NLP‐driven search performed inexact or fuzzy matching of the term "Fontan" within the text of the notes so that words similar to Fontan, including potential misspellings, were captured. All retrieved posts were manually reviewed, and Fontan cases were labeled. Reasons for false positives with NLP‐driven search were noted, as were reasons for false negatives with ICD code–based classification of single‐ventricle cases. Abstractors reviewed all false‐positive and false‐negative cases (as determined by NLP) to assess data quality. The chart abstractors played no role in model development and did not communicate at any point of the study with the investigators (Y.G. M. A. A.–G. and A.S.) involved in ML model development. This ensured that the model development was not biased by expert knowledge from the abstractors.

ICD‐9‐CM code‐based hierarchy for congenital heart defect classification by native CHD anatomy group.

*Based on hierarchy reported in Ref. Individuals aged 1 to 64 years with documented congenital heart defects at health care encounters, 5 US surveillance sites, 2011 to 2013. CHD indicates congenital heart defect; and ICD‐9‐CM, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification.

Data and Procedures

Data from the 4 sites (GA, NC, NY, UT) over a 3‐year project period, 2011 to 2013, were used for this validation. A total of 800 cases were planned for the validation study consisting of 200 cases from each of the 4 sites. Each site selected 50 cases from 4 mutually exclusive CHD anatomic groups as defined by the ICD code hierarchy (Figure 1) based on native anatomy: complex, shunt, valves, and "Other", with each group further stratified by age: 1 to 10 years, 11 to 19 years, 20 to 64 years, > 64 years (GA, NC, NY), or ages 11 to 19 years and 20 to 64 years (UT). Anatomic groups are described in Figure 1 and Data S1. To ensure a comparable distribution of cases by age, the data set was stratified by age group and a proportion was selected, based on the age distribution of the larger cohort, into each of the 4 mutually exclusive anatomic groups (Figure 2). Only those data sources where medical charts were accessible for review were eligible for inclusion. Cases identified only in administrative data, but without clinical records to review, were excluded. Of the total cases from the larger CHD surveillance project, 69.4% of GA's cases, 36.7% of NC's cases, 32.5% of NY's cases, and 97.6% of UT's cases were eligible for medical chart review and selection for the validation project.

### Spontaneous closure of congenital cranial defect: is early surgical intervention warranted? [^114RCQqQ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Infantile cranial development typically occurs in a predictable sequence of events; however, less is known about how the development occurs in isolated, nonsyndromic congenital craniofacial anomalies. Furthermore, the timing of pediatric cranioplasty has been extrapolated from adult studies. Thus, the management of nonsyndromic congenital craniofacial anomalies presents with unique challenges to the craniofacial surgeon. The authors describe the case of a baby girl who was born with right Tessier 3 cleft, cleft palate, anophthalmos, and severe left craniofacial microsomia with Pruzansky grade III left mandibular anomaly. By analyzing 3-dimensional chronological models of the patient, the authors found that her abnormal fontanelle initially increased in size until 22 weeks of age, with subsequent spontaneous closure at a rate of 60.53 mm2/y. Although similar cranial anomalies are typically surgically corrected early in life, delaying treatment until after 2 years of age may be appropriate in some patients, obviating surgical morbidity in the newborn period.

The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 was signed into law on April Fool's Day. Indeed, 2014 saw unprecedented enthusiasm for the possibility of a permanent solution to the sustainable growth rate formula. Congress failed to come together on methods to pay for that fix. Instead, Congress provided another temporary patch on April 1. As part of that law, International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) adoption was pushed back by at least 1year until, at the earliest, October 1, 2015. While many physicians support the delay in ICD-10 implementation, there are those that disagree.

### Is delayed primary bladder exstrophy closure the new norm? An analysis of the epic cosmos database [^1114Ab4B]. Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the age at primary bladder exstrophy (BE) closure from 2012 through 2023. We hypothesized that the median age at primary BE closure increased from within the first week of life to more delayed closure.

Methods

A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis was performed using the Epic Cosmos database. BE patients were identified using a combination of diagnostic and procedure codes. The use and timing of pelvic osteotomies, epispadias repairs, postoperative complications, and length of stay were also noted. The primary outcome was the age at the primary BE closure. Delayed closures were defined as occurring > 7 days of life. Secondary outcomes included other surgical and postsurgical aspects (e.g., concomitant epispadias repair and/or osteotomy, postoperative complications, and length of stay).

Results

149 patients (77(52%) male) were identified as having a BE closure within the database. Of these, 10(7%) had an epispadias closure and 52(35%) had pelvic osteotomies coded within two days of their BE closure. The majority (44/52) (85%) of osteotomies occurred in patients whose BE closures were performed at > 7 days of age. In four of the first five years of the study, the median age at BE closure was within one week of birth. Conversely, in six of the last seven years of the study, the median age at BE closure was ≥ 2 months of life.

Conclusions

Data from Epic Cosmos hospitals suggest a shift from immediate postnatal to delayed primary BE closure between 2012 and 2023. Only one-third of patients underwent pelvic osteotomy synchronous with BE closure.

### Untitled [^1137TfmP]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The disorders discussed in this narrative review were identified through a targeted literature search in PubMed using the following search terms: ((("delayed closure" OR wide* OR dysplasia OR persistent) AND ("cranial suture" OR "fontanelle")) AND (patent)) AND (("2016/01/01"[Date — Publication]: "2022/01/01"[Date — Publication])). 90 results were obtained over the 7-year period. Of those, 28 articles were considered relevant to the topic of this article based on abstract review. These studies were reviews or case reports describing 18 conditions that manifest with widened sutures and/or persistent fontanelles, summarized in Table 1. Subsequent un-restricted literature search conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Ovid databases targeted pertinent cranial suture descriptions, etiology, and findings from the clinic and experimental systems based on the disorders identified in the preliminary search. The four clinical examples investigated in this review were chosen to illustrate independent biological principles of suture malformation.

### Anaemia-based screening for resistance to thyroid hormone alpha in children [^115VeuQQ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The hypothyroid phenotype associated with resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (RTH-α) is associated with a diverse clinical picture. On the other hand, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are normal. Free triiodothyronine (fT3) and free thyroxine (fT4) levels can also be normal; however, normo- or macrocytic anaemia is usually present in reported cases. Diagnosis is challenging and there is limited data regarding screening methods.

Objective

The study aimed to assess the efficiency of a screening strategy for RTH-α.

Subjects and Methods

Out of a total of 6540 children evaluated at the outpatient clinics of paediatric neurology over 2 years and who underwent complete blood count and thyroid function tests, 432 were found to have anaemia. Within this group, we identified 42 children without an underlying specific neurological aetiology who exhibited normo- or macrocytic anaemia, normal TSH levels, fT3 levels in the upper half of the normal range or high, and fT4 levels in the lower half of the normal range or low. We excluded one patient who had already been diagnosed with RTH-α and nine patients could not be reached. Subsequently, clinical evaluation, biochemical assessment, and THRA sequencing analysis were conducted on 32 children. The findings were compared with those of the known RTH-α patients in our unit.

Results

The median age of the patients was 5.7 (5.1–7.4) years, and 22 of them were males (69%). The main reasons for assessment in paediatric neurology clinics were autism spectrum disorder (n = 12, 38%), epilepsy (n = 11, 34%), and delay in developmental stages (n = 8, 25%). Constipation was present in five of the cases (16%), while the closure of the anterior fontanelle and tooth eruption were delayed in two cases (6%) and one case (3%), respectively. The median length/height and weight standard deviation (SD) scores were 0.3 [(-0.8)-(1.1)] and -0.1 [(-0.8)-(0.3)], respectively. The median fT3, fT4, and TSH levels were 4.6 (4.2–5.0)pg/mL, 0.9 (0.8–1.0)ng/dL, and 2.2 (1.8–3.1)uIU/mL, respectively. Thirteen of the patients (41%) had high fT3 levels, while none of them had low fT4 levels. The normo- or macrocytic anaemia rate was 47% (normocytic/macrocytic, n = 8/7) at the time of reassessment. Serum creatine kinase (CK) was elevated in five patients (16%; one had anaemia). None of the subjects had a pathological variant in THRA. Known RTH-α patients had significantly lower median height SD score, higher rates of delayed tooth eruption and closure of the anterior fontanelle, lower haemoglobin levels, and higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and CK levels as compared to those found without RTH-α.

Conclusions

This approach found one known patient with RTH-α but did not reveal any new cases. Notably, normo- or macrocytic anaemia did not persist in nearly half of the screened patients. A screening strategy that takes clinical findings and prominent laboratory features suggestive of RTH-α into account could lower unnecessary genetic analysis of THRA in patients presenting with neurological problems.

### Congenital heart defects and APGAR score at birth, a nationwide study [^1152HLto]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnoses of CHD were identified in the Danish National Patient Registry. The codes Q20 to 26 from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10) were included, while the following specific codes were excluded: bicuspid aortic valve, patent ductus arteriosus, and persistent foramen ovale, as well as nonspecific codes of CHD. Infants born with a low Apgar score may be more likely to be subject to detailed diagnostic investigations and are thus more likely to be diagnosed with small atrial septal defects or ventricular septal defects of no clinical or hemodynamic importance. Thus, to minimize the risk of surveillance bias, newborns diagnosed with small atrial septal defects or ventricular septal defects without the need for a surgical or catheter‐based intervention at a later stage were not included in the CHD population. Only the diagnoses assigned at the highest level of diagnostic accuracy were accepted. Consequently, the diagnoses were arranged into 3 groups of descending diagnostic accuracy. The first group consisted of diagnoses from surgical contacts at a tertiary center; the second group consisted of diagnoses from admissions to a tertiary center with no surgery performed; and the third group consisted of diagnoses from other university hospital departments of pediatric cardiology. The third group also included a small number of individuals who died before transfer to a department of pediatric cardiology. In accordance with previous work, CHD was divided into 3 primary groups of severity (high, moderate, low) adapted from the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies. Moreover, the diagnoses were divided into 13 mutually exclusive subtypes (Table S2). Only diagnoses from the highest group of severity, assigned at the highest level of diagnostic accuracy, were accepted for each individual. Moreover, if an individual was assigned ≥ 2 diagnoses of a similar severity, the CHD was categorized into the group of "other severe defects" or "other mild defects" and was not considered an isolated CHD.

### Case ascertainment in pediatric heart failure using international classification of disease clinical modification (ICD-CM) codes [^112y9kzg]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Most epidemiological studies in pediatric heart failure (HF) use administrative database sources, defining patient cohorts by presence of a single HF ICD code. However, the ability of ICD codes to identify true HF patients is unknown in pediatrics. Here we describe the accuracy of HF ICD-10-CM code search algorithms, in identifying pediatric patients with HF from electronic data sources. Based on the adult HF literature, search algorithms were designed to incorporate HF ICD codes, imaging, and medications. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and accuracy of the algorithms were tested among children in an advanced HF clinic ("Clinic cohort"). Top-performing algorithms were then tested in a large-scale regional electronic data warehouse (EDW), 01/2017 to 01/2020, generating the "EDW Cohort". False positive cases were identified and characterized by chart review. Within the Clinic Cohort, 78/378 patients (21%) had gold standard HF diagnoses. A search algorithm with one HF ICD coded visit was more sensitive but less specific than > 1 HF ICD coded visit, (sensitivity 94% and specificity 89% versus 69% and 97%, respectively). Correspondingly, > 1 ICD coded visit had a higher PPV than one ICD coded visit; 84% vs. 69%. Accuracy was similar (90% vs 91%). Presence of 1 HF ICD code combined with HF medication had high sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy, all higher than the single ICD code algorithm. The "1 HF coded visit+any medication" algorithm resulted in highest accuracy (93%). Top-performing algorithms were tested in the EDW: the algorithm with > 1 HF ICD coded visit, and the algorithm with one HF ICD coded visit combined with HF medication. In the EDW Cohort, 133/248 (53.6%) patients had gold standard HF diagnoses though 115/248 (46.3%) were false positive cases; 41% of those had pulmonary over-circulation from congenital heart disease. Excluding children < 30 days old and those with a history of an isolated VSD repair, complete AVSD repair, or PDA closure further reduced the proportion of false positives to 50/248 (20%). A search algorithm using a single HF ICD code can have acceptable sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy in identifying children with HF from within electronic medical records. Similar to adult HF literature, specificity improves by including HF medication. When applied to large data sources, however, the search algorithms result in a high proportion of patients with pulmonary overcirculation related to congenital heart disease. To narrow the population to those with myocardial dysfunction, case identification may require use of ICD codes with linked of administrative, surgical, and/or imaging databases.

### Cause-specific mortality of patients with atrial septal defect and up to 50 Years of follow-up [^112oh55o]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study was limited by the retrospective nature of its design. Despite the FHDR reportedly being accurate, the possibility of coding misclassifications cannot be completely excluded.

There is some selection bias in patients born before 1969, as patients with more severe defects may have died before the start of follow‐up. For patients born before 1969 (n = 3739, 41.1% of the study population), the date of diagnosis cannot be known for sure. Follow‐up began with the first time that the diagnosis appeared in the FHDR. In patients born before 1969, this could mean the date of diagnosis or a follow‐up visit.

The closure rate for patients with ASD in the whole cohort is unknown, as procedural codes were included in the discharge registry only after 1986. Information about the ASD subtypes was limited because ICD‐8 and ICD‐9 (used from 1969 to 1995) were not specific enough to describe various types of ASD. Thus 36.9% of defects were labeled as undetermined.

### Diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome in a large integrated health system [^113yypN3]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Data on the accuracy of the diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) in cirrhosis is limited. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients with International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) in a large integrated health system.

Methods

A retrospective review of encounters was performed of all patients with ICD-9-CM and/or ICD-10-CM diagnosis of cirrhosis and HPS from 2014–2019 in a multi-state health system. Demographics and cardiopulmonary testing closest to the time of HPS diagnosis were recorded. HPS was defined using standard criteria.

Results

A total of 42,749 unique individuals with cirrhosis were identified. An ICD diagnosis of HPS was found in 194 patients (0.45%), of which 182 had clinically confirmed cirrhosis. 143 (78.5%) underwent contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography, and 98 (54%) had delayed shunting. Among them, 61 patients had a documented arterial blood gas, with 53 showing abnormal oxygenation (A-a gradient of > 15 mm Hg). 12 were excluded due to significant pulmonary function test abnormalities and abnormal oxygenation from other cardiopulmonary diseases. Ultimately, 41 (22.5%) fulfilled the criteria for HPS. When stratifying those with an ICD code diagnosis of HPS into HPS, no HPS and indeterminate HPS groups, based on standard diagnostic criteria for HPS, we found that the confirmed HPS patients had similar complications except for less portopulmonary hypertension, worse gas exchange, less cardiopulmonary disease and were more often diagnosed in transplant centers.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of HPS by ICD code is made in an extremely small subset of a sizeable cirrhotic cohort. When made, only a minority of these patients meet diagnostic criteria. Our findings highlight the need for improved education and more effective screening algorithms.

### The rush to atrial septal defect closure: is the introduction of percutaneous closure driving utilization? [^112BgCEt]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical repair of isolated atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) has been largely supplanted by percutaneous closure. Whether the perceived benefit of percutaneous closure has lowered thresholds for intervention and thus increased overall utilization rates is unknown. We sought to determine nationwide trends in the use of percutaneous compared with surgical closure and their respective outcomes over an 18-year period.

Methods

Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, procedure and diagnosis codes, we identified all ASD/PFO closures performed from 1988 to 2005. National estimates and their standard deviations were calculated. Logistic regression analysis identified determinants of closure type.

Results

We identified 15,482 secundum ASD/PFO closures between 1988 and 2005, yielding a national estimate of 79,841 cases. Of these, 5,495 (national estimate, 27,554 ± 2,526) were percutaneous, 10,278 (national estimate, 53,710 ± 1,451) were surgical. The ASD/PFO closures per capita increased dramatically from 1.08 per 100,000 population in 1988 to 2.59 per 100,000 population in 2005, an increase of 139%. When analyzed by closure type, surgical closure increased by only 24% (from 0.86 per 100,000 population in 1988 to 1.07 per 100,000 in 2005) whereas percutaneous closure increased by 3,475% (from 0.04 per 100,000 population in 1988 to 1.43 per 100,000 in 2005). A marked shift in repair type occurred in 2001. Estimated mortality rates remained near 1% for both closure types over time.

Conclusions

Nationwide utilization of ASD/PFO repair has increased over time, largely attributable to the dramatic rise in percutaneous closure. Despite the substantial increase in utilization, mortality has remained constant. In the absence of meaningful benchmarks, prospective studies comparing outcomes and criteria for surgical versus percutaneous closure are needed to determine whether the increased rates of ASD closure are justified.

### Lifetime burden of morbidity in patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect [^113xrLJR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The cohort of patients with VSD was identified using ICD‐8 (code 746.39) and ICD‐10 (code DQ21.0) in the DNPR (from 1977 to 2018). This cohort was supplemented by patients with VSD (n = 593) identified before the introduction of the DNPR (before 1977) and described elsewhere. Patients with coexisting congenital cardiac malformation or chromosomal abnormalities were excluded. All patients diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction in ICD‐8 or ICD‐10 before their VSD diagnosis were excluded to prevent including misclassified individuals with postinfarction VSD. The cohort of patients with surgically closed defects was defined as patients with VSD who at any given time had received defect closure by suture, patch, or transcatheter closure. ICD codes used to identify intervention are outlined in Table S1.

To compare risk of morbidity in the population with VSD with the general Danish population, the Danish Civil Registration System was used to identify 10 controls per patient, matched by year of birth and sex. The controls were included so they did not have congenital heart disease and were alive at the date of VSD diagnosis for each patient.

Morbidity

Morbidity data included diagnosis of arrhythmia, arterial hypertension, ischemic cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, infectious endocarditis, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. For each morbidity, the first date of diagnosis was collected. Event‐free survival was defined as survival free from any of following: arrhythmia, infectious endocarditis, heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, or death. The complete list of codes used for each morbidity according to ICD‐8 and ICD‐10 is presented in Table S2. Table S3 provides information on register coverage and validity of diagnoses.

### Cleidocranial dysplasia with growth hormone deficiency: a case report [^112tnrN2]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

CCD is a rare skeletal disorder characterized by hypoplastic clavicles, delayed closure of fontanelles, delayed eruption of primary and permanent dentition, and short stature. It is diagnosed clinically. The prevalence is 1 in 1,000,000. The gene responsible for pathogenesis is RUNX2 located on the short arm of chromosome 6p21. Genetic analysis reveals a heterozygous mutation of RUNX2 in almost 70% of patients. RUNX2 is a transcription factor belonging to the Runx family (Runx1, Runx2, Runx3), and is expressed in osteoblasts and chondrocytes. RUNX2 is essential for the differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal cells to osteoblasts. It cooperates with Sp7 and canonical Wnt pathway. Bone is formed through two types of ossification: intramembranous or endochondral. For endochondral ossification, RUNX1 and RUNX3 can compensate for the RUNX2 function to some extent, even if the expression of RUNX2 is halved due to mutation. However, for intramembranous ossification, RUNX2 is crucial. Thus, open fontanelles and sutures, together with hypoplastic clavicles, are characteristic findings in CCD since the formation of these bones is related to intramembranous ossification. A report in Argentina stated that out of 37 cases studied, 95% had skull abnormalities, 75% had single clavicle alterations, and 100% had bilateral clavicle alterations. The present case also has open fontanelles and hypoplastic clavicles. Interestingly, her mother and brother have open fontanelles, but not hypoplastic clavicles, even though they have the same mutation. This clearly shows that mutations in RUNX2 could lead to various phenotypic features even in the same family, as previously reported.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^116FM4wi]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^114pEknp]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The conversion from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM was the largest change to health care coding in America in the last 30 years. While ICD-10 was approved in 1990 and had been utilized in several countries since as early as 1994, its use only became required in the United States on October 1, 2015. The version used in the United States has several significant modifications suggested during an open comment period and via a field test performed by The American Hospital Association and the American Health Information Management Association. ICD-10-CM, as the version is known, added many more codes than the original World Health Organization version used prior to adoption in the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services originally planned to instate ICD-10 on October 1, 2011, but its implementation met resistance. The American Medical Association feared that the costs of implementing ICD-10 would be extreme and could even put smaller practices out of business. In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the date to October 1, 2013. Two additional delays led to the final implementation date of October 1, 2015.

Each ICD-10 code has space for seven characters, an increase from the five available in ICD-9. The nearly 70,000 diagnostic codes available in ICD-10 provide a much greater level of detail than the 14,500 codes available in ICD-9, and mapping diagnoses from one to the other is often convoluted and rarely straightforward. Included in the increased details are codes that specify laterality and severity of disease, features that have a substantial effect on coding in ophthalmology. The increased level of detail is projected to lead to an eventual decrease in denied claims. Unfortunately, this decrease in rejected claims is expected to occur after a period of increased rejected claims lasting from 6 months to 3 years as coders adapt to the new system.–The more detailed information available from ICD-10 codes is also predicted to more easily identify fraud and abuse, give insurance companies more accurate information in order to make coverage decisions, and improve public health monitoring and research. Notably a dually coded database in Canada showed no improvement in the validity of coding with ICD-10 compared to ICD-9. However, a Swedish study did show continual improvement in the accuracy of recording conditions using ICD-10 over a 5-year period related to a coding learning curve.

### Insurance-based disparities in congenital cardiac operations in the era of the affordable care act [^113g47at]. Pediatric Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

All pediatric (≤ 18 years) patients undergoing congenital cardiac operations were tabulated in the 2010–2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD). The NRD is the largest all-payer inpatient and readmission database that is maintained as part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. The database uses hospital specific based discharge weights to provide accurate national estimates for 36 million discharges annually. Using hospital-specific weighting algorithms, the NRD is able to accurately estimate 58% of US hospitalizations. For patients under the age of one, the NRD can estimate approximately 50% of hospitalizations.

The International Classification of Disease Ninth and Tenth Revision procedure and diagnosis codes (ICD-9 and ICD-10) were utilized to classify operations of interest. These included operative repair for ventricular/atrial septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, Tetralogy of Fallot, arterial switch procedure, Norwood procedure, Glenn procedure, Fontan operation, truncus arteriosus repair, coarctation repair, and total anomalous venous pulmonary return repair, as has been previously described. All operations were cross-validated to ensure appropriate clinical diagnosis codes. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons-European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (STAT) Category, a previously validated stratification tool for mortality risk following congenital operations, was used to account for operative complexity. Pre-populated variables including insurance status, median household income, age, and mortality were defined according to the NRD data dictionary. Hospitalizations with missing data or those without private or Medicaid insurance were excluded (1.5%). Other clinical characteristics were defined using ICD9/10 codes as reported in prior work. The Charlson Comorbidity Index, a validated composite of comorbid conditions, was utilized to quantify the burden of comorbidities. This index is a standardized, 10-point measure of patient comorbidities which includes neurologic, cardiac, vascular, endocrine, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, cancer, and immune categories. Pediatric comorbidities were defined using previously published diagnosis groups. To assess annual volume status for each center, congenital cardiac case volume was summed each year while accounting for appropriate survey weights. Hospitals were classified as low, medium, or high-volume based on tertiles of annual case volume with cutoffs at the 33rd and 66th percentile.

### Long-term mortality in patients with atrial septal defect: a nationwide cohort-study [^114miUq1]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Study cohort and design

This nationwide cohort study was based on national medical registries in Denmark. Part of the study cohort has previously been used in investigations of the impact of an ASD on pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. The unified Danish health care system is publicly funded with equal access for all Danes. Hospital data are gathered in nationwide public registries linked to a unique personal identification number (the CPR number) provided for all inhabitants since 1968. Information on the date of birth, date of immigration, and date of death was identified in the Danish Civil Registration System.

Two data sources were used to identify ASD patients for this study. We used the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) established in 1977 to identify patients born before 1994 and diagnosed with an ASDfrom 1977 to 2013. The DNPR contains information on all inpatient and outpatient hospital contacts in Denmark, dates of admission and discharge, surgical procedures, and discharge diagnoses coded according to the International Classification of Disease (ICD). The 8th edition was used until 1993 after which the 10th version has been used. In Denmark, it is mandatory by law for all healthcare centres and hospitals to report to the register, and it is considered to be nearly complete. Two independent doctors reviewed all hospital records to validate the diagnosis registered in the DNPR. The ASD closing procedure was likewise registered in the DNPR, and the date was confirmed in the review of hospital records. During this medical record review, we identified a small number of patients with ASD diagnosis dates and/or ASD closure dates recorded before the initiation of the DNRP. Thus, the dates of diagnoses of the included subjects ranged from 1959 to 1 January 2013. The second data source included patients diagnosed with ASD before the age of 15 years between 1963 and 1974. These patients are a subgroup of a cohort used in a previous study of patients with congenital heart defects. The patients were identified by an experienced physician from 1970 to 1974 by review of inpatient and outpatient hospital records in all Danish medical and paediatric departments. The CPR number of the patients alive in 1968 was manually identified, and their diagnoses were translated into ICD-10 codes. Patients who died before 1968 (n = 5), and therefore did not receive a CPR number, were excluded. We only included patients with an isolated ASD except those few (n = 3) who had a concomitant patent arterial duct, thought to be of no relevance in adulthood. Patients were excluded if the defect was described as a patent foramen ovale. Thus, only patients with an ASD diagnosis confirmed by medical record review were included in this study.

### Drug formularies in workers' compensation systems [^113QM6mH]. ACOEM (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary of ACOEM recommendations — ACOEM believes that if a workers' compensation formulary is to be established, a condition-triggered evidence-based formulary is the preferred approach; policymakers must also establish administrative processes related to UR, dispute resolution during ramp-up, assurance of non-delayed prescription fills in urgent clinical situations, robust oversight involving a P&T Committee, and careful measurement of outcome variables. ACOEM recommends that the formulary be based on well-documented evidence-based methods such as those embodied in the ACOEM Practice Guidelines and the Reed Group formulary, or in the Washington State workers' compensation formulary. ACOEM sees great merit in a condition-based formulary such as the Reed Group formulary and cautions that diagnostic categories not be made so specific as to give rise to UR disputes over the details of an ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnostic code. ACOEM recommends that a P&T Committee, with occupational medicine physicians among its leaders, provide guidance prior to formulary implementation and oversee formulary content.

### Effect of folic acid food fortification in Canada on congenital heart disease subtypes [^112A37oj]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Case Ascertainment and Classification of CHDs

Up to fiscal year 2000 to 2001, diagnoses in the Discharge Abstract Database were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), with the Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems for Diagnoses (ICD-10) being adopted by Canadian hospitals in 2001 to 2002. The validity of information in the Discharge Abstract Database is assessed continually through abstraction and other studies. These studies show that the diagnosis of CHDs is accurate and that the transition of the coding system from ICD-9 to ICD-10 did not materially affect the coding of CHDs.

CHDs among all live births, stillbirths (including pregnancy terminations), and infants readmitted in the first year after birth were ascertained by the use of ICD-9 codes for diagnoses from 1990 to 2001 to 2002 (745.0–747.9), after which ICD-10 codes (Q20.0–Q26.9) were used. All CHD cases were then classified into the following 6 categories by grouping ICD codes in hierarchical fashion, as previously proposed –,: (1) conotruncal defects consisting of common truncus (745.0/Q20.0 and Q21.4), transposition of great vessels (745.1/Q20.1-Q20.3 and Q20.5), and tetralogy of Fallot (745.2/Q21.3); (2) nonconotruncal defects including endocardial cushion defects (745.6/Q21.2), common ventricle (745.3/Q20.4), and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (746.7/Q23.4); (3) coarctation of the aorta (747.1/Q25.1); (4) ventricular septal defect (745.4/Q21.0 and Q21.8); (5) atrial septal defect (745.5/Q21.1), and (6) other heart and circulatory system anomalies (ie, ICD codes for CHDs excluding the above-mentioned 5 categories). The first 3 categories made up the severe CHD subtypes. Pregnancy terminations resulting from congenital anomalies were included among stillbirths, although they could not be identified separately until 1997 in our data source.

### Untitled [^112nTFBR]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Widening of cranial sutures is a rare craniofacial outcome revealing what is not yet known about the causes and implications of cranial suture malformation. The spectrum of craniofacial disorders involving widened sutures described here is caused by pathogenic variants in genes required for the cellular processes governing suture formation and function. Each of the cases presented in this review shares a common feature: widened cranial sutures, or a persistent anterior fontanelle. However, each pathology arises from a different underlying biological perturbation. Whereas distinctions between causes of suture widening are difficult to make clinically, a wholistic view of the disorder and potential biologically relevant causes is required for effective personalized treatment plans for individual patients. Importantly, widened cranial sutures or persistent fontanelles are not simply the inverse of craniosynostosis. This paradigm emphasizes consideration of the underlying biology as patient-specific interventions evolve. This narrative review has illustrated significant gaps in understanding of complex craniofacial disorders in the context of pathologically widened cranial sutures, highlighting avenues for exciting future work to unite foundational biology with clinical practice.

### European position paper on the management of patients with patent foramen ovale. general approach and left circulation thromboembolism [^1113DnKF]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for patent foramen ovale, more specifically with respect to pre-closure evaluation, ESC 2019 guidelines recommend to consider withholding the insertable cardiac monitor in order not to delay percutaneous closure in patients with clear evidence of a causal PFO (such as simultaneous PE).

### A mapping algorithm for international classification of diseases 10th revision codes for congenital heart surgery benchmark procedures [^113U6uaT]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Administrative billing data are critical to many initiatives in congenital heart surgery. Mapping algorithms for International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical registry procedure definitions will allow identification of surgical cases and account for patient and procedural factors within administrative data. Our objectives were to develop mapping logic to crosswalk International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision procedure codes to 10 Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database benchmark and beta-test the algorithm.

Methods

Patients undergoing Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database benchmark procedures from 2015 to 2019 were identified and served as the gold standard. Cases were linked on direct identifiers to cases from the Pediatric Health Information System Database. Two independent teams developed International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision-based algorithms for cases capture. Algorithms were compared and iteratively refined to optimize sensitivity and specificity. Operative mortalities for cases identified in the administrative versus registry data were compared.

Results

Overall sensitivity was 91% and specificity was 99% for capture of benchmark operations using International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision codes. Sensitivity was more than 90% in identifying 6 of the 10 individual benchmark procedures and more than 98% sensitive in identifying Fontan, Glenn, and arterial switch with ventricular septal defect procedures. Specificity was more than 98% for all benchmark operations. There were no statistical differences in operative mortality between cases identified in the administrative versus the registry data.

Conclusions

Novel mapping algorithm for International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision procedure codes enables identification of congenital heart benchmark procedures within administrative billing data. This crosswalk facilitates population-based congenital heart surgical research and quality assessment.

### Accuracy of the all patient refined diagnosis related groups classification system in congenital heart surgery [^114WF3Pw]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Administrative data are increasingly used to evaluate clinical outcomes and quality of care in pediatric congenital heart surgery (CHS) programs. Several published analyses of large pediatric administrative data sets have relied on the All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRG, version 24) diagnostic classification system. The accuracy of this classification system for patients undergoing CHS is unclear.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of all 14,098 patients 0 to 5 years of age undergoing any of six selected congenital heart operations, ranging in complexity from isolated closure of a ventricular septal defect to single-ventricle palliation, at 40 tertiary-care pediatric centers in the Pediatric Health Information Systems database between 2007 and 2010. Assigned APR-DRGs (cardiac versus noncardiac) were compared using χ2 or Fisher's exact tests between those patients admitted during the first day of life versus later and between those receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support versus those not. Recursive partitioning was used to assess the greatest determinants of APR-DRG type in the model.

Results

Every patient admitted on day 1 of life was assigned to a noncardiac APR-DRG (p < 0.001 for each procedure). Similarly, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was highly associated with misclassification of CHS patients into a noncardiac APR-DRG (p < 0.001 for each procedure). Cases misclassified into a noncardiac APR-DRG experienced a significantly increased mortality (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In classifying patients undergoing CHS, APR-DRG coding has systematic misclassifications, which may result in inaccurate reporting of CHS case volumes and mortality.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) — postrepair clinical examination: The typical postrepair patient has a soft ejection systolic murmur from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT); a low-pitched, delayed diastolic murmur in the pulmonary area is consistent with pulmonary regurgitation, and such patients usually have an absent P2 component of the second sound. Additional findings may include a pansystolic murmur of a VSD patch leak and a diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation (AR). Some adults may present after only a palliative shunt, and such patients usually have cyanosis and clubbing with a continuous murmur if the shunt is patent.
