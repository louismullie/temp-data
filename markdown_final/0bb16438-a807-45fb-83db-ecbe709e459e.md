## Question

Indications of giving bicarbonate in dka if ph more than 7

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sodium bicarbonate should be given in diabetic ketoacidosis when the arterial or venous pH is greater than 7.0, and if so, under what circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic thresholds that define DKA and how severity is stratified. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about bicarbonate use across pH ranges. Next, I will review the clinical evidence for or against bicarbonate at pH above 7.0, including any exceptions. After that, I need to consider the pathophysiologic rationale and potential harms of bicarbonate in DKA. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, pH-based recommendation and outline safer alternatives that actually improve outcomes, making sure I double-check pediatric versus adult nuances before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I don't anchor on a misleading premise. DKA is defined by the triad of hyperglycemia or diabetes, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis with pH less than 7.3 and/or bicarbonate less than 18 mmol/L, with severity commonly graded as mild (pH 7.25–7.30), moderate (pH 7.00–7.24), and severe (pH less than 7.00), which sets the context for any discussion of bicarbonate thresholds [^114srPLa] [^112UAbax].

> Now, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines advise about bicarbonate in DKA. The ADA consensus repeatedly recommends not to administer bicarbonate routinely in DKA, emphasizing that fluids, insulin, and electrolytes are the mainstays and that bicarbonate does not improve clinically meaningful outcomes; some statements note that even in severe acidosis, evidence is limited and use should be exceptional rather than routine [^1155FWi9] [^1163TwTf]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric guidance too; UK pediatric guidance explicitly advises that bicarbonate is contraindicated in children with DKA except in the rare circumstance of life-threatening acidosis with refractory shock after discussion with a pediatric intensivist, reinforcing a conservative stance in pediatrics [^117V2pjs].

> Next, I will examine the clinical evidence at pH greater than 7.0. Wait, let me verify whether any randomized or observational studies show benefit in this range. Multiple reviews and studies show no improvement in time to resolution of acidosis, insulin requirements, or length of stay with bicarbonate, and some data suggest potential harm such as increased hypokalemia; in fact, a retrospective cohort of adults with pH less than 7.0 found no benefit even in that more severe stratum, which strengthens the case against use at pH above 7.0 where acidosis is less profound [^113pR2i8] [^114t76r8] [^116f3UJa]. I should double-check pediatric data; pediatric studies link bicarbonate use with increased cerebral edema risk, and case series in non-diabetic pediatric ketoacidosis also associate bicarbonate with seizures and delayed acidosis correction, arguing against routine use in children altogether [^114t76r8] [^111kf8nN].

> Let me consider the pathophysiologic rationale so I don't jump to conclusions based on intuition. Bicarbonate administration can raise serum pH but also increases CO2 load; CO2 diffuses across the blood–brain barrier faster than bicarbonate, potentially causing paradoxical central nervous system acidosis, and it can precipitate or worsen hypokalemia, increase sodium load and osmolality, and theoretically worsen cerebral edema risk, particularly in children; these mechanisms underpin the caution seen across guidelines and reviews [^111kf8nN] [^116f3UJa] [^117V2pjs]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought bicarbonate might help insulin action by reducing acidosis, but the data don't show improved insulin sensitivity or faster clinical resolution with bicarbonate, so that assumption doesn't hold up under scrutiny [^116f3UJa].

> I should confirm whether there are any legitimate exceptions at pH greater than 7.0. Some expert narratives suggest that in select adults with pH less than 7.20 and marked hemodynamic instability despite fluids and vasopressors, bicarbonate may be considered as a bridge, but this is off-label, low-quality, and not supported by outcome data. Moreover, this scenario is uncommon and does not apply to patients with pH above 7.0 who are typically hemodynamically stable once volume is restored [^114nZHFC]. Hold on, I should verify that no major society endorses bicarbonate at pH above 7.0. I find no such endorsement in ADA or UK pediatric guidance, reinforcing that exceptions, if any, are rare, individualized, and evidence-limited [^113pR2i8] [^117V2pjs].

> Let me synthesize a pH-based recommendation, but I need to ensure I'm precise. For pH greater than 7.0, bicarbonate is not indicated. For pH 7.00–7.19, routine bicarbonate is still not recommended given lack of benefit and potential harm. For pH less than 7.00, some guidelines allow consideration only in the setting of life-threatening instability refractory to standard therapy, ideally after specialist consultation, acknowledging that even here the evidence is weak and the risks nontrivial [^113pR2i8] [^117V2pjs] [^114t76r8]. I should double-check that this aligns with ADA language. Yes, ADA emphasizes no routine use and does not provide a pH greater than 7.0 indication for bicarbonate, which supports withholding it in the scenario posed [^113pR2i8].

> Next, I should review what to do instead, because the practical question is management when bicarbonate is inappropriate. The cornerstone is aggressive isotonic fluid resuscitation with either 0.9% saline or a balanced crystalloid, early and appropriate potassium replacement guided by serum potassium and acidosis, and continuous low-dose intravenous insulin with timely addition of dextrose to permit ongoing insulin until ketonemia resolves. Balanced crystalloids may modestly accelerate DKA resolution compared with saline and avoid hyperchloremic acidosis, which can confound bicarbonate interpretation, but both are acceptable per guidelines [^112YtsdG] [^113aX4rv] [^113FVmo3] [^113CnGK2]. I need to ensure I include pediatric timing. Insulin should start 1–2 hours after fluids to mitigate cerebral edema risk, and fluids should be titrated carefully to avoid rapid osmotic shifts, especially in children [^117V2pjs].

> But wait, what if the clinician is concerned about tissue hypoperfusion or myocardial depression at pH just above 7.0? I should confirm that supportive measures targeting perfusion, electrolytes, and the precipitating cause are preferred; bicarbonate does not reliably improve hemodynamics in DKA and may distract from correcting volume, potassium, and insulin delivery, so the focus should remain on guideline-concordant resuscitation and metabolic therapy rather than alkali administration [^114t76r8] [^1117ZCKL].

> Final answer: No, sodium bicarbonate should not be administered in DKA when pH is greater than 7.0. It offers no proven benefit and carries potential harms, so management should prioritize fluids, insulin, and electrolytes while treating the precipitating cause, with bicarbonate reserved, if at all, for extreme acidemia with refractory shock and specialist oversight, not for pH above 7.0 [^113pR2i8] [^114t76r8] [^117V2pjs] [^114nZHFC].

---

Bicarbonate is **not indicated** in DKA when pH is above 7.0. Routine use is **not recommended** because it does not improve outcomes and may cause harm, including hypokalemia, paradoxical CNS acidosis, and delayed ketone clearance [^1155FWi9] [^114t76r8]. Bicarbonate is only considered if pH is **< 6.9** with refractory shock or cardiac arrest despite fluids and insulin [^1155FWi9] [^114nZHFC]. For pH > 7.0, prioritize fluids, insulin, and electrolytes; reserve bicarbonate for **life-threatening acidosis unresponsive to standard care** [^1117ZCKL].

## Pathophysiological rationale for bicarbonate therapy in DKA

DKA is characterized by **insulin deficiency**, leading to increased lipolysis and ketogenesis, producing acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate and causing metabolic acidosis [^113yJojX]. The rationale for bicarbonate therapy is to raise serum pH, thereby improving myocardial contractility, reducing arrhythmias, and enhancing insulin sensitivity [^111swA9K]. However, this rationale is largely theoretical and not supported by clinical evidence [^114t76r8].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding bicarbonate use in DKA

Multiple studies and reviews have evaluated bicarbonate therapy in DKA, particularly in patients with pH > 7.0. The evidence consistently shows **no clinical benefit** from routine bicarbonate administration in this population:

- **No improvement in outcomes**: Bicarbonate therapy does not improve time to resolution of acidosis, insulin requirements, or length of hospital stay in patients with DKA and pH > 7.0 [^1163TwTf] [^114t76r8].

- **Potential harm**: Bicarbonate therapy is associated with significant risks, including hypokalemia, paradoxical central nervous system acidosis, and delayed ketone clearance [^112apFZT] [^116f3UJa].

- **Pediatric considerations**: In pediatric patients, bicarbonate use is associated with an increased risk of cerebral edema, a potentially fatal complication [^114t76r8].

---

## Guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus statements consistently **recommend against routine bicarbonate use** in DKA, particularly when pH is > 7.0:

- **ADA 2024 guidelines**: Strongly recommend against routine bicarbonate administration in DKA, emphasizing that it does not improve clinical outcomes and may cause harm [^1155FWi9].

- **AAFP 2024 guidelines**: Similarly recommend against routine bicarbonate use, highlighting potential risks and lack of benefit [^notfound].

- **Pediatric guidelines**: Bicarbonate is contraindicated in pediatric DKA except in cases of life-threatening acidosis with refractory shock or cardiac arrest [^117V2pjs].

---

## Potential risks and complications of bicarbonate therapy

Bicarbonate therapy in DKA with pH > 7.0 carries several **significant risks**:

- **Hypokalemia**: Bicarbonate administration can cause intracellular potassium shift, leading to severe hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmias [^116f3UJa] [^112kJ47g].

- **Paradoxical CNS acidosis**: Bicarbonate increases CO2 production, which can cross the blood-brain barrier and worsen intracellular acidosis in the central nervous system [^111kf8nN] [^1176vWUb].

- **Delayed ketone clearance**: Bicarbonate may inhibit ketone oxidation, delaying the resolution of ketosis [^112kJ47g] [^116f3UJa].

- **Hypernatremia and osmotic complications**: Bicarbonate administration increases sodium load, potentially causing hypernatremia and osmotic demyelination syndrome [^1176vWUb] [^112apFZT].

---

## Clinical scenarios where bicarbonate may be considered

Despite the general recommendation against routine use, bicarbonate therapy may be considered in **specific clinical scenarios**:

- **Severe acidosis (pH < 6.9)**: In cases of severe acidosis with refractory shock or cardiac arrest, bicarbonate may be considered as a temporizing measure while definitive therapy (fluids, insulin, electrolyte replacement) is initiated [^113pR2i8] [^114nZHFC].

- **Life-threatening hyperkalemia**: Bicarbonate may be used as part of the management of life-threatening hyperkalemia with severe acidosis, although its role is limited and should not delay other interventions [^117V2pjs].

---

## Alternative management strategies

Effective management of DKA with pH > 7.0 centers on **three pillars**:

- **Fluid resuscitation**: Isotonic saline or balanced crystalloids are recommended for initial volume replacement, with careful monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance [^112YtsdG] [^116vxCdp].

- **Insulin therapy**: Continuous intravenous insulin infusion is the standard of care, with careful monitoring of glucose and ketone levels [^1163TwTf] [^1178C8s6].

- **Electrolyte replacement**: Potassium replacement is critical, with careful monitoring to prevent hypokalemia or hyperkalemia [^115PqRtU].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Bicarbonate therapy** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| pH > 7.0 | Not recommended | - No benefit <br/> - Potential harm |
| pH 7.0–7.19 | Not recommended | - No benefit <br/> - Potential harm |
| pH < 6.9 with refractory shock or cardiac arrest | Consider | Temporizing measure while definitive therapy is initiated |

---

Bicarbonate therapy is **not indicated** in DKA when pH is above 7.0. Routine use is not recommended due to lack of benefit and potential harm. It should be reserved for rare cases of severe acidosis (pH < 6.9) with refractory shock or cardiac arrest, used alongside definitive therapy.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a relatively common and potentially fatal complication of type 1 diabetes. Diagnosing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) traditionally involves the identification of hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia and metabolic acidosis, often in that order. Recommended thresholds for diagnosis vary among different organizations. Values most commonly used are plasma glucose > 11 or > 13.9 mmol/L, pH < 7.3, bicarbonate < 18 or 15 mmol/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) > 3 mmol/L.

However, with an increasing prevalence of euglycemic ketoacidosis due to factors including the use of sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and a paucity of evidence confirming the 3mmol/L diagnostic threshold for blood ketones (BOHB), a study verifying ketone thresholds and identifying the reliance that can be placed on glucose and BOHB testing in this clinical situation is warranted. The current study aimed to use real-world data from patients admitted to an Emergency Department with presumptive DKA to validate, or not, current blood ketone concentration thresholds as well as to explore how effective blood glucose and blood BOHB measurement in identifying patients with significant acidosis.

Effect of various doses of insulin on recovery parameters

Table 3 demonstrates the outcome recovery data for DKA, depicting the time that predetermined values were reached for glucose, HCO 3 −, and pH. The results suggested no significant differences in these values for the three doses of insulin, but 5 of 12 patients in the no load group required additional insulin for control of their blood glucose. The length of hospitalization was not significantly different among the groups, there were no complications in any of the groups, and no deaths occurred in this cohort. No hypokalemia was noted in any treatment group. The potassium nadirs were 4.3, 4.2, and 3.7 mEq/l in the load, no load, and twice no load groups, respectively (Fig. 2).

Table 4 shows estimates of the slopes for glucose, venous pH, ketones, FFAs, bicarbonate, and cortisol during the first 8 h of therapy in the three insulin therapy groups. The response of serum bicarbonate and cortisol showed no differences among the treatment groups. However, the slopes for glucose, venous pH, ketones, and FFAs varied among treatment groups.

Bicarbonate infusion

In a ketoacidotic state, bicarbonate ions can be lost after their binding with the accumulated ketone bodies, followed by their excretion through the kidney. This is the rationale for bicarbonate supplementation in these patients. However, administration of bicarbonate may not necessarily correct acidosis; it may rather aggravate acidosis and hypoxia in the central nervous system, exacerbate hypokalemia, change serum calcium concentration, and increase plasma osmolality. The infusion of biocarbonate increases the blood pCO 2, which can cross the blood brain barrier faster than the biocarbonate. Increased pCO 2 in the brain would result in paradoxical fall in cerebral pH. Biocarbonate infusion could increase blood pH, which induces intracellular shift of potassium and lead to hypokalemia. Alkalosis can also promote calcium binding to proteins and decrease free calcium level. The sodium infused together with biocarbonate could increase body sodium load and plasma osmolality. Thus, bicarbonate infusion in DKA is only suggested to patients with severe acidosis.

Similarly, infusion of biocarbonate in patients with non-diabetic ketoacidosis might not achieve satisfactory results. For example, out of the 7 episodes of non-diabetic ketoacidosis described in this report, two children who received the highest dose of sodium bicarbonate (case 1 and 1st episode of Case 5; Tables 1 and 2) had altered mental status and seizures during the treatment. The child with highest biocarbonate infusion (case 1, 85 mL/kg) required the longest time to correct acidosis. Both of them did not show any rapid reversal of acidosis. On the contrary, one patient (2nd episode in Case 5; Tables 1 and 2) with severe acidosis (serum bicarbonate < 3 mmol/L) who received the lowest amount of bicarbonate infusion had a relatively shorter recovery time from acidosis. These findings suggest that, similar to diabetic ketoacidosis, the treatment of non-diabetic ketoacidosis should also be careful with the bicarbonate infusion. Bicarbonate should only be considered when there is severe acidosis and unstable hemodynamic signs after initial fluid resuscitation. Bicarbonate can be administered in the form of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution in a dosage of 1~2 mL/kg administered over 1 hour.

### Guidelines for the management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) have been poorly adopted and implemented, resulting in a lack of improvement in outcomes [^114LXpV7]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Study parameters and outcomes

We defined DKA as per recommendations by the JBDS‐IP guidelines (capillary or serum glucose > 11.0 mmol/L or a history of diabetes, and capillary or serum ketones > 3.0 mmol/L or urine ketones ≥ ++ and pH < 7.30 or bicarbonate < 15.0 mmol).DKA resolution was defined as pH > 7.30 or bicarbonate > 18.0 mmol and capillary or serum ketones < 0.6 mmol/L for two consecutive hours.

For this study, we identified specific parameters from this database relevant to implementing FRIII reduction guidelines and their impact on outcomes. These included sociodemographic data (age, gender, and ethnicity), duration of DKA, length of hospital admission and rate of FRIII. We also included the date and time of DKA diagnosis, resolution, time of first instance for blood glucose < 14 mmol/L during DKA episode, time to start 10% dextrose and time to reduce FRIII to 0.05 units/kg/h. Outcome measures included episodes of hypoglycaemia (defined as < 4 mmol/L), hypokalaemia (defined as < 3.5 mmol/L), hyperkalaemia (defined as > 5.5 mmol/L), and mortality. We evaluated outcomes as they occurred during the DKA episode. DKA duration was calculated as the time difference between DKA diagnosis and resolution and expressed in hours. Length of stay was calculated as the time difference between admission and discharge or death expressed in days.

DKA precipitants were classified into alcohol‐related, COVID‐19, drug‐induced, intercurrent illness, pump failure, new diagnosis of T1D, new diagnosis of T2D, sepsis, sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) related, suboptimal compliance with treatment, and unknown causes.

We described the 'adoption' of guidelines as a reduction in FRIII during the DKA episode and 'implementation' when FRIII reduction was adjusted correctly, as per the recommendations.

### Sodium bicarbonate [^112wKKwe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection is indicated in the treatment of metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate is further indicated in the treatment of certain drug intoxications, including barbiturates (where dissociation of the barbiturate-protein complex is desired), in poisoning by salicylates or methyl alcohol and in hemolytic reactions requiring alkalinization of the urine to diminish nephrotoxicity of hemoglobin and its breakdown products. Sodium bicarbonate also is indicated in severe diarrhea which is often accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate.

Treatment of metabolic acidosis should, if possible, be superimposed on measures designed to control the basic cause of the acidosis – e.g., insulin in uncomplicated diabetes, blood volume restoration in shock. But since an appreciable time interval may elapse before all of the ancillary effects are brought about, bicarbonate therapy is indicated to minimize risks inherent to the acidosis itself.

Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total CO2content is crucial – e.g., cardiac arrest, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, and in severe primary lactic acidosis or severe diabetic acidosis.

SGLT2i — perioperative management: SGLT2i must be discontinued 3 to 4 days before surgery, with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis defined as normoglycemia (blood glucose < 250 mg/dL) in the presence of metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.3), total decreased serum bicarbonate (< 18 mEq/L), and elevated serum and urine ketones; there are no clear guidelines regarding restarting SGLT2i after surgery and ideally they should not be recommended until the patient is clinically stable and has resumed a normal diet.

### Abstract… [^117UPrdD]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The therapeutic goals for diabetic ketoacidosis consist of improving circulatory volume and tissue perfusion, reducing blood glucose and serum osmolality toward normal levels, clearing ketones from serum and urine at a steady rate, correcting electrolyte imbalances and identifying precipitating factors. A suggested flow sheet for monitoring therapeutic response is provided in Figure 3.
6. The measured serum sodium concentration can be corrected for the changes related to hyperglycemia by adding

1. 6 mEq per L to the measured sodium value for every 100 mg per dL of glucose over the normal baseline of 100 mg per dL. The initial priority in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis is the restoration of extra-cellular fluid volume through the intravenous administration of a normal saline solution. This step will restore intravascular volume, decrease counterregulatory hormones and lower the blood glucose level.

9 As a result, insulin sensitivity may be augmented. In patients with mild to moderate volume depletion, infusion rates of 7 mL per kg per hour have been as efficacious as infusion rates of 14 mL per kg per hour. 10 The subsequent administration of a hypotonic saline solution, which is similar in composition to the fluid lost during osmotic diuresis, leads to gradual replacement of deficits in both intracellular and extracellular compartments. When the blood glucose concentration is approximately 250 mg per dL, glucose should be added to the hydration fluid. This allows continued insulin administration until ketonemia is controlled and also helps to avoid iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Another important aspect of rehydration therapy in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis is the replacement of ongoing urinary losses.

INSULIN THERAPY Modern management of diabetic ketoacidosis has emphasized the use of lower doses of insulin. This has been shown to be the most efficacious treatment in both children and adults with diabetic ketoacidosis. 11–14 The current recommendation is to give low-dose insulin after the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis has been confirmed by laboratory tests and fluid replacement has been initiated. Either of these treatments should be continued until the blood glucose level falls by 50 to 70 mg per dL. Low-dose insulin therapy typically produces a linear fall in the glucose concentration of 50 to 70 mg per dL per hour. 12 More rapid correction of hyperglycemia should be avoided because it may increase the risk of cerebral edema. This dreaded treatment complication occurs in approximately 1 percent of children with diabetic ketoacidosis.

When a blood glucose concentration of 250 mg per dL has been achieved, the continuous or hourly insulin dosage can be reduced to 0. 05 unit per kg per hour. The insulin and fluid regimens are continued until ketoacidosis is controlled. This requires the achievement of at least two of these acid-base parameters: a serum bicarbonate concentration of greater than 18 mEq per L, a venous pH of 7. 3 or greater and an anion gap of less than 14 mEq per L. POTASSIUM THERAPY Although the typical potassium deficit in diabetic ketoacidosis is 500 to 700 mEq, most patients are hyperkalemic at the time of diagnosis because of the effects of insulinopenia, hyperosmolality and acidemia. 4 During rehydration and insulin therapies for diabetic ketoacidosis, the serum potassium concentration typically declines rapidly as potassium reenters the intracellular compartment. One protocol entails using insulin and intravenous fluids until the serum potassium concentration is less than 5.

### 0.9% saline versus Ringer's lactate as initial fluid in children with diabetic ketoacidosis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111oFw6u]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

The study Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA was published by Ashish Agarwal and colleagues in 2025 in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetic ketoacidosis and Diabetes mellitus type 1. In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the trial question was: what is the effect of Ringer's lactate in children with T1DM mellitus who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis? In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the population was: 67 patients (44 female, 23 male). The inclusion criteria were children aged 9 months to 12 years with T1DM who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis. The key exclusion criteria were symptomatic cerebral edema; pre-existing/established CKD; underlying liver disorders; inborn errors of metabolism and serum potassium > 5.5 mEq/L at admission. In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the interventions were: n = 33 Ringer's lactate (Ringer's lactate as initial fluid for resuscitation and replacement) n = 34 saline (0.9% saline as initial fluid for resuscitation and replacement). In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis (12.9 hours vs. 16.8 hours; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.8). In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in rise in chloride level at 8 hours (4.4 mmol/L vs. 10.8 mmol/L; MD -6.4, 95% CI -10.7 to -2.1) Significant increase in rise in bicarbonate level at 12 hours (14.7 mmol/L vs. 12.9 mmol/L; MD 1.8, 95% CI 0.3 to 3.3) No significant difference in hypokalemia (45.5% vs. 61.8%; RR 0.74, 95% CI -0.34 to 1.82). In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the conclusion was: in children aged 9 months to 12 years with T1DM who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis, Ringer's lactate was superior to saline with respect to time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Comparisons of biochemical parameters and diabetic ketoacidosis severity in adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes [^111Gn69r]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This prospective observational study recruited all 99 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus who were diagnosed with DKA between 01 October 2018 and 30 September 2020 at our hospital.

Study subjects

Patients were assigned to the type 2 diabetes group if they were previously diagnosed and managed with diet and exercise alone or with oral hypoglycemic agents or with insulin but not on a regular basis. Patients with DKA whose medical records indicating prior diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or if serum C peptide was below 1 ng/mL and received regular insulin treatment at follow-up were regarded as type 1 diabetes. Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes were classified as type 1 diabetes if the level of C peptide below 1 ng/mL after resolution of DKA for 4 weeks.

The inclusion criteria were: age > 18 years, diagnosed with DKA and admitted to Maharaj Nakorn Si Thammarat Hospital, serum blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL and serum BHB ≥ 3 mmol/L, and venous blood pH < 7.3 or serum bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L. We classified the severity of DKA at the time of diagnosis into mild, moderate, and severe according to the 2009 consensus statement of the American Diabetes Association as follows: mild DKA, pH > 7.25 and HCO 3 ≥ 15 mmol/L or anion gap > 10; moderate DKA, pH 7.0–7.24 and HCO 3 10–15 mmol/L or anion gap > 12; severe DKA, pH < 7.0 and HCO 3 < 10 mmol/L or anion gap > 12. Serum BHB, venous pH, and electrolytes were followed up every 4 h until DKA was resolved. Resolution of DKA was defined as plasma glucose < 200 mg/dL plus any two of bicarbonate > 15 mmol/L, pH > 7.3, and anion gap < 12 mmol/L. Patients were excluded if they were unable to provide informed consent or had wide gap metabolic acidosis from other conditions (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2), drug-induced acidosis, chronic alcohol drinking, pregnancy, and serum lactate > 18 mg/dL (2 mmol/L).

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^111uooVy]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Our criteria for the diagnosis of DKA included plasma glucose > 250 mg/dl, HCO 3 − < 15 mEq/l, pH < 7.3, and moderate ketones in the urine or blood by the nitroprusside method. A total of 37 patients were prospectively randomly assigned to three groups as follows: 1) the load group consisted of 12 patients who received a loading dose of insulin at 0.07 unit/kg body weight followed by an infusion of 0.07 unit · kg body weight −1 · h −1; 2) the no load group consisted of 12 patients who received only an intravenous infusion of insulin at a dose of 0.07 unit · kg body weight −1 · h −1 without a loading dose; or 3) the twice no load group consisted of 13 patients who received an infusion of insulin at a dose of 0.14 unit · kg body weight −1 · h −1 without a bolus dose. Responses to therapy were based on the time to achieve a glucose level of ≤ 250 mg/dl, bicarbonate of ≥ 15 mEq/l, and pH ≥ 7.3. All other modes of therapy (hydrating solution, KCl, and HCO 3 −) were similar in the three groups and followed the recommendations of the first ADA position statement. All patients were seen in the emergency department of the Regional Medical Center at Memphis. Upon arrival, history was obtained and a physical examination was performed. Urine ketones (by nitroprusside) plus glucose by fingerstick and blood gas measurements were obtained immediately. Once a suspected diagnosis of DKA was made, the initial laboratory blood samples were obtained for basal metabolic parameters and complete blood count with differential; urinalysis was performed for blood and urine ketones by both the nitroprusside and enzymatic methods. Patients then received 1 liter of 0.9% NaCl per hour until laboratory results were available. After laboratory confirmation, the intravenous fluids were adjusted, depending on the glucose and corrected serum sodium value, to ½ N saline or dextrose with 1 N or ½ N saline. With confirmation of the diagnosis of DKA and an acceptable potassium level (> 3.3 mEq/l), the patients were then transferred to the Clinical Research Center (CRC) of the University of Tennessee Bowld Hospital after the research study was described to the patients or their next of kin and the consent form, which was approved by the University of Tennessee Health Science Center of Memphis Institutional Review Board, was signed. On arrival at the CRC, the treatment and care of patients was managed by the DKA team, including the medical housestaff on rotation for the service, following an established protocol with consultation of the staff endocrinologist. Hourly blood glucose measurements and blood samples for free insulin were obtained at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min. Blood for measurement of other hormones and ketone bodies, blood gases, and metabolic profile; urinalysis for ketones; and other parameters were obtained. Random assignment of patients to different insulin regimens was done after arrival at the CRC. Random assignment was not based on sex or ethnicity. Because a priming dose of insulin adds an additional risk of hypokalemia, potassium levels were assessed and corrected on an hourly basis for the first few hours of therapy until glucose reached the predetermined goal of < 250 mg/dl (i.e. ∼4 h) and every 2 h thereafter.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^112zo74N]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

The object of this review is to provide the definitions, frequency, risk factors, pathophysiology, diagnostic considerations, and management recommendations for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children and adolescents, and to convey current knowledge of the causes of permanent disability or mortality from complications of DKA or its management, particularly the most common complication, cerebral edema (CE). DKA frequency at the time of diagnosis of pediatric diabetes is 10%-70%, varying with the availability of healthcare and the incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the community. Recurrent DKA rates are also dependent on medical services and socioeconomic circumstances. Management should be in centers with experience and where vital signs, neurologic status, and biochemistry can be monitored with sufficient frequency to prevent complications or, in the case of CE, to intervene rapidly with mannitol or hypertonic saline infusion. Fluid infusion should precede insulin administration (0.1 U/kg/h) by 1–2 hours; an initial bolus of 10–20 mL/kg 0.9% saline is followed by 0.45% saline calculated to supply maintenance and replace 5%-10% dehydration. Potassium (K) must be replaced early and sufficiently. Bicarbonate administration is contraindicated. The prevention of DKA at onset of diabetes requires an informed community and high index of suspicion; prevention of recurrent DKA, which is almost always due to insulin omission, necessitates a committed team effort.

### Thirty years of personal experience in hyperglycemic crises: diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [^116kkeVh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) cause major morbidity and significant mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. For more than 30 yr, our group, in a series of prospective, randomized clinical studies, has investigated the pathogenesis and evolving strategies of the treatment of hyperglycemic crises. This paper summarizes the results of these prospective studies on the management and pathophysiology of DKA.

Setting

Our earliest studies evaluated the comparative efficacy of low-dose vs. pharmacological amounts of insulin and the use of low-dose therapy by various routes in adults and later in children. Subsequent studies evaluated phosphate and bicarbonate therapy, lipid metabolism, ketosis-prone type 2 patients, and use of rapid-acting insulin analogs as well as leptin status, cardiac risk factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and the mechanism of activation of T lymphocytes in hyperglycemic crises.

Main Outcome

The information garnered from these studies resulted in the creation of the 2001 American Diabetes Association (ADA) technical review on DKA and HHS as well as the ADA Position and Consensus Paper on the therapy for hyperglycemic crises.

Conclusions

Areas of future research include prospective randomized studies to do the following: 1) establish the efficacy of bicarbonate therapy in DKA for a pH less than 6.9; 2) establish the need for a bolus insulin dose in the initial therapy of DKA; 3) determine the pathophysiological mechanisms for the absence of ketosis in HHS; 4) investigate the reasons for elevated proinflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular risk factors; and 5) evaluate the efficacy and cost benefit of using sc regular insulin vs. more expensive insulin analogs on the general ward for the treatment of DKA.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^117JtEQn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

For the observational studies, a quality assessment was conducted by using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool from the Cochrane Review. We judged the "Risk of Bias" as "low", "moderate", "serious", "critical" or "no information (NI)". We assessed the following domains: bias due to confounding, bias in selection of participants into the study, bias in classification of interventions, bias due to deviation from intended intervention, bias due to missing data, bias in measurement of outcomes, and bias in selection of the reported result. We synthesized the overall risk of bias based on the outcomes within each domain. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

We conducted meta-analyses using the Dersimonian and Laird random-effects models with inverse variance weighting to pool data across studies for each outcome of interest at the suggestion of journal reviewers. A random-effects approach was used due to the clinical heterogeneity across the various studies. If the measures were continuous, we estimated mean differences (MDs) and for count data, we estimated pooled risk ratios (RRs). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis whereby we conducted meta-analyses stratified by the type of study (RCTs and observational studies). The meta-analyses were conducted using R software, version 4,2,3. The data used to conduct the meta-analysis is available in Supplementary Table 1.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^114t76r8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence supporting bicarbonate therapy as either pushes of ampules of sodium bicarbonate or as a resuscitation fluid are lacking. A systematic review by Chua et al. examined clinical and physiologic outcomes with the use of bicarbonate therapy in adult and pediatric patients with DKA and showed no mortality benefit with sodium bicarbonate use compared with conventional fluid resuscitation. In addition, in three pediatric studies, investigators observed an association between bicarbonate therapy and development of cerebral edema. One multicenter study calculated a relative risk for the development of cerebral edema as high as 4.2 (95% CI 1.5–12.1). However, the two remaining studies found no association after adjusting for baseline acidosis. There were no available studies examining the risk of cerebral edema in adult DKA populations. There was no difference in neurologic recovery with bicarbonate therapy in adult patients with DKA and no available studies on this endpoint in pediatric patients. Two studies examined hemodynamic parameters (i.e. heart rate, respiratory rate, and mean arterial pressure) in adult patients with DKA and found no difference with or without bicarbonate therapy. Importantly, an older, small RCT found that among patients with DKA with a pH between 6.90 and 7.14, there was no improvement in morbidity or mortality or time to resolution of DKA among patients receiving bicarbonate therapy. Another found no difference in the length of hospital stay with bicarbonate therapy. More recently, a retrospective study evaluated time to resolution of acidosis and hospital length of stay in ED patients presenting with DKA and an initial pH < 7.0. Patients were stratified into two groups based on receipt of bicarbonate or not. The authors found no significant difference in time to resolution of acidosis or hospital length of stay between patients who received bicarbonate and those who did not, including in a predefined subgroup of patients with initial pH < 6.9. The lack of conclusive data is reflected in the various society guidelines and sodium bicarbonate administration is still recommended by some professional societies if pH is < 6.9, but not others.

Patient clinical outcome and predictors of mortality

Patients were stratified based on treatment outcome (if survived or died). A summary of the demographic, biochemical and clinical predictors with regards to final treatment outcome in 243 patients who had either survived (n = 180) or died (n = 63) is shown in Table 2. Most patients had an age of < 60 years old (n = 95, 39.1%)]. Majority of the patients were male (n = 134, 55.1%); and most of the cases belonged to Hispanic (n = 53, 21.8%) and black ethnicity (n = 45, 18.5%). There was a high obesity rate [BMI ≥ 30: n = 27, 11.1%]. Diabetes types among those patients were approximately identical [newly diagnosed (n = 61, 25.1%); pre-existing diabetes mellitus type 1 (n = 60, 24.7%); and pre-existing diabetes mellitus type 2 (n = 60, 24.7%)]. Most patients presented with a random blood glucose level in the range of 500 mg/dl and 1000 mg/dl [n = 61, 25.1%]. About 69 (28.4%) of the patients had an HbA1c higher than ≥ 10%. As expected with the acute DKA complication, most patients had abnormal arterial pH [pH between 7–7.34: n = 78, 32.1%; and pH < 7.00: n = 29, 11.9%]. Also, most patients had low bicarbonate [≤ 11 mmol/l: n = 69, 28.4%] and high anion gap [between 21–30 mEq/l: n = 39, 16%; and between 31–50 mEq/l: n = 20, 8.2%]; Table 2.

### Clinical effects of balanced crystalloids vs saline in adults with diabetic ketoacidosis: a subgroup analysis of cluster randomized clinical trials [^113FVmo3]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Saline (0.9% sodium chloride), the fluid most commonly used to treat diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Balanced crystalloids, an alternative class of fluids for volume expansion, do not cause acidosis and, therefore, may lead to faster resolution of DKA than saline.

Objective

To compare the clinical effects of balanced crystalloids with the clinical effects of saline for the acute treatment of adults with DKA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study was a subgroup analysis of adults with DKA in 2 previously reported companion trials-Saline Against Lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte in the Emergency Department (SALT-ED) and the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART). These trials, conducted between January 2016 and March 2017 in an academic medical center in the US, were pragmatic, multiple-crossover, cluster, randomized clinical trials comparing balanced crystalloids vs saline in emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU) patients. This study included adults who presented to the ED with DKA, defined as a clinical diagnosis of DKA, plasma glucose greater than 250 mg/dL, plasma bicarbonate less than or equal to 18 mmol/L, and anion gap greater than 10 mmol/L. Data analysis was performed from January to April 2020.

Interventions

Balanced crystalloids (clinician's choice of Ringer lactate solution or Plasma-Lyte A solution) vs saline for fluid administration in the ED and ICU according to the same cluster-randomized multiple-crossover schedule.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time between ED presentation and DKA resolution, as defined by American Diabetes Association criteria. The secondary outcome was time between initiation and discontinuation of continuous insulin infusion.

Results

Among 172 adults included in this secondary analysis of cluster trials, 94 were assigned to balanced crystalloids and 78 to saline. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 29 (24–45) years, and 90 (52.3%) were women. The median (IQR) volume of isotonic fluid administered in the ED and ICU was 4478 (3000–6372) mL. Cumulative incidence analysis revealed shorter time to DKA resolution in the balanced crystalloids group (median time to resolution: 13.0 hours; IQR: 9.5–18.8 hours) than the saline group (median: 16.9 hours; IQR: 11.9–34.5 hours) (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.18–2.38; p = 0.004). Cumulative incidence analysis also revealed shorter time to insulin infusion discontinuation in the balanced crystalloids group (median: 9.8 hours; IQR: 5.1–17.0 hours) than the saline group (median: 13.4 hours; IQR: 11.0–17.9 hours) (aHR = 1.45; 95% CI, 1.03–2.03; p = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of 2 cluster randomized clinical trials, compared with saline, treatment with balanced crystalloids resulted in more rapid resolution of DKA, suggesting that balanced crystalloids may be preferred over saline for acute management of adults with DKA.

### Pediatric non-diabetic ketoacidosis: a case-series report [^116kK37C]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This study is to explore the clinical characteristics, laboratory diagnosis, and treatment outcomes in pediatric patients with non-diabetic ketoacidosis.

Methods

Retrospective patient chart review was performed between March 2009 to March 2015. Cases were included if they met the selection criteria for non-diabetic ketoacidosis, which were: 1) Age ≤ 18 years; 2) urine ketone positive ++ or > 8.0 mmol/L; 3) blood ketone > 3.1 mmol/L; 4) acidosis (pH < 7.3) and/or HCO 3 < 15 mmol/L; 5) random blood glucose level < 11.1 mmol/L. Patients who met the criteria 1, 4, 5, plus either 2 or 3, were defined as non-diabetic ketoacidosis and were included in the report.

Results

Five patients with 7 episodes of non-diabetic ketoacidosis were identified. They all presented with dehydration, poor appetite, and Kussmaul breathing. Patients treated with insulin plus glucose supplementation had a quicker recovery from acidosis, in comparison to those treated with bicarbonate infusion and continuous renal replacement therapy. Two patients treated with bicarbonate infusion developed transient coma and seizures during the treatment.

Conclusion

Despite normal or low blood glucose levels, patients with non-diabetic ketoacidosis should receive insulin administration with glucose supplementation to correct ketoacidosis.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^1159y2Lx]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Insulin

Insulin should be started after initial fluid expansion. This provides a more realistic starting glucose level.
0.1 U/kg/hour is given as a continuous infusion, using a pump. Fifty units of regular insulin are diluted in 50 mL normal saline to provide 1 unit/mL.
A bolus dose of insulin is not indicated and may increase the risk of CE.
In some settings it may be necessary to administer insulin subcutaneously. Studies in adults have indicated no significant difference in recovery time whether insulin was administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously after the first couple of hours of treatment. A study of subcutaneous insulin in children with DKA using a rapid-acting insulin analog (lispro) provided a dose of 0.15 units/kg every 2 hours; there were no significant differences from children randomized to receive 0.1 unit/kg per hour intravenously. The administration of 0.1 unit/kg subcutaneously every hour may be preferable and can be adjusted to maintain blood glucose concentrations at ∼180–200 mg/dL (10–11 mmol/L).
Fluid expansion alone will have a dilutional effect, lowering high blood glucose levels by as much as 180–270 mg/dL (10–15 mmol/L). With insulin infusion the rate of glucose decline should be 50–150 mg/dL (2.8–8.3 mmol/L/hour), but not > 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L/hour). If serum glucose values are not dropping adequately, the insulin dose should be increased; this is rarely necessary.
If the blood glucose concentration falls below 150 mg/dL (8.3 mmol/L) 10% dextrose solution should be given and the insulin dose reduced to 0.05 U/kg/hour if glucose concentration is not sustained by the 10% dextrose solution.
Insulin should not be stopped; a continuous supply of insulin is needed to prevent ketosis and permit continued anabolism. If the patient demonstrates marked sensitivity to insulin, the dose may be decreased to 0.05 units/kg/hour, or less, provided that metabolic acidosis continues to resolve.
Persistent acidosis, defined as bicarbonate value < 10 mmol/L after 8–10 hours of treatment, is usually caused by inadequate insulin effect. Insulin dilution and rate of administration should be checked, and a fresh preparation made. Too dilute a solution may enhance insulin adherence to the tubing. If insulin is being given by subcutaneous injection, inadequate absorption may be occurring. Rare causes of persistent acidosis include lactic acidosis due to an episode of hypotension or apnea or inadequate renal handling of hydrogen ion as a result of an episode of renal hypoperfusion.

### Update and harmonisation of guidance for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and young people in the UK [^117V2pjs]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Both BSPED and NICE recommend the following fluid maintenance requirements, using 0.9% sodium chloride without added glucose, and the Holliday-Segar formula:

100 mL/kg for the first 10 kg (0–10 kg body weight).
50 mL/kg for the second 10 kg (10–20 kg body weight).
20 mL/kg for each subsequent kilogramme (> 20 kg body weight).
When calculating the total fluid replacement, subtract any initial bolus volumes from the total fluid deficit (unless the child or young person is in shock).

For insulin and electrolyte replacement requirements, both recommend:

The addition of 40 mmol/L potassium chloride to all fluids (apart from the initial intravenous bolus) unless the patient is anuric or hyperkalaemic. Include this before starting the insulin infusion if hypokalaemia is observed at presentation.
0.9% sodium chloride should be used without added glucose unless the plasma glucose is < 14 mmol/L.
Initially assess for the presence of hyponatraemia, continue to monitor throughout treatment and treat as soon as blood glucose falls. Monitor sodium levels throughout treatment and calculate sodium initially to identify if hyponatraemia is present. This should be treated as soon as blood glucose falls. It is important to monitor as hyponatraemia and rapidly increasing sodium levels can both be signs of CO.
Do not give intravenous sodium bicarbonate to CYP with DKA unless they have compromised cardiac contractility caused by life-threatening hyperkalaemia or severe acidosis, and you have discussed with paediatric intensivist.
A soluble insulin infusion of between 0.05 units/kg/hour and 0.1 units/kg/hour, 1–2 hours after intravenous fluids have been commenced. BSPED stated that the 0.05 units/kg/hour should be sufficient unless the patient is suffering from severe DKA or is an adolescent. If they are attached to a 'continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion', disconnect when starting intravenous insulin therapy. For patients already on long-acting insulin, it may be continued, and in new patients consider commencing long-acting subcutaneous insulin alongside intravenous. Similarly, the NICE guidelines state that continuing subcutaneous basal insulin in a child or young person who was using a basal insulin before DKA may be continued in discussion with a diabetes specialist.

### Fluid resuscitation with balanced electrolyte solutions results in faster resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis than with 0.9% saline in adults – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113CnGK2]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Fluid resuscitation during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is most frequently performed with 0.9% saline despite its high chloride and sodium concentration. Balanced Electrolyte Solutions (BES) may prove a more physiological alternative, but convincing evidence is missing. We aimed to compare the efficacy of 0.9% saline to BES in DKA management. MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies using predefined keywords (from inception to 27 November 2021). Relevant studies were those in which 0.9% saline (Saline-group) was compared to BES (BES-group) in adults admitted with DKA. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution (defined by each study individually), while the main secondary outcomes were changes in laboratory values, duration of insulin infusion, and mortality. We included seven randomized controlled trials and three observational studies with 1006 participants. The primary outcome was reported for 316 patients, and we found that BES resolves DKA faster than 0.9% saline with a mean difference (MD) of -5.36 [95% CI: -10.46, -0.26] hours. Post-resuscitation chloride (MD: -4.26 [-6.97, -1.54] mmoL/L) and sodium (MD: -1.38 [-2.14, -0.62] mmoL/L) levels were significantly lower. In contrast, levels of post-resuscitation bicarbonate (MD: 1.82 [0.75, 2.89] mmoL/L) were significantly elevated in the BES-group compared to the Saline-group. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding the duration of parenteral insulin administration (MD: 0.16 [-3.03, 3.35] hours) or mortality (OR: -0.67 [0.12, 3.68]). Studies showed some concern or a high risk of bias, and the level of evidence for most outcomes was low. This meta-analysis indicates that the use of BES resolves DKA faster than 0.9% saline. Therefore, DKA guidelines should consider BES instead of 0.9% saline as the first choice during fluid resuscitation.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^116ZgiFF]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is characterized by a serum glucose level greater than 250 mg per dL, a pH less than 7.3, a serum bicarbonate level less than 18 mEq per L, an elevated serum ketone level, and dehydration. Insulin deficiency is the main precipitating factor. Diabetic ketoacidosis can occur in persons of all ages, with 14 percent of cases occurring in persons older than 70 years, 23 percent in persons 51 to 70 years of age, 27 percent in persons 30 to 50 years of age, and 36 percent in persons younger than 30 years. The case fatality rate is 1 to 5 percent. About one-third of all cases are in persons without a history of diabetes mellitus. Common symptoms include polyuria with polydipsia (98 percent), weight loss (81 percent), fatigue (62 percent), dyspnea (57 percent), vomiting (46 percent), preceding febrile illness (40 percent), abdominal pain (32 percent), and polyphagia (23 percent). Measurement of A1C, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum glucose, electrolytes, pH, and serum ketones; complete blood count; urinalysis; electrocardiography; and calculation of anion gap and osmolar gap can differentiate diabetic ketoacidosis from hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, gastroenteritis, starvation ketosis, and other metabolic syndromes, and can assist in diagnosing comorbid conditions. Appropriate treatment includes administering intravenous fluids and insulin, and monitoring glucose and electrolyte levels. Cerebral edema is a rare but severe complication that occurs predominantly in children. Physicians should recognize the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis for prompt diagnosis, and identify early symptoms to prevent it. Patient education should include information on how to adjust insulin during times of illness and how to monitor glucose and ketone levels, as well as information on the importance of medication compliance.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^114axg41]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

The use of sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis is intuitive, yet data suggest that not all patients benefit from this therapy.

Objective:

In this narrative review, we describe the physiology behind commonly encountered nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis, highlight potential harm from the indiscriminate administration of sodium bicarbonate in certain scenarios, and provide evidence-based recommendations to assist emergency physicians in rationale use of sodium bicarbonate.

Discussion:

Sodium bicarbonate can be administered as a hypertonic push, as a resuscitation fluid, or as an infusion. Lactic acidosis and cardiac arrest are two common scenarios where there is limited benefit to routine use of sodium bicarbonate, although certain circumstances, such as patients with concomitant acute kidney injury and lactic acidosis may benefit from sodium bicarbonate. Patients with cardiac arrest secondary to sodium channel blockade or hyperkalemia also benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy. Recent data suggest that the use of sodium bicarbonate in diabetic ketoacidosis does not confer improved patient outcomes and may cause harm in pediatric patients. Available evidence suggests that alkalinization of urine in rhabdomyolysis does not improve patient-centered outcomes. Finally, patients with a nongap acidosis benefit from sodium bicarbonate supplementation.

Conclusions:

Empiric use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis is not warranted and likely does not improve patient-centered outcomes, except in select scenarios. Emergency physicians should reserve use of this medication to conditions with clear benefit to patients.

### Approach to the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^114nZHFC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a common cause of severe metabolic acidosis, remains a life-threatening condition due to complications of both the disease and its treatment. This Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case discusses DKA management, emphasizing complications of treatment. Because cerebral edema is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity, especially in children with DKA, we emphasize its pathophysiology and implications for therapy. The risk for cerebral edema may be minimized by avoiding a bolus of insulin, excessive saline resuscitation, and a decrease in effective plasma osmolality early in treatment. A goal of fluid therapy is to lower muscle venous Pco 2 to ensure effective removal of hydrogen ions by bicarbonate buffer in muscle and diminish the binding of hydrogen ions to intracellular proteins in vital organs (such as the brain). In patients with DKA and a relatively low plasma potassium level, insulin administration may cause hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmias. It is suggested in these cases to temporarily delay insulin administration and first administer potassium chloride intravenously to bring the plasma potassium level close to 4mmol/L. Sodium bicarbonate administration in adult patients should be individualized. We suggest it be considered in a subset of patients with moderately severe acidemia (pH < 7.20 and plasma bicarbonate level < 12mmol/L) who are at risk for worsening acidemia, particularly if hemodynamically unstable. Sodium bicarbonate should not be administered to children with DKA, except if acidemia is very severe and hemodynamic instability is refractory to saline administration.

### Bicarbonate therapy in severe metabolic acidosis [^115qNaVZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The utility of bicarbonate administration to patients with severe metabolic acidosis remains controversial. Chronic bicarbonate replacement is obviously indicated for patients who continue to lose bicarbonate in the ambulatory setting, particularly patients with renal tubular acidosis syndromes or diarrhea. In patients with acute lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, lactate and ketone bodies can be converted back to bicarbonate if the clinical situation improves. For these patients, therapy must be individualized. In general, bicarbonate should be given at an arterial blood pH of ≤ 7.0. The amount given should be what is calculated to bring the pH up to 7.2. The urge to give bicarbonate to a patient with severe acidemia is apt to be all but irresistible. Intervention should be restrained, however, unless the clinical situation clearly suggests benefit. Here we discuss the pros and cons of bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidosis.

Insulin therapy must be initiated 1–2 hours after the beginning of fluid resuscitation, if there has already been an improvement in peripheral perfusion; then, low insulin doses may be administered by intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) route. Continuous IV infusion of low doses of human regular insulin has been chosen most often as it causes more predictable fall of blood glucose levels, and it allows for more immediate dose adjustments. Nevertheless, IV insulin administration requires another venous line to allow independent handling of fluid hydration and of the insulin infusion rate.

Human regular insulin should be infused at the dose of 0.1 U/Kg/hour (for instance: 50 U in 500 mL of 0.9% saline solution, where 1 mL = 0.1 U) aiming to promote a plasma glucose concentration fall at a rate of 50–90 mg/dl/hour. Capillary blood glucose should be measured hourly, as well as the rate of falling of plasma glucose concentrations; if the patient demonstrates marked sensitivity to insulin, 5% glucose shall be added to the saline solution or insulin dose may be reduced to 0.05 U/Kg/hour, so that IV insulin therapy is kept until ketosis and metabolic acidosis are under control.

In most DKA events, metabolic acidosis control will occur as a consequence of fluid replacement and insulin therapy; however, in severe cases when pH < 6.9, alkali therapy may be indicated in order to prevent decreased cardiac contractility and peripheral vasodilatation that could further impair tissue perfusion. Bicarbonate administration of 1–2 mEq/kg would be done over 1–2 hours or according to the following formula:

Bicarbonate to be administered (mEq) = (15 - Bicarbonate found) × 0.3 × weight (kg)

Venous blood sampling should be obtained every 2 hours for monitoring plasma glucose, serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphorus), blood urea, creatinine levels, and blood gases until metabolic acidosis is corrected. In case a phosphate solution is used at rehydration phase, it is also recommended to monitor calcium and magnesium levels.

When metabolic acidosis is controlled (pH > 7.3, bicarbonate > 15, and/or anion gap = 12 ± 2), IV regular insulin may be replaced by intermittent SC regular insulin administration (0.1 U/kg every 4 hours), which must be initiated 1–2 hours before interrupting the IV regular insulin infusion.

### Re-visiting pH-adjusted potassium to avoid hypokalemic crisis during management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a conceptual framework [^116oYfQC]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) treatment guidelines recommend to initiate potassium-replacement when serum potassium (S K) drops within normal range, and to withhold insulin if S K is below normal. Despite strict recommendations, hypokalemia is frequently observed in DKA.

Methods

Scientific literature was thoroughly searched to find 1) DKA treatment guidelines, 2) studies reporting hypokalemia in DKA, 3) and literature elaborating mechanisms involved in hypokalemia.

Results

Acidosis affects S K and its regulators including insulin, catecholamines and aldosterone. Current conceptual framework is an argument to gauge the degree of hypokalemia before it strikes DKA patients utilizing S K level after adjusting it with pH. Suggested approach will reduce hypokalemia risk and its associated complications. The nomogram calculates pH-adjusted potassium and expected potassium loss. It also ranks hypokalemia associated risk, and proposes the potassium-replacement rate over given time period. The differences between current DKA treatment guidelines and proposed strategy are also discussed. Moreover, reasons and risk of hyperkalemia due to early initiation of potassium replacement and remedial actions are debated.

Conclusion

In light of proposed strategy, utilizing the nomogram ensures reduced incidence of hypokalemia in DKA resulting in improved clinical and patient outcomes. Pharmacoeconomic benefits can also be expected when avoiding hypokalemia ensures early discharge.

A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis requires the patient's plasma glucose concentration to be above 250 mg per dL (although it usually is much higher), the pH level to be less than 7.30, and the bicarbonate level to be 18 mEq per L or less. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is a better measurement of the degree of ketosis than serum ketones. Intravenous insulin and fluid replacement are the mainstays of therapy, with careful monitoring of potassium levels. Phosphorous and magnesium also may need to be replaced. Bicarbonate therapy rarely is needed. Infection, insulin omission, and other problems that may have precipitated ketoacidosis should be treated. Myocardial infarction is a precipitating cause of diabetic ketoacidosis that is especially important to look for in older patients with diabetes. Cerebral edema is a major complication that occurs primarily in children. Education to prevent recurrence should be offered to all patients, including how to manage sick days and when to call a physician.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^116mHPx6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Our systematic review was conducted by following a prespecified protocol and is reported based on the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Our protocol was registered with Prospero (CRD42022339577). Material deviations to the prespecified protocol are described below.

We systematically searched Ovid-Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, BIOSIS and CENTRAL from inception until April 26th, 2024 to identify studies that compared the use of subcutaneous insulin to continuous IV insulin for the treatment of mild to moderate DKA. Keywords and search strategies used are available in Appendix 1.

We included RCTs and observational studies that compared subcutaneous insulin and a continuous IV insulin infusion in managing adult patients with mild-to-moderate DKA. Subcutaneous insulin included either short-acting or rapid-acting insulin. Inclusion was restricted to studies that included adults age ≥ 18 years old, who were identified as having diabetes with DKA, defined as having arterial pH ≤ 7.3, serum bicarbonate ≤ 18 mmol/L and anion gap is > 12 mmol/L with positive serum and/or urine ketones. Our definition of DKA was based on the criteria outlined in the ADA guidelines. Mild DKA is defined as pH 7.25 to 7.30 and serum bicarbonate 15 to 18 mmol/L, whereas moderate was defined as pH 7.00 to < 7.24 and serum bicarbonate 10 to < 15 mmol/L Studies were required to report at least one of the following outcomes: length of stay, time to resolution of DKA, mortality, need for intensive care stay, hypoglycemia or hypokalemia. Studies that compared subcutaneous insulin versus IV insulin in severe DKA, or in patients with hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, comatose state, and other medical conditions that warranted ICU admission were excluded.

### Management of diabetic keto-acidosis in adult patients admitted to intensive care unit: an ESICM-endorsed international survey [^112ZuD23]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) management are limited, resulting in varied practices. This study assessed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission criteria, fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and metabolic management in adult patients with DKA.

Methods

An international survey of ICU clinicians consisted of 39 items that focused on management of DKA and was endorsed by the European Society of the Intensive Care Medicine. An experienced ICU was defined as a unit admitting > 20 patients with DKA per year.

Results

A total of 522 respondents from 57 different countries participated: 295(57%) worked in Europe, 86(16%) in North America, 25(5%) in South America, 52(10%) in Africa, 52(10%) in Asia and 12(2%) in Oceania. Among respondents, 377(72%) worked in teaching hospitals, 355(68%) in medical-surgical ICUs, and 204(39%) in experienced ICUs. The pH value (< 7.20), arterial or venous bicarbonate concentration (< 15 mmol/L), and the need for continuous intravenous insulin (regardless of the dose) were considered criteria for ICU admission by 362(69%), 240(46%) and 264(51%) respondents, respectively. A protocol for fluid resuscitation was available for 290(63%) respondents, 135(29%) administered isotonic saline only, 173(38%) administered balanced solutions only, and 153(33%) administered both. A protocol for insulin therapy was available for 355(77%) respondents. An initial bolus of intravenous insulin was administered by 228(49%) respondents, 221(48%) used an initial continuous intravenous insulin dose of 0.1 UI/kg/h, 42(9%) used an initial predefined fixed dose, 159(35%) based the initial dose on blood glucose and 39(8%) on blood and/or urine ketones. Fluid choice and modalities of intravenous insulin administration did not differ between experienced and non-experienced ICUs. Intravenous insulin administration was more likely to be initiated upon ICU admission (57%vs.45%, p = 0.04) and less likely after initial fluid resuscitation (27%vs.35%, p = 0.04) in experienced ICUs. Arterial or venous pH was monitored by 408(90%) respondents. Arterial blood gases were favored by 236(52%) respondents and venous blood gases were more likely to be performed in experienced ICUs (30%vs.18%, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

The management of patients with DKA remains heterogeneous worldwide. Future randomized trials are needed, especially regarding fluid resuscitation and insulin therapy. Trial registrationNot applicable.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^116rLYRF]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study of patients presumed as having DKA has been unable to verify the equivalence between a BOHB concentration of 3mmol/L and that of a bicarbonate concentration of 18mmol/L. Indeed, on average, pH and bicarbonate concentrations which were not abnormal equated to a BOHB of 3mmol/L. The 3mmol/L value originally adopted by several guidelines appears derived from preliminary recommendations based on a study of only 14 patients admitted to hospital with DKA. A single larger study which equated BOHB concentrations to a bicarbonate concentration of 18mmol/L actually only quoted the BOHB equivalence of 3.0mmol/L to be in children, while in adults this was 3.8mmol/L. Notwithstanding these data, a BOHB threshold of 3.0mmol/L continues to be promulgated in guidelines. In the current study, the 18mmol/L bicarbonate level equated, on average, to a BOHB concentration of 4.3mmol/L, which is closer to the aforementioned Sheikh-Ali adult value and other more contemporary findings. More recent DKA diagnostic guidelines have suggested a lower bicarbonate concentration of < 15mmol/L as a diagnostic criterion. In our study, this equated to a BOHB value of 4.7mmol/L.

It might be assumed that our data therefore suggests that consideration should be given to raising the diagnostic DKA threshold for blood BOHB concentrations. However, what this current study has also shown is that in real-world situations, using modern point-of-care blood ketone testing, there is a marked spread of BOHB values around the same (including pathological) bicarbonate concentration (r = -0.49) or, alternatively, the pH (r = -0.44). This spread means that significant acidosis, for instance defined as pH < 7.30, may be present even when the BOHB concentration is considerably lower than the 4.4mmol/L equivalent value, as indicated in Fig. 1 C, and, indeed, lower than the 3mmol/L traditionally used.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^116f3UJa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Several studies suggest a potential role for bicarbonate therapy in the recovery phase of DKA. After volume resuscitation, bicarbonate is regenerated, but may be offset by development of hyperchloremia, as ketoacids are preferentially excreted over chloride anions. In addition, patients with persistent kidney injury and reduced production of renal bicarbonate may theoretically benefit from bicarbonate administration to correct this relative bicarbonate deficiency. Two adult RCTs found quicker reversal of acidosis with bicarbonate therapy at 2 h, but this benefit was not sustained beyond 2 h. There were no significant differences in glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, tissue oxygenation, or cerebrospinal fluid acidosis, but increased rates of hypokalemia. Finally, two studies found paradoxical worsening of ketonemia with bicarbonate therapy, theorized to be due to augmented hepatic ketogenesis.

Recommendation

Sodium bicarbonate therapy in the initial resuscitation or recovery phase of DKA is not recommended and may cause harm in pediatric patients, although data in patients with severe acidosis (pH < 7.0) and hyperkalemia are lacking (Level of evidence: B).

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^113u3pne]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

DKA is the result of absolute or relative deficiency of insulin in combination with exuberant secretion of counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, growth hormone) resulting in blockade of glucose utilization in insulin-sensitive tissues (liver, fat, muscle) and a cascade of derangement progressing to ketoacidosis and dehydration. Much new-onset DKA can be prevented by increased awareness of early signs and symptoms of diabetes and, in principle, almost all recurrent DKA is preventable by informed sick day management, recognition of psychosocial problems leading to insulin omission, and careful monitoring of insulin pump function.

Management of DKA should occur in centers with treatment experience and monitoring capability. Fluid replacement begins with 0.9% saline to restore circulation and subsequent 0.45% saline for maintenance and replacement of 5%–10% dehydration, according to severity indicators. Whether levels of serum K are normal or elevated, there will be a total K deficit that must be dealt with early and sufficiently. Bicarbonate administration is neither necessary nor safe. Mannitol or hypertonic saline should be at the bedside, for rapid intervention as indicated for CE, the most common serious complication of DKA. Other complications include hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypoglycemia, intracerebral complications other than CE, peripheral venous thrombosis, mucormycosis, aspiration pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, acute pancreatitis, and acute renal failure. Among questions that need to be addressed regarding DKA in children and adolescents are whether feasible and cost-effective methods can reduce the frequency of new-onset and recurrent DKA, what characterizes optimal fluid replacement therapy, how effective proposed monitoring and intervention criteria are in the reduction of CE morbidity and mortality, and whether hypertonic saline is as or more effective than mannitol in the treatment of CE.

Key points

Treatment of DKA requires first and foremost fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline, followed by replacement for 5%–10% dehydration, depending on severity, and maintenance with 0.45% saline, and early and adequate K replacement.
Insulin should not be given as a bolus, but infused after the initial fluid resuscitation in a dose of 0.1 U/kg of body weight/hour.
Bicarbonate infusion is contraindicated in pediatric DKA.
CE is the most common serious complication, requiring careful neurologic and vital sign monitoring and early intervention with mannitol or hypertonic saline infusion.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112rdtau]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

One possible reason for increased mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with diabetes is from the complication of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Objectives

To re-evaluate the association of SARS-CoV-2 and development of DKA and analyse the demographic and biochemical parameters and the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with DKA.

Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement was followed.

Methods

Electronic databases (Proquest, Medline, Embase, Pubmed, CINAHL, Wiley online library, Scopus and Nature) were searched from 1 December 2019 to 30 June 2021 in the English language using the following keywords alone or in combination: COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND diabetic ketoacidosis OR DKA OR ketosis OR ketonemia OR hyperglycaemic emergency OR hyperglycaemic crisis. We included studies in adults and children of all ages in all healthcare settings. Binary logistic regression model was used to explore the effect of various demographic and biochemical parameters variables on patient's final treatment outcome (survival or death).

Results

Of the 484 papers that were identified, 68 articles were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis (54 case report, 10 case series, and 4 cohort studies). Studies involving 639 DKA patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 [46 (7.2%) were children and 334 (52.3%) were adults] were analyzed. The median or mean patient age ranged from < 1 years to 66 years across studies. Most of the patients (n = 309, 48.3%) had pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus. The majority of the patients were male (n = 373, 58.4%) and belonged to Hispanic (n = 156, 24.4%) and black (n = 98, 15.3%) ethnicity. The median random blood glucose level, HbA1c, pH, bicarbonate, and anion gap in all included patients at presentation were 507 mg/dl [IQR 399–638 mg/dl], 11.4% [IQR 9.9–13.5%], 7.16 [IQR 7.00–7.22], 10 mmol/l [IQR 6.9–13 mmol/l], and 24.5 mEq/l [18–29.2 mEq/l]; respectively. Mortality rate was [63/243, 25.9%], with a majority of death in patients of Hispanic ethnicity (n = 17, 27%; p = 0.001). The odd ratios of death were significantly high in patients with pre-existing diabetes mellitus type 2 [OR 5.24, 95% CI 2.07–15.19; p = 0.001], old age (≥ 60 years) [OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.38–7.91; p = 0.007], and male gender [OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.37–5.17; p = 0.004] compared to those who survived.

Conclusion

DKA is not uncommon in SARS-CoV-2 patients with diabetes mellitus and results in a mortality rate of 25.9%. Mortality key determinants in DKA patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are individuals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus type 2, older age [≥ 60 years old], male gender, BMI ≥ 30, blood glucose level > 1000 mg/dl, and anion gap ≥ 30 mEq/l.

### Insulin resistance relates to DKA severity and affects insulin requirement in children with type 1 diabetes at onset [^115So8Av]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Fluid and insulin are the cornerstones of DKA management. The objectives of therapy are to restore circulating volume by correcting dehydration, acidosis, and reversing ketosis. If properly adopted, it may reduce the risk of related complications. After initial fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy is essential to normalize blood glucose concentration, to correct acidosis by suppression of the lipolysis and ketogenesis, to generate bicarbonate from ketoacid metabolism, and to restore the normal cellular metabolism. According to the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) guidelines the insulin infusion should be started at least 1 h after starting fluid replacement therapy at dosage ranging from 0.05 to 0.1 unit/kg/h; low dose intravenous insulin administration is safe and effective. Peculiar and relevant indications on different dosages are needed at diabetes onset. However, this information has not been completely investigated yet. Notably, distinct approaches related to different scenarios according to major confounding factors, such as insulin sensitivity states, should be evaluated. Therefore, in children with new onset type 1 diabetes, studies evaluating the effects of insulin sensitivity on insulin requirement are needed. These results might offer unique data for producing guidelines for different insulin dosages related to insulin sensitivity. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether different degrees of DKA are related to different insulin sensitivity thus requiring pH tailored insulin administration in children with new onset type 1 diabetes.

### Clinical features and outcomes of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients using SGLT2 inhibitors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114kc7Dv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Baseline characteristics of diabetic ketoacidosis patients in SGLT2 inhibitor users versus non‐users.

Clinical symptoms of DKA appear to be similar between SGLT2i users and non‐users, based on limited comparative data. Reported symptoms included nausea/vomiting (57.9%–76.5%), abdominal pain (42.1%–83.3%), fever (16.7%–50.0%), dyspnoea (16.7%–21.1%), and unconsciousness (12.5%–29.4%). The results of meta‐analysis comparing clinical features and outcomes of patients with DKA who were SGLT2i users and non‐users are summarised in Table 3, and their forest and funnel plots are displayed in Figures S4–S7. Among DKA cases, the decrease in pH was less pronounced in SGLT2i users than in non‐users, whereas bicarbonate levels and anion gaps were not significantly different between the two groups. Serum ketone levels in DKA cases among SGLT2i users were generally comparable to or slightly lower than those in non‐users. Two studies reported no significant differences between groups (p = 0.94 and p = 0.19, respectively), whereas Khan et al. demonstrated lower β‐hydroxybutyrate levels in SGLT2i users compared with non‐users (7.7 vs. 8.3 mmol/L). Especially, euglycemic DKA accounted for a 22.4‐fold (95% CI: 7.4–67.5) higher proportion of DKA cases in SGLT2i users than in non‐users. DKA cases in SGLT2i users had significantly lower blood glucose (MD = −218.4, 95% CI: −275.7 to −161.1, p < 0.0001, I² = 79.5%) and HbA1c levels (MD = −1.2, 95% CI: −2.1 to −0.4, p = 0.0027, I² = 73.6%) compared with DKA cases in non‐users. Regarding the electrolytes, DKA cases in SGLT2i users exhibited a less pronounced decrease in sodium levels (MD = 4.1, 95% CI: 2.3–6.0, p < 0.0001, I² = 0.0%) than DKA cases in non‐users, whereas no significant differences were observed in potassium level and chloride level. SGLT2i users had a small but less pronounced increase in creatinine levels (MD = −0.1, 95% CI: −0.2 to −0.1, p = 0.0007, I² = 0.0%) and lactate (MD = −0.3, 95% CI: −0.6 to −0.0, p = 0.0239, I² = 16.2%). No statistically significant differences were observed in the systolic blood pressure or heart rate between SGLT2i users and non‐users of DKA. With respect to DKA outcomes, no significant differences were observed in the length of hospitalisation (p = 0.211, I² = 70.1%), ICU admission (p = 0.697, I² = 68.7%), or in‐hospital mortality (p = 0.156, I² = 0.0%).

### Resuscitation with balanced electrolyte solution prevents hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^113xGcaY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine if balanced electrolyte solution (BES) prevents hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Methods

This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. A convenience sample of DKA patients aged 18 to 65 years with serum bicarbonate less than or equal to 15 and anion gap greater than or equal to 16 was enrolled at "Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-Shreveport" an capitalize Emergency Department over a 24-month period (2006–2008). Patients were randomized to standardized resuscitation with normal saline (NS) or BES (Plasma-Lyte A pH 7.4; Baxter International, Deerfield, IL). Every 2 hours, serum chloride and bicarbonate were measured until the patient's anion gap decreased to 12. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed on patients who met inclusion criteria and received at least 4 hours of study fluid. Chloride and bicarbonate measurements from the BES and NS groups were compared using unpaired and paired Student t tests.

Results

Of 52 patients enrolled, 45 (22 in BES group and 23 in NS group) met inclusion criteria and received 4 hours of fluid. The mean postresuscitation chloride was 111 mmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI] = 110–112) in the NS group and 105 mmol/L (95% CI = 103–108) in the BES group (P ≤ .001). The mean postresuscitation bicarbonate was 17 mmol/L (95% CI = 15–18) in the NS group and 20 mmol/L (95% CI = 18–21) in the BES group (P = 0.020).

Conclusions

Resuscitation of DKA patients with BES results in lower serum chloride and higher bicarbonate levels than patients receiving NS, consistent with prevention of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

### Excessive sodium bicarbonate infusion may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis: a case report [^114AwAT8]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We present a case wherein diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was treated with a large amount of sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride, resulting in the development of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS).

Case Presentation

Our patient was a 29-year-old male with a history of post-surgical repair for ventricular septal defect. Upon arrival, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was E2M4V3. Laboratory examinations revealed leukocytosis, severe metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. His consciousness status and hemodynamics improved after resuscitation (GCS: E3M6Ve). However, they declined at the 40th hour of admission and dropped to GCS E2M2Ve. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multifocal abnormal signal intensity changes in the whole brain stem. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus was made during the hospitalization period. The patient exhibited improved consciousness status after 17-day medical care at the ICU.

Conclusions

We recommend that in the case of DKA, the correction of hypokalemia should be prioritized during treatment. Sodium bicarbonate infusion should be reserved for pH < 6.9. In addition, close monitoring of the serum sodium level and prompt actions to lower it if it exceeds the threshold may be necessary.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in the era of SGLT-2 inhibitors [^1174mau4]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Definition of EDKA

DKA is a well-known and life-threatening complication for both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM. It is more common in patients with T1DM with a prevalence ranging from 4.6 to 8.0 per 1000 patient-yearswith a mortality rate of 0.65% to 3.3%. To make a diagnosis of DKA a triad of hyperglycemia above 250 mg/dL, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis with elevated anion gap is required. EDKA is like DKA but lacks the classic hyperglycemia component. In EDKA, blood glucose (BG) is generally < 200 mg/dL, although in some reports a cut-off of 300 mg/dL has been used to define EDKA. We prefer to use a BG threshold of < 200 mg/dL, ketonemia (serum β-hydroxybutyrate ≥ 3.0 mmol/L), and at least one of the following criteria to define EDKA:

Arterial pH ≤ 7.3
Serum bicarbonate ≤ 18 meq/L
Anion gap > 10.

EDKA can be further classified as mild with a pH range of 7.25–7.3 and/or serum bicarbonate 15–18 meq/L, moderate with a pH 7.00–7.24 and/or serum bicarbonate 10–15 meq/L, or severe with a pH < 7.0 and/or serum bicarbonate < 10 meq/L.

### Bicarbonate therapy and diabetic ketoacidosis… [^1176vWUb]. publications.aap.org (2000). Low credibility.

Source: Viallon A, Zeni F, Lafond P, et al. Does bicarbonate therapy improve the management of severe diabetic ketoacidosis. Crit Care Med. 1999; 27: 2690–2693. Thirty-nine patients with severe DKA were retrospectively identified at Hopital Bellevue, Saint-Etienne, France. Insulin therapy, hydration and hemodynamic monitoring for DKA were administered by protocol during the study period. Twenty-four patients received a 1. 4% solution of sodium bicarbonate over 1 hour, while 15 received no bicarbonate. The 2 groups did not differ by age, concurrent infection, Glasgow Coma Score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, hemodynamic characteristics, acidosis, hyperglycemia, electrolytes or renal function. During the first 24 hours of therapy, the 2 groups did not differ with regard to pH, HCO. 3, PaCO 2, anion gap, or blood glucose when measured at the time of bicarbonate administration, and at 4 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours.

In addition, the amount of hydration fluid and glucose administration did not differ between the two groups. The bicarbonate treated group did receive significantly more potassium supplementation to maintain levels between 3. 7 and
3. 9 mmole/L. The authors concluded that patients with severe DKA did not benefit from bicarbonate administration. Bicarbonate has been advocated in severe DKA to treat acidosis and to improve myocardial response to cate-cholamines. 1 Bicarbonate therapy has potential toxicity. Acidosis shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve so that hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily to the tissues, whereas administration of bicarbonate could increase the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Bicarbonate administration lowers the pH of cerebrospinal fluid 2–, 3 and intracellular pH of patients in DKA. Furthermore, bicarbonate administration can cause hypernatremia and hypokalemia. Although Viallon et al did not study many patients with pH < 6.

9, did not comment on the most severely acidotic patients and report a retrospective series, their results are similar to the randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study of bicarbonate administration in DKA reported by Gamba. 4 Like other reports, 5–, 6 Viallon et al demonstrated that bicarbonate therapy did not hasten the resolution of the ketoacidosis. Patients who received bicarbonate did require greater amounts of potassium supplementation compared to patients who did not receive bicarbonate. Bicarbonate therapy should be reserved for patients with shock unresponsive to adequate hydration or in patients with ventricular dysrhythmias. All these reports reach the same conclusion: bicarbonate is used too frequently in managing DKA. Comments.

### Utilizing serum bicarbonate instead of venous pH to transition from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin shortens the duration of insulin infusion in pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis [^115ivZKD]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Standard therapy of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in pediatrics involves intravenous (IV) infusion of regular insulin until correction of acidosis, followed by transition to subcutaneous (SC) insulin. It is unclear what laboratory marker best indicates correction of acidosis. We hypothesized that an institutional protocol change to determine correction of acidosis based on serum bicarbonate level instead of venous pH would shorten the duration of insulin infusion and decrease the number of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) therapies without an increase in adverse events. Methods We conducted a retrospective (pre/post) analysis of records for patients admitted with DKA to the PICU of a large tertiary care children's hospital before and after a transition-criteria protocol change. Outcomes were compared between patients in the pH transition group (transition when venous pH ≥ 7.3) and the bicarbonate transition group (transition when serum bicarbonate ≥ 15 mmol/L). Results We evaluated 274 patient records (n = 142 pH transition group, n = 132 bicarbonate transition group). Duration of insulin infusion was shorter in the bicarbonate transition group (18.5 vs. 15.4 h, p = 0.008). PICU length of stay was 3.2 h shorter in the bicarbonate transition group (26.0 vs. 22.8 h, p = 0.04). There was no difference in the number of adverse events between the groups. Conclusions Transitioning patients from IV to SC insulin based on serum bicarbonate instead of venous pH led to a shorter duration of insulin infusion with a reduction in the number of PICU therapies without an increase in the number of adverse events.

2.4 Data extraction

Two researchers (D. L. and G. S.) independently collected the data using a standardised data extraction spreadsheet, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The extracted data included the name of the first author, publication year, study period, nation, study setting, number of patients, type of SGLT2i used, and patient demographics. To examine the clinical features of DKA, clinical symptoms, vital signs, and laboratory parameters were collected, including blood pH, bicarbonate, anion gap, glucose, HbA1c, electrolytes (e.g. Na +, K +, and Cl −), creatinine, and lactate, along with the assessment of euglycemic DKA, defined as DKA with a blood glucose level < 250 mg/dL. Regarding the outcomes, the length of hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in‐hospital mortality were also collected.

2.5 Assessment of study quality

Two researchers (D. L. and G. S.) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale (NOS). The NOS evaluates studies across three domains: selection of study subjects (0–4 points), comparability between groups (0–2 points), and outcome or exposure assessment (0–3 points), with a total possible score of 9. Studies scoring ≥ 7 were classified as high quality, while those scoring < 7 were considered moderate to low quality.

Abstract

Aim

Sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) offer significant cardiorenal benefits for people with type 2 diabetes (PwT2D). However, concerns remain regarding their association with diabetes‐related ketoacidosis (DKA). (1) To compare demographics, precipitating factors, biochemical features, management, and outcomes of acute DKA admissions between SGLT2i users (n = 267) and non‐users (n = 793) with T2D. (2) To conduct a systematic review and meta‐summary of published studies describing SGLT2i‐associated DKA in T2D.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study analysed data from 18 UK hospitals (April 2018–March 2024), using standardised DKA protocols. Propensity score matching compared DKA episodes between SGLT2i users and non‐users. In addition, a systematic review and meta‐summary was performed including studies from PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science focusing on DKA in PwT2D treated with SGLT2i.

Results

Within the DEKODE cohort, 534 matched individuals were analysed. SGLT2i users had lower glucose, pH, and bicarbonate levels than non‐users. SGLT2i was identified as the sole precipitant in 30.3% of cases. Despite lower admission glucose and more profound acidosis, both SGLT2i users and non‐users had similar clinical outcomes including duration of DKA and length of hospital stay. In the meta‐summary of 1024 cases of SGLT2 inhibitor‐associated DKA from 247 studies, the median age was 54.6 years, with 49.7% male and a median diabetes duration of 10 years. Biochemical features included acidosis (median pH 7.1), elevated ketones (5.7 mmol/L), and modest hyperglycaemia (10.6 mmol/L). DKA typically developed after 2 months of SGLT2i use, with 21.1% requiring intensive care admission.

Conclusions

Despite lower admission glucose, more pronounced acidosis, and a higher incidence of hypokalaemia episodes, clinical outcomes were similar between the matched population of SGLT2i users and non‐users. This may be attributed to earlier identification of euglycaemic DKA, timely intervention, as well as the distinct pathophysiological profile of SGLT2i‐associated DKA. Improved education on risk factors and preventive strategies is warranted with SGLT2i therapy.

### Hyperglycemic crises in adult patients with diabetes: a consensus statement from the American diabetes association [^112UAbax]. Diabetes Care (2006). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ADA 2006 guidelines recommend to consider using the following diagnostic criteria and classification for DKA and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild DKA|- Plasma glucose > 250 mg/dL <br/> - Arterial pH 7.25–7.30 <br/> - Serum bicarbonate 15–18 mEq/L <br/> - Positive urine ketones using the nitroprusside reaction method <br/> - Positive serum ketones using the nitroprusside reaction method <br/> - Β-hydroxybutyrate (enzymatic assay) 3–6 mmol/L <br/> - Variable effective serum osmolality <br/> - Anion gap > 10 <br/> - Alert|
|Moderate DKA|- Plasma glucose > 250 mg/dL <br/> - Arterial pH 7.00–7.25 <br/> - Serum bicarbonate 10–15 mEq/L <br/> - Positive urine ketones using the nitroprusside reaction method <br/> - Positive serum ketones using the nitroprusside reaction method <br/> - Β-hydroxybutyrate (enzymatic assay) 3–6 mmol/L <br/> - Variable effective serum osmolality <br/> - Anion gap > 12 <br/> - Alert/drowsy|
|Severe DKA|- Plasma glucose > 250 mg/dL <br/> - Arterial pH < 7.00 <br/> - Serum bicarbonate < 10 mEq/L <br/> - Positive urine ketones using the nitroprusside reaction method <br/> - Positive serum ketones using the nitroprusside reaction method <br/> - Β-hydroxybutyrate (enzymatic assay) > 6 mmol/L <br/> - Variable effective serum osmolality <br/> - Anion gap > 12 <br/> - Stupor/coma|
|Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state|- Plasma glucose > 600 mg/dL <br/> - Arterial pH ≥ 7.30 <br/> - Serum bicarbonate ≥ 15 mEq/L <br/> - Small amount of urine ketones <br/> - Small amount of serum ketones <br/> - Β-hydroxybutyrate (enzymatic assay) < 3 mmol/L <br/> - Effective serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg <br/> - Anion gap < 12 <br/> - Stupor/coma.|

### Management of diabetic keto-acidosis in adult patients admitted to intensive care unit: an ESICM-endorsed international survey [^113yJojX]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic keto-acidosis (DKA) is the most common metabolic emergency in patients with diabetes, accounting for almost 10% of hospital admission in patients with diabetes. There is currently an increase in hospital admissions for DKA and although the mortality rate for DKA remains low, ranging from 0.20% in patients with type 1 diabetes to 1.04% in those with type 2 diabetes, it has stopped decreasing over the last decade.

DKA results from relative or absolute insulin deficiency and failure to regulate the effect of the hyperglycemic hormones glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone and catecholamines. The result is the hepatic metabolism of free fatty acids, which generates ketone bodies such as beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia leading to osmotic diuresis, which causes dehydration and water loss, and electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and pseudohyponatremia), and metabolic acidosis linked to the production of ketone bodies. The management of DKA requires fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and correction of metabolic disorders. The provision of continuous insulin therapy and the frequent monitoring and repletion of electrolytes requires critical care expertise and thus patients with DKA are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Guidelines for managing patients with DKA are limited. While the American and British guidelines provide recommendations on fluid resuscitation and suggest isotonic saline as the first option, the supporting evidence is limited, leading to ongoing debate regarding both fluid resuscitation, specifically regarding the use balanced solution to avoid the occurrence of hyperchloremic acidosis. Other heterogeneities in practice are related to insulin therapy, administration of sodium bicarbonate and the management of metabolic disorders.

This international survey aimed to assess current clinical management of adult patients with DKA, focusing on ICU admission criteria, fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and management of metabolic disorders.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^115xwCN4]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor

Sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have become increasingly popular glucose‐lowering agents, and interest in this class has broadened due to demonstration of cardioprotection in patients with established cardiovascular disease and slowing the progression of renal dysfunction. 1 There is also interest in extending this therapy to patients without diabetes, as it appears to lower the risk of heart failure or cardiovascular death, even in patients with heart failure in the absence of diabetes. 2 SGLT2i increase serum ketones, and a recognized adverse effect of SGLT2i therapy is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). While the incidence and risk factors for developing DKA on SGLT2i have been studied, 3 and recognition and prevention of DKA have become part of society and consensus guidelines, 4, 5 it has been assumed that DKA in this setting mimics classical DKA typically seen in type 1 diabetes. However, there are no detailed studies of the inpatient course of patients who develop this adverse medication effect. Therefore, we performed a systematic medical records search at a large academic medical centre in Boston, MA to identify common patterns and inpatient course for cases with DKA associated with SGLT2i.

The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) electronic medical record was systematically queried to identify cases of DKA in patients prescribed SGLT2i. The BIDMC Institutional Review Board exempted this protocol from review. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age 18 or older, admitted between 1 January 2013 and 16 May 2019, prescribed any SGLT2i at any point, and diagnosed with DKA, either by ICD codes or using serum bicarbonate under 20 mEq/L. The records were individually reviewed by a physician to confirm that use of a SGLT2i occurred prior to the admission for DKA. DKA was defined using the American Diabetes Association definition (pH ≤ 7.30, serum bicarbonate ≤ 18, and positive urine ketones). Venous pH is reported, as arterial pH is not routinely obtained at this institution to diagnose DKA. Serum ketones were not available for most cases. The duration of intravenous insulin infusion, persistence of glucosuria and time to close anion gap (5), defined as time elapsed from the first available serum chemistry to the chemistry measuring an AG ≤ 16, were extracted from medical records.

### Characterisation of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a regional hospital study [^113L2ipd]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Most of the patients were treated at our regional hospital, with only 6.7% (2 out of 30) requiring transfer to a referral centre. These data align with those of a Victorian ED-based study, which revealed that 10% of the patients were transferred out during 2017–2018. This highlights a crucial opportunity, as strengthening diabetes care in regional centres could lead to improved emergency management locally and better utilisation of the existing infrastructure in regional hospitals.

The subcutaneous insulin regimen can effectively manage paediatric DKA, particularly in regional hospitals. However, the medical team must make informed decisions regarding its applicability and patient selection. The new ISPAD guidelines, published in 2022, support the use of subcutaneous insulin for treating uncomplicated mild to moderate DKA. In our study, 20% of the patients were managed with subcutaneous insulin, including one patient with severe DKA, and favourable outcomes were achieved. This evidence may encourage regional hospitals to consider SC insulin therapy for DKA, potentially reducing complications and the overall burden of care. Further research is necessary to validate these findings and to shift the perspective of the health care professionals involved, ultimately influencing their practices and the local guidelines. Notably, bicarbonate recovery in this study occurred almost 4 h earlier than did pH recovery. While most local Australian protocols mention both criteria for transition to SC therapy, they lack clarity on whether it should be pH "or" bicarbonate or both pH "and" bicarbonate recovery. This ambiguity leaves the decision to transition to SC therapy dependent on the clinical judgement of the treating paediatrician. More clarity on the same would thus be beneficial.

In this study, the average length of ED stay was 7.93 h, and the average length of in-hospital stay was 2.18 days. Estimates from the United States of America indicate that the average cost of hospital admission for DKA is 27,000 USD, whereas equivalent data from Australia are lacking. Thus, ensuring that protocols prioritise patient safety while minimising hospital stays can help decrease the economic burden on the healthcare system.

In our study, 18 patients accounted for 30 episodes of DKA, with 5 of these patients experiencing recurrent presentations. The primary contributing factors identified from medical records include a lack of adherence to sick day management protocols, mental health concerns and various social factors. This underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary allied health team in regional centres providing care for T1D patients. However, a comprehensive, in-depth analysis of these factors was not feasible because of the observational nature of this study.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^117Vb2Nc]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

The collection of the 3 components required to meet a DKA diagnosis (namely, increased glucose, increased blood ketones and metabolic acidosis) is not consistently gathered which could potentially be detrimental if it means clinical staff do not see the need to assess the acid-base status of a patient because their blood glucose and/or ketones have not themselves reached their respective diagnostic thresholds. This could delay a diagnosis or mean the patient re-presents later with more severe illness. One approach to tackle this situation is the recommendation to reduce the threshold level for acting on blood ketones, for instance by having intermediate blood ketone concentrations such as 1.6–3mmol/L or even lower. From our data, including patients with BOHB values of 1.6 to < 3mmol/L would have improved sensitivity by identifying 11 of the 14 significantly acidotic (bicarbonate ≤ 18mmol/L) patients 'missed' because they had a BOHB ≤ 3mmol/L. However, it would also have reduced specificity by including 11 other episodes where BOHB was between 1.6 and < 3mmol/L while bicarbonate was > 18mmol/L.

Euglycemic DKA, which was thought to comprise up to 10% of DKA presentations even before the advent of SGLT2 inhibitors, limits lowering glucose cut-offs in a similar way to BOHB. Indeed, this is the reason given for one guideline removing blood glucose altogether as a diagnostic criterion. In addition, exogenous ketone bodies themselves are known to be associated with a hypoglyemic effect, so it is possible that this phenomenon could influence the association between endogenous BOHB and glucose.

Most patients presenting with DKA do so unequivocally, as was the case in our dataset. However, where the diagnosis is less obvious, the poor correlation between both blood glucose and blood ketones with acid-base status would suggest the only reliable means of ensuring all significantly acidotic patients are identified is by guaranteeing that pH and/or bicarbonate is measured in all patients where DKA is a possibility.

### Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy in severely acidotic diabetic ketoacidosis [^113pR2i8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The use of intravenous bicarbonate in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) may be considered for patients with a pH less than 6.9 according to the American Diabetes Association. The impact of this therapy on resolution of acidosis in patients with DKA is unclear.

Objective

To determine whether the use of intravenous bicarbonate therapy was associated with improved outcomes in patients with severe DKA who were seen in the emergency department.

Methods

This review was conducted from 2007 to 2011 in the emergency department of a tertiary teaching hospital. Adults diagnosed with DKA with an initial pH less than 7.0 were included. Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on receipt of intravenous bicarbonate. The primary study outcome was time to resolution of acidosis, defined as return to pH greater than 7.2. Secondary outcomes included length of stay; continuous infusion insulin use; and intravenous fluid, po tas si um, and insulin requirements within the first 24 hours of hospital admission, beginning upon admittance to the emergency department. We also conducted a subgroup analysis of patients with an initial pH less than 6.9.

Results

There was no significant difference in time to resolution of acidosis (8 hours vs 8 hours; p = 0.7) or time to hospital discharge (68 hours vs 61 hours; p = 0.3) between patients who received intravenous bicarbonate (n = 44) compared with those who did not (n = 42). The median dose of intravenous bicarbonate was 100 mEq (100–150) for patients who received intravenous bicarbonate. Insulin and fluid requirements in the first 24 hours were significantly higher in patients who received intravenous bicarbonate compared with those who did not (100 units vs 86 units; p = 0.04 and 7.6 L vs 7.2 L; p = 0.01, respectively). There was no significant difference in hours of continuous insulin infusion (27 hours vs 26 hours; p = 0.09) or potassium requirements in the first 24 hours of hospital stay (135 mEq vs 120 mEq; p = 0.84).

Conclusions

Intravenous bicarbonate therapy did not decrease time to resolution of acidosis or time to hospital discharge for patients with DKA with an initial pH less than 7.0.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^1138Kgtw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The authors conducted a narrative review of the available literature of bicarbonate therapy in selected topics. The literature search was completed using Google Scholar and PubMed databases for articles written in English published between November 1990 and November 2022. Search terms included: "bicarbonate", "cardiac arrest", "lactate", "lactic acidosis", "diabetic ketoacidosis", "rhabdomyolysis", "acidosis", and "acidemia". Abstracts were reviewed by two authors (S.H. G.W.) for appropriateness and discrepancies were adjudicated by a third author (C.T.). Preference was given to recent randomized trials and meta-analyses. Additional articles were identified if judged relevant in references of selected articles. We reviewed a total of 143 abstracts, of which 27 original research studies and 4 meta-analyses were included.

Levels of Evidence and Strength of Recommendations

The definitions used for grading the level of evidence and the strength of recommendations were adapted from the method used for the American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Policies and are summarized in Table 1.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^111BPJWb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis is intuitive, yet data suggest that not all patients benefit from this therapy.

Objective

In this narrative review, we describe the physiology behind commonly encountered nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis, highlight potential harm from the indiscriminate administration of sodium bicarbonate in certain scenarios, and provide evidence-based recommendations to assist emergency physicians in the rational use of sodium bicarbonate.

Discussion

Sodium bicarbonate can be administered as a hypertonic push, as a resuscitation fluid, or as an infusion. Lactic acidosis and cardiac arrest are two common scenarios where there is limited benefit to routine use of sodium bicarbonate, although certain circumstances, such as patients with concomitant acute kidney injury and lactic acidosis may benefit from sodium bicarbonate. Patients with cardiac arrest secondary to sodium channel blockade or hyperkalemia also benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy. Recent data suggest that the use of sodium bicarbonate in diabetic ketoacidosis does not confer improved patient outcomes and may cause harm in pediatric patients. Available evidence suggests that alkalinization of urine in rhabdomyolysis does not improve patient-centered outcomes. Finally, patients with a nongap acidosis benefit from sodium bicarbonate supplementation.

Conclusions

Empiric use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis is not warranted and likely does not improve patient-centered outcomes, except in select scenarios. Emergency physicians should reserve use of this medication to conditions with clear benefit to patients.

### 8.4% sodium bicarbonate [^111Dg1Lg]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Indications & Usage

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate is further indicated in the treatment of certain drug intoxications, including barbiturates (where dissociation of the barbiturate-protein complex is desired), in poisoning by salicylates or methyl alcohol and in hemolytic reactions requiring alkalinization of the urine to diminish nephrotoxicity of blood pigments. Sodium bicarbonate also is indicated in severe diarrhea which is often accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate.

Treatment of metabolic acidosis should, if possible, be superimposed on measures designed to control the basic cause of the acidosis ― e.g., insulin in uncomplicated diabetes, blood volume restoration in shock. But since an appreciable time interval may elapse before all of the ancillary effects are brought about, bicarbonate therapy is indicated to minimize risks inherent to the acidosis itself.

Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total CO2 content is crucial ― e.g., cardiac arrest, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, and in severe primary lactic acidosis or severe diabetic acidosis.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^112GAMQt]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This prospective, multiple-center study was conducted during a thirteen-month period in five ICUs. In accordance with French law, informed consent was not mandatory, given that this observational study did not modify diagnostic or therapeutic strategies. This study was approved by the Montpellier University Hospital Institutional Review Board and followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology recommendations for reporting observational studies.

Definitions

"Severe acidemia" was defined as a pH below 7.20. Respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis and other mixed disorders were categorized using the classical method (namely, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation) with base excess and corrected anion gap (AG) (corrected AG = (measured AG + (40 g/dl - (albuminemia ÷ 10 g/dl))).

Therefore, we defined the following specific acidemia as follows. (1) "Severe metabolic acidemia" comprised pH less than 7.20, bicarbonatemia less than 22 mmol/L, base excess less than or equal to 5 mmol/L and expected partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) = bicarbonatemia × 1.5 + 8 ± 2 mmHg. (2) "Severe respiratory acidemia" was defined as pH less than 7.20, PaCO 2 greater than 45 mmHg and expected bicarbonatemia = (PaCO 2–40) ÷ 10 + 24). (3) "Severe mixed acidemia" was the classification for secondary response to the primary process outside the expected range.

Patients

All consecutive patients who experienced severe acidemia within the first 24 hours of their ICU admission were screened, and those who presented with either single metabolic acidemia or mixed metabolic and respiratory acidemia were included. Patients admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis were excluded from the outcome analysis, as their mortality risk in the ICU is very low and may not represent the risk level among the whole population. Furthermore, because one of the aims of the present study was to describe the use of sodium bicarbonate to treat severe acidemia, patients admitted with a single severe respiratory acidemia were not analyzed in detail, because they were considered not to be candidates for that treatment. No guidelines, advice or documentation were given to the intensivists regarding acidemia, treatment or routine daily care.

### Use of base in the treatment of severe acidemic States [^111swA9K]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Severe acidemia (blood pH < 7.1 to 7.2) suppresses myocardial contractility, predisposes to cardiac arrhythmias, causes venoconstriction, and can decrease total peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure, reduce hepatic blood flow, and impair oxygen delivery. These alterations in organ function can contribute to increased morbidity and mortality. Although it seemed logical to administer sodium bicarbonate to attenuate acidemia and therefore lessen the impact on cardiac function, the routine use of bicarbonate in the treatment of the most common causes of severe acidemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, and cardiac arrest, has been an issue of great controversy. Studies of animals and patients with these disorders have reported conflicting data on the benefits of bicarbonate, showing both beneficial and detrimental effects. Alternative alkalinizing agents, tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane and Carbicarb, have shown some promise in studies of animals and humans, and reevaluation of these buffers in the treatment of severe acidemic states seems warranted. The potential value of base therapy in the treatment of severe acidemia remains an important issue, and further studies are required to determine which patients should be administered base therapy and what base should be used.

### Clinical effects of balanced crystalloids vs saline in adults with diabetic ketoacidosis: a subgroup analysis of cluster randomized clinical trials [^113UvF8F]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Current DKA clinical practice guidelines recommend saline as the fluid of choice for volume expansion, but they also acknowledge a paucity of evidence comparing saline with balanced crystalloids in this population. We believe that the results of this study add to the accumulating evidence suggesting balanced crystalloids are better resuscitation fluids than saline for many patients, and may have particular benefits for patients with DKA.

The median reduction in time to DKA resolution with balanced crystalloids in our study was small. However, DKA is common. Saline and balanced crystalloids are both widely available and similar in cost, and the safety of administering fluids with a tonicity lower than saline in DKA is established. Therefore, no particular barrier exists to optimizing clinical care for DKA patients by incorporating use of balanced crystalloids. Consistent implementation of interventions that deliver small improvements in outcomes for common conditions can translate into substantial improvements in population health and health system function.

Four recent small trials compared balanced crystalloids and saline in patients with DKA. Consistent with our results, each of these trials found point estimates favoring faster DKA resolution with balanced crystalloids, although small sample sizes led to low power. Mahler et alrandomized 45 adults with DKA and found Plasma-Lyte A led to higher plasma bicarbonate concentrations than saline after 24 hours (20 vs 17 mmol/L; p = 0.02). Van Zyl et al randomized 54 adults with DKA and found the median time to reach a pH greater than or equal to 7.32 was 540 minutes with lactated Ringer's and 683 minutes with saline (P = 0.25). Yung et alrandomized 77 children with DKA and found the geometric mean time to plasma bicarbonate concentration greater than or equal to 15 mmol/L was 6.2 hours with lactated Ringer and 8.6 hours with saline (P = 0.26). Williams et alrandomized 66 children with DKA and found median time to resolution of DKA (defined as pH > 7.3, bicarbonate > 15 mmol/L, and normal sensorium) was 14.5 hours with Plasma-Lyte A and 16.0 hours with saline (P = 0.47). To our knowledge, our study adds to this literature as the largest study in the field.

### Management of diabetic ketoacidosis… [^115PqRtU]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The measured serum sodium concentration can be corrected for the changes related to hyperglycemia by adding 1. 6 mEq per L to the measured sodium value for every 100 mg per dL of glucose over the normal baseline of 100 mg per dL. The initial priority in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis is the restoration of extra-cellular fluid volume through the intravenous administration of a normal saline solution. This step will restore intravascular volume, decrease counterregulatory hormones and lower the blood glucose level. 9 As a result, insulin sensitivity may be augmented. In patients with mild to moderate volume depletion, infusion rates of 7 mL per kg per hour have been as efficacious as infusion rates of 14 mL per kg per hour. 10 The subsequent administration of a hypotonic saline solution, which is similar in composition to the fluid lost during osmotic diuresis, leads to gradual replacement of deficits in both intracellular and extracellular compartments. When the blood glucose concentration is approximately 250 mg per dL, glucose should be added to the hydration fluid. This allows continued insulin administration until ketonemia is controlled and also helps to avoid iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Another important aspect of rehydration therapy in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis is the replacement of ongoing urinary losses. INSULIN THERAPY Modern management of diabetic ketoacidosis has emphasized the use of lower doses of insulin. This has been shown to be the most efficacious treatment in both children and adults with diabetic ketoacidosis.

11–14 The current recommendation is to give low-dose insulin after the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis has been confirmed by laboratory tests and fluid replacement has been initiated. When a blood glucose concentration of 250 mg per dL has been achieved, the continuous or hourly insulin dosage can be reduced to 0. 05 unit per kg per hour. The insulin and fluid regimens are continued until ketoacidosis is controlled. This requires the achievement of at least two of these acid-base parameters: a serum bicarbonate concentration of greater than 18 mEq per L, a venous pH of 7. 3 or greater and an anion gap of less than 14 mEq per L. POTASSIUM THERAPY Although the typical potassium deficit in diabetic ketoacidosis is 500 to 700 mEq, most patients are hyperkalemic at the time of diagnosis because of the effects of insulinopenia, hyperosmolality and acidemia.

4 During rehydration and insulin therapies for diabetic ketoacidosis, the serum potassium concentration typically declines rapidly as potassium reenters the intracellular compartment. One protocol entails using insulin and intravenous fluids until the serum potassium concentration is less than 5. 5 mEq per L. At this time, potassium chloride is added to intravenous fluids in the amount of 20 to 40 mEq per L. The exact amount of potassium that is administered depends on the serum potassium concentration. When the serum potassium level is less than 3. 3 mEq per L, the administration of 40 mEq per L of potassium is appropriate. If the serum potassium is greater than 3. 3 mEq per L but less than
5. 5 mEq per L, 20 to 30 mEq per L of potassium can be administered. The goal is to maintain the serum potassium concentration in the range of 4 to 5 mEq per L. 1, 2, 6.

Introduction

Definition of Diabetic Ketoacidosis

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is biochemically defined as a venous pH < 7.3 or serum bicarbonate concentration < 15 mmol/L, serum glucose concentration > 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) together with ketonemia, glucosuria, and ketonuria. Rarely, DKA may occur with normal circulating glucose concentrations if there has been partial treatment or with pregnancy. The severity of DKA is determined by the degree of acidosis:
Mild: venous pH > 7.2 and < 7.3, bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L
Moderate: venous pH > 7.1 and < 7.2, bicarbonate < 10 mmol/L
Severe: venous pH < 7.1, bicarbonate < 5 mmol/L.

Pathophysiology

DKA is the result of a critical relative or absolute deficit of insulin, resulting in intracellular starvation of insulin-dependent tissues (muscle, liver, adipose), stimulating the release of the counter-regulatory hormones glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, and growth hormone. The counter-regulatory hormonal responses may also be the result of stress-induced proinflammatory cytokines. They stimulate lipolysis and proteolysis, hepatic and renal glucose production, and hepatic oxidation of fatty acid to ketone bodies. Unlike during physiologic fasting, absence of citric acid cycle processing of glucose impedes the processing of these ketones for energy (Figure 1).

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1163TwTf]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

The regression model was statistically significant (R 2 = 0.68; F (3, 17) = 11.901; P < .001). Change in ketone concentration over the first 24 hours was significantly associated with baseline insulin therapy (β = 6.67; 95% CI, 2.71 to 10.63; p = 0.002), lower bicarbonate nadir (β = −0.56; 95% CI, −0.89 to −0.23; p = 0.02), and higher admission PG level (β = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.55; p = 0.24) in SGLT2i DKA.

### Excessive sodium bicarbonate infusion may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis: a case report [^112apFZT]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Several case reports have described the relationship between hyperglycemia and ODS. In one such case report, a type 2 diabetic and cirrhotic patient presented with several neurologic symptoms following ingestion of large amounts of sugar-containing foods and was diagnosed with ODS. During admission, the patient had serum sodium levels in the range of 133–144 mmol/l. The authors concluded that ODS resulted from sudden hyperglycemia. In another instance, a patient presented with a serum glucose level of 106 mmol/l (1908 mg/dl) that declined to 60 mmol/l (1080 mg/dl) in 6 h. The serum sodium level simultaneously elevated from 135 to 159 mmol/l. Both cases did not report hyponatremia but displayed abrupt serum osmolality changes.

Treatment of DKA involves the administration of intravenous fluids, potassium supplements, and insulin. A systematic review concluded that bicarbonate therapy provided no clinical advantages in the management of DKA. A report suggested that bicarbonate infusion can be administered if the serum pH is < 6.9 to justify the deleterious effect of acidemia. However, another review conducted in 2011 stated the absence of sufficient evidence to support the therapy. In addition, once administered, sodium bicarbonate infusion was initially recommended at the dose of 100 mmol and later at a dose of 20 mmol for every 2 h until the serum pH was > 7.0. Furthermore, some side effects of bicarbonate therapy have been reported, including cerebral edema, hypokalemia, and paradoxical central nervous system acidosis.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^112kJ47g]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Sodium bicarbonate for subtypes of metabolic acidosis

Administration of sodium bicarbonate has been considered for DKA not only because sodium bicarbonate reverses the acidotic status but because acidosis possibly contributes to insulin resistance. However, a retrospective single center study from the USA reported that sodium bicarbonate administration in the emergency department was not associated with time to resolution of acidosis in patients with DKA with a pH < 7.0. There was also no difference in hospital length of stay. A systematic review in 2011 found that sodium bicarbonate did not shorten the duration of acidosis, ketosis, or glycemic levels. Furthermore, there was a high incidence of hypokalemia that required correction in patients who received sodium bicarbonate. These findings imply that the beneficial effects of sodium bicarbonate administration for DKA might be limited. However, the systematic review by Chua et al. revealed a lack of rigorous randomized clinical trials that assessed patient-centered outcomes in these patients.

Sodium bicarbonate for lactic acidosis has been compared with saline in two small-scale randomized, crossover, single center trials. Cooper et al. reported that sodium bicarbonate administration increased pH and PCO2 with no change in blood pressure or cardiac output. Similarly, Mathieu et al. found an increase in pH but no change in hemodynamic parameters, including cardiac index.

For cardiac arrest, several observational studies have reported an increase in the rate of return of spontaneous circulation in patients receiving sodium bicarbonate. However, one study found that this treatment was associated with a worse survival rate and neurological outcomes to hospital discharge. A pilot RCT showed no improvement in patient mortality, return of spontaneous circulation rate, or neurologically favorable status in treated patients. At present, routine use of sodium bicarbonate is not recommended for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

### Management of diabetic keto-acidosis in adult patients admitted to intensive care unit: an ESICM-endorsed international survey [^113LTX7o]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current level of evidence on the management of adult patients with DKA is scarce. This survey highlights significant heterogeneity regarding the management of these patients, based on the experience of ICU and the income level of the countries according to the World Bank classification.

We found significant heterogeneity in fluids administered to patients with DKA. Although evidence does not support routine systemic alkalinization, one-third of respondents reported using sodium bicarbonate, typically for pH < 7.10. DKA-related acidosis does not impair cardiac contractility, and sodium bicarbonate may delay hyperglycemia and DKA recovery while increasing the risk of cerebral edema, especially in children. Guidelines limits its use in patients with pH < 7.0.

The choice between isotonic and balanced solutions remains debated in the critical care community, including in patients with DKA. Two small randomized controlled trials (< 60 patients, one of which was stopped prematurely) evaluating the use of balanced solutions in patients with DKA found contradictory results, both in terms of recovery speed of DKA and the incidence of fluid-related metabolic disorders. Secondary analyses of two pragmatic trials (SALT-ED and SMART trials) showed that balanced solutions (Plasma-Lyte-A or Ringer Lactate) were associated with faster DKA recovery and a shorter duration of intravenous insulin administration. The SCOPE-DKA trial, which compared a balanced solution (Plasmalyte-148) with isotonic saline in 93 patients admitted to ICU for DKA, found no difference in the primary outcome, which was the increase in base excess > -3 mEq/L at 48 h of management. Importantly, in these trials, crossover rates between randomization arms ranged from 30 to 50%, and none of these studies had a dedicated protocol for fluid administration. A recent meta-analysis encompassing these randomized trials found that balanced solutions compared to isotonic saline might accelerate DKA resolution and reduce the frequency of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Still, the amount of fluid administered, and the duration of intravenous insulin administration did not differ between groups. Recent consensus reports from American, British and European diabetes societies now suggests the use of either isotonic saline or balanced solutions, depending on local availability, cost and resources. Nonetheless, further randomized trials, like the ongoing DRINK trial (NCT 06541535), are needed to further clarify the optimal fluid choice.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome was incidence of new onset or progressive AKI defined as ONE of the following composite outcomes: change in serum creatinine or urine output as per KDIGO classification OR, change in GFR as calculated using Schwartz formula OR, and change in urinary NGAL. The individual outcomes were divided into quartiles, and the worst quartile was used to define AKI. The standard definitions of individual outcomes are provided in Additional file 1: Appendix. Analysis was done separately for absolute levels and their worst quartiles. The secondary outcomes were rate of resolution of AKI, time to resolution of DKA (pH > 7.3, bicarbonate > 15 mEq/L and normal sensorium), change in chloride, pH and bicarbonate levels (baseline, 24 h), proportion of in-hospital all-cause mortality, proportion of children requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), length of ICU and hospital stay.

Follow-up

Patients were followed up till discharge from PICU or ward or death, whichever was earlier. Post discharge, the children were assessed in the PICU and diabetic follow-up clinics. Patients failing to attend day 28 follow-up were contacted through telephone to ascertain the survival status. Renal function tests were carried out wherever needed. A data safety monitoring board supervised the conduct of the trial (Additional file 1: Appendix).

Methods

Study design, setting and population

The study was undertaken at a large tertiary care center in West Midlands, UK, which serves an ethnically diverse population of over one million people. All people admitted with DKA from April 2014 to September 2020 were included in the study. DKA was defined as blood glucose > 11 mmol/L, pH ≤ 7.3 or bicarbonate ≤ 15 mmol/L and ketonemia ≥ 3 mmol/L. The list of people admitted with DKA was initially screened based on those who meet one of the following criteria: electronic records with pH < 7.3 and blood glucose > 11 mmol/L or referral with DKA to the specialist team or discharged with a diagnosis of DKA. This list was further manually verified for confirmed diagnosis of DKA and only those who met the criteria as per national guidelines were included in the study. Classification (type 1/2) of diabetes was based on a clinical diagnosis as per National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, although may have been confirmed through islet autoantibody or C peptide testing. Patients who had DKA were identified using an automatic monitoring system, and data regarding various aspects of DKA were collected manually. We reviewed patients' health records to confirm the type of diabetes diagnosis. Patients were excluded from analysis if the diabetes classification was unclear or if this information was unavailable.

DKA management guidelines

The guidelines for management of DKA at our center are based on the Joint British Diabetes Societies guidelines and are the same for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Treatment of DKA includes administering fluids to correct the deficit and replacement glucose infusion when serum glucose drops less than 14 mmol/L but ketosis persists. A fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion was administered based on the patient's body weight at a rate of 0.1 unit/kg/hour to switch of lipolysis. Hourly glucose and ketone measurements are done to check treatment progress. Venous blood gases are done during infusion bag change to ensure the next bag of fluid has appropriate potassium replacement. While the guidelines for DKA management have evolved to ensure simplicity and end-user satisfaction over the last 7 years in our institute, the principles have not changed (figure 1).

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^11645sjW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of metabolic acidosis remains controversial in the medical community. Review of the literature overall does not support routine use of bicarbonate, particularly in anion gap metabolic acidosis. The processes underlying pH balance in human physiology are multifaceted, and an understanding of the mechanisms at play, as well as the methods of providing sodium bicarbonate supplementation, will serve an emergency physician well. There are few data demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with sodium bicarbonate use in patients with shock states, DKA, rhabdomyolysis, or cardiac arrest (except in the presence of sodium channel blockade toxicity or hyperkalemia), as shown in Table 2. However, it may benefit patients with NAGMA and, despite physiologic rationale, there are minimal data from RCTs to justify this.

### Alternative management of diabetic ketoacidosis in a Brazilian pediatric emergency department [^114K1pfj]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

DKA is a severe metabolic derangement characterized by dehydration, loss of electrolytes, hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, acidosis and progressive loss of consciousness that results from severe insulin deficiency combined with the effects of increased levels of counterregulatory hormones (catecholamines, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone). The biochemical criteria for diagnosis are: blood glucose > 200 mg/dl, venous pH < 7.3 or bicarbonate < 15 mEq/L, ketonemia > 3 mmol/L and presence of ketonuria. A patient with DKA must be managed in an emergency ward by an experienced staff or in an intensive care unit (ICU), in order to provide an intensive monitoring of the vital and neurological signs, and of the patient's clinical and biochemical response to treatment. DKA treatment guidelines include: restoration of circulating volume and electrolyte replacement; correction of insulin deficiency aiming at the resolution of metabolic acidosis and ketosis; reduction of risk of cerebral edema; avoidance of other complications of therapy (hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hyperchloremic acidosis); identification and treatment of precipitating events. In Brazil, there are few pediatric ICU beds in public hospitals, so an alternative protocol was designed to abbreviate the time on intravenous infusion lines in order to facilitate DKA management in general emergency wards. The main differences between this protocol and the international guidelines are: intravenous fluid will be stopped when oral fluids are well tolerated and total deficit will be replaced orally; if potassium analysis still indicate need for replacement, it will be given orally; subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analog is administered at 0.15 U/kg dose every 2–3 hours until resolution of metabolic acidosis; approximately 12 hours after treatment initiation, intermediate-acting (NPH) insulin is initiated at the dose of 0.6–1 U/kg/day, and it will be lowered to 0.4–0.7 U/kg/day at discharge from hospital.

### Sodium bicarbonate administration for metabolic acidosis in the intensive care unit: a target trial emulation [^112sFxKN]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

We performed a target trial emulation utilizing a multicenter, retrospective dataset obtained from 12 closed-model ICUs in Australia, accessed via the Queensland Critical Care Research Network. The participating sites include tertiary, metropolitan, and regional centers, and encompass the majority of intensive care to the state's population. Data sources included hospital electronic medical records supplemented by data from the Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database, Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection and linkage to the Queensland Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. The dataset was available for admissions from January 1st 2015 to December 31st 2021.

Eligible patients were adults (age ≥ 18yrs) admitted to ICU with metabolic acidosis defined as pH < 7.3 and PCO 2 ≤ 45 mmHg within the first three days of admission. Exclusion criteria were a history of dialysis-dependent renal failure, diabetic ketoacidosis, toxicology admissions, and repeat ICU admissions meeting inclusion criteria. We also excluded interhospital transfers and patients with transfer to an ICU as their discharge destination.

The study intervention was sodium-bicarbonate administration on days when the eligibility criteria were met. The primary outcome was 30-day ICU mortality with discharge from ICU as a competing event. As a secondary outcome, we evaluated time to renal replacement therapy (RRT) with death or ICU discharge as competing events. The frequency of bicarbonate use over time was evaluated as a potential confounder which was planned for inclusion in the multivariable model.

We performed the following subgroup analyses:
pH < 7.3 in conjunction with AKI, defined as stage ≥ 2 on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification
pH < 7.3 with requirement for vasoactive treatment, consisting of a mean daily vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) of ≥ 10, equivalent to 0.1mcg/kg/min noradrenaline
Severe acidosis with pH < 7.2
Admissions not meeting additional severity criteria (i.e. 7.2 ≤ pH < 7.3, KDIGO stage ≤ 1, and VIS < 10)

As RRT is a major potential confounder, we performed an additional sensitivity analysis stratifying patients by whether they received dialysis during the admission.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^115W2W1J]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

This study thus raises the question about what is hoped to be achieved when initially investigating possible DKA in an acute setting. Is it to establish if there is hyperglycemia present (or another cause) which is sufficient to lead to hyperketonemia and then to determine whether this has resulted in a significant metabolic acidosis (a 'D-K-A' strategy)? Or is it to establish the reverse, namely, if there is a metabolic acidosis present, whether ketonemia is its major (or only) source and then to determine if hyperglycemia also exists (an 'A-K-D' strategy)? It could be argued that any life-threatening situation is likely to be a consequence of acidosis rather than ketonemia, irrespective of whether hyperglycemia exists, although acid-base compensatory mechanisms mean pH or bicarbonate measurements alone are unlikely to be perfect triage tests either. Certainly, guidelines cannot cover every clinical presentation and, as previously pointed out, some, such as the ADA position statement, make clear that the criteria may be inaccurate in roughly 10% of cases. In our study, 22 of 133 episodes of potential DKA (~ 17%) with a bicarbonate concentration ≤ 18mmol/L were either not diagnostically hyperglycemic (> 13.9mmol/L, n = 8) or ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9) or both (n = 5).

Data collection

Patient demographics

The following variables were registered: age, sex and ethnicity. Data were based on self-identification or from medical records. Ethnicity was categorized as white, Asian, black, mixed and others.

Etiology of DKA

The precipitating cause was categorized as alcohol-related, intercurrent illness, new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, suboptimal compliance to diabetes treatment, cancer therapy-associated, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors-related or unknown.

DKA severity

The following data were collected as indicators of DKA severity: serum sodium, serum potassium, serum glucose, lactate, pH, bicarbonate, urea and serum osmolality. Serum ketone data were unavailable.

In addition, serum osmolality was calculated to explore whether there was an element of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in any of the episodes. HHS was defined as a calculated serum osmolality of greater than 320 mOsm/L.

Progression of treatment

Progression of DKA was measured in several ways: number of episodes of hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 4 mmol/L), hypokalemia (potassium < 3.5 mmol/L) and hyperkalemia (potassium > 5.5 mmol/L) during the DKA episode. Total insulin infused was calculated as the product of fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion rate and the total DKA duration. It does not include the dose of any subcutaneous basal insulin therapy that may have been initiated/maintained during the DKA episode. DKA duration (days) was calculated as the time difference between DKA diagnosis and DKA resolution (pH > 7.3 and bicarbonate > 15 mmol/L; ketones < 0.6 mmol/L). Length of stay (days) was calculated as the difference between admission and discharge.

Changes in physiological parameters over time

There was a clear annual trend towards improved acid–base status and glucose control over the study period. The mean worst pH in the first 24 hours progressively increased from 7.20 ± 0.02 (IQR 7.09–7.3) in 2000 to 7.24 ± 0.01 (IQR 7.15–7.34) in 2013 (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3), the mean lowest plasma bicarbonate increased from 12.1 ± 6.6 to 13.8 ± 6.6 mmol/L (P < 0.0001), and the mean SBE increased from –16 ± 8 to –13 ± 8 mmol/L (P < 0.0001). The mean highest plasma glucose in the first 24 hours decreased over the study period from 26.3 ± 14.8 to 23.2 ± 13.1 mmol/L (P < 0.0001).

Outcomes

Median ICU length of stay increased progressively over the study period from 32.7 (IQR 19.8–56.4) to 41.7 (IQR 24.8–67.3) hours (P = 0.0004), whereas median hospital length of stay declined from 109 (IQR 72.8–212) to 87 (IQR 50.3–166) hours (P < 0.0001). The unadjusted ICU and hospital mortality rates for the entire study period were 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively. The increase in mortality between ICU and hospital discharge was confined almost exclusively to the NI group of patients. Although we observed a reduction in raw mortality (Fig. 4), there was no change in risk-adjusted mortality during the 14-year study period after accounting for declining severity of illness. Analysis of survival trends over three different epochs (2000–2004, 2005–2009, 2010–2013) did not identify any differences in mortality. About 98% of the I cohort and patients and 96% of the NI cohort were discharged home, the remainder to a rehabilitation or chronic care facility.

### Update and harmonisation of guidance for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and young people in the UK [^111PysW8]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Specifically, the NICE 2015 guidelines were more conservative with fluid administration, in order to avoid rapid changes in osmolality. The BSPED guidelines permitted a more generous fluid allowance, and this raised concerns about precipitating CO. The conflicting advice generated challenges in the emergency setting, with arbitrary site-specific preference rather than evidence-based medicine taking precedence. In addition to generating uncertainty of treatment pathways increasing the risk of clinical error, the regional variability hampered service evaluation and audit of clinical practice.

Unfortunately, there is little data to establish differences in their efficacy, especially surrounding the risk of CO in the paediatric population. However, inadequate resuscitation is likely to increase the risk of brain injury and thus must be avoided. Further research on a national scale is required to assess this.

This article aims to highlight the considerable alterations made to the two main UK guidelines. Alongside these updates, this article will provide clinical context to paediatricians and junior doctors who are likely to treat these vulnerable groups.

### Excessive sodium bicarbonate infusion may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis: a case report [^116nJoXv]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We present a case wherein diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was treated with a large amount of sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride, resulting in the development of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS).

Case presentation

Our patient was a 29-year-old male with a history of post-surgical repair for ventricular septal defect. Upon arrival, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was E2M4V3. Laboratory examinations revealed leukocytosis, severe metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. His consciousness status and hemodynamics improved after resuscitation (GCS: E3M6Ve). However, they declined at the 40th hour of admission and dropped to GCS E2M2Ve. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multifocal abnormal signal intensity changes in the whole brain stem. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus was made during the hospitalization period. The patient exhibited improved consciousness status after 17-day medical care at the ICU.

Conclusions

We recommend that in the case of DKA, the correction of hypokalemia should be prioritized during treatment. Sodium bicarbonate infusion should be reserved for pH < 6.9. In addition, close monitoring of the serum sodium level and prompt actions to lower it if it exceeds the threshold may be necessary.

### Relationship between bedside ketone levels and time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis: a retrospective cohort study [^1152Lq1r]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions

The diagnosis of DKA was based on the presence of all of the following criteria: (1) blood glucose level (BG) of greater than 300 mg/dL [16.7 mmol/L]; (2) either venous blood pH value of less than 7.30 or serum bicarbonate level of less than 15 mEq/L; (3) bedside 3HB greater than 1.0 mmol/L; and (4) urine ketone positive. DKA severity was classified by venous blood pH level on admission: (1) mild for pH between 7.25 and 7.30; (2) moderate for pH between 7.00 and 7.24; and (3) severe for pH below 7.00. The anion gap was calculated as serum bicarbonate level (mmol/L) minus serum sodium level (mEq/L) minus serum chloride level (mEq/L). Recovery from DKA (DKA resolution) was defined as 3HB below 1.0 mmol/L for the first time since the commencement of DKA therapy. Consciousness was assessed by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and exacerbation of impaired consciousness was considered as GCS score of discretion more than twice that recorded on admission. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as a decrease in BG level below 70 mg/dL that required urgent medical treatment, such as glucose infusion and glucagon use. Mild hypoglycemia was defined as a decrease in BG level below 70 mg/dL associated with recovery following management by the patients themselves. All complications were recorded as necessary. Data of all clinical outcomes were obtained from the clinical records during admission for DKA treatment. The time to DKA resolution was defined as the time period from the start of insulin infusion until the fall of 3HB level to less than 1.0 mmol/L. The total insulin dose was calculated from clinical chart data and represented the sum of all insulin infusion doses administered until DKA resolution.

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: a consensus report [^112YtsdG]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solutions at an initial rate of 500–1,000 mL/h during the first 2–4 hours in adult patients with DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state without renal or cardiac compromise. Decide on the subsequent choice for fluid replacement after restoration of intravascular volume based on the state of hydration assessed by BP, HR, fluid input-output balance, and sodium concentration, correcting estimated fluid deficits within the first 24–48 hours. Use caution when rapidly replacing fluids in patients at high risk of fluid overload, including older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with heart or kidney disease or other serious comorbidities.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^112MEhEp]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.

### Incidence and determinants of hypophosphatemia in diabetic ketoacidosis: an observational study [^113BtJP7]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Research design and methods

Design

This is a cohort study among individuals with T1DM admitted because of DKA. This study was executed at two hospitals in the Netherlands: Isala (Zwolle, the Netherlands, a secondary care and teaching hospital) and the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG, located in Groningen, the Netherlands, an academic hospital).

Outcomes

Primary outcome was the prevalence of hypophosphatemia in DKA (defined as concentrations < 0.80 mmol/L) during the treatment phase of DKA. As secondary outcomes, we investigated the determinants of hypophosphatemia on clinical outcomes, such as length of hospital stay. Furthermore, we investigated the compliance with current guidelines (stating phosphate measurement in the first 24 hours of DKA and phosphate therapy should be given at levels < 0.32 mmol/L).

Patients

Patients were included in the present analysis if they were aged between 18 and 70 years and diagnosed with T1DM (defined as presence of autoantibodies and/or c-peptide concentrations).

Both patients with known T1DM as well as patients with new-onset T1DM presenting with a DKA were included. DKA was defined according to current guidelines, that is, blood glucose levels > 15 mmol/L, presence of urine ketones (> 2+ on urine dipsticks), pH levels < 7.30 kPa, serum bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L and an anion gap > 10 mmol/L.

Patients with a known pre-existing condition that could have led to the presence of low phosphate concentrations, including hyperparathyroidism, Fanconi syndrome and chronic diarrhoea were per protocol excluded from the present analysis, but no patients fulfilling this were identified. Patients who were transferred from another hospital were excluded from this study. In addition, patients who left the hospital within 24 hours while the DKA had not yet been controlled were excluded from analyses.

Treatment of DKA is based on Dutch guidelines. In brief, this guideline states fluid therapy (0.9% NaCl) and insulin therapy via a continuous infusion of 0.04–0.07 IU/kg/hour, without a prior bolus. Bicarbonate therapy is to be considered when pH levels dropped below 6.9 kPa.

Intravenous therapy of potassium is considered if plasma potassium is < 5.5 mmol/L.

Phosphate therapy should be considered in severe hypophosphatemia (< 0.32 mmol/L).

### Excessive sodium bicarbonate infusion may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis: a case report [^1148ncfN]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

We often encounter severe metabolic acidosis status in the emergency room setting or ICU, and sodium bicarbonate infusion is considered an important initial treatment to correct the acid-base status. In our case, a total of 30 ampules of sodium bicarbonate was administered over a 16-h period. The sodium content of these fluids was 510 meq, which was equal to that of 1 l of 3% sodium chloride. Frequent VPCs and hypotension also interfered with the clinician's decision. First-line clinicians may attribute this status to severe hypokalemia and acidosis and liberally prescribe sodium bicarbonate and potassium supplements, with the expectation of correcting the electrolyte disturbance as early as possible. However, osmotic changes caused by sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride remain unaddressed.

It is widely known that ODS is often linked to the rapid correction of hyponatremia, and intensive monitoring of the serum sodium level has been suggested for ODS. Nevertheless, in the clinical setting of DKA, only potassium monitoring has been highlighted. Our case implies that not only potassium but also sodium levels must be monitored carefully in the first few hours of resuscitation and that clinicians should be aware of the possibility of a rapid increase in the serum sodium level. In life-threatening conditions, potassium supplements should primarily be administered as indicated by a previous report. The use of sodium bicarbonate should be refrained until the serum pH decreases to < 6.9.

DKA with concurrent hypokalemia, arrhythmia, and unstable hemodynamics could be quite challenging for clinicians. The correction of hypokalemia should receive priority during treatments. Sodium bicarbonate infusion should be reserved for pH < 6.9. Close monitoring of the serum sodium level and prompt actions to lower it if it exceeds the threshold may be necessary.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116vxCdp]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to determine hydration status and administer IV fluids according to the severity of hypovolemia:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid at a clinically appropriate rate aiming to replace 50% of the estimated fluid deficit in the first 8–12 hours <br/> - Add 5% or 10% dextrose to the 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid when glucose reaches < 250 mg/dL <br/> - Start 5% or 10% dextrose alongside 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid at the start of the insulin treatment in euglycemic DKA (glucose < 200 mg/dL and positive β-hydroxybutyrate)|
|Severe hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid (1.0 L/hr)|
|Cardiac compromise|- Hemodynamic monitoring/pressors.|

### Sodium bicarbonate administration for metabolic acidosis in the intensive care unit: a target trial emulation [^113QQGcm]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Sodium bicarbonate is commonly administered to treat metabolic acidosis in intensive care units (ICUs). There is limited evidence from randomized trials to support this practice, and observational studies show conflicting results. Our aim was to perform a target trial emulation evaluating the effect of bicarbonate therapy on mortality.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study using data from 12 Australian ICUs. Inclusion criteria were adults with pH < 7.3 and PCO 2 ≤ 45 mmHg within the first three days. We excluded repeat admissions, toxicology, diabetic ketoacidosis, and pre-existing end-stage renal failure. The treatment intervention was sodium-bicarbonate administration, and the primary outcome was 30-day ICU mortality with ICU discharge as a competing event. We evaluated multiple subgroups, including patients with acute kidney injury, requirement for vasoactive therapy, and pH < 7.2. The primary model utilized a parametric g-computation and rolling entry matching was performed as a sensitivity analysis.

Results

We identified 6157 eligible admissions, of which 1764 (29%) received sodium bicarbonate. Bicarbonate therapy was associated with a 1.9% absolute mortality reduction for the primary analysis [risk ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 0.91], and significant benefits were seen across all subgroups evaluated. A similar point estimate of 2.1% was observed in the sensitivity analysis, with a sustained mortality reduction seen at 30 days.

Conclusion

In this target trial emulation, bicarbonate administration was associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in mortality for patients with metabolic acidosis. Large sample sizes would be required to demonstrate this effect in a randomized trial.

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: a consensus report [^113aX4rv]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to modify replacement fluids once the plasma glucose concentration is < 250 mg/dL (< 13.9 mmol/L) to contain 5–10% dextrose in addition to the 0.9% sodium chloride to prevent hypoglycemia and allow continued insulin administration until the ketonemia is corrected, as plasma glucose concentrations usually decrease before the resolution of ketoacidosis (usually within 4–8 hours).

### Sodium bicarbonate injection, (Sodium bicarbonate) [^115Tcgqg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate is further indicated in the treatment of certain drug intoxications, including barbiturates (where dissociation of the barbiturate-protein complex is desired), in poisoning by salicylates or methyl alcohol and in hemolytic reactions requiring alkalinization of the urine to diminish nephrotoxicity of hemoglobin and its breakdown products. Sodium bicarbonate also is indicated in severe diarrhea which is often accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate. Treatment of metabolic acidosis should, if possible, be superimposed on measures designed to control the basic cause of the acidosis - e.g., insulin in uncomplicated diabetes, blood volume restoration in shock. But since an appreciable time interval may elapse before all of the ancillary effects are brought about, bicarbonate therapy is indicated to minimize risks inherent to the acidosis itself.

Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total C02 content is crucial - e.g., cardiac arrest, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, and in severe primary lactic acidosis or severe diabetic acidosis.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^111itEwi]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the three criteria are present - 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### Severe euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis of multifactorial etiology in a type 2 diabetic patient treated with empagliflozin: case report and literature review [^117CsEBT]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of euDKA are not available. Relevant recommendations for the treatment of DKA suggest volume restoration with isotonic fluid of NaCl 0,9%, ensuring that serum K is > 3.3 mmol/l before initiation of insulin therapy, while bicarbonate infusion should only be considered in cases of life-threatening acidosis (PH < 6.9). However, recognition of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved, enables successful treatment with simple measures. In our case in particular, infusion of a minimum amount of bicarbonate, along with proper insulin administration was sufficient to restore the HCO 3 − deficit and to raise the pH into safe levels. Resolution of vomiting and proper feeding along with insulin administration and SGLT-2 inhibitor withdrawal completely reversed the abnormal metabolic process. In less than 24 h the patient had restored normal blood pH and was switched to subcutaneous insulin regiment.

Overall, euDKA associated with SGLT-2 inhibitor use in T2DM is a serious side-effect, often with a multifactorial etiology. Increased awareness and recognition of involved factors can safely restore normal acid-base balance with simple measures. Given the undisputed cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors and their awaited increased use, physicians need to familiarize themselves with euDKA and its treatment in order to readily manage this complication for the benefit of our patients.

### Euglycaemic ketoacidosis in pregnant women with COVID-19: two case reports [^112NcJZy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Resolution of ketoacidosis is considered when pH levels are > 7.3 and ketones below 0.3 mmol/L; insulin therapy and fluid resuscitation can be discontinued once the patient is eating and drinking and ketones are less than 0.6 mmol with normal bicarbonate.

Fetal wellbeing with continuous CTG monitoring is advocated as ketones readily cross the placenta and can severely compromise the fetus. The fetal mortality in diabetic and severe non-diabetic ketoacidosis is estimated at 9–35% with recent data suggesting 15.6% with advancements in diabetes care. CTG abnormalities are often corrected once maternal biochemical parameters normalise, therefore delivery is not always indicated. Emergency operative delivery should be used with caution, as maternal condition can worsen if not adequately resuscitated and can result in an iatrogenic preterm birth. However, persistent maternal and fetal concerns require a multidisciplinary approach with escalation to critical care (Fig. 2) and consideration of early delivery, as delivery can lead to symptom resolution due to the removal of the fetus and placenta with a reduction in pregnancy-related hormones which oppose endogenous insulin.

Most pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have mild COVID-19. COVID-19 with concomitant euglycaemic ketoacidosis is rare, but should be considered in those who are unwell, have loss of appetite, and/or have gestational or Type 1/ Type 2 diabetes. Patient education about maintaining oral intake and glycaemic control during illnesses is paramount. Prompt recognition and timely management with multidisciplinary input are key to reducing the risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

### The influence of chloride for the interpretation of plasma bicarbonate during the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^115reQbf]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis can occur in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and may affect the acid-base interpretation during treatment.

Objectives

This study aims to describe the prevalence of hyperchloremia during the treatment of DKA and its effect on the interpretation of bicarbonate value.

Methods

A cross-sectional study, including all cases of DKA in patients aged 1 to 18 years old admitted from 2010 to 2015, was performed. Laboratory tests were performed on admission (baseline), 2 and 6 hours after admission, and when resolution of DKA was achieved. Adjusted bicarbonate value was calculated using regression equations.

Results

Seventy-nine DKA episodes were included. The average age was 13.3 ± 3.8 years. Baseline levels were as follows: plasma glucose, 479 ± 133 mg/dL; pH 7.1 ± 0.083; bicarbonate, 9.65 ± 2.9; and anion gap, 23.9 ± 7.5. The time to achieve resolution of DKA was 12.2 ± 4.4 hours, and the decrease in capillary glucose was 25.5 (19.7–38.2) mg/dL per hour. After 6 hours of treatment, the proportion of patients presenting hyperchloremia increased from 23% to 77%. By using adjusted bicarbonate, the percentage of patients achieving resolution of DKA after 6 hours of treatment would have been 35.4% (confidence interval 95%, 28–49), in comparison with 24.1% (confidence interval 95%, 18–37) using observed bicarbonate (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

The hyperchloremia developed during the treatment of DKA could modify the value of measured plasma bicarbonate concentration and unnecessarily prolong the initial phase of treatment.
