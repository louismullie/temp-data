## Question

Can proton therapy be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether proton therapy (proton‑beam radiation) can be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and what evidence and guidelines say about this. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what proton therapy is and its typical oncologic indications. Then, I should scan the provided corpus for any mention of proton therapy in rheumatology. Next, I should review data on radiotherapy toxicity in patients with RA, because that is often conflated with using radiation to treat RA itself. After that, I will verify what authoritative RA guidelines recommend. Finally, I will reconcile RA pathophysiology with the mechanism of proton therapy to synthesize a clinical conclusion [^115qta6d] [^116FUD6g] [^1136BFKv].

> Let me first confirm the modality in question: proton therapy is a form of external‑beam radiation that leverages the Bragg peak to deliver high dose to tumors while sparing adjacent normal tissue, used in cancer care rather than autoimmune disease management, and nothing in its mechanism suggests an immunomodulatory indication for RA per se [^115qta6d].

> Wait, let me verify the occurrences of "proton" across the documents, because I might be mixing up proton therapy with proton pump inhibitors; I see "Protonix I.V". and general PPI content that relate to drug–drug interactions with methotrexate in RA, which is entirely unrelated to radiation therapy, and separately I see a proton therapy discussion confined to gastrointestinal malignancies, with no linkage to RA as a therapeutic target, so I should not jump to conclusions that "proton" here implies a rheumatologic therapy [^111Npu6q] [^115zDnt4] [^115qta6d].

> I need to check whether radiotherapy has been studied in RA patients and in what context, and the systematic reviews found focus on toxicity among RA patients who receive radiotherapy for cancer rather than using radiation to treat RA; they suggest possible higher toxicity rates in RA but emphasize low-quality, heterogeneous evidence and explicitly do not recommend dose reduction or altered oncologic practice on the basis of RA status alone, which again signals radiotherapy as a cancer treatment issue, not an RA treatment option [^112aQwex] [^112yAjmu] [^113jKnqR].

> Next, I should review guideline standards of care for RA to ensure I am not overlooking any radiation‑based recommendation; both EULAR 2022/2023 and ACR 2021 emphasize a treat‑to‑target strategy anchored by conventional synthetic DMARDs (methotrexate preferred), escalation to biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs as needed, with short‑term glucocorticoids and NSAIDs for symptom control, and there is no mention of external‑beam radiotherapy or proton therapy as part of RA management [^116FUD6g] [^113V5qrF] [^116oPTSo] [^115Y4mhL].

> Hold on, I should verify the biological plausibility: RA pathogenesis is driven by dysregulated adaptive immunity and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF‑α and IL‑6, whereas proton therapy exerts cytotoxic effects via DNA damage in malignant tissues rather than targeted immunomodulation of synovitis, making a mechanistic rationale for using proton therapy in RA implausible in this context [^112LPQuu] [^111nybsF] [^115qta6d].

> Let me synthesize: the corpus contains no evidence that proton therapy is used, studied, or recommended for the treatment of RA, guidelines uniformly omit radiation modalities from RA treatment algorithms, and the radiotherapy literature in RA pertains to toxicity during cancer treatment rather than therapeutic benefit for RA, so proton therapy is not indicated for RA [^116FUD6g] [^1136BFKv] [^112aQwex].

> But wait, what if an RA patient requires proton or photon radiotherapy for a malignancy; I should double‑check the practical implications, and the best available reviews indicate potential for increased toxicity but insufficient evidence to mandate dose reductions or systematic modifications, so coordination between oncology and rheumatology is prudent while proceeding with standard oncologic care rather than altering RA therapy goals based on radiation alone [^112yAjmu] [^113ygWhJ].

---

Proton therapy is **not used** for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There is **no clinical evidence** or guideline support for its use in RA, and it is **not recommended by ACR or EULAR** [^1136BFKv] [^116FUD6g]. As a cancer treatment [^115qta6d], it is not an RA intervention; RA care should follow established **DMARD-based, treat-to-target strategies** [^113MWpKS].

---

## Mechanism of action of proton therapy

Proton therapy uses high-energy protons to deliver radiation with a Bragg peak, enabling **precise dose delivery** to tumors while sparing surrounding tissues [^115qta6d]. This precision is valuable in oncology but has no established role in RA, where the therapeutic goal is immune modulation [^111nybsF], not tumor ablation.

---

## Current clinical evidence for proton therapy in RA

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting proton therapy for RA. No randomized trials, cohort studies, or case series have evaluated its efficacy or safety, and it is not included in any rheumatology guideline [^116FUD6g].

---

## Comparison with established RA treatments

Established RA treatments include:

- **Conventional synthetic DMARDs**: Methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide [^116oPTSo].
- **Biologic DMARDs**: TNF inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, B-cell depleting agents [^113zZ8PG].
- **Targeted synthetic DMARDs**: JAK inhibitors [^1139G89r].
- **Glucocorticoids and NSAIDs**: For symptom control [^1149snBs].

These therapies are **supported by robust evidence** [^114j4coo] and are recommended by ACR and EULAR [^1136BFKv] [^116FUD6g]. In contrast, proton therapy **lacks evidence** or endorsement.

---

## Safety profile and potential risks

Proton therapy can cause **radiation-related adverse effects** (e.g. fatigue, skin reactions, secondary malignancies). In RA, there are concerns about increased radiosensitivity and toxicity, although evidence is limited and inconsistent [^112aQwex] [^113ygWhJ]. Given the absence of benefit and potential harm, proton therapy is **not appropriate** for RA.

---

## Cost-effectiveness and accessibility

Proton therapy is **expensive and limited** to specialized centers, making it impractical for a chronic disease such as RA [^115qta6d]. In contrast, DMARDs are widely available, cost-effective, and supported by strong evidence [^114j4coo].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

ACR [^1136BFKv] and EULAR [^116FUD6g] recommend a **treat-to-target approach** with DMARDs, aiming for remission or low disease activity. Proton therapy is not mentioned or recommended in any guideline.

---

## Ongoing research and clinical trials

There are **no ongoing trials** or research initiatives investigating proton therapy for RA. Current research in RA focuses on pharmacologic and biologic therapies.

---

## Patient selection criteria and contraindications

There are **no defined criteria** or contraindications for proton therapy in RA because it is not an accepted or studied intervention.

---

## Long-term outcomes and quality of life

There is **no evidence** on long-term outcomes or quality of life with proton therapy in RA. In contrast, established therapies have demonstrated sustained benefits in disease control, function, and quality of life [^112Ukb4T].

---

Proton therapy is not used for RA due to **lack of evidence**, safety concerns [^113ygWhJ], high cost, and limited access [^115qta6d]. RA management should follow guideline-supported DMARD strategies [^1136BFKv] [^116FUD6g]; proton therapy should **not be considered**.

### Association between rheumatoid arthritis and risk of radiotherapy toxicity: A systematic review [^112aQwex]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

There are plausible mechanisms by which patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) would be more sensitive to radiotherapy; however, there is currently a lack of high-quality research on this topic. A literature search identified 12 studies that overall suggest patients with RA do develop higher rates of radiotherapy toxicity; however, most studies lacked statistical significance, had varied methodology, low generalizability, and risk of numerous biases. Given the lack of strong and high-quality evidence identified in this review, dose reduction of radiotherapy in patients with RA lacks sufficient evidence to be recommended.

There is a need for further research that would provide a step towards addressing the lack of guidance for patients with RA. The field requires prospective studies using up-to-date radiotherapy techniques, larger cohorts of patients with RA, appropriate matching of risk factors, sufficient follow-up, and incorporation of confounding factors in the analysis of RA disease activity. The use of real-world data (RWD) that exploits electronic health records (EHRs) could also address the limitations identified in our review.

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study [^1114KFnN]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease affecting 0.5–2% of the population. Although modern treatments for rheumatoid arthritis can induce remission in many patients, diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis in early disease stages is important for preventing irreversible damage to the synovial lining and cartilage of diseased joints and for preventing progression into later disease stages. At present, there is no good clinically available indicator for the long-term development of rheumatoid arthritis.

Rheumatoid factor is an autoantibody targeting the Fc region of IgG antibodies. Testing for rheumatoid factor is the most widely used blood test in the classification of rheumatoid arthritis. In the classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis, "definite rheumatoid arthritis" is based on the confirmed presence of synovitis in at least one joint, the absence of an alternate diagnosis better explaining the synovitis, and achievement of a total score of ≥ 6 (out of a possible 10) on a scoring system.

- **Scoring criteria**:
	- The score is derived from four criteria: the number and site of affected joints (range 0–5), serological abnormality (elevated levels of rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated protein antibody; range 0–3), elevated acute phase response (range 0–1), and symptom duration (< 6 vs. ≥ 6 weeks; range 0–1).
	- It is often stated that levels of rheumatoid factor increase with age, but convincing data for this statement is difficult to find. About 80% of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis will eventually be seropositive for rheumatoid factor, while only 40% are positive at clinical onset.

### Interpreting radiographic data in rheumatoid arthritis [^114RQv92]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Plain film radiography is the preferred method for evaluating disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis and for establishing the efficacy of new disease-modifying antirheumatic agents. However, the relative efficacy of these agents cannot be determined by comparing radiographic data from different studies, and a standardized system is needed.

### Is there still a role for traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis [^116bS6kv]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic and debilitating disease, affecting an estimated 1% of the population worldwide. The past decade has witnessed an explosion in our understanding of the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis and, therefore, in our ability to more effectively target the disease process. Although a cure remains elusive, remission is an approachable goal. Rheumatologists have completely remodeled the traditional "pyramid" approach, now treating rheumatoid arthritis earlier and more aggressively than ever before.

Standard single therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, which was previously the final step in treating rheumatoid arthritis, is now practically bypassed in the deluge of information suggesting that combinations of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or newer biologic therapy are more effective. It is difficult to assimilate all the data and develop a rational approach; however, the bottom line is often the deciding factor: the newer agents are tremendously expensive. This article aims to review recent and relevant trials in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, suggest a treatment algorithm, and argue that traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs continue to play a pivotal role.

### Novel pathways that regulate tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in rheumatoid arthritis [^112LPQuu]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Clinical intervention studies have clearly shown the benefit of suppressing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Consequently, considerable interest has arisen in those pathways that regulate TNF-alpha production, as they may offer further possible therapeutic targets. Several candidate pathways are currently being investigated, including T cell/macrophage interactions mediated primarily through cell-cell membrane contact, novel cytokine activities, and microbial-derived products, particularly bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid sequences. Additionally, autoreactive T cells and immunoglobulins are of interest.

At the subcellular level, there is further interest in targeting signaling and mRNA processing, as well as cytokine cleavage pathways required for optimal TNF-alpha production. Key recent observations in these areas, particularly in the extracellular compartment, are reviewed.

### Management of extra-articular disease manifestations in rheumatoid arthritis [^116PA3rP]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

To discuss the rationale for various treatment strategies in rheumatoid arthritis with extra-articular manifestations, we review the advances in understanding the impact of extra-articular rheumatoid arthritis and its management.

Recent epidemiologic studies of extra-articular rheumatoid arthritis manifestations have emphasized their major role as predictors of premature mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These studies provide a rationale for aggressive anti-rheumatic treatment of extra-articular rheumatoid arthritis. Previous uncontrolled or nonrandomized studies favor the use of cyclophosphamide in patients with systemic rheumatoid vasculitis and methotrexate in the case of other manifestations of extra-articular rheumatoid arthritis. Recent case reports indicate that patients with rheumatoid lung disease may respond to cyclosporine or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and that tumor necrosis factor blocking therapy also may be successful in cases of treatment-resistant vasculitis.

By contrast, it has been suggested that tumor necrosis factor inhibitors may induce some manifestations of extra-articular rheumatoid arthritis. Data indicating a high risk of serious infections and cardiovascular disease in patients with extra-articular rheumatoid arthritis underline the importance of carefully monitoring such patients.

Extra-articular rheumatoid arthritis is a serious condition, and rheumatoid arthritis patients with extra-articular manifestations should be aggressively treated and monitored.

### SPL drug information for prednisone [^1149snBs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of prednisone by mouth (PO) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults is as follows:

- **Maintenance**: 5–30 mg PO daily.
- **Maximum**: 60 mg per day.

### Long-term clinical outcomes in early rheumatoid arthritis that was treated-to-target in the BeSt and IMPROVED studies [^112Ukb4T]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

**Rheumatology key messages**: In a 12/20-year follow-up investigation, most patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had been treated-to-target were in clinical remission. Relatively mild radiographic joint damage progression had occurred since the end of the trial phase of the studies. Functional ability was relatively well preserved in the long term, but was worse than in the general population.

### 2022 EULAR recommendations for screening and prophylaxis of chronic and opportunistic infections in adults with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases [^114Y1aSp]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for rheumatoid arthritis, specifically concerning pretreatment evaluation, the EULAR 2023 guidelines recommend screening for HIV infection before initiating biological DMARDs. It is also advised to consider screening for HIV infection before initiating conventional or targeted synthetic DMARDs, immunosuppressants, or corticosteroids, depending on the dose and duration.

### Imuran [^114NVCeu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Imuran should not be given to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug. It should not be used for treating rheumatoid arthritis in pregnant women. Furthermore, patients with rheumatoid arthritis previously treated with alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, or melphalan, may face a prohibitive risk of malignancy if treated with Imuran.

### Consensus statement on the use of rituximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^1121Q1n8]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

A large number of experts experienced in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis were involved in formulating a consensus statement on the use of B cell-targeted treatment with rituximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The statement was supported by data from randomized controlled clinical trials and the substantial literature on oncology. The statement underwent three rounds of discussions until its ultimate formulation. It should guide clinicians in the use of this newly approved biological agent in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

### Ultrasound in management of rheumatoid arthritis: ARCTIC randomised controlled strategy trial [^1163jG4c]. BMJ (2016). High credibility.

The ARCTIC study underscores the importance of conducting randomized controlled trials to evaluate not only pharmacological interventions but also new technologies or treatment strategies. The implementation and systematic use of ultrasound in the follow-up of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis treated with an aggressive tight control strategy is not justified based on the results of the ARCTIC trial. This outcome should be reflected in future recommendations and guidelines for managing patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Nevertheless, ultrasound may play a crucial role in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and in procedures like intra-articular injections. Future research should concentrate on the potential benefits of ultrasound in these areas, as well as its possible role in evaluating disease activity and tailoring treatment in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis.

### Humira [^113zZ8PG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 patients who were either DMARD-naive or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Patients were randomized to receive 40 mg of HUMIRA or placebo every other week for 24 weeks.

Study RA-V evaluated 799 patients with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years' duration who were ≥ 18 years old and MTX naive. Patients were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by week 8), HUMIRA 40 mg every other week, or HUMIRA/MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among patients enrolled in the study was 5 months. The median MTX dose achieved was 20 mg.

- **Clinical response**: The percentage of HUMIRA-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50, and 70 responses in Studies RA-II and III are shown in Table 3.

The results of Study RA-I were similar to Study RA-III; patients receiving HUMIRA 40 mg every other week in Study RA-I also achieved ACR 20, 50, and 70 response rates of 65%, 52%, and 24%, respectively, compared to placebo responses of 13%, 7%, and 3% respectively, at 6 months (p < 0.01).

### Association between rheumatoid arthritis and risk of radiotherapy toxicity: A systematic review [^113ygWhJ]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

There is sometimes concern over the use of radiotherapy for cancer in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but there is little evidence to support its avoidance. Identifying any association between RA and the risk of radiotherapy toxicity could impact guidance. This review aimed to evaluate the evidence base.

A systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. The review was performed on Medline, Embase, and PubMed databases on 25 November 2019 and updated on 22 February 2024. Articles identified for inclusion were reviewed by two independent assessors.

A total of 155 articles were identified, with 114 remaining after excluding repeated articles. Twelve articles were included in the qualitative analysis. Of these, six studies had no comparison cohort; one study compared patients with RA to patients with collagen vascular disease (CVD) without RA, and five studies compared patients with RA to those with CVD or a matched pair. The studies indicated that patients with RA developed higher levels of toxicity; however, only two studies reported statistically significant results. Nine out of the twelve studies were of medium-to-low quality and displayed predisposition to various biases. The lack of high-quality research makes it challenging to draw clear conclusions on the relationship between RA and radiotherapy toxicity.

In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a dose reduction of radiotherapy in patients with RA due to the lack of strong and high-quality evidence identified in this review. Further high-quality research involving prospective methodologies is needed.

### Xeljanz [^1139G89r]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The clinical studies described in the following sections were conducted using Xeljanz. Although other doses of Xeljanz have been studied, the recommended dose of Xeljanz is 5 mg twice daily. The recommended dose for Xeljanz XR is 11 mg once daily. A dosage of Xeljanz 10 mg twice daily or Xeljanz XR 22 mg once daily is not a recommended regimen for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

In RA Safety Study 1, 1455 patients were treated with Xeljanz 5 mg twice daily, 1456 patients were treated with 10 mg twice daily, and 1451 patients were treated with a TNF blocker for a median of 4.0 years [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

The following data includes two Phase 2 and five Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials. In these trials, patients were randomized to doses of Xeljanz 5 mg twice daily (292 patients) and 10 mg twice daily (306 patients) monotherapy, Xeljanz 5 mg twice daily (1044 patients) and 10 mg twice daily (1043 patients) in combination with DMARDs (including methotrexate), and placebo (809 patients). All seven placebo-controlled protocols included provisions for patients taking placebo to receive treatment with Xeljanz at Month 3 or Month 6 either by patient response (based on uncontrolled disease activity) or by design, so that adverse events cannot always be unambiguously attributed to a given treatment. Therefore, some analyses that follow include patients who changed treatment by design or by patient response from placebo to Xeljanz in both the placebo and Xeljanz group of a given trial.

### Protonix I.V [^111Npu6q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Concomitant use of PROTONIX I.V. with methotrexate**: Literature suggests that the concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high doses; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In cases of high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].

---

### Rayos [^114YUMTu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Rayos was evaluated in 375 rheumatoid arthritis patients in two controlled trials. Patients treated with Rayos ranged in age from 20 to 80 years (median age 56 years), with 85% female, 99% Caucasian, 1% African-American, and less than 1% Asian. Patients received Rayos 3 mg to 10 mg once daily at 10 pm, with the majority (84%) receiving 5 mg or less. The clinical trial experience did not raise new safety concerns beyond those already established for immediate-release prednisone.

- **Postmarketing experience**: Adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Rayos. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The postmarketing experience has not raised new safety concerns beyond those already established for immediate-release prednisone.

### Meloxicam [^114UdvAE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis**: The meloxicam Phase 2/3 clinical trial database includes 10,122 osteoarthritis (OA) patients and 1,012 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with meloxicam 7.5 mg/day; 3,505 OA patients and 1,351 RA patients were treated with meloxicam 15 mg/day. Meloxicam, at these doses, was administered to 661 patients for at least 6 months and to 312 patients for at least one year. Approximately 10,500 of these patients were treated in ten placebo- and/or active-controlled osteoarthritis trials, and 2,363 of these patients were treated in ten placebo- and/or active-controlled rheumatoid arthritis trials. Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were the most frequently reported adverse events in all treatment groups across meloxicam trials.

A 12-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial was conducted in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip to compare the efficacy and safety of meloxicam with placebo and an active control. Two 12-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized trials were conducted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to compare the efficacy and safety of meloxicam with placebo.

Table 1a depicts adverse events that occurred in ≥ 2% of the meloxicam treatment groups in a 12-week placebo- and active-controlled osteoarthritis trial. Table 1b depicts adverse events that occurred in ≥ 2% of the meloxicam treatment groups in two 12-week placebo-controlled rheumatoid arthritis trials.

The adverse events that occurred with meloxicam oral suspension in ≥ 2% of patients treated short-term (4 to 6 weeks) and long-term (6 months) in active-controlled osteoarthritis trials are documented in these studies.

### Will there be a clinically significant role for protons in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies [^115qta6d]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal malignancies inherently arise amidst visceral organs that are very radiation sensitive. While radiation therapy is an integral part of cancer treatment, its use has historically been limited by normal tissue toxicity. Proton therapy is a form of external-beam radiation associated with several dosimetric advantages compared to photon therapy. Proton radiation may allow for the delivery of tumoricidal doses while minimizing side effects by decreasing the dose to adjacent organs at risk. We discuss the rationale for and challenges of using protons in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. We describe the available data and ongoing trials using proton radiation to treat these tumors. Finally, we discuss the unique challenges of using protons to treat gastrointestinal malignancies.

### Cuprimine [^117W6JqT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Cuprimine can cause severe adverse reactions, so its use in rheumatoid arthritis should be restricted to patients with severe, active disease who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy. Even in these cases, the benefit-to-risk ratio should be carefully considered. Other measures, such as rest, physiotherapy, salicylates, and corticosteroids, should be used in conjunction with Cuprimine when indicated (see PRECAUTIONS).

---

### Rheumatoid arthritis: Diagnosis and management [^113CVocT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis can be challenging early in its course. It requires high clinical suspicion, thorough examination, and appropriate investigations. The early use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics has improved outcomes; however, it necessitates close monitoring of the disease course and potential adverse events.

### Skeletal muscle disease in rheumatoid arthritis: The center of cardiometabolic comorbidities [^115G3xQY]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Despite its critical roles in body movement, structure, and metabolism, skeletal muscle remains underappreciated in the context of rheumatoid arthritis. In rheumatoid arthritis, chronic inflammation, physical inactivity, and medication toxicities impair skeletal muscle. These skeletal muscle alterations contribute to continued rheumatoid arthritis disparities in physical function and cardiometabolic health.

- **Recent findings**: In the prebiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug era, rheumatoid arthritis skeletal muscle atrophy was the central feature of 'rheumatoid cachexia', a hypermetabolic state driven by chronic systemic inflammation and muscle protein degradation. In the current era, rheumatoid arthritis muscle deficits are less visible, yet persist as a key component of 'sarcopenic obesity'. In rheumatoid arthritis sarcopenic obesity, chronic inflammation, physical inactivity, and medication toxicities contribute to muscle contractile deficits, inflammation, altered metabolism, and intramuscular adiposity, a key predictor of rheumatoid arthritis disability and insulin resistance.

- **Summary**: Rheumatoid arthritis skeletal muscle disease in the current era is defined by impaired contractile function (poor strength and endurance) and sarcopenic obesity (decreased muscle mass, increased fat mass, and intramuscular adiposity). These muscle impairments contribute to disability and cardiometabolic disease in rheumatoid arthritis. Management should focus on monitoring rheumatoid arthritis muscle function and body composition, limiting potentially myotoxic therapies.

### Interleukin-6 in rheumatoid arthritis [^111nybsF]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Recent progress in cytokine studies has clarified the pathological roles played by cytokines and provided key evidence that antagonizing their actions can be therapeutic. The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune inflammatory disease, involves inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6. Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha and anti-interleukin-1 therapies have been used successfully to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but they are not consistently effective. Therefore, further therapies are needed for this refractory disease. Interleukin-6 is another target molecule for blockade in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab is a humanized antihuman interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody designed to block the actions of interleukin-6. This review addresses the pathological significance of interleukin-6 and the status of anti-interleukin-6 therapy for rheumatoid arthritis.

- **Recent findings**: The safety and efficacy of tocilizumab have been demonstrated in clinical trials conducted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune inflammatory diseases, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis and Crohn's disease.

- **Summary**: Clinical studies have demonstrated the pathological significance of interleukin-6 and the safety and efficacy of anti-interleukin-6 therapy with tocilizumab. Blockade of interleukin-6, the second generation of anticytokine therapy, may be a promising treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.

- **Methods: Information sources and search strategy**: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines were followed. A literature search was completed using 'Titles' and 'Abstracts' for Ovid Medline and Ovid Embase, and 'Title/Abstracts' for PubMed databases.

	- The following search terms were used: (((((toxic* OR side effect* OR adverse event* OR adverse effect*)) AND (radiotherapy OR radiat*)) AND (neoplasm* OR cancer* OR malignan* OR tumour* OR tumor*)) AND rheumatoid arthritis) AND (patient* OR cohort*)) NOT ultraviolet) NOT review.

	- The search was initially completed on 25 November 2019 and then rerun and finalized on 22 February 2024 involving PubMed with no year limits; Ovid Embase 1974–2024 to 22 February 2024; Ovid Medline 1946 to 22 February 2024 with one search run in the interim. Citations were reviewed in selected articles and systematic reviews found in the search. Citations found through additional reading were also included.

- **Study selection**: The inclusion criteria were as follows: participants of any age, treated with radiotherapy for any form of cancer; included patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) alone or as a subgroup of cardiovascular disease (CVD); studies measured incidence of acute or late toxicity due to radiotherapy using toxicity based on outcome assessment tools (The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) or Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)); studies were prospective or retrospective with a minimum of five patients with RA; no minimum time period reported.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111Y9ZhG]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

While several guidelines for the management of the gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects of cancer chemotherapy do exist, only the European Society for Medical Oncology and the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology clinical practice recommendations address gastroesophageal mucositis. Different types of cancer therapy alter the integrity of the GI mucosa, as well as the microbial flora that inhabit the oral cavity and the gut. These treatments also affect the amount and composition of saliva. Additionally, they negatively impact epithelial turnover and maturation, leading to impairment of the mucosal barrier.

Up to 40% of patients undergoing treatment with gemcitabine or S-1 (an oral pro-drug of 5-fluorouracil) for pancreatic cancer complained of GERD-related symptoms, and endoscopy revealed the presence of severe mucosal lesions (multiple gastric erosions, diffuse erosive gastritis, gastric or duodenal ulcer) in 46% of patients following a single cycle of chemotherapy with cisplatin plus etoposide. Gastroduodenal ulcers are extremely frequent, occurring in up to 100% of patients subjected to hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy. Even the more recent molecular-targeted agents are not devoid of GI adverse events. For instance, ulceration and perforation of the stomach and bowel are well-known complications of bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor.

The rationale for acid suppression in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy stems from the evidence that cytotoxic treatment damages the gastroesophageal mucosa.

### Association of radiation-induced normal tissue toxicity with a high genetic risk for rheumatoid arthritis [^115XbYe6]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Low credibility.

In this study, we focus on radiotherapy-related toxicity and hypothesize that individuals with an increased genetic predisposition to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) will have an increased risk of normal tissue toxicity. To test this hypothesis, we generated polygenetic risk scores for RA for individual patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate, breast, or lung cancer. Our aim was to test whether patients at high genetic risk of RA have an increased risk of normal tissue toxicity after receiving curative-intent radiotherapy.

### Lack of radiological and clinical benefit over two years of low dose prednisolone for rheumatoid arthritis: Results of a randomised controlled trial [^117CHjEe]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). High credibility.

Evidence for the disease-modifying activity of low-dose corticosteroid treatment in rheumatoid arthritis is contradictory. Studies suggesting radiological benefit indicate that continued treatment is required to sustain the effect.

To evaluate the effect of low-dose oral prednisolone in early rheumatoid arthritis on disease activity over two years, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis of less than three years in duration (n = 167) were started on a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD; sulphasalazine) and allocated by stratified randomisation to prednisolone 7 mg/day or placebo. The primary outcome measure was radiological damage, assessed by the modified Sharp method. Clinical benefit was a secondary outcome. A proactive approach to identifying and treating corticosteroid adverse events was adopted. Patients who discontinued sulphasalazine were offered an alternative DMARD.

Results showed that 90 of 257 eligible patients refused to participate, with more women than men declining. Of those enrolled, 84% were seropositive for rheumatoid factor, with a median age of 56 years and a median disease duration of 12 months. The female to male ratio was 1.8:1. Prednisolone was given to 84 patients, with 73% continuing prednisolone and 70% continuing sulphasalazine at two years. Of the 83 patients on placebo, 80% continued placebo and 64% continued sulphasalazine at two years. There were no significant differences in radiological scores, clinical measures, or laboratory measures at baseline and at two years.

In conclusion, low-dose prednisolone conferred no radiological or clinical benefit on patients with rheumatoid arthritis over two years.

### Indocin [^113qUCTf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Indocin has been shown to be an effective anti-inflammatory agent, appropriate for long-term use in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and osteoarthritis. Indocin affords relief of symptoms; it does not alter the progressive course of the underlying disease.

- **Clinical studies**: Indocin suppresses inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, demonstrated by relief of pain and reduction of fever, swelling, and tenderness. Improvement in patients treated with Indocin for rheumatoid arthritis has been shown by a reduction in joint swelling, average number of joints involved, and morning stiffness. Increased mobility is demonstrated by a decrease in walking time, and improved functional capability is shown by an increase in grip strength.

Indocin may enable the reduction of steroid dosage in patients receiving steroids for the more severe forms of rheumatoid arthritis. In such instances, the steroid dosage should be reduced slowly, and patients should be followed very closely for any possible adverse effects.

### Biologics and heart failure in rheumatoid arthritis: Are we any wiser [^111H5qHG]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

To summarize the recent literature concerning the role of TNF-alpha in heart failure, the epidemiology of heart failure in rheumatoid arthritis, and the risk of heart failure associated with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in rheumatoid arthritis:

- **Recent findings**: TNF-alpha has been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure. It has direct deleterious effects on the myocardium in the setting of acute injury or chronic heart failure. In animal models, TNF-alpha is important in cardiac remodeling, leading to cardiac dysfunction following acute injury. Both incident and worsening heart failure have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are treated with anti-TNF-alpha therapy. Recent cohort studies, however, have shown no increased risk and, in some, a protective effect on the risk of heart failure. Certain traditional cardiovascular risk factors have a relatively lesser contribution to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that disease-related perturbations of the cytokine network may contribute to the excess risk of heart failure in these patients.

- **Summary**: Overall mortality in rheumatoid arthritis has remained stagnant despite advances in rheumatoid arthritis and heart failure management and improved cardiovascular mortality in the general population. Heart failure prevalence is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and leads to greater mortality. Despite expert consensus contraindicating the use of anti-TNF-alpha agents in patients with moderate to severe heart failure, substantial issues persist regarding the management of these conditions in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

### Indomethacin [^111GnGSj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Indomethacin has been shown to be an effective anti-inflammatory agent, appropriate for long-term use in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and osteoarthritis. Indomethacin affords relief of symptoms; however, it does not alter the progressive course of the underlying disease.

- **Effectiveness in rheumatoid arthritis**: Indomethacin suppresses inflammation as demonstrated by relief of pain and reduction of fever, swelling, and tenderness. Improvement in patients treated with indomethacin is evidenced by a reduction in joint swelling, the average number of joints involved, and morning stiffness. It also increases mobility, as shown by a decrease in walking time, and improves functional capability, as demonstrated by an increase in grip strength.

- **Steroid dosage reduction**: Indomethacin may enable the reduction of steroid dosage in patients receiving steroids for the more severe forms of rheumatoid arthritis. In these instances, the steroid dosage should be reduced slowly, and patients should be closely monitored for any possible adverse effects.

### Treatment strategies for early rheumatoid arthritis [^1156kDgF]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a potentially destructive disease with a profound impact on patients' function and quality of life. Newer therapeutic agents have revolutionized outcomes but have not achieved the best results for all patients. This article reviews recent progress in developing strategies to enhance outcomes in patients with early RA (ERA).

Over the past 10 years, investigators have increasingly focused on additional means to improve the long-term prognosis of patients with RA by examining different strategies to reach clinical targets reflecting optimal levels of disease control. In particular, it has become apparent that patients with ERA have the best chance of achieving optimal outcomes, thereby normalizing function and halting radiographic damage. Studies show that strategies including treating to a target, computerizing targets, and combining clinical and biological or imaging targets for patients enable more to achieve remission, sustained remission, and even drug-free remission.

Overall, the bar has been set higher in clinical research, with the expectation that therapeutic approaches for all patients should be implemented to achieve high-level targeted outcomes. Studies evaluating the feasibility of implementing these in practice are needed to achieve this goal for all patients with ERA.

### Rheumatoid arthritis, anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment, and risk of squamous cell and basal cell skin cancer: Cohort study based on nationwide prospectively recorded data from Sweden [^114fcVa3]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors have become standard care in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. In addition to its role in inflammation, TNF plays a role in tumour biology. Concerns have been expressed that TNF inhibitors may increase the risk of cancer, particularly non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), which are known to be associated with states of immune perturbation. Organ transplantation has been associated with a 10-fold risk of basal cell cancer and a 50–200-fold increased risk of squamous cell cancer. Studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis naive to biologic drugs (as listed in supplementary table A) have indicated a 20–80% increased risk of NMSC compared with the general population.

TNF inhibitor treatment may influence the risk of NMSC in rheumatoid arthritis. Such associations have been described in case reports of rapidly evolving squamous cell cancer after TNF inhibitor treatment is started, and a large meta-analysis of clinical trial data indicated a doubled risk of NMSC during the typically short timeframes of clinical trials. Observational studies of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with TNF inhibitors have reported mixed results, with some suggesting an increased risk of NMSC and others not. In most of these studies, NMSC has been studied without differentiating in situ from invasive lesions or squamous cell from basal cell cancer. Whereas most studies have reported on overall risks, stratification by follow-up time is important as it might reconcile some of the discrepancies in the studies.

**Concomitant use of Protonix I.V. with methotrexate**: Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high doses; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113xcsf1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) carrying some risks, as with any other class of drugs, they should not be denied to patients who are likely to benefit from them merely due to concerns about potential adverse effects. There is generally an equivalence between the acceptable burden of adverse effects and the severity of the illness being treated. However, patients with acid-related diseases are often otherwise "healthy" individuals who take these drugs for a specific condition. This raises the question of what level of undesirable effects would be acceptable for them and who will bear the cost of treating any ensuing iatrogenic disease. A number of simple and potentially effective preventive measures should be recommended for some, if not all, safety concerns to minimize them.

First, PPI therapy should be evidence-based. Decisions regarding whether to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be sound, and PPIs should only be prescribed when there is an appropriate clinical indication. Clinical guidelines can certainly aid in this decision-making process. In this position paper, we have reviewed the available guidelines, together with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to generate them. We synthesized the knowledge into several statements, i.e. summaries of the evidence, and in Table 3.

- **Proton pump inhibitor therapy indications**: Guidelines rely on both evidence and expert opinion; they are neither infallible nor a substitute for clinical judgment. They, however, go beyond systematic reviews to recommend what should be done in specific clinical circumstances.

### Association between rheumatoid arthritis and risk of radiotherapy toxicity: A systematic review [^112sAQoE]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Results**:
	- The PRISMA flow chart (Figure 1) illustrates the data collection process. The search identified 155 studies, with five additional studies sourced from citation searching and further reading, resulting in a total of 160 studies. After removing duplicates (n = 46), titles and abstracts of the remaining 114 studies were screened, excluding 93. A full-text analysis was conducted on the remaining 21 studies, where eight studies were excluded for being conference abstracts with insufficient information. One study was excluded due to the lack of a radiotherapy toxicity endpoint. Thus, the final selection comprised 12 studies published between 1993 and 2021.

- **Study characteristics**:
	- Tables 1 and 2 outline the key characteristics of these 12 studies and results from meta-analyses present in the literature, all published between 1993 and 2021. Among these, three studies did not include a comparison cohort; one study compared patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to patients without RA but with cardiovascular disease (CVD); five studies compared patients with RA or CVD to a matched pair; and three studies included multivariable analysis. Quality assessment revealed that three studies were high quality (grade A), seven studies were medium quality (grade B), and two studies were low quality (grade C), as detailed in Table 3.

	- **Related findings**:
		Felefly et al. reported a low quality of methodology, sampling, generalizability, and implications. Chen et al. demonstrated low quality of evidence with statistical abnormalities, where the total number of patients investigated for late complications in the CVD and control groups was 39 and 78, respectively, rather than the stated 36 and 72, with no explanation provided.

The data presented below reflect the experience in 2,578 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with rituximab in controlled and long-term studies, with a total exposure of 5,014 patient years.

Among all exposed patients, adverse reactions reported in greater than 10% of patients include infusion-related reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infections, and bronchitis.

In placebo-controlled studies, patients received 2 × 500 mg or 2 × 1,000 mg intravenous infusions of rituximab or placebo, in combination with methotrexate, during a 24-week period. From these studies, 938 patients treated with rituximab (2 × 1,000 mg) or placebo have been pooled. Adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 5% of patients were hypertension, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, pyrexia, and pruritus. The rates and types of adverse reactions in patients who received rituximab 2 × 500 mg were similar to those observed in patients who received rituximab 2 × 1,000 mg.

### The role of B cells in rheumatoid arthritis: mechanisms and therapeutic targets [^113fcJbL]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the role of B cells as part of the immune system has remarkably expanded in the past few years. Autoimmunity, the production of autoantibodies, or the activation and expansion of autoimmune T cells is relatively common, whereas the development of autoimmune diseases with tissue destruction is much less frequent. In rheumatoid arthritis, the autoantigen(s) involved in tissue damage and their role in the disease have not been fully elucidated. Recent data suggest that the impact of B cells in rheumatoid arthritis may be significant; therefore, depleting anti-B cell therapy appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy. This review will focus on recent findings regarding the role of B cells in rheumatoid arthritis and the implications of targeting B cells in this disease.

### Contemporary treatment principles for early rheumatoid arthritis: a consensus statement [^115tsEiB]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) significantly impacts both patients and healthcare systems. The objective of the study is to advance the understanding of modern management principles in light of recent evidence concerning the diagnosis and treatment of the condition.

A group of practicing UK rheumatologists developed contemporary management principles and clinical practice recommendations related to both diagnosis and treatment. Areas of clinical uncertainty were identified, leading to research recommendations.

A key concept in the treatment of RA is minimizing cumulative inflammation, often described as the inflammation-time area under the curve (AUC). To achieve this, four core management principles were identified:

- **Detect and refer patients early**: Even if the diagnosis is uncertain, patients should be referred at the first suspicion of persistent inflammatory polyarthritis. Rheumatology departments must provide rapid access to diagnostic and prognostic services.

- **Treat RA immediately**: Optimizing outcomes with conventional DMARDs and biologics requires starting effective treatment early, ideally within three months of symptom onset.

- **Tight control of inflammation improves outcome**: Frequent assessments and an objective protocol should be used to make treatment changes that maintain low disease activity or remission at an agreed target.

- **Consider the risk-benefit ratio and tailor treatment**: Due to differing patient, disease, and drug characteristics, it is essential to monitor risks and benefits long-term and adapt treatments accordingly.

### Association between rheumatoid arthritis and risk of radiotherapy toxicity: A systematic review [^112yAjmu]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

The studies identified in this systematic review demonstrate variable methodology and risk of numerous biases. Only one study showed a high-quality, statistically significant result for an association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and radiotherapy toxicity. Given the lack of strong evidence identified in the review, dose reduction of radiotherapy in patients with RA lacks sufficient evidence to be recommended.

Our findings agree in part with those reported in the 2019 and 2021 meta-analyses that included patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and subgroup analyses of patients with RA. There is some evidence for an increase in toxicity, but the absolute level is too low to warrant changing practice guidelines. Both meta-analyses and our study highlight the need for further high-quality research. Lin et al. reported an incidence of late ≥ G3 toxicity in patients with RA of 8.7% (95% CI 1.4 to 19.7). Shaikh et al. showed patients with RA had increased ≥ G2 late toxicity compared with a case control group (OR = 2.56; 95% CI 1.28 to 5.14). Taken in isolation, these studies suggest that patients with RA have an increased risk of radiotherapy toxicity.

In comparison to the meta-analyses, our study focused on methodology within and between studies. We showed heterogeneity in total radiotherapy dose, toxicity outcome, chemotherapy, cancer treated, and time-frame of data collection, as well as the risk of confounding bias from varied control matching. In addition, Shaikh et al. included the statistics from Chen et al. which was identified as being of low quality of evidence and had incorrect statistics.

### Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors versus combination intensive therapy with conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in established rheumatoid arthritis: TACIT non-inferiority randomised controlled trial [^114j4coo]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

In early rheumatoid arthritis, three head-to-head trials have shown that combinations of disease-modifying drugs achieve similar benefits to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors. The RACAT trial, the only other trial in established active rheumatoid arthritis, demonstrated that triple therapy (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine) achieved similar benefits to etanercept plus methotrexate in incomplete methotrexate responders treated for 12 months. Our trial and RACAT had comparable results, despite differences in patients and trial design, highlighting the role of head-to-head trials against effective conventional comparators to evaluate expensive treatments. Although toxicity remains a potential concern with combined disease-modifying drugs because single trials like ours cannot fully assess risks, such combinations have been used for many years without evidence of major toxicity.

The trial questions the status quo of the use of biologics in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in whom methotrexate does not achieve the required response. In these patients, the clinical and economic evidence from our trial supports preferentially starting combinations of synthetic disease-modifying drugs. We also believe that modernising biologic treatment regimens for rheumatoid arthritis requires more strategy trials. Increasing efficacy is important, and optimising cost-effectiveness is crucial. Options include giving biologics to patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are likely to respond to specific agents and discontinuing biologics when patients do not fully respond.

### The lung in rheumatoid arthritis, cause or consequence [^114846Dk]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Recent discoveries implicate the lungs as a possible extra-articular mucosal site for initiating rheumatoid arthritis-associated immunity.

- **Recent findings**: Individuals at risk for developing arthritis and patients with early untreated rheumatoid arthritis show signs of lung involvement on high-resolution computer tomography. Rheumatoid arthritis-associated antibodies are present in patients with respiratory complaints such as bronchiectasis and unexplained dyspnea, even in the absence of joint disease, and might predict the future development of rheumatoid arthritis in these patients. Rheumatoid arthritis-associated antibodies are detected in the sputum of individuals at risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis but not yet having the disease. Signs of bronchial mucosal inflammation with germinal center formation and local production of antibodies have been described in patients with early untreated rheumatoid arthritis. Shared antigenic targets have been identified and characterized in the lungs and joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients.

- **Summary**: Recent findings support an important role for the lung as a mucosal extra-articular place where inflammation induced by external triggers (such as smoking) leads to tolerance break and generation of rheumatoid arthritis-specific immunity already before disease onset, with only secondary targeting of the joints.

### Patient benefit-risk in arthritis — a rheumatologist's perspective [^115AEdW4]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

There is a range of pharmacological options available to the rheumatologist for treating arthritis. Non-selective NSAIDs or Cox-2 selective inhibitors are widely prescribed to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain; however, they must be used with caution in individuals with an increased cardiovascular, renal, or gastrointestinal (GI) risk. The potential cardiovascular risks of Cox-2 selective inhibitors came to light over a decade ago. The conflicting nature of the study data reflects some context dependency, but the evidence shows a varying degree of cardiovascular risk with both Cox-2 selective inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs. This risk appears to be dose-dependent, which may have important ramifications for arthritis patients who require long-term treatment with high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs.

The renal effects of non-selective NSAIDs have been well characterized. An increased risk of adverse renal events was found with rofecoxib but not celecoxib, suggesting that this is not a class effect of Cox-2 selective inhibitors. Upper GI effects of non-selective NSAID treatment, ranging from abdominal pain to ulceration and bleeding, are extensively documented. Concomitant prescription of a proton pump inhibitor can help in the upper GI tract, but probably not in the lower. Evidence suggests that Cox-2 selective inhibitors are better tolerated in the entire GI tract. More evidence is required, and a composite end-point is being evaluated. Appropriate treatment strategies are needed depending on the level of upper and lower GI risk. Rheumatologists must be vigilant in addressing these risks for optimal patient care.

Patient support organisations, such as the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society or the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance, represent a strong platform for spreading awareness online. These groups are well trusted by patients and can play a pivotal role in advertising widely and sharing case stories of successfully treated patients, as well as hosting events such as interactive seminars. The use of other mediums, including podcasts and ethnography projects, can help enhance confidence among people with rheumatoid arthritis, particularly those who may have accepted their moderate disease and may have lost the will, hope, or even trust in the treatment or their treating physicians. In addition to producing their own material, patient support groups can also signpost patients to relevant sources and educational tools. This activity will help to reassure patients and also save time for health care professionals by resolving queries patients may have.

### Association between rheumatoid arthritis and risk of radiotherapy toxicity: A systematic review [^113jKnqR]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

There is sometimes concern over the use of radiotherapy for cancer in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but little evidence to support its avoidance. Identifying any association between RA and the risk of radiotherapy toxicity could impact guidance, so we aimed to review the evidence base.

Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic review was conducted of Medline, Embase, and PubMed databases on 25 November 2019 and updated on 22 February 2024. Articles identified for inclusion were reviewed by two independent assessors. A total of 155 articles were identified, and after excluding repeat articles, 114 remained. Twelve articles were included in the qualitative analysis. Six studies held no comparison cohort; one compared RA to non-RA collagen vascular disease (CVD) patients; five compared patients with RA to CVD or a matched pair. The studies indicated that patients with RA developed higher levels of toxicity; however, only two studies had statistically significant results. Nine of the 12 studies provided medium to low quality evidence and displayed predisposition to numerous biases.

Due to limited high-quality research, it is difficult to draw a clear conclusion on the relationship between RA and radiotherapy toxicity. Given the lack of strong and high-quality evidence identified in this review, dose reduction of radiotherapy in patients with RA lacks sufficient evidence to be recommended. There is a need for further high-quality research involving prospective analyses of toxicity, up-to-date radiotherapy techniques, long follow-up, and large sample sizes.

### Humira [^111rMGqn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The data described below reflect exposure to HUMIRA in 2,468 patients, including 2,073 exposed for six months, 1,497 exposed for greater than one year, and 1,380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). HUMIRA was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow-up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most patients received 40 mg HUMIRA every other week [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in patients treated with HUMIRA 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion.

Less common adverse reactions in rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies include other infrequent serious adverse reactions that do not appear in the Warnings and Precautions or Adverse Reaction sections that occurred at an incidence of less than 5% in HUMIRA-treated patients in RA studies.

### Patient benefit-risk in arthritis — a rheumatologist's perspective [^111A3FLK]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

There is a range of pharmacological options available to the rheumatologist for treating arthritis. Non-selective NSAIDs or Cox-2 selective inhibitors are widely prescribed to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain; however, they must be used with caution in individuals with an increased cardiovascular, renal, or gastrointestinal (GI) risk. The potential cardiovascular risks of Cox-2 selective inhibitors came to light over a decade ago. The conflicting nature of the study data reflects some context dependency, but the evidence shows a varying degree of cardiovascular risk with both Cox-2 selective inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs. This risk appears to be dose-dependent, which may have important ramifications for arthritis patients who require long-term treatment with high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs.

The renal effects of non-selective NSAIDs have been well characterized. An increased risk of adverse renal events was found with rofecoxib but not celecoxib, suggesting that this is not a class effect of Cox-2 selective inhibitors. Upper GI effects of non-selective NSAID treatment, ranging from abdominal pain to ulceration and bleeding, are extensively documented. Concomitant prescription of a proton pump inhibitor can help in the upper GI tract, but probably not in the lower. Evidence suggests that Cox-2 selective inhibitors are better tolerated in the entire GI tract. More evidence is required, and a composite end-point is being evaluated. Appropriate treatment strategies are needed depending on the level of upper and lower GI risk. Rheumatologists must be vigilant in a

### Proton pump inhibitor exposure, trabecular bone score, and BMD: a registry-based cohort study [^115aRVJu]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). Low credibility.

- **Least squares mean (LSM) analysis**: Trabecular bone score (TBS) (upper panel), lumbar spine BMD (g/cm², middle panel), and femoral neck BMD (g/cm², lower panel) were evaluated according to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use. These measures were adjusted for age, sex, and scanner (model 1); additional clinical variables such as BMI, previous fracture, parental hip fracture, smoking, glucocorticoid use, rheumatoid arthritis, secondary osteoporosis, high alcohol use, and anti-osteoporosis therapy without sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) (model 2); and additional clinical variables with SAD (model 3). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **PPI use categorization**: The medication persistence ratio (MPR) was used to categorize PPI use as none (referent), minimal (MPR 0.01–0.25), mild (MPR 0.26–0.5), moderate (MPR 0.51–0.75), and high (MPR 0.76–1).

### Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of the knee: Is contrast needed to score disease activity when using an augmented MRI protocol comprising PD-weighted sequences [^115nGPaF]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The JIA subgroups included oligoarticular arthritis (n = 16), extended oligoarthritis (n = 6), rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular arthritis (n = 3), enthesitis-related arthritis (n = 1), and psoriatic arthritis (n = 1). The average number of affected joints was 4 ± 3 joints.

Every patient involved in the study received medication, including one or two of the following: naproxen (n = 19), ibuprofen (n = 1), methotrexate (n = 8), etanercept (n = 1), and prednisolone (n = 1).

- **Imaging technique**: All MRI examinations were performed on a 3-Tesla system (Magnetom Verio, Siemens Healthineers) using either a 6-channel body coil to simultaneously examine both knees during one single exam or a dedicated 6-channel transmit/receive knee coil to examine one knee. Of a total of 53 knee joints, nine were examined with a knee coil and 44 with a 6-channel body coil. Sequences included: proton-density-weighted (PD) fat-saturated turbo spin echo (TSE) images, T1-weighted TSE images, T2-weighted TSE images, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted fat-saturated TSE images. Contrast media (gadoterate meglumine, Dotarem, Guerbet) were administered according to the manufacturer's recommendation at a dose of 0.2 mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg) body weight as an intravenous bolus injection.

### Appropriate and effective management of rheumatoid arthritis [^117A3EfW]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Early referral (at < 3 months) and early DMARD treatment enable the course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to be changed. Once the disease has become aggressive, it is much harder to treat, and improvements will not be as significant as they would have been with earlier treatment. The latest strategies and treatments enable remission to be achieved in many more patients than formerly.

### Airways abnormalities in a prospective cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^112d9EJk]. Chest (2025). Low credibility.

- **Background**: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with increased risk of airway abnormalities, which may contribute to comorbid respiratory diseases.

- **Objective**: The study aims to identify and characterize airway abnormalities in patients with RA.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective cohort study involving participants diagnosed with RA. Participants underwent high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans and pulmonary function tests to assess airway abnormalities.

- **Results**: The analysis revealed a significant prevalence of bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, and air trapping in the RA cohort. Additionally, pulmonary function tests indicated a reduction in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), suggesting obstructive and restrictive ventilatory defects in these patients.

- **Discussion**: The findings highlight the necessity for regular respiratory assessments in RA patients to prevent and manage potential respiratory complications. These abnormalities may impact the quality of life and require multidisciplinary management approaches.

- **Conclusion**: The study underscores the need for heightened awareness and proactive monitoring of respiratory health in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. Further research is recommended to explore therapeutic interventions targeting these airway abnormalities.

### Humira [^116CDmgc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of Humira were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in patients aged 18 years or older with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients had at least six swollen and nine tender joints. Humira was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III, and RA-V), as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V), or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV).

- **Study RA-I**: Evaluated 271 patients who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had an inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40, or 80 mg of Humira or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.

- **Study RA-II**: Evaluated 544 patients who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20, or 40 mg of Humira were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks.

- **Study RA-III**: Evaluated 619 patients who had an inadequate response to MTX. Patients received placebo, 40 mg of Humira every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of Humira weekly for up to 52 weeks. This study had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks for the inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase where 40 mg of Humira was administered every other week for up to five years.

### Patients' attitudes and experiences of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis: A qualitative synthesis [^111HD4te]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Clinicians are encouraged to follow international guidelines that recommend the early use of DMARDs, and escalating or changing treatment to aim for a target of remission or low disease activity. However, patients can find commencing DMARDs at the first consultation alarming, and they may fear changes and escalations of therapy. This therapeutic approach may be more acceptable if patients understand that treating early and treating to target increases DMARD efficacy and results in better long-term outcomes.

A structured approach may help the clinician discuss DMARD use. The 5A approach (ask, assess, advise, assist, arrange follow-up) to smoking cessation has been adapted to guide brief counseling interventions targeting diet and exercise. We suggest the following 5A approach to address DMARD adherence:

- **Ask about patients' experiences** of their DMARDs, their concerns (especially those they may not mention, such as mortality, cancer, and organ damage), and goals (which could be to take fewer medications).

- **Assess their willingness** to take DMARDs.

- **Advise on the benefits** of DMARDs (using examples, including benefits on mortality, on maintaining roles, and control of disease), options (including practical implications to lifestyle), and communicate with optimism and consistency (referring to reliable internet sources and drug information leaflets).

- **Assist patients taking DMARDs** so they feel supported (including nursing, phone, and peer support).

- **Arrange adequate follow-up** and continue to address the above at every stage of their disease.

### The 2005 international symposium on advances in targeted therapies: What have we learned in the 2000s and where are we going [^114BeweV]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

This essay summarizes a personal perspective on where we have arrived five years into the new millennium. The focus is on advances in the knowledge of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic immune-inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Accumulating knowledge is clarifying the scope and limitations of these agents' efficacy, safety, and durability. It is also defining the unmet needs of patients and communities worldwide for the future. There is a call for progress in providing more cost-effective advancements in therapeutics that not only interrupt the disease process long-term but also reverse the anatomical and functional consequences of the disease and improve the quality of life.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111uu1Gh]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The Globocan survey indicates that, in 2012, approximately 32.6 million people were living with cancer within five years of diagnosis. It is therefore astonishing and disappointing that thousands of studies, often dealing with trivial gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and spending billions of euros, have been performed while very few have evaluated the potential indications of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in cancer to provide physicians with the best way to cope with the GI adverse effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy and relieve the suffering of these difficult patients.

Besides the several potential and alleged indications of PPIs in cancer patients, increasing evidence suggests an anti-tumor effect for this class of drugs. This is achieved through the selective induction of apoptosis as well as an anti-inflammatory effect. PPIs also exert a protection of cancer cells from developing chemo- or radiotherapeutic resistance. Acidification of the extracellular compartment represents a conceivable mechanism of drug resistance in malignant cells. In addition, it drives proliferation and promotes invasion and metastasis. Experimental evidence has shown that PPIs counteract tumor acidification via inhibition of vacuolar H+ ATPase and restore sensitivity to anticancer drugs. Moreover, early clinical data have supported their role as add-on medications to anticancer treatments in patients with osteosarcoma or breast cancer. A recent large epidemiological study, the SPORE program, found that patients with head and neck tumors taking acid suppressants had significantly longer overall survival compared to those who did not.
