## Question

Espirometry indicating asthma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret spirometry in suspected asthma, including when spirometry supports the diagnosis, when it does not, what adjunct tests to use, how to distinguish asthma from COPD, and how age affects interpretation and testing strategy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should review the baseline spirometry parameters and define obstruction. Next, I will evaluate bronchodilator reversibility thresholds and their diagnostic implications. After that, I need to consider what to do when spirometry is normal, including PEF monitoring, FeNO, and bronchoprovocation. Then, I will distinguish asthma from COPD using spirometry patterns. I should also review special populations and age-related issues. Finally, I will integrate these elements into a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm and monitoring plan with quality safeguards.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because pretest probability shapes test interpretation and post-test probabilities. Typical asthma symptoms include wheeze, dyspnea, chest tightness, and cough that vary over time and intensity, often worse at night or with exercise, allergens, cold air, or viral infections, so I need to anchor the spirometric data to this symptom pattern before concluding anything definitive [^115ppn5R].

> I will now examine the baseline spirometry for obstruction, since reduced post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC supports airflow limitation and moves the diagnosis toward an obstructive disorder, but wait, I should verify the cutoffs I'm using. A post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC less than the lower limit of normal is preferred over a fixed 0.70 in adults, while a reduced FEV1/FVC is required for COPD and helps characterize but is not required for asthma; I initially thought "FEV1/FVC less than 0.70 defines obstruction in both asthma and COPD", but hold on, that's imprecise — 0.70 is the fixed ratio threshold commonly used for COPD, whereas asthma is defined by variable airflow limitation and can show normal baseline FEV1/FVC between episodes, so I should correct myself and use LLN where available and interpret a low FEV1/FVC as supportive of obstruction rather than diagnostic for asthma per se [^11792zsF] [^115TQgF8].

> Next, I should review bronchodilator responsiveness, because this is the key discriminator for asthma within obstructive patterns. In adults with typical symptoms, an increase in FEV1 of at least 12% and 200 mL from baseline after bronchodilator is considered consistent with asthma, whereas marked reversibility exceeding 12% and 400 mL strongly favors asthma and is unusual in COPD; I need to ensure withholding of short-acting bronchodilators before testing to avoid false negatives, and I should remember that GINA acknowledges a technical standards proposal to change the criterion to more than 10% predicted but has not adopted it for diagnostic use pending further data, so I will stick with the 12% and 200 mL threshold for now [^112HHJDS] [^11792zsF] [^117WmeDa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions when spirometry is normal. Normal results do not exclude asthma because airflow limitation can be intermittent or absent between episodes, so I should consider alternative objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation. Excessive variability on serial peak expiratory flow measurements over 1–2 weeks, a clinically meaningful increase in lung function after a 4-week trial of ICS-containing therapy, or a positive bronchial challenge test can all support the diagnosis when spirometry is nondiagnostic, and I should double-check that I am using the same PEF meter and best-of-three technique given inter-meter variability up to about 20% [^111aC4up] [^113WFRcb] [^115spWrp].

> I need to check the role of FeNO as an adjunct when the diagnosis remains uncertain or spirometry is not feasible. FeNO is conditionally recommended in patients aged 5 years and older with diagnostic uncertainty or when spirometry cannot be performed, but I should confirm that FeNO is not used in isolation to diagnose asthma and that levels are interpreted in the context of atopy and smoking, which can confound results; in children, a FeNO of 35 ppb or higher alongside supportive clinical features increases the likelihood of eosinophilic asthma and ICS responsiveness, but I must avoid FeNO in children under 5 for diagnostic prediction given limited evidence [^1143mPZ9] [^111rLE4B] [^116Gifhy].

> Let me consider bronchoprovocation testing when suspicion remains high despite normal spirometry and noninvasive measures are inconclusive. Methacholine or mannitol challenge demonstrating bronchial hyperresponsiveness supports asthma, and I should ensure bronchodilators are withheld appropriately beforehand to maximize sensitivity. If FEV1 is less than 70% predicted, a therapeutic bronchodilator trial may be safer than provocation, but I should verify that the clinical risk and local expertise are aligned before proceeding [^117NCPzZ] [^116i3ybZ].

> Now, I should distinguish asthma from COPD using spirometry patterns and clinical context, because misclassification is common and affects treatment. Asthma typically shows variable obstruction with significant bronchodilator reversibility, whereas COPD shows persistent airflow limitation with limited reversibility; however, I must remember that GOLD no longer recommends using the degree of reversibility to differentiate asthma from COPD because it varies over time and lacks diagnostic specificity, so I should integrate smoking history, age, symptom pattern, and imaging when needed, recognizing asthma-COPD overlap when both reversible and fixed obstruction coexist [^113d5NE3] [^115TQgF8] [^114Ze2M6].

> I will now examine age-related considerations, since test performance and interpretation differ in children and older adults. In children under 5, objective testing is limited and diagnosis is largely clinical with cautious therapeutic trials; once children are 5 years and older, spirometry with bronchodilator testing is recommended, and I should be mindful that pediatric guidelines often emphasize FeNO and PEF variability, though evidence quality varies and thresholds differ across guidelines, so I need to document variability rather than rely on a single snapshot [^114BtFWA] [^114q6oiM] [^112w4CDg]. In older adults, I should use age-adjusted reference values to avoid overcalling obstruction, anticipate lower FEV1 and more severe airflow limitation, and consider that frailty may limit test performance, yet many can complete acceptable maneuvers with coaching [^115bdX5g].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Start with a careful history to establish pretest probability. If probability is high and spirometry demonstrates obstruction with significant reversibility, the diagnosis is supported. If spirometry is normal, proceed with PEF monitoring, consider FeNO, and escalate to bronchoprovocation if uncertainty persists. If probability is low, prioritize alternative diagnoses and avoid anchoring on asthma. Throughout, I should confirm the diagnosis objectively before initiating long-term ICS-containing therapy when feasible, as treatment can mask diagnostic features and complicate later confirmation [^111aC4up] [^115spWrp] [^1148j9QB].

> I should double-check monitoring implications once asthma is diagnosed, because routine spirometry at every visit is not necessary in stable patients. Guidelines suggest obtaining spirometry 3–6 months after initiating ICS to establish a personal best FEV1 and then periodically, at least every 1–2 years in adults and more frequently in higher-risk patients or children, while avoiding routine spirometry for stable asthma in primary care; I need to ensure that control assessment also incorporates symptom tools and exacerbation history rather than lung function alone [^116SBHxw] [^112eniPc] [^115RU2A4].

> But wait, what if small airway dysfunction is suspected or spirometry remains discordant with symptoms? Oscillometry can detect small airway involvement and may add value in specialized settings or when standard spirometry is unrevealing, though I should confirm local availability and standardization before relying on it clinically, and recognize that evidence is growing but not yet universally adopted for routine diagnosis [^111vNNr6] [^113RM5af].

> Finally, I need to ensure quality assurance because misinterpretation is common in primary care and can lead to misdiagnosis. Adequate coaching, device calibration, and adherence to ATS/ERS acceptability and reproducibility criteria improve test validity, and when in doubt, referral for specialist testing is appropriate, especially in patients with persistent symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, or suspected alternative diagnoses that require advanced evaluation [^113WFRcb] [^116eJ6HV].

Spirometry supports an asthma diagnosis when there is **variable expiratory airflow limitation** [^115ppn5R], most often shown by a **post-bronchodilator FEV1 increase ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL** [^112HHJDS] from baseline. If spirometry is normal but suspicion remains high, **bronchoprovocation testing** (methacholine or exercise) can confirm airway hyperresponsiveness [^1147h6Tf] [^117AGe3D]. Normal spirometry does not exclude asthma, especially in mild or well-controlled disease [^1135HjLy] [^112rNsHe], so **repeat testing** or adjuncts (FeNO, peak flow monitoring) may be needed [^1143mPZ9] [^111aC4up]. Spirometry also helps distinguish asthma from COPD by documenting reversibility and excluding fixed obstruction [^114Ze2M6] [^11792zsF].

## Key spirometric findings indicating asthma

Asthma is defined by **variable expiratory airflow limitation** [^115ppn5R]; spirometry can demonstrate this via several patterns:

| **Spirometric finding** | **Definition** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Post-bronchodilator reversibility | Increase in FEV1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL from baseline after bronchodilator [^112HHJDS] | Highly supportive of asthma |
| Excessive variability in lung function | - Fluctuations in FEV1 or PEF over time <br/> - Often > 20% variability in PEF [^114HhJif] | Indicates variable airflow limitation |
| Normal baseline spirometry with bronchoprovocation | - Normal FEV1/FVC <br/> - Positive methacholine or exercise challenge [^1147h6Tf] | Suggests airway hyperresponsiveness |
| Low FEV1/FVC ratio | - Reduced ratio indicating obstruction <br/> - Often improves after bronchodilator [^117NCPzZ] | Consistent with asthma |

---

## Bronchodilator reversibility

Bronchodilator reversibility is a hallmark of asthma; a **post-bronchodilator increase in FEV1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL** [^112HHJDS] strongly supports the diagnosis [^112HHJDS]. However, reversibility can be absent in well-controlled asthma or during remission, so a negative test does not exclude asthma [^11792zsF].

---

## Bronchoprovocation testing

When spirometry is normal but suspicion remains high, **bronchoprovocation testing** (methacholine or exercise) can confirm airway hyperresponsiveness, a characteristic feature of asthma [^1147h6Tf] [^117AGe3D].

---

## Limitations of spirometry in asthma diagnosis

Spirometry has several limitations: **normal results** can occur in mild or well-controlled asthma, reducing sensitivity [^11792zsF] [^115YNXJM]. Poor effort or improper technique can produce inaccurate results, and variability in obstruction means repeated testing may be needed to capture airflow limitation [^1156vyjU] [^111aC4up].

---

## Differentiating asthma from other respiratory conditions

Spirometry helps distinguish asthma from other respiratory diseases:

- **COPD**: Fixed airflow obstruction (little reversibility) and reduced DLCO favor COPD [^11792zsF].
- **Restrictive lung disease**: Reduced FVC with normal FEV1/FVC ratio [^117AGe3D].
- **Upper airway obstruction**: Flattened inspiratory/expiratory loops on flow-volume curve [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **objective testing** to confirm asthma:

- **GINA 2024**: Document variable expiratory airflow limitation using spirometry or PEF; avoid diagnosing on symptoms alone [^111aC4up] [^1148j9QB].
- **ERS 2022**: Use spirometry as part of diagnostic work-up in adults with suspected asthma [^113LT73i].
- **NHLBI 2020**: Use FeNO as an adjunct when diagnosis is uncertain or spirometry is not feasible [^1143mPZ9] [^112bqJrr].

---

## Clinical scenarios where spirometry is particularly useful

Spirometry is especially helpful when **diagnostic uncertainty** exists — symptoms are present but the diagnosis is unclear [^113LT73i] — and for **differentiating asthma from COPD** by documenting reversibility and excluding fixed obstruction [^114Ze2M6]. It is also useful for **monitoring disease control and treatment response** over time [^116SBHxw].

---

## Conclusion

Spirometry is essential for diagnosing asthma by demonstrating **variable expiratory airflow limitation** [^113AoLag] [^115ppn5R], most often via post-bronchodilator reversibility [^111bZLC5]. Normal spirometry does not exclude asthma, so **additional testing** (bronchoprovocation, FeNO, peak flow monitoring) may be needed [^116i3ybZ] [^1143mPZ9]. Spirometry also helps distinguish asthma from other respiratory conditions and guides ongoing management [^114Ze2M6] [^117NCPzZ].

### Difficulties in the interpretation of lung function tests in the diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111sXsQB]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To ascertain differences in the interpretation of spirometry and peak flow measurement between primary care (several practioners and nurses) and specialists in patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Design

A randomized, prospective cohort study of 98 patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of asthma or COPD. Two chest specialists independently interpreted the peak flow and spirometric data and they were also blinded to the primary care results.

Results

There was total agreement in interpretation of the data between general practitioners and specialists in only 20 (20.4%). Levels of diagnostic agreement were highest between the two chest specialists (55%) and lowest between the general practice records and the diagnosis assigned by general practitioners (16%). Disagreement between general practitioners and the two chest specialists was consistent (38%) indicating systematic differences in interpretation.

Conclusions

This study raises concerns about differences in the interpretation of spirometry and peak expiratory flow rates in general and hospital practice and the guidelines on which these interpretations are based.

### Improving primary care management of asthma: do we know what really works? [^113ZhC95]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Appropriate practice organisation and systems focussing on the identification, diagnosis and treatment are pivotal for quality asthma care. There was compelling evidence to indicate that integrated, multi-faceted practice-based approaches for the management of patients improves outcomes and reduces the need for referral to secondary care. Coordinated practice systems that combine several interventions such as decision support tools, flagging of electronic records, use of care pathways, staff training and structured approaches to patient education, if consistently implemented, afford the greatest benefits. Implementation of practice schemes is likely to be enhanced where there is dedicated clinical and administrative leadership.

Intuitively an accurate diagnosis should lead to better patient outcomes, although we found conflicting evidence that access to proper diagnosis has an impact on patient outcomes. Nevertheless, an accurate diagnosis remains the fulcrum on which optimal asthma management depends. Indeed programmes in which an expanded medical team improved the quality of asthma care within the primary care setting (such as a diagnostic and management support organisation) show clear benefit on patient outcome.

Spirometry combined with an assessment of reversibility has been set as gold standard for asthma diagnosis. However, standards on quality of spirometry such as those set by the ERS and ATS are often not achieved – and impose an unnecessarily high and potentially unachievable threshold in primary care. Nevertheless, some studies have demonstrated that primary care office spirometry can meet the acceptability criteria –. Although such standards are laudable particularly in a specialist setting, their practicability in primary care, where patients commonly have mild–moderate, intermittent disease, is debatable. The latest ATS-ERS spirometry guidelines (published in October 2019) may address some of these issues. However, the use of spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma remains beyond reach in primary care around the world.

In many countries primary care physicians have limited or no access to tests of lung function or airway inflammation. The creation of diagnostic hubs in the community may open access to these tests. A structured approach to diagnosis including applicability and feasibility for primary care is currently under development by an ERS taskforce; its outcome not available at the time of writing.

### Does the routine use of spirometry improve clinical outcomes in children? – A systematic review [^113NsTNi]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Spirometry is a portable and relatively simple test designed to identify and quantify abnormalities in respiratory function. The measurements derived from spirometry are measures of airflow and exhaled lung volumes. Spirometry can generally be reliably performed by children > 6 years of age and by some preschoolers under modified criteria.

Data from spirometry add to clinical management in numerous ways, including assisting in characterizing respiratory pathophysiology, grading the severity of lung disorders, monitoring disease, and determining the effectiveness of therapy. Hence, its use is recommended in pediatric clinical guidelines as part of clinical management including guidelines for chronic cough, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and recurrent wheezing, asthma, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. Other diagnoses and conditions in which spirometry aids in management include, but are not limited to, oncology conditions, connective tissue disorders, neuromuscular weakness, and scoliosis.

Although spirometry is widely advocated in pediatric guidelines and routine in most respiratory clinics, there is evidence of under‐utilization of spirometry in primary care settings. For example, only half of all family physicians and general pediatricians use spirometry in patients with asthma and only 21% routinely use it in asthma guideline‐recommended situations, that is, establishing an asthma diagnosis, severity, or control. Although pediatricians used spirometry 66% of the time, only 10% performed the test consistently on each asthma visit. In another survey of children with asthma, only a third were referred for spirometry and only one‐half of hospitalized children underwent spirometry during follow‐up.

Clarification of the value and impact of spirometry in routine consultations, with systematic review evidence, is essential for integrating spirometry into routine clinical practice. Thus, our systematic review aimed to evaluate the question "In children with suspected or known respiratory diseases, does the routine use of spirometry improve health‐related quality of life (QoL) outcome and guide clinical management, compared to not using spirometry?"

### Novel measure of lung function for assessing disease activity in asthma [^115YNXJM]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

In asthma, lung function measures, such as spirometry, are often discordant with the clinical assessment of disease activity, as determined by symptoms, exacerbation frequency and response to treatment. There is no single diagnostic test for asthma, and both clinical assessment of symptoms and objective tests can produce false positives and false negatives. Spirometry may be normal in patients with active airways disease, and the diagnosis of asthma, for example, may require multiple measurements over time to demonstrate variable airflow obstruction. In addition, age-related changes in FEV 1 or fixed airflow obstruction may lead to overdiagnosis or treatment in older people. This disparity, alongside the fact that primary care clinicians may not have access to reliable lung function testing at the point of clinical decision-making, often leads clinicians to adopt a no-test approach to diagnosis and treatment.

Recently, Mountain et al. described a new approach to lung function testing that involved assessing the inhomogeneity of gas exchange in the lung. This study is a first look at whether this technique has the potential to provide a better measure of disease activity in the lungs of asthmatic patients than standard spirometry.

### The challenge of objective confirmation of asthma diagnosis in primary care [^117MHaeV]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Asthma represents one of the most common chronic conditions encountered in primary care and diagnosis should be confirmed objectively with the demonstration of variable airflow obstruction. As many asthmatics have normal lung function at the time of clinical presentation, objective confirmation of airflow limitation may be challenging. Fluctuations in airflow obstruction can be documented with simple office spirometry after bronchodilator challenge, home monitoring of peak expiratory flow and bronchoconstriction induced by spasmogens such as methacholine. We present a case highlighting the challenge of objective confirmation of asthma diagnosis in primary care and provide a critical review of the diagnostic approaches highlighted above. Our aim is to provide a pragmatic interpretation of the available literature with a view to assisting clinicians in selecting the diagnostic test best suited for individualised patient encounters.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115ppn5R]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for asthma, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose asthma in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged 6–11 years) patients based on typical variable respiratory symptoms and confirmed variable expiratory airflow:

- **Wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough**: symptoms occurring variably over time and vary in intensity; symptoms often worse at night or on waking; symptoms often triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens, cold air; symptoms worsen after end-exercise (very distinctive); symptoms often appearing or worsening with viral infections

- **Confirmed excessive variability in lung function (≥ 1 of the following)**: positive bronchodilator responsiveness test with spirometry (or peak expiratory flow); excessive variability in twice-daily peak expiratory flow over 2 weeks; increase in lung function after 4 weeks of ICS-containing treatment; positive bronchial challenge test; excessive variation in lung function between visits.

### Oscillometry in the diagnosis, assessment, and monitoring of asthma in children and adults [^111vNNr6]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing asthma typically relies on clinical history, physical examination, and objective lung function test results. Spirometry, the gold standard for assessing lung function, is universally recommended for the diagnostic, assessment, and monitoring of asthma. It requires maximal respiratory effort that limits cooperation in certain populations and has limitations in detecting small airway dysfunction. Oscillometry requires minimal patient effort, is noninvasive, and provides valuable information on both large and small airways. Recent task force reports have suggested oscillometry as an alternative or a complementary lung function test to spirometry in the management of individuals with asthma. This review explores the scientific evidence and psychometric properties regarding oscillometry in the main purposes served by lung function testing in asthma, namely diagnosis, assessment of control and future risk, as well as longitudinal monitoring, including clinical utility. Furthermore, it addressed challenges and facilitators to implementation and future directions regarding its positioning as lung function testing in individuals with asthma.

### Global, regional, and national deaths, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years, and years lived with disability for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2015 [^115EJtcJ]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic respiratory diseases are among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Of all chronic respiratory diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are the most common. These diseases ranked among the top 20 conditions causing disability globally and were ranked eighth (COPD) and 23rd (asthma) as causes of disease burden as measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2015. Yet the measurement of mortality, prevalence, and other population indicators of these two diseases is complicated by misclassification and an absence of consensus about case definitions. Both death rates and prevalence of COPD steeply increase with age. The age pattern of asthma mortality resembles that of COPD rather than the relatively steady prevalence in adults seen in asthma surveys and health service encounter data. This difference in age patterns between cause of death and prevalence data sources has been attributed to a range of factors including the commonly reported misclassification of asthma in the elderly as COPD, variable and temporal effects of smoking, and an actual overlap of asthma and COPD (asthma COPD overlap; ACO). However, no consensus exists on the definition of ACO to date. Also, evidence from a longitudinal studydid not show a larger reduction in lung function in those patients with COPD and asthma than those without asthma, whereas others have challenged the concept of ACO altogether.

Spirometry is the fundamental tool used to define and stage COPD and, accordingly, establish population prevalence in surveys. Under the umbrella of the burden of obstructive lung disease (BOLD) initiative, surveys have been done in 29 countries, with surveys in a further nine countries still in progress. Two previous initiatives in five Colombian cities (PREPOCOL)and in five Latin American capital cities (PLATINO)provided more population estimates. Although all these studies used comparable methods, there is still no universal consensus about the thresholds of spirometry findings to define COPD. The two dominant case definitions for airflow limitation compatible with COPD are a value of less than 0.70 for the ratio of FEV 1 and forced vital capacity (FVC), or the lower limit of normal (LLN) method of deriving a threshold as the fifth percentile of FEV 1 :FVC in a healthy reference population. No universal LLN threshold exists because it is thought to vary between populations. Because most people identified with COPD based on spirometry findings report not having been diagnosed prior to survey, population screening and case-finding in symptomatic smokers have been suggested to provide an opportunity for smoking cessation interventions before the disease has progressed.

Ages 5–11 years terminology and monitoring — The terms ICS-LABA and ICS-formoterol indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler, and where formoterol is specified in the steps, it is because the evidence is based on studies specific to formoterol. In individuals ages 5–11 years with persistent allergic asthma in which there is uncertainty in choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapies based on history, clinical findings, and spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement is conditionally recommended as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy that includes frequent assessment.

### Spirometric criteria for asthma: adding further evidence to the debate [^111uiSZa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Objective assessments of pulmonary function are considered essential for the diagnosis of asthma. The degree of reversibility of FEV(1) considered supportive of asthma varies between international asthma guidelines.

Objective

We sought to compare the relative performance of international guideline reversibility criteria for identifying impairment in persons with a significant bronchodilator response (SBR) without an asthma diagnosis.

Methods

The North West Adelaide Health (Cohort) Study, a population biomedical study of 4060 subjects, conducted spirometry according to American Thoracic Society criteria. SBR was defined as postbronchodilator FEV(1) responses of at least 12% or 15% of baseline values, 9% of predicted values, or 400 mL. A self-completed questionnaire assessed current asthma (CA), respiratory symptoms, and participant demographics.

Results

The prevalence of CA was 9.4% (n = 380), whereas 1.3% (≥ 400 mL) to 4.5% (≥ 9% of predicted value) of participants demonstrated an SBR in the absence of CA. With the exception of the 9% predicted criterion, prebronchodilator mean FEV(1) (percent predicted) in those demonstrating an SBR but no CA was significantly worse than that in the CA group. Significantly more respiratory symptoms were experienced by the SBR groups than the group without asthma. Logistic regression analyses identified different characteristics of those classified by the following criteria: 12% and 15%, age of 40 years or greater and household income of less than $40,000; 9% predicted, household income of less than $40,000; 400 mL, male sex (odds ratio, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.1–9.3).

Conclusions

Different criteria identify different persons, but SBR by any criteria was associated with significant respiratory impairment, some of which might be attributable to asthma. Postbronchodilator change as a percentage of predicted value was the least biased of the criteria.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^115zTJnE]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Asthma is one of the most frequent reasons children visit a general practitioner (GP). The diagnosis of childhood asthma is challenging, and a variety of diagnostic tests for asthma exist. GPs may refer to clinical practice guidelines when deciding which tests, if any, are appropriate, but the quality of these guidelines is unknown.

Objectives

To determine (i) the methodological quality and reporting of paediatric guidelines for the diagnosis of childhood asthma in primary care, and (ii) the strength of evidence supporting diagnostic test recommendations.

Design

Meta-epidemiological study of English-language guidelines from the United Kingdom and other high-income countries with comparable primary care systems including diagnostic testing recommendations for childhood asthma in primary care. The AGREE-II tool was used to assess the quality and reporting of the guidelines. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Results

Eleven guidelines met the eligibility criteria. The methodology and reporting quality varied across the AGREE II domains (median score 4.5 out of 7, range 2–6). The quality of evidence supporting diagnostic recommendations was generally of very low quality. All guidelines recommended the use of spirometry and reversibility testing for children aged ≥ 5 years, however, the recommended spirometry thresholds for diagnosis differed across guidelines. There were disagreements in testing recommendations for 3 of the 7 included tests.

Conclusions

The variable quality of guidelines, lack of good quality evidence, and inconsistent recommendations for diagnostic tests may contribute to poor clinician adherence to guidelines and variation in testing for diagnosing childhood asthma.

### Interpretation of spirometry, peak flow, and provocation testing for asthma [^111XtitB]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Spirometry plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of asthma. The hallmark spirometry finding of expiratory airflow variability can be demonstrated in several ways including peak airflow and bronchodilator and bronchoprovocation testing. Challenges of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis underscore the need to consider clinical context while interpreting these tests. A meticulous and multifaceted approach prioritizing objective testing is imperative while diagnosing asthma.

Several algorithms exist to facilitate spirometric interpretation in clinical practice, yet there is a lack of consensus on how spirometric criteria for asthma, COPD, and restrictive disorders should be incorporated into spirometry interpretation algorithms suitable for use in day-to-day primary care management. The purpose of this review was to identify and describe the variability that exists among spirometry interpretation algorithms and how this might be relevant to the interpretation of spirometric data of common conditions encountered in primary care. MEDLINE, Embase, and mainstream search engines were used to identify all English-language spirometry interpretation algorithm-related material between January 1990 and December 2018. Eight variations in spirometry interpretation algorithms were identified via specific a priori assumptions that each spirometry interpretation algorithm should contain content consistent with national and international guidelines related to spirometry interpretation. Of the 26 spirometry interpretation algorithms identified, 5 were deemed impractical for day-to-day use in primary care (19%), 23 lacked a logic string leading to the postbronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC (88%), 4 relied on postbronchodilator change in FEV 1 to distinguish between asthma and COPD (15%), 24 lacked a prompt for bronchodilator challenge when FEV 1 /FVC was considered to be at a normal level (92%), 12 did not indicate whether the data represented a prebronchodilator or postbronchodilator scenario (46%), 7 did not include a logic string that considers mixed obstructive/restrictive defect (27%), 23 did not contain a prompt to refer for methacholine challenge testing when spirometry appeared normal (88%), and 2 spirometry interpretation algorithms did not include a logic string leading to restrictive disorder (8%). Our review suggests that there is considerable variability among spirometry interpretation algorithms available as diagnostic aids and that there is a need for standardization of spirometry interpretation algorithms in primary care.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114BtFWA]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma in children 5 years and younger — tests to assist diagnosis — notes that while no tests definitively diagnose asthma with certainty, the following are useful adjuncts: a therapeutic trial for at least 2–3 months with as-needed SABA and regular low-dose ICS may provide some guidance (Evidence D), with response evaluated by symptom control and frequency of wheezing and exacerbations; marked improvement on treatment and deterioration when stopped support a diagnosis, and a trial may need repeating; allergic sensitization can be assessed by skin prick testing or allergen-specific immunoglobulin E, is present in the majority once over 3 years of age, absence does not rule out asthma, and allergic sensitization is the best predictor for development of persistent asthma; chest radiographs are rarely indicated but may help exclude alternative diagnoses when doubt exists, with other imaging as appropriate; lung function, bronchial provocation, and other physiological tests do not have a major role at this age, though by 5 years many can perform reproducible spirometry with coaching; FeNO is not widely available and remains primarily a research tool, can be measured with tidal breathing with published normal reference values for children aged 1–5 years, and in preschool children an elevated FeNO recorded 4 weeks from any URTI predicted physician-diagnosed asthma at school age and increased the odds for wheezing, asthma and ICS use by school age.

### Physiological tests of small airways function in diagnosing asthma: a systematic review [^117B8qF8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common but heterogeneous disease characterised by chronic airway inflammation and clinically defined by the presence of respiratory symptoms that vary over time and in intensity. Physiologically, asthma is characterised by variable expiratory airflow limitation which may become persistent over time. Symptoms and airflow limitation can be extremely variable, including the age of onset, triggers for symptoms, the decline in lung function and therapeutic response.

It is estimated that 339 million people are affected by asthma globallybut diagnosing asthma is often challenging as there is no gold standard test. This has led to a high burden of undiagnosed disease, especially in children and older adults. According to current guidelines, a diagnosis of asthma should be objectively supported with an assessment of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) reversibility. However, some patients with asthma have no evidence of reversibility or airflow obstructionand airflow obstruction and reversibility are seen in patients with alternative diagnoses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, the forced manoeuvres required for spirometry requires effort and coordination, which can be difficult for some individuals.

In the past, asthma was thought to only affect larger airwaysbut current evidence suggests that small airways (defined as airways of ≤ 2 mm in diameter) are affected as well. The small airways may form a site of active disease, even in the absence of airflow obstruction. If the small airways are the first to be affected in asthma, identifying small airways dysfunction (SAD) may help identify asthma earlier, enabling treatment. However, there are a large number of tests that report small airways function. Some of these are being used as secondary outcomes in experimental studies of asthma, to determine asthma phenotype and assess the response to new therapies. The evidence to support the use of any physiological test of small airways function in the diagnosis of asthma is unclear.

This systematic review aimed to assess the evidence to support the use of commonly reported physiological tests of small airways function to diagnose asthma in adults, and assess if the selected tests should be included in future clinical studies of the disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, more specifically with respect to feNO testing, NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurement as an adjunct to the evaluation process of ≥ 5 years old patients, if the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain based on history, clinical findings, clinical course, and spirometry, including bronchodilator responsiveness testing, or if spirometry cannot be performed.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115TQgF8]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Pre- or post-bronchodilator spirometry — diagnostic approach — notes that, in line with other National and International guidelines, GOLD has recommended using post-bronchodilator values when considering a diagnosis of COPD; however, it is now recognised that the bronchodilator response has little value in differentiating asthma from COPD, that pre-bronchodilator values are reproducible, and that obstruction only found on post-bronchodilator measurements is uncommon. Obtaining post-bronchodilator values is more time consuming. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry can be used as an initial test in symptomatic patients, and if it does not show obstruction, performing post-bronchodilator spirometry is not necessary unless there is a very high clinical suspicion of COPD.

### Asthma control assessment tools [^115RU2A4]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

Both the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 and the 2015 Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines identify achieving and maintaining asthma control as goals of therapy, and they emphasize periodic assessment of asthma control once treatment is established. Accurate assessment of asthma control is difficult due to the complexity of asthma control and due to the limitations in the traditional methods of assessment, such as lung function tests, physician assessment, and patients' self-assessment. Relying solely on the role of lung function tests is insufficient to reflect the status of asthma control, since patients with asthma may have normal spirometry between exacerbations. Clinicians often overestimate the level of asthma control. Similarly, it is not uncommon for patients to overestimate how well their asthma is controlled, and, therefore, they under-report asthma symptoms and fail to recognize the impact that asthma has on their daily life. As a result, several tools have been developed to quantify the level of asthma control, identify patients at risk, and evaluate the effect of asthma management. This review examines the commonly used asthma control assessment tools in terms of content, psychometric properties, methods of administration, limitations, and ability to reflect the overall status of asthma control, which can aid clinicians in selecting the most appropriate tool for their needs.

Box 7–3: Spirometric measures in asthma and COPD — reduced post-BD FEV1/FVC (< lower limit of normal, or < 0.7) indicates airflow limitation in asthma but is required for diagnosis of COPD and required for diagnosis of asthma+COPD. Post-BD increase in FEV1 ≥ 12% and 200 mL from baseline (reversible airflow limitation) is usual at some time in course of asthma but may not be present when well controlled or on ICS-containing therapy, and is common and more likely when FEV1 is low. Post-BD increase in FEV1 > 12% and 400 mL from baseline (marked reversibility) has high probability of asthma, is unusual in COPD, and is compatible with asthma+COPD.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116eJ6HV]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Refer for specialized investigations — indications for referral: Referral for expert advice and further diagnostic evaluation is advised for patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite treatment, for diagnostic uncertainty (especially if an alternative diagnosis needs to be investigated), for patients with suspected asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have atypical or additional symptoms or signs suggesting an additional pulmonary diagnosis, when chronic airways disease is suspected but syndromic features of either asthma or COPD are few, and for patients with comorbidities that may interfere with assessment and management. When atypical or additional symptoms or signs suggest an additional pulmonary diagnosis, this should prompt early referral, without waiting for a trial of treatment for asthma or COPD. Referral may also be appropriate for issues arising during ongoing management of asthma, COPD or asthma-COPD overlap, as outlined in the GINA and GOLD strategy reports.

Individuals ages 12+ years — The terms ICS-LABA and ICS-formoterol indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler. Where formoterol is specified in the steps, it is because the evidence is based on studies specific to formoterol. In individuals ages 12 years and older with persistent allergic asthma in which there is uncertainty in choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapies based on history, clinical findings, and spirometry, FeNO measurement is conditionally recommended as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy that includes frequent assessment. Bronchial thermoplasty was evaluated in Step 6. The outcome was a conditional recommendation against the therapy.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — LMIC diagnosis and confirmation: GINA does not recommend that diagnosis of asthma should be solely based on syndromic clinical patterns, and suggests lung function testing with a PEF meter if spirometry is not available. When spirometry is not available, the presence of variable expiratory airflow limitation can be confirmed by PEF, and before starting long-term ICS-containing treatment, the following investigations can help to confirm the diagnosis of asthma or prompt investigation for alternative diagnoses: ≥ 20% improvement in PEF 15 minutes after giving 2 puffs of albuterol, or improvement in symptoms and PEF after a 4-week therapeutic trial with ICS-containing treatment; either of these findings would increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of asthma versus other diagnoses. The World Health Organization (WHO) Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary care lists the PEF meter as an essential tool in the management of chronic respiratory diseases.

Differential diagnoses and diagnostic uncertainty

Misdiagnosis of asthma remains a major problem with rates of both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis being high. Overdiagnosis is problematic as it exposes children to unnecessary side effects of medications and runs the risk of trivialising asthma.

There are several conditions that may be associated with chronic cough, wheeze and/or shortness of breath in children and therefore present similarly to asthma (table 1). Due to the difficulties with diagnosis, especially in young children where objective testing is not possible, the diagnosis of asthma should be reviewed at each clinical presentation and interaction.

Table 1
Asthma differentials and clues in medical history

Diagnosing asthma in children

There is no single 'gold-standard' test that can be used to accurately diagnose asthma. In practice, a diagnosis should be made based on characteristic symptom patterns, evidence of variability in airflow limitation in the presence of airway inflammation, likelihood of alternative diagnoses and response to treatment. Getting the diagnosis correct is key for optimal management of paediatric asthma.

Lung function tests can be used to aid the diagnosis of asthma in children over the age of 5 years. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) and spirometry are commonly used to assess airflow obstruction and reversibility. PEF can be used to detect diurnal variation, which is a typical feature of asthma. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) specifically recommends the use of either PEF or spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma in children over 5 years. Once a child is old enough to reliably perform lung function testing, it is recommended that this be undertaken if the diagnosis of asthma has not been previously confirmed. In children under 5, lung function testing is rarely practical outside a research setting. This makes diagnosis in this age group additionally challenging. Guidelines vary between countries and regions with regard to diagnostic criteria. An overview of the similarities and differences between these guidelines is displayed in table 2. Lung function testing is frequently used to monitor progress of children with asthma as part of their care. Objective testing should be repeated if there is poor response to treatment or diagnostic uncertainty.

### Office spirometry in primary care for the diagnosis and management of COPD: national lung health education program update [^116f9uMp]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

The use of office spirometry was recommended by the National Lung Health Education Program (NLHEP) consensus conference in 1999 for detection and management of COPD. Since that time, spirometry utilization has increased, but its role in the diagnosis of COPD is still evolving. This update reviews the role of spirometry for screening and case finding in COPD as well as for asthma. Spirometry has been used for disease management in patients with airway obstruction, with varying results. The diagnostic criteria for COPD using spirometry have also evolved in the past 17 years, with differences arising between the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease and NLHEP recommendations. More sophisticated spirometers as well as new reference equations are widely available. Standardization guidelines from the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society published in 2005 provide a robust framework for performing and interpreting spirometry, but clinicians still need hands-on training and meaningful feedback to perform high-quality spirometry in the office setting.

### Making the diagnosis of asthma [^112rNsHe]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnostic tests can only increase or decrease the probability of the asthma diagnosis, so a thorough history is very important. In patients with asthma-like symptoms, spirometric evidence of airway obstruction plus a large bronchodilator response makes asthma much more likely. However, normal spirometry is common in patients with mild asthma who are not symptomatic at the time of testing, and patients with poorly controlled asthma may lack substantial bronchodilator response. Inhalation challenge test often helps confirm asthma in patients with normal spirometry. Adult smokers with intermittent respiratory symptoms may have either asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Normal post-bronchodilator spirometry rules out COPD. In patients with airway obstruction, a low diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide increases the probability of COPD and makes asthma much less likely. A high exhaled nitric oxide level makes allergic asthma more likely. Response to inhaled corticosteroids makes asthma more likely and COPD less likely.

### Diagnostic accuracy of FEV1 / forced vital capacity ratio z scores in asthmatic patients [^111gkcfG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio is used as a criterion for airflow obstruction; however, the test characteristics of spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma are not well established. The accuracy of a test depends on the pretest probability of disease.

Objective

We wanted to estimate the FEV1/FVC ratio z score threshold with optimal accuracy for the diagnosis of asthma for different pretest probabilities.

Methods

Asthmatic patients enrolled in 4 trials from the Asthma Clinical Research Centers were included in this analysis. Measured and predicted FEV1/FVC ratios were obtained, with calculation of z scores for each participant. Across a range of asthma prevalences and z score thresholds, the overall diagnostic accuracy was calculated.

Results

One thousand six hundred eight participants were included (mean age, 39 years; 71% female; 61% white). The mean FEV1 percent predicted value was 83% (SD, 15%). In a symptomatic population with 50% pretest probability of asthma, optimal accuracy (68%) is achieved with a z score threshold of -1.0 (16th percentile), corresponding to a 6 percentage point reduction from the predicted ratio. However, in a screening population with a 5% pretest probability of asthma, the optimum z score is -2.0 (second percentile), corresponding to a 12 percentage point reduction from the predicted ratio. These findings were not altered by markers of disease control.

Conclusion

Reduction of the FEV1/FVC ratio can support the diagnosis of asthma; however, the ratio is neither sensitive nor specific enough for diagnostic accuracy. When interpreting spirometric results, consideration of the pretest probability is an important consideration in the diagnosis of asthma based on airflow limitation.

### The clinician's guide on monitoring children with asthma [^1112eyYr]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Based on a review of the evidence on the usefulness of monitoring disease outcome parameters in childhood asthma and the author's 20-yr clinical experience in managing childhood asthma, this article provides the clinician with up-to-date recommendations on how to monitor childhood asthma in everyday clinical practice. Monitoring should be focused on patient-centered outcomes, such as exacerbations and impact on sports and play. Composite asthma control measures, although reasonably validated, do not take exacerbations into account and have a short recall window, limiting their usefulness as a routine monitoring tool in clinical practice. Lung function, airways hyperresponsiveness, exhaled nitric oxide, and inflammatory markers in sputum are surrogate end points, of little if any interest to patients. There is no evidence to support their use as a monitoring tool in clinical practice; office spirometry may be used as additional information. Rather than monitoring surrogate end points, clinicians should focus on showing a genuine interest in the impact of asthma on children's daily lives, and building and maintaining a partnership by monitoring those characteristics of asthma which have the biggest impact on children (exacerbations and limitations in sports and play), and adjusting treatment accordingly.

### Diagnosis of asthma in symptomatic children based on measures of lung function: an analysis of data from a population-based birth cohort study [^111FE8eF]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma remains the most common chronic disease of childhood, with 1.1 million children in the UK currently receiving treatment. Because of the absence of gold standard tests to confirm or refute asthma, most guidelines concur that asthma is a clinical diagnosis based on a characteristic pattern of symptoms and signs in the absence of an alternative explanation. A careful reassessment of a large Canadian cohort of 613 adults with a recent diagnosis of asthma ruled out the diagnosis in a third of those assessed. This finding probably represents a combination of asthma remission and overdiagnosis, but in 2% of the population analysed an alternative serious cardiorespiratory disorder was diagnosed. Because of concerns about overdiagnosis (and underdiagnosis), on behalf of the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), experts have developed comprehensive guidance on the diagnosis of asthma incorporating objective tests, which are yet to be implemented (figure 1). Despite the accompanying review highlighting the paucity of evidence in children for the use of lung function measures in the diagnosis of asthma (table 1), the interim reportproposes a diagnostic algorithm for use in primary care in children with symptoms. The algorithm incorporates the sequential use of four measures of lung function and inflammation, each applied as a dichotomous variable: first, spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV 1] and forced vital capacity [FVC]) expressed as a ratio FEV 1 :FVC; second, bronchodilator reversibility; third, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FNO); and fourth, peak flow variability. For both adults and children, spirometry is the first-line investigation; baseline FEV 1 is not included, but rather the FEV 1 :FVC ratio, with the proposed cutoff for a positive test being an FEV 1 :FVC ratio of less than 70% or of less than the lower limit of normal if this is known for children. Bronchodilator reversibility is done only if the FEV 1 :FVC ratio is less than 70%, and deemed positive if FEV 1 improves by 12% or more from baseline; children positive to both tests can be diagnosed with asthma. If bronchodilator reversibility is negative, both a FNO of 35 or more parts per billion and more than 20% variability in peak expiratory flow measured over 2–4 weeks is required to diagnose asthma (ie, three positive tests are needed). For children with normal spirometry (FEV 1 :FVC ≥ 70%), bronchodilator reversibility testing is not done, but both a FNO of 35 or more parts per billion and a more than 20% peak flow variability is required for an asthma diagnosis. Children with other combinations of results should be referred to a specialist for opinion, be reviewed in 6 weeks with repeat tests, or have other diagnoses considered.

### Spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma in children [^112PQpUZ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the diagnostic accuracy of lung function measurements made using spirometry for childhood asthma, recent guidelines for the measurement and interpretation of spirometric lung function tests and recent developments for diagnosing asthma.

Recent Findings

Measurements of lung function and bronchial lability made using spirometry may not perform any better than other tests such as skin prick testing, or measurements of exhaled nitric oxide for diagnosing asthma. New guidelines are available.

Summary

Spirometry is a simple, robust and widely available tool for investigating lung function. There are published guidelines for making measurements and their interpretation. The place of spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma, however, needs clarification. The diagnostic profiles of measurements of bronchodilator responsiveness and bronchial hyperreactivity made using spirometry, although reasonable, are not perfect. In schoolchildren, they are no better than knowledge of aeroallergen sensitization when considering a diagnosis of asthma.

### Confirmatory spirometry for adults hospitalized with a diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [^113XjA2K]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the most common obstructive lung diseases, account for more than one million hospitalizations and nearly six million hospital days each year in the US alone. Readmission rates at 30 days, following hospitalization for asthma and COPD exacerbations, are approximately 10% and 20%, respectively. Readmission rates at 90-days in patients with COPD exacerbations are estimated to be about 35%. In-hospital mortality for patients admitted with asthma or COPD exacerbations ranges from 0.2% to 38%; higher mortality rates correspond to populations with a greater acuity of illness, including those requiring mechanical ventilation. The economic burden from these hospitalizations and re-admissions is enormous; annual direct costs are estimated to be $16 billion, representing more than 30% of the total medical care costs for these two conditions.

Studies performed using International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, (ICD-9) billing codes or physician-documented diagnosis to identify the study population, indicate that up to 50% of patients hospitalized with asthma or COPD exacerbations do not receive guideline recommended care. In a previous study using chart abstraction, we found that relying on ICD-9 billing codes may lead to overdiagnosis of COPD exacerbations in up to 25% of patients, potentially because confirmatory testing (e.g. spirometry) to document obstructive lung disease is rarely performed. To our knowledge, similar data on asthma exacerbations is not available. Objective measurement of expiratory airflow obstruction is considered essential to the diagnosis of asthma and COPD, as other diseases can present with similar symptoms. A recently completed audit of patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbations found substantial variations in care, with spirometry prior to hospital admissions available in only about three-quarters of patients. While confirmatory spirometry is recommended by the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society guidelines to establish a diagnosis of asthma or COPD, is not routinely performed during hospitalizations for exacerbations, due to concerns about its feasibility (e.g. inadequate test quality) and a lack of data supporting its utility.

### Don't diagnose or manage asthma without spirometry.… [^113AoLag]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinicians often rely solely upon symptoms when diagnosing and managing asthma, but these symptoms may be misleading and be from alternate causes. Therefore, spirometry is essential to confirm the diagnosis in those patients who can perform this procedure. Recent guidelines highlight spirometry's value in stratifying disease severity and monitoring control. History and physical exam alone may over- or underestimate asthma control. Beyond the increased costs of care, repercussions of misdiagnosing asthma include delaying a correct diagnosis and treatment.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^1122rhJL]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is one of the most frequent reasons children visit a general practitioner (GP). The diagnosis of childhood asthma is challenging, and a variety of diagnostic tests for asthma exist. GPs may refer to clinical practice guidelines when deciding which tests, if any, are appropriate, but the quality of these guidelines is unknown.

Objectives

To determine (i) the methodological quality and reporting of paediatric guidelines for the diagnosis of childhood asthma in primary care, and (ii) the strength of evidence supporting diagnostic test recommendations.

Design

Meta-epidemiological study of English-language guidelines from the United Kingdom and other high-income countries with comparable primary care systems including diagnostic testing recommendations for childhood asthma in primary care. The AGREE-II tool was used to assess the quality and reporting of the guidelines. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Results

Eleven guidelines met the eligibility criteria. The methodology and reporting quality varied across the AGREE II domains (median score 4.5 out of 7, range 2–6). The quality of evidence supporting diagnostic recommendations was generally of very low quality. All guidelines recommended the use of spirometry and reversibility testing for children aged ≥ 5 years, however, the recommended spirometry thresholds for diagnosis differed across guidelines. There were disagreements in testing recommendations for 3 of the 7 included tests.

Conclusions

The variable quality of guidelines, lack of good quality evidence, and inconsistent recommendations for diagnostic tests may contribute to poor clinician adherence to guidelines and variation in testing for diagnosing childhood asthma.

### Asthma end points and outcomes: what have we learned? [^116YavZg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

In spite of the wide prevalence of asthma and its substantial consequences, the diagnosis and assessment of asthma has not been standardized, and the goals of therapy currently are not being achieved. Our purpose is to help delineate what the most important asthma end points are and what kinds of strategies we should use to guide therapy. Comparison of numerous studies reveals that asthma measures used routinely in the clinic, such as spirometric lung function, do not uniformly correlate with asthma control. We cannot improve outcomes until we determine which measures reveal the underlying disease process most clearly and at the same time offer ease of performance during routine office visits. We propose that by standardizing the way we collect and analyze data from our daily practice, we can better define which measures reflect true asthma control. Such measures most likely address a spectrum of changes occurring in the pathophysiology of asthma, notably distal airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. Inflammation may provide the best opportunity for assessment and treatment, because if it is adequately addressed, airway sensitivity may improve, thereby reducing airway obstruction and subsequently minimizing exacerbations. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide as a measure of inflammation is suggested as offering the best combination of disease evaluation and practical implementation for improved asthma outcomes.

### Confirmatory spirometry for adults hospitalized with a diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [^113ofDXe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Recent studies of spirometry in the primary care setting have shown that up to 50% of patients with a physician diagnosis of COPD did not meet the criteria for the diagnosis by spirometry. Similarly, a recent study showed that more than 30% of patients with a physician diagnosis of stable asthma did not meet the criteria for the diagnosis when tested with a combination of spirometry and methacholine challenge test. To our knowledge, the present report is the first study to evaluate the frequency of misclassification among hospitalized patients with a physician diagnosis of asthma exacerbation.

Additionally, we found that the lack of evidence for obstructive lung disease was four times more common in obese vs. non-obese participants. Our findings in hospitalized patients are consistent with results observed in a study of outpatients in a primary care setting that identified higher rates of misclassification for COPD in overweight or obese patients. Similarly, previous studies have suggested that overweight or obese patients may be over-diagnosed as having asthma. For example, one study reported that nearly 1 in 3 overweight or obese subjects diagnosed with asthma do not actually have airway hyperresponsiveness. Other studies, including some in obese patients, found that medical history and physical examination findings may not be sufficiently reliable to diagnose obstructive lung disease. Other data suggest that vocal cord dysfunction may mimic an asthma exacerbation, which may help explain why some spirometry tracings had evidence of variable extrathoracic airflow obstruction. In our study, we found that some patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of asthma or COPD exacerbation presented spirometry tracings suggestive of restrictive (not obstructive) lung disease. Thus, together with previously published evidence, our findings suggest that a range of conditions may be contributing to respiratory symptoms diagnosed as asthma or COPD exacerbations.

### Diagnostic differentiation between asthma and COPD in primary care using lung function testing [^115Raemb]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we looked at which patient characteristics distinguish between patients diagnosed with asthma or COPD, and established the added value of spirometry and of more advanced lung function measurements when differentiating between the two chronic airways diseases. Although asthma and COPD are both heterogenous conditions with multiple overlapping features, there are important clinical differences as well. We observed that in the scenario using only medical history questions, it is already possible to reliably distinguish between asthma and COPD. The most important factors to aid differentiation are smoking behaviour, certain respiratory symptoms and the presence of allergies. The use of postbronchodilator spirometry provided important additional discriminative power in correctly labelling a patient as having asthma or COPD. More advanced diagnostic tests that are mainly used in secondary care, such as measuring bronchial hyperresponsiveness and diffusion capacity, did not provide a better differentiation in this primary care study population.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: evaluation and management of asthma in the elderly [^115bdX5g]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2016). Medium credibility.

Physiologic tests and biomarkers for diagnosis and management of elderly patients with asthma emphasize that "Many of the same tests used in younger patients with asthma are useful to characterize AIE", and that "Spirometry and airway reactivity measurements are first-line methods for diagnosing and monitoring AIE". Evidence indicates "lower FEV1 and more severe airflow limitation in older patients with asthma", and that "Bronchoprovocation testing can detect airway reactivity in older as in younger patients", with older patients showing "more peripheral airway closure during bronchoconstriction (measured by the reduction in FVC)" than younger patients. When interpreting results, "age-adjusted values are essential, particularly when interpreting the FEV1/FVC ratio, to avoid overdiagnosing respiratory impairment", and although predicted values are available for the elderly, "data for nonwhite individuals and for those older than 75 years are sparse". Testing is limited because these are "effort-dependent maneuvers", and studies show "80% or more of older persons can achieve ATS-acceptable spirometry", though "this may be hard for some frail".

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^111rLE4B]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma — use cases, limitations, and operational considerations for FeNO testing: FeNO testing has a supportive role in evaluation when the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain, and individuals who may benefit include those aged 5 years and older who have an uncertain diagnosis of asthma and those in whom spirometry testing cannot be performed accurately. Because the data on the diagnostic accuracy of FeNO measurement in children younger than 4 years are not conclusive, FeNO measurement in this age group should not be used. FeNO test results should not be used alone to diagnose asthma; FeNO measurements can serve as an adjunct test when the results of a thorough clinical assessment, including other appropriate tests, are inconclusive. FeNO measurements should be performed by appropriately trained personnel, FeNO testing can be performed in primary or specialty care settings, and the costs of testing may prohibit adoption in the primary care office setting; recognition of allergen sensitivity is extremely important for interpreting FeNO levels because allergic rhinitis and atopy are associated with increased FeNO levels.

### Detecting small airways dysfunction in asthma: rationale, findings, and future of ATLANTIS [^111kKS3Y]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Small airway dysfunction (SAD) is both common and clinically relevant in patients with asthma. However, there is no recognized 'gold standard' approach for the identification of SAD in clinical practice. The ATLANTIS (AssessmenT of smalL Airways involvemeNT In aSthma) study was a prospective (1 year follow-up), multi-center, international observational study that aimed to identify the best, or best combination of biomarkers, physiological tests, and imaging markers for the determination of the presence of SAD, and to evaluate the contribution of SAD across all asthma severities to meaningful clinical asthma outcomes. A large number of analyses from the ATLANTIS study have been conducted or are planned. This narrative review summarizes the key findings to date and the future directions. Perhaps the most important finding so far is that a 'toolbox' of spirometry, oscillometry, and a small airways dysfunction questionnaire can detect SAD with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.96, positive likelihood ratio 12.8). Further, collaboration with other consortia has demonstrated the use of oscillometry to identify asthma phenotypes. We advocate the adoption of the ATLANTIS toolbox into interventional studies in asthma - and if validated, this could form a useful part of research and daily clinical practice.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112HHJDS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — bronchodilator responsiveness thresholds for diagnosis — states that in adults with respiratory symptoms typical of asthma, an increase or decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL from baseline, or if spirometry is not available a change in peak expiratory flow (PEF) of at least 20%, is accepted as being consistent with asthma. A Technical Standards Committee recommended changing the criterion for a positive bronchodilator responsiveness test from an increase from baseline in FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) of ≥ 12% and > 200 mL to an increase from baseline of > 10% of the patient's predicted value; this recommendation was based on data for survival, and the Technical Standards Committee avoided making any recommendation about the use of this criterion for diagnostic decisions in clinical practice.

Diagnosis confirmation in suspected difficult-to-treat asthma — spirometry, thresholds, and bronchodilator withholding: Confirmation of the diagnosis is important, because in 12–50% of people assumed to have severe asthma, asthma is not found to be the correct diagnosis; perform spirometry, before and after bronchodilator, to assess baseline lung function and seek objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, and if initial bronchodilator responsiveness testing is negative (≤ 200 mL or ≤ 12% increase in FEV1), consider repeating after withholding bronchodilators or when symptomatic or stepping controller treatment before further investigations such as bronchial provocation testing; check full flow-volume curve to assess for upper airway obstruction; if spirometry is normal or is not available, provide a peak flow meter and diary and consider bronchial provocation testing if able to withhold bronchodilators (short-acting beta2 agonist [SABA] for at least 6 hours, LABA for up to 2 days depending on duration of action).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111aC4up]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Lung function testing is essential — use lung function testing to confirm the presence of persistent expiratory airflow limitation and variable expiratory airflow limitation. Spirometry is preferably performed at the initial assessment; in cases of clinical urgency it may be delayed to a subsequent visit, but confirmation of diagnosis may be more difficult once patients are started on ICS-containing therapy. Early confirmation (or exclusion) of the presence of persistent expiratory airflow limitation may avoid needless trials of therapy or delays in initiating other investigations. Measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) on the same meter over a period of 1–2 weeks may help to confirm reversible airflow limitation and the diagnosis of asthma by demonstrating excessive variability; however, PEF is not as reliable as spirometry, and a normal PEF does not rule out either asthma or COPD. Consider alternative diagnoses; the above approach to diagnosis does not replace the need for a full assessment to first exclude non-respiratory diagnoses such as heart failure, and physical examination may provide supportive information.

### What is the best pulmonary diagnostic approach for wheezing patients with normal spirometry? [^1147h6Tf]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and variable air flow obstruction. The diagnosis of asthma, however, is often based upon nonspecific clinical symptoms of cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath. Furthermore, the physical examination and measurements of pulmonary function are often unremarkable in patients with asthma, thereby complicating the diagnosis of the disease. The following discussion will review approaches to the diagnosis of asthma when lung functions are normal, and will largely focus on the use of bronchial provocation tests to detect underlying AHR.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^113d5NE3]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Post-bronchodilator spirometry and reversibility testing — practice guidance: Post-bronchodilator spirometry is required for the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, but assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction (e.g., measuring FEV1 before and after bronchodilator or corticosteroids) to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended because the degree of reversibility in a single patient varies over time and has not been shown to differentiate the diagnosis from asthma or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids; accordingly, it is not necessary to stop inhaled medication before obtaining spirometry measurements during follow-up of patients.

### The definition and diagnosis of asthma [^117NwXa1]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of asthma depends on what we mean by the word. Its definition continues to be controversial because there is no single genetic or environmental cause. Addressed from a descriptive point of view, the disease components include airway inflammation, symptoms, variable airflow limitation and chronic airflow limitation. The essentialist definition conveys the message that asthma is a separate disease entity, fails to identify a primary defining characteristic which separates it from other diseases and is long winded. These disadvantages are overcome by the nominalist definition of asthma in which the word 'asthma'refers to an abnormality of airway function, specifically to wide variations in airflow limitation over short periods of time. In patients with asthma the other components of airway disease need to be considered. These have separate nominalist definitions and especially include different types of bronchitis for airway inflammation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for chronic airflow limitation. What is present will vary between and within patients. The accurate diagnosis of asthma and of other components of disease all require objective measurements. Currently spirometry and airway responsiveness should be available to the general practitioner, who sees milder disease, and additional quantitative sputum cell counts in specialist practice, where moderate to severe disease is more prevalent. Such measurements characterize the patient, identify heterogeneity and allow treatment to be personalized.

### Asthma diagnosis using patient-reported outcome measures and objective diagnostic tests: now and into the future [^111bZLC5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The global prevalence of asthma continues to increase; however, asthma remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. This results in a significant burden on the healthcare system and preventable patient morbidity and mortality. Over-diagnosis of asthma based on clinical history alone also complicates patient management. This heightens the importance of a prompt and accurate asthma diagnosis. Therefore, a review of the literature was performed regarding both objective diagnostic testing for asthma and using patient-reported outcome measures.

Recent Findings

The cornerstone of asthma diagnosis remains spirometry with testing for bronchodilator reversibility testing for pediatric and adult populations. This test may need to be repeated at multiple time points due to its low sensitivity. Peak flow measurement, fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing, and allergy testing are useful adjuncts to the diagnosis and phenotyping of asthma. Bronchoprovocation testing is reserved for people with high clinical suspicion for asthma, but negative spirometry. Novel noninvasive testing modalities may play a diagnostic role in the future. The advent of remote digital health monitoring technology has resulted in revisiting patient-reported outcome measures for the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma.

Summary

Overall, improved diagnostic tools for asthma are crucial for earlier recognition and treatment of the disease and improved patient care outcomes worldwide.

### A stepwise approach to the interpretation of pulmonary function tests [^117AGe3D]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Office-based pulmonary function testing, also known as spirometry, is a powerful tool for primary care physicians to diagnose and manage respiratory problems. An obstructive defect is indicated by a low forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio, which is defined as less than 70% or below the fifth percentile based on data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) in adults, and less than 85% in patients five to 18 years of age. If an obstructive defect is present, the physician should determine if the disease is reversible based on the increase in FEV1 or FVC after bronchodilator treatment (i.e., increase of more than 12% in patients five to 18 years of age, or more than 12% and more than 200 mL in adults). Asthma is typically reversible, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not. A restrictive pattern is indicated by an FVC below the fifth percentile based on NHANES III data in adults, or less than 80% in patients five to 18 years of age. If a restrictive pattern is present, full pulmonary function tests with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide testing should be ordered to confirm restrictive lung disease and form a differential diagnosis. If both the FEV1/FVC ratio and the FVC are low, the patient has a mixed defect. The severity of the abnormality is determined by the FEV1 (percentage of predicted). If pulmonary function test results are normal, but the physician still suspects exercise- or allergen-induced asthma, bronchoprovocation (e.g., methacholine challenge, mannitol inhalation challenge, exercise testing) should be considered.

### Novel measure of lung function for assessing disease activity in asthma [^113jRB51]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Key messages

In asthma, spirometric measurements associated with airways resistance are often discordant with other clinical features of disease activity or control.

This study demonstrates that a novel technology measuring the evenness of lung expansion and contraction can reflect these clinical features better than spirometry.

A reliable, objective measure of disease activity in asthma would be very valuable for both patient management and clinical research.

### Classifying asthma severity: objective versus subjective measures [^113ecXUM]. The Journal of Asthma (2007). Low credibility.

National guidelines recommend the use of clinical history and spirometry to determine asthma severity. We examined the usefulness of the six guideline-recommended clinical questions in determining asthma severity and then compared guideline-determined severity to clinician-reported and spirometry-determined severity in a cross-sectional study of 201 children with asthma who were not receiving controller therapy. Four guideline-recommended questions (daytime and nocturnal symptoms, school absenteeism, and exercise impairment) determined asthma severity. Concordance between clinician-reported and spirometry-determined asthma severity was poor (kappa = 0.02). Clinical history alone underestimated spirometry-determined disease severity in 27% of children while spirometry results alone underestimated clinician-determined severity in 40% of children.

### Confirmatory spirometry for adults hospitalized with a diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [^111juC6t]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of data about the feasibility of measuring lung function in hospitalized patients suspected of having an asthma or COPD exacerbation. A recent single-hospital study by Rea and colleagues found that spirometry, performed upon hospital discharge, can serve as a baseline against which post-discharge measurements can be compared. However, we are not aware of studies that have specifically examined the quality of spirometry tests obtained early in the course of hospitalizations for patients with COPD or asthma exacerbations and their utility in confirming the presence of obstructive lung disease.

Rea and colleagues also showed that approximately 16% of patients hospitalized with COPD exacerbations did not meet the GOLD criteria for COPD by spirometry on hospital discharge. Data about the prevalence of patients with a physician diagnosis of an asthma exacerbation but in whom spirometry fails to confirm obstructive lung disease (i.e. overdiagnosis) are lacking.

To address these gaps in knowledge, we conducted a multi-center study in adults hospitalized with a physician diagnosis of asthma or COPD exacerbation to: a) evaluate the quality of spirometry tracings; and b) assess the utility of confirmatory spirometry for the presence of obstructive lung disease in patients hospitalized with a physician diagnosis of asthma or COPD exacerbation. The findings reported in this study may help determine the need for confirmatory testing in clinical care setting, or as part of quality improvement efforts, such as pay-for-performance, in adults hospitalized with a physician diagnosis of asthma or COPD exacerbation.

Lung function documentation and when to seek specialist advice: Airflow limitation may be present in patients with long-standing asthma, due to remodeling of the airway walls, or limited lung development in childhood, so it is important to document lung function when the diagnosis of asthma is first made, and specialist advice should be obtained if the history is suggestive of asthma but the diagnosis cannot be confirmed by spirometry.

### How to interpret spirometry in a child with suspected asthma [^114EsxGd]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic disorders of childhood. The typical symptoms are a result of reversible airway obstruction. There is no 'gold-standard' test to diagnose asthma, but the most commonly used investigation to help with a diagnosis is spirometry. This article outlines some of the technical aspects of spirometry together with how the forced expiration manoeuver and bronchodilator responsiveness testing can be performed and interpreted in a child with suspected asthma.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spirometry in primary care [^1135HjLy]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

COPD can be estimated with high diagnostic accuracy using spirometry. It is also possible to rule in asthma with spirometry. However, asthma can not be ruled out only using spirometry. This diagnostic uncertainty leads to an overestimation of asthma presence. Patients with inconclusive spirometric results should be referred for NO – measurement and/or bronchial provocation if possible to guarantee accurate diagnosis.

### Office spirometry: indications and interpretation [^117NCPzZ]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

High-quality, office-based spirometry provides diagnostic information as useful and reliable as testing performed in a pulmonary function laboratory. Spirometry may be used to monitor progression of lung disease and response to therapy. A stepwise approach to spirometry allows for ease and reliability of interpretation. Airway obstruction is suspected when there is a decreased forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio, but there is no strong evidence to clearly define what constitutes a significant decrease in this ratio. A low FVC is defined as a value below the 5th percentile in adults or less than 80% of predicted in children and adolescents five to 18 years of age. The FEV1/FVC ratio and FVC are used together to identify obstructive defects and restrictive or mixed patterns. Obstructive defects should be assessed for reversibility, as indicated by an improvement of the FEV1 or FVC by at least 12% and 0.2 L in adults, or by more than 12% in children and adolescents five to 18 years of age after the administration of a short-acting bronchodilator. FEV1 is used to determine the severity of obstructive and restrictive disease, although the values were arbitrarily determined and are not based on evidence from patient outcomes. Bronchoprovocation testing may be used if spirometry results are normal and allergen- or exercise-induced asthma is suspected. For patients with an FEV1 less than 70% of predicted, a therapeutic trial of a short-acting bronchodilator may be tried instead of bronchoprovocation testing.

Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) interpretation — during symptoms, if FEV1 is within the predicted normal range this reduces the probability that symptoms are due to asthma; however, patients whose baseline FEV1 is > 80% predicted can have a clinically important increase in lung function with bronchodilator or ICS-containing treatment, and the patient's own best reading ('personal best') is recommended as their 'normal' value.

### The role of objective tests to support a diagnosis of asthma in children [^115VpHzd]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

In many healthcare settings asthma in children is a clinical diagnosis based on parental reported symptoms. These include intermittent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness and periodic nocturnal dry cough. Increased symptoms often coincide with colds. Confirming a diagnosis of asthma in children can be difficult and recent reports highlight that misdiagnosis, including over- and under-diagnosis of asthma are common. Recent UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend diagnostic algorithms for children from five years and adults to support a clinical suspicion of asthma. Spirometry, bronchodilator reversibility and fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing are the first line tests to diagnose asthma in children. The introduction of these tests across all healthcare settings has the potential to reduce misdiagnosis, improve asthma management and reduce healthcare spending for asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1148j9QB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — diagnosis in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years: The diagnosis of asthma is based on the history of characteristic symptom patterns and evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, which should be documented from bronchodilator reversibility testing or other tests, and more than one test may be needed to confirm asthma or exclude alternative causes of respiratory symptoms. Many health professionals do not have access to spirometry; if so, peak expiratory flow (PEF) should be used, rather than relying on symptoms alone. Test before treating, wherever possible, i.e., document the evidence for the diagnosis of asthma before starting inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment, as it is often more difficult to confirm the diagnosis once asthma control has improved, and additional or alternative strategies may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of asthma in particular populations including patients already on ICS-containing treatment, the elderly, patients presenting with cough as the only symptom (including cough variant asthma), and patients in low-resource settings.

### Spirometry can be done in family physicians' offices and alters clinical decisions in management of asthma and COPD [^1156vyjU]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Spirometry is recommended for diagnosis and management of obstructive lung disease. While many patients with asthma and COPD are cared for by primary care practices, limited data are available on the use and results associated with spirometry in primary care.

Object

To assess the technical adequacy, accuracy of interpretation, and impact of office spirometry.

Design

A before-and-after quasiexperimental design.

Setting

Three hundred eighty-two patients from 12 family medicine practices across the United States.

Participants

Patients with asthma and COPD, and staff from the 12 practices.

Measurements

Technical adequacy of spirometry results, concordance between family physician and pulmonary expert interpretations of spirometry test results, and changes in asthma and COPD management following spirometry testing.

Results

Of the 368 tests completed over the 6 months, 71% were technically adequate for interpretation. Family physician and pulmonary expert interpretations were concordant in 76% of completed tests. Spirometry was followed by changes in management in 48% of subjects with completed tests, including 107 medication changes (> 85% concordant with guideline recommendations) and 102 nonpharmacologic changes. Concordance between family physician and expert interpretations of spirometry results was higher in those patients with asthma compared to those with COPD.

Discussion and Conclusions

US family physicians can perform and interpret spirometry for asthma and COPD patients at rates comparable to those published in the literature for international primary care studies, and the spirometry results modify care.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113WFRcb]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — lung function testing to document variable expiratory airflow limitation — notes that lung function is most reliably assessed by spirometry testing with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the FEV1/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). Spirometry testing should be carried out by well-trained operators with well-maintained and regularly calibrated equipment, with an inline filter to protect against transmission of infection. When spirometry is unavailable, peak expiratory flow (PEF), although less reliable, is better than no objective measurement; if PEF is used, the best of 3 measurements should be used each time, and the same meter should be used for follow-up testing, as measurements may differ from meter to meter by up to 20%. Responsiveness refers to rapid improvements in FEV1 or PEF within minutes after a rapid-acting bronchodilator such as 200–400 mcg salbutamol, or more sustained improvement over days or weeks after introduction of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment. In patients with typical or suggestive respiratory symptoms, obtaining evidence of excessive variability in expiratory lung function is an essential component of diagnosis, with examples including an increase in lung function 10–15 minutes after a bronchodilator or after a trial of ICS-containing treatment; lung function may improve gradually, so it should be assessed after at least 4 weeks, a decrease in lung function after exercise or during a bronchial provocation test, and variation beyond the normal range on repeated measurements, including on twice-daily home monitoring over at least 1–2 weeks; a decrease in FEV1 or PEF during a respiratory infection does not necessarily indicate asthma.

### Objective monitoring tools for improved management of childhood asthma [^113nDR6p]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently, multiple clinical studies demonstrated the effectiveness of using subjective monitoring tools in conjunction with objective monitoring tools to assess asthma control, such as spirometry (e.g. forced expiration volume in one second, FEV 1 and forced vital volume, FVC), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), bronchial hyperresponsiveness tests. Guidelines have also been updated and recommended that objective monitoring tools, such as spirometry and FeNO measurements, may be used in conjunction to guide asthma preventive treatment in children. However, no gold standard is available, and the tools used in clinical settings differ between guidelines. Therefore, this review aims to summarise the existing objective monitoring tools and their effectiveness in paediatric asthma management.

### Confirmatory spirometry for adults hospitalized with a diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [^111AJYBw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Objective measurement of airflow obstruction by spirometry is an essential part of the diagnosis of asthma or COPD. During exacerbations, the feasibility and utility of spirometry to confirm the diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are unclear. Addressing these gaps in knowledge may help define the need for confirmatory testing in clinical care and quality improvement efforts. This study was designed to determine the feasibility of spirometry and to determine its utility to confirm the diagnosis in patients hospitalized with a physician diagnosis of asthma or COPD exacerbation.

Methods

Multi-center study of four academic healthcare institutions. Spirometry was performed in 113 adults admitted to general medicine wards with a physician diagnosis of asthma or COPD exacerbation. Two board-certified pulmonologists evaluated the spirometry tracings to determine the proportion of patients able to produce adequate quality spirometry data. Findings were interpreted to evaluate the utility of spirometry to confirm the presence of obstructive lung disease, according to the 2005 European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society recommendations.

Results

There was an almost perfect agreement for acceptability (κ = 0.92) and reproducibility (κ = 0.93) of spirometry tracings. Three-quarters (73%) of the tests were interpreted by both pulmonologists as being of adequate quality. Of these adequate quality tests, 22% did not present objective evidence of obstructive lung disease. Obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) were more likely to produce spirometry tracings with no evidence of obstructive lung disease, compared to non-obese patients (33% vs. 8%, p = 0.007).

Conclusions

Adequate quality spirometry can be obtained in most hospitalized adults with a physician diagnosis of asthma or COPD exacerbation. Confirmatory spirometry could be a useful tool to help reduce overdiagnosis of obstructive lung disease, especially among obese patients.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115spWrp]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — diagnostic flowchart for adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years in clinical practice outlines an approach for patients presenting with chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms in clinical practice. The algorithm begins by asking "Are symptoms typical of asthma?", then evaluates objective testing feasibility with "Is spirometry or peak expiratory flow (PEF) available and feasible?" and directs to "Perform lung function test(s) as in Box 1–2, e.g. spirometry or PEF before and after bronchodilator" to determine whether "Is variable expiratory airflow limitation confirmed?". A branch conducts "Further history and tests for alternative diagnoses" with "Is alternative diagnosis confirmed?", leading to "Treat for alternative diagnosis" when confirmed. If other diagnoses are unlikely, it advises to "treat empirically with ICS-containing treatment (Boxes 4–5 & 4–11)", then "Review response in 1–3 months, including PEF or spirometry if available" and, if improved, "Treat for asthma with ICS-containing treatment See Boxes 4–5 & 4–11". The footnote states that "Peak expiratory flow (PEF) is less reliable than spirometry, but it is better than having no objective measurement of lung function", and that readings "may vary by up to 20% between different meters" and to use "only the highest of three readings".

Clinical questions

Can the test be used to diagnose asthma? Is FeNO more accurate than spirometry or peak flow diaries?

Asthma is a clinical diagnosis and as a result, there is no single diagnostic test. NICE guidelines recommend that for children under 5 years with suspected asthma, their symptoms should be treated according to clinical judgement and have regular reviews. Once they reach 5 years, symptomatic children should undergo objective testing, including spirometry, bronchodilator reversibility or FeNO testing.

Asthma can be diagnosed if the patient has symptoms suggestive of asthma and a FeNO level of ≥ 35 ppb with positive peak flow variability or obstructive spirometry with positive bronchodilator reversibility (table 2). In children, a FeNO level of ≥ 35 ppb makes asthma (and a response to ICS) very likely.

Current guidance advocating serial monitoring (peak flow readings or spirometry) to confirm diagnosis may miss mild asthma as abnormal airway physiology may be undetectable, suggesting these tests used serially have a low sensitivity.

Research has shown that the predictive values for FeNO are higher than that of traditional diagnostic methods. Table 3 below summarises the diagnostic accuracy of FeNO compared with traditional methods.

### Can measures of small airway dysfunction aid with the diagnosis or management of asthma exacerbations? A systematic review [^113RM5af]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

The findings of this systematic review suggest that small airway function tests are feasible during exacerbations and may aid in monitoring improvement. However, given that small airway function was not a primary outcome in most included studies and the limited number of RCTs, the evidence remains inconclusive regarding their added value over traditional lung function measures. More research is needed to determine which tests, if any, provide clinically meaningful information and whether small airway dysfunction during exacerbations is consistent across all asthma patients or varies by specific phenotypes. Previous studies have highlighted the role of small airways in asthma heterogeneity, with evidence suggesting that small airway dysfunction is present across multiple asthma subtypes and may be associated with worse disease outcomes.

Incorporating these tests into clinical practice could provide a more comprehensive assessment of airway function, particularly in patients whose symptoms are not adequately reflected by traditional spirometry. Small airway function tests may facilitate earlier detection of exacerbations, allowing for timely intervention or the development of new interventions if incorporated into clinical trials. This could potentially reduce the severity and duration of exacerbations, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Tests like IOS that do not require forced breathing manoeuvres are easier for patients to perform, especially during exacerbations. This can improve patient compliance and the reliability of test results, thereby enhancing clinical decision-making.

Despite the promising findings, several limitations need to be addressed. The heterogeneity in study designs, patient populations and outcome measures poses challenges in generalising the results. Additionally, small airway function tests exhibit variability in measurement techniques, with differences in device calibration, reference equations and interpretation thresholds leading to inconsistencies across studies. Moreover, the availability of small airway function tests in routine clinical practice remains limited, and their cost-effectiveness needs further evaluation.

Furthermore, while alternative spirometric measures such as FEV₃ and FEV₆ have been proposed for early airflow limitation detection, their clinical relevance in asthma and exacerbation settings remains under investigation. They were not included in this review due to limited validation and lack of standardised reference ranges

Addressing these challenges through large-scale studies could pave the way for a more nuanced understanding and management of asthma exacerbations. Developing standardised protocols for test administration and interpretation will be crucial for their widespread adoption. Integrating these tests with existing diagnostic frameworks could facilitate earlier detection of exacerbations and potentially improve patient outcomes by allowing for timely interventions.

### Ascertainment of small airways dysfunction using oscillometry to better define asthma control and future risk: are we ready to implement It in clinical practice? [^1141VPwe]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The evidence suggests a clear advantage for including airway oscillometry into clinical practice for more accurate assessment, prediction of those at risk of deterioration, and management decision guidance. Clinicians would benefit from greater knowledge in terms of advantages and limitations to prescribe and interpret oscillometry. Further studies are ongoing to investigate the additive value of oscillometry to conventional spirometry and F. If a patient is not clinically responding to therapy despite normal spirometry, this is a strong indication for oscillometry. We recommend that oscillometry be considered for use in specialized care and community practice.

Current challenges in asthma diagnosis

Asthma is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome. While we now begin to understand the mechanisms driving some of the asthma phenotypes and endotypes, our knowledge remains limited, impeding accurate asthma definition and diagnosis. In spite of this complexity, the clinical features of asthma include (some or all of) reversible airflow obstruction, airway inflammation and bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR). All the currently available diagnostic tests are aimed at demonstrating one or more of these features. Peak expiratory flow (PEF), lung function and reversibility tests demonstrate airflow obstruction and variability, bronchoprovocation challenges examine BHR. Fe NO, allergic sensitisation tests (skin prick test and immunoglobulin E (IgE)) and serum/sputum eosinophil counts are inflammatory biomarkers. In addition to clinical symptoms, an asthma diagnosis should be supported by objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction or inflammation, yet there is no single 'gold-standard' test. Adding to the challenge, national clinical guidelines have published somewhat conflicting recommendations, causing much concern among healthcare professionals. In a population-based birth cohort study, the asthma diagnostic algorithm for children recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) was applied to 772 children. Strikingly, in this population, only 3% of children with current asthma had FEV 1 to FVC ratio (FEV 1 :FVC) of less than 70%. Bronchodilator reversibility tests (BDR) and Fe NO also demonstrated poor diagnostic accuracy using the recommended cut-off values. This raises concerns over the potential for delayed diagnosis in children or misdiagnosis; the comprehensive review of the literature that accompanied this guidance clearly demonstrated the paucity of evidence for the use of spirometry and bronchodilator reversibility in children.

### Confirmatory spirometry for adults hospitalized with a diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [^1158sisL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The study findings have several implications. First, the relatively high frequency of adequate quality spirometry tests (about three-quarters of patients tested) should be encouraging to clinicians who may want to use spirometry in the inpatient setting to confirm the diagnosis of asthma or COPD exacerbations. Second, the high rates of patients who did not meet the asthma or COPD diagnostic criteria by spirometry (about 20%), which were even higher among obese patients (33%). Given these findings, we recommend that clinicians routinely obtain spirometry in hospitalized patients suspected of having an asthma or a COPD exacerbation.

In conclusion, we found that adequate quality spirometry can be obtained in most patients hospitalized with exacerbations of asthma or COPD. Clinical practice and quality improvement efforts that include spirometry for confirmation of obstructive lung disease may help to reduce the risk of overdiagnosis, which could lead to inappropriate care in this population.

### Distinguishing asthma and COPD in primary care: a case-based approach [^114Ze2M6]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect more than 40 million Americans, cost more than $100 billion annually, and together constitute the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States. Distinguishing between asthma and COPD can be difficult; accurate diagnosis requires spirometry that demonstrates a characteristic pattern. Asthma is diagnosed if airway obstruction on spirometry is reversible (greater than 12% and greater than 200 mL improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]) with administration of bronchodilators or through the observation of bronchoconstriction (reduction in FEV1 of 20% or greater) with a methacholine challenge. COPD is diagnosed if airway obstruction (FEV1/forced vital capacity [FEV1/FVC] ratio less than 70%) on spirometry is not reversible with bronchodilators. Although not considered a separate diagnosis, asthma-COPD overlap can be a useful clinical descriptor for patients displaying diagnostic features of both diseases. In these cases, spirometry will show reversibility after administration of bronchodilators, which is consistent with asthma, and the persistent baseline airflow limitation that is more characteristic of COPD. Treatment should follow Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines. In patients with asthma-COPD overlap, pharmacotherapy should primarily follow asthma guidelines, but pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches specific to COPD may also be needed.

### BTS / NICE / SIGN guideline for asthma 2024: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management. how does this compare to GINA 2024? [^1142WTpr]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of asthma in adults, young people and children age 5–16 (BTS/NICE/SIGN) and in adults, adolescents and children age 6–11(GINA)

Both BTS/NICE/SIGN and GINA documents emphasise that a diagnosis of asthma should be made on basis of a characteristic history and confirmed by objective evidence. However their recommendations for objective testing differ significantly.
BTS/NICE/SIGN: Emphasises tests for eosinophilic airway inflammation such as Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO), blood eosinophil counts and (in children) skin-prick testing.
GINA: Focuses on identifying variable expiratory airflow limitation, primarily using spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility.

The recommended tests, criteria for positivity and recommended sequence of testing are shown in Fig. 1.

(in sequence if the previous test is negative).

FeNO testing has moderate sensitivity (reflecting the number of false negative results) in children and adults and high specificity (reflecting a low number of false positive results). The order of diagnostic tests recommended by BTS/NICE/SIGN is largely based on economic analysis derived from United Kingdom costs. However, as pointed out in the GINA strategy document, the sensitivity of FENO is reduced in smokersand obese individuals. Also it has questionable utility in identifying non-eosinophilic asthma which may account for 48% adults with asthma. Evidence regarding the diagnostic value of bronchodilator testing, particularly in children, remains surprisingly limited. The evidence shows that bronchodilator reversibility has high specificity, but low sensitivity in adults. (for example may be normal when a patient is asymptomatic) Peak flow variability also shows low sensitivity, but has very high specificity and is readily available in primary care internationally.

### Ascertainment of small airways dysfunction using oscillometry to better define asthma control and future risk: are we ready to implement It in clinical practice? [^115J6RDm]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

The small airways comprise generations 8 to 23 of the bronchial tree, consist of airways with an internal diameter < 2 mm, and are classically difficult to assess and treat in persistent asthma. Small airways dysfunction (SAD) is integral to the asthma management paradigm because it is associated with poorer symptom control and greater levels of type 2 inflammation, and it has been proposed as a potentially treatable asthma trait. Although identification of SAD based on oscillometry has been found to be clinically useful in managing asthma, very few physicians, including specialists, use this technique as part of standard or adjunct evaluation of lung function to diagnose asthma, grade severity of airway obstruction, ascertain disease control or the risk for future exacerbations, or to make management decisions. To rectify the unrecognized value of oscillometry in the asthma community, a consortium of authors who are investigators with knowledge and experience of oscillometry wished to address the most important clinical questions raised by our colleagues who are considering using this technique, including its clinical utility. In this article, we discuss integral concepts, including applicability of oscillometry as a predictive tool for asthma exacerbations and disease control, adequacy of spirometry and oscillometry in assessing SAD, potential limitations of oscillometry, and treatment options for SAD.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood; however, no diagnostic criteria exist to confirm or refute the diagnosis. Guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network recognise that the diagnosis of asthma is a clinical one. Because of concerns about the diagnosis of asthma, particularly overdiagnosis, the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has developed comprehensive guidance on the diagnosis incorporating objective tests. The NICE interim report proposes a diagnostic algorithm incorporating the sequential use of four measures of lung function and inflammation in children with symptoms, each applied as a dichotomous variable: spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV 1] and forced vital capacity [FVC] expressed as a ratio FEV 1 :FVC), bronchodilator reversibility, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and peak flow variability. For the development of the NICE guideline, systematic scientific literature searches were done to identify all published evidence relevant to the review questions. The authors acknowledged that no evidence was found for asthma diagnosis in children for either FEV 1 :FVC or bronchodilator reversibility, and little evidence exists for fractional exhaled nitric oxide and peak flow variability. Despite these findings, the guideline proposes a complex algorithm in which at least two of these tests must be positive to make the diagnosis.
