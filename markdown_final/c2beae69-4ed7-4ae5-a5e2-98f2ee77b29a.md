## Question

MRSA abscess outpatient antibiotics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about outpatient antibiotics for MRSA abscesses — when they're indicated, which agents to choose, and how to approach dosing and duration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical scenario and confirming whether this is an uncomplicated abscess. Then, I should verify the primary therapy and whether antibiotics are routinely indicated. Next, I will review when antibiotics are appropriate and which agents to choose, including dosing and duration. After that, I need to check special populations and risk factors that modify decisions. I will then examine the role of cultures and follow-up. Finally, I should consider recurrence prevention and synthesize a practical algorithm with shared decision-making in mind [^114BT1Uk].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and definitions, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with an uncomplicated cutaneous abscess rather than a complicated infection or cellulitis without purulence. Uncomplicated abscesses are typically well-circumscribed collections under 5 cm, without extension into deeper tissues, multiloculation, or systemic inflammatory response, and MRSA is the most common pathogen in purulent SSTIs in many communities, which frames empiric thinking but does not by itself mandate antibiotics after adequate drainage [^112BYds6] [^113129Bg] [^114BT1Uk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics; I should verify the foundation of therapy. Incision and drainage is the primary and essential treatment for uncomplicated abscesses, and routine antibiotics are not required when source control is achieved in an immunocompetent host without systemic signs, so I need to ensure adequate drainage technique and wound care before discussing drugs [^111eVYNk] [^113UkXua] [^113XQ3Kf].

> Wait, let me verify the role of adjunctive antibiotics after drainage, because practice varies and evidence has evolved. High-quality randomized trials show that TMP-SMX or clindamycin modestly improves short-term cure and reduces recurrence compared with drainage alone, but the absolute benefit is small and must be balanced against adverse effects, so guidelines frame this as a weak recommendation with shared decision-making rather than a mandate [^113gWrmr] [^117E864F] [^114BT1Uk] [^114nXAy1].

> I should confirm the indications for adding antibiotics after drainage, and I need to check that I am aligning with SIRS-based criteria and host factors. Indications include systemic signs such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, or leukocytosis, markedly impaired host defenses, extremes of age, multiple or large lesions, significant surrounding cellulitis, failure to improve after 48–72 hours, or patient preference after discussing trade-offs, and in these settings an anti-MRSA agent is reasonable while ensuring source control remains paramount [^111tWNDR] [^111eVYNk] [^1111JWUp].

> Let me consider first-line oral agents and dosing, and I should double-check comparative effectiveness and tolerability. TMP-SMX and clindamycin have similar cure rates in head-to-head trials, but TMP-SMX has a lower risk of diarrhea; typical dosing is TMP-SMX 1–2 double-strength tablets twice daily for 7–10 days, or clindamycin 300–450 mg four times daily for 7–10 days, with selection informed by local resistance and patient-specific factors such as allergy or prior intolerance [^116Ubdzu] [^115FF4Ke] [^112w921g].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot take TMP-SMX or clindamycin, or if local resistance patterns are unfavorable. Doxycycline or minocycline are acceptable alternatives for MRSA, though they are less reliable for beta-hemolytic streptococci; if streptococcal coverage is needed, combining doxycycline with a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin is reasonable, and I should confirm age restrictions for tetracyclines in children under 8 years [^112w921g] [^112z7Dvu].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and risk modifiers. In children, TMP-SMX or clindamycin are appropriate MRSA-active choices, with clindamycin often favored when beta-hemolytic streptococci are suspected; in pregnancy, I should avoid TMP-SMX in the first trimester and prefer beta-lactams if antibiotics are needed; in patients with diabetes, immunocompromise, or large abscesses, a lower threshold for antibiotics and closer follow-up is prudent; for injection drug users, polymicrobial flora including streptococci and anaerobes are more common, so I should consider broader coverage if systemic signs are present [^112w921g] [^111Tviut] [^114j7ABt].

> Next, I should review the role of cultures, and I need to check when they change management. Routine cultures are not required for uncomplicated abscesses after drainage, but they are reasonable in recurrent infections, severe infections, immunocompromised hosts, outbreaks, or when initial therapy fails, and if antibiotics are prescribed, obtaining a culture can guide narrowing or switching therapy if the clinical course is atypical [^114CSRxj] [^111xeTY7] [^111eVYNk].

> I will now examine recurrence prevention, because I should confirm whether decolonization is indicated. For patients with recurrent S. aureus abscesses, a 5-day decolonization regimen with intranasal mupirocin twice daily, chlorhexidine body washes, and decontamination of personal items can reduce recurrence, and I should also screen for and treat close contacts if clusters occur [^111dXsxU] [^116udS1D].

> Let me think about duration and follow-up, and I should verify whether shorter courses are acceptable. Most trials and guidelines use 7–10 days, but emerging questions include whether 5–7 days suffice in selected patients; until stronger evidence is available, I should individualize duration to clinical response and reassess at 48–72 hours, with clear return precautions for worsening pain, expanding erythema, fever, or new lesions [^117L8GRv] [^111Tviut].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not recommending agents with poor activity. Cephalosporins are inferior to TMP-SMX or clindamycin for MRSA abscesses and should be avoided when MRSA is likely, whereas beta-lactams remain appropriate for nonpurulent cellulitis without MRSA risk factors, which underscores the importance of distinguishing cellulitis from abscess at the bedside [^115FF4Ke] [^112z7Dvu].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm so I do not miss a step. First, confirm uncomplicated abscess and perform incision and drainage with appropriate analgesia and wound care; second, assess for systemic signs, host risk factors, lesion size or cellulitis, and patient preferences; third, if no indications are present, observe with close follow-up; fourth, if indications are present or the patient prefers, offer TMP-SMX or clindamycin with shared decision-making and counseling on benefits and adverse effects; fifth, arrange follow-up in 48–72 hours and escalate care if there is no improvement or if systemic toxicity emerges [^111eVYNk] [^114nXAy1].

> Finally, I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with high-quality evidence and guidelines. The balance of randomized trials shows a modest absolute benefit of MRSA-active antibiotics after drainage, guidelines frame this as a weak recommendation with shared decision-making, and the overarching principle remains that source control via incision and drainage is the cornerstone of therapy for uncomplicated abscesses, with antibiotics reserved for selected patients or those who prefer them after informed discussion [^113gWrmr] [^117E864F] [^114BT1Uk] [^111eVYNk].

---

For outpatient MRSA abscesses, **incision and drainage is the primary therapy** [^111eVYNk]; antibiotics are reserved for patients with **systemic signs**, **immunocompromise**, or **failure to improve after 48–72 hours** [^111tWNDR]. When antibiotics are indicated, **TMP-SMX or clindamycin** are first-line oral options [^113gWrmr]; doxycycline is an alternative if local resistance is low [^112w921g]. Routine cultures are not required for uncomplicated cases [^114CSRxj], but should be obtained for recurrent infections, severe disease, or treatment failure [^111xeTY7]. Provide clear return precautions and arrange follow-up within 48–72 hours to ensure improvement [^116tzahZ].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not routinely required** for uncomplicated MRSA abscesses after adequate incision and drainage [^113UkXua]. Indications for antibiotic therapy include:

- **Systemic signs of infection**: Fever (temperature ≥ 38°C or < 36°C), tachycardia (heart rate > 90 bpm), tachypnea (> 24 breaths per minute), or abnormal white blood cell count (> 12,000 or < 4,000 cells/µL) [^111eVYNk].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Patients with markedly impaired host defenses [^113KrirW].

- **Failure of initial management**: Lack of improvement after 48–72 hours of incision and drainage alone [^notfound].

- **Severe local infection**: Extensive cellulitis, rapid progression, or multiple lesions [^113UkXua].

---

## Recommended outpatient antibiotic regimens

When antibiotics are indicated, **the following regimens are recommended**:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage (adults)** | **Dosage (children)** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) | 1–2 double-strength tablets orally twice daily (160/800 mg per tablet) | 8–12 mg/kg/day of TMP component divided every 12 hours | - First-line oral therapy <br/> - Monitor for hypersensitivity and renal function [^114nXAy1] |
| Clindamycin | 300–450 mg orally four times daily | 30–40 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours | - First-line oral therapy <br/> - Monitor for gastrointestinal side effects and C. difficile infection [^115FF4Ke] |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally twice daily | Not recommended for children < 8 years | Alternative oral therapy; monitor for gastrointestinal side effects [^112w921g] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **recommended duration** of antibiotic therapy for MRSA abscesses is typically 7–10 days, individualized based on clinical response and severity of infection [^1125JJvB].

---

## Role of incision and drainage

Incision and drainage (I&D) is the **cornerstone of treatment** for MRSA abscesses [^111eVYNk]. Adequate I&D significantly reduces the need for antibiotics and improves clinical outcomes [^111pS5Gp]. Antibiotics should be considered adjunctive therapy only when indicated by clinical factors [^111eVYNk].

---

## Indications for obtaining cultures

Routine cultures are **not required** for uncomplicated MRSA abscesses [^114CSRxj]. Obtain cultures in the following scenarios:

- **Recurrent infections**: Multiple or recurrent abscesses [^111LRskt].

- **Severe infection**: Extensive cellulitis, systemic symptoms, or treatment failure [^111xeTY7].

- **Outbreaks**: Concern for clusters or outbreaks [^111xeTY7].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Patients should have **follow-up within 48–72 hours** to assess clinical improvement and ensure adequate source control. Provide clear return precautions for worsening symptoms, systemic signs, or lack of improvement [^116tzahZ].

---

## Patient education and prevention strategies

Patient education is **essential** to prevent recurrence and transmission. Key strategies include:

- **Hand hygiene**: Regular handwashing with soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizers [^notfound].

- **Wound care**: Keep wounds covered, clean, and dry [^113UkXua].

- **Avoid sharing personal items**: Towels, razors, clothing, and other personal items should not be shared [^notfound].

- **Decolonization**: Consider intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine baths for recurrent infections [^111dXsxU].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Incision and drainage**: Primary treatment for MRSA abscesses [^111eVYNk].

- **Antibiotics**: Reserved for patients with systemic signs, immunocompromise, or failure to improve after 48–72 hours [^113UkXua].

- **First-line antibiotics**: TMP-SMX or clindamycin; doxycycline as an alternative [^111aNudS].

- **Duration**: 7–10 days, individualized based on clinical response [^1125JJvB].

- **Cultures**: Not routine; obtain in recurrent, severe, or treatment failure cases [^11537E23].

- **Follow-up**: Within 48–72 hours to ensure improvement [^116tzahZ].

- **Education**: Hand hygiene, wound care, and decolonization strategies to prevent recurrence [^111dXsxU].

---

Outpatient management of MRSA abscesses centers on **incision and drainage**, with antibiotics reserved for specific indications. TMP-SMX or clindamycin are first-line oral agents when antibiotics are needed, and patient education is essential to prevent recurrence.

### How do you treat an abscess in the era of increased community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)? [^111T2v86]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the era of increased prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), there have been a number of questions and several recent studies that address the clinical management of uncomplicated abscesses in the emergency department (ED).

Discussion

We examine the historical and clinical predictors for MRSA in patients with an uncomplicated abscess and review the evidence behind the use of wound cultures, decolonization, antibiotics, irrigation, and packing after incision and drainage. We found that current recommendations and treatment guidelines are often based on limited data, expert opinion, and anecdotal experience.

Conclusion

In light of the data currently available, antibiotics and decolonization should be used selectively, not routinely, for treatment of most uncomplicated abscesses. Wound cultures are generally not necessary in the ED, and all patients should be given return precautions for worsening symptoms.

The evidence

To inform the recommendations, the guideline panel requested a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of adjuvant antibiotic therapy compared with no antibiotic therapy in addition to incision and drainage in patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses.

A large RCT published in March 2016 suggested that TMP-SMX treatment resulted in a higher cure rate than placebo among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess. Another RCT published in June 2017 found that, compared with incision and drainage alone, clindamycin or TMP-SMX in addition to incision and drainage improved short term outcomes in patients who had an uncomplicated skin abscess. The Rapid Recommendations team believed these two trials, in addition to the existing body of evidence, might change practice.

Figure 1 gives an overview of the characteristics of patients and trials included in the systematic review of the effects of antibiotics on uncomplicated skin abscesses. There were 14 RCTs: eight included a comparison of antibiotics versus no antibiotics, and seven included a comparison of two different antibiotics. Explicit descriptions of abscess definitions, for each trial, were summarised in the accompanying systematic review (table C of appendix 2). The largest trial specifically focused on small abscesses (all < 5 cm diameter and about half ≤ 2 cm) in patients who had no signs of systemic infection. The RCTs included participants with skin abscesses anywhere on the body.

Eleven trials reported study setting, of which nine were conducted in emergency departments, one in outpatient dermatology clinics, and one in an Integrated Soft Tissue Infection Services (ISIS) clinic involving patients with high rates of comorbidity, such as infection with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, or HIV. The RCTs included children and adults. Almost all patients underwent incision and drainage for their skin abscess. The most common pathogen was MRSA (49–88%) followed by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 9–18%).

### Subgroup analysis of antibiotic treatment for skin Abscesses [^1127Vwkj]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Two large randomized trials recently demonstrated efficacy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-active antibiotics for drained skin abscesses. We determine whether outcome advantages observed in one trial exist across lesion sizes and among subgroups with and without guideline-recommended antibiotic indications.

Methods

We conducted a planned subgroup analysis of a double-blind, randomized trial at 5 US emergency departments, demonstrating superiority of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (320/1,600 mg twice daily for 7 days) compared with placebo for patients older than 12 years with a drained skin abscess. We determined between-group differences in rates of clinical (no new antibiotics) and composite cure (no new antibiotics or drainage) through 7 to 14 and 42 to 56 days after treatment among subgroups with and without abscess cavity or erythema diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm, history of MRSA, fever, diabetes, and comorbidities. We also evaluated treatment effect by lesion size and culture result.

Results

Among 1,057 mostly adult participants, median abscess cavity and erythema diameters were 2.5 cm (range 0.1 to 16.0 cm) and 6.5 cm (range 1.0 to 38.5), respectively; 44.3% grew MRSA. Overall, for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and placebo groups, clinical cure rate at 7 to 14 days was 92.9% and 85.7%; composite cure rate at 7 to 14 days was 86.5% and 74.3%, and at 42 to 56 days, it was 82.4% and 70.2%. For all outcomes, across lesion sizes and among subgroups with and without guideline antibiotic criteria, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with improved outcomes. Treatment effect was greatest with history of MRSA infection, fever, and positive MRSA culture.

Conclusion

Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with improved outcomes regardless of lesion size or guideline antibiotic criteria.

### Failure of outpatient antibiotics among patients hospitalized for acute bacterial skin infections: what is the clinical relevance? [^113YjiQu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend that patients hospitalized for acute bacterial skin infections after failure of outpatient antibiotic therapy be managed as "severe" infections; however, the clinical relevance of apparent failure of outpatient therapy is not clear.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter, retrospective cohort of adults and children hospitalized for cellulitis, abscess, or wound infection. We compared clinical features, laboratory and microbiology findings, antibiotic treatment, and outcomes among patients who received outpatient antibiotics prior to admission and those who did not.

Results

Of 533 patients, 179 (34%) received outpatient antibiotics prior to admission. Compared with those who did not, patients who received antibiotics prior to admission less frequently had fever (18% vs 26%, P = 0.04) and leukocytosis (33% vs 51%, P < .001). In the 202 cases where a microorganism was identified, Staphylococcus aureus was more common among those who received antibiotics prior to admission (75% vs 58%, P = 0.02), particularly methicillin-resistant S aureus (41% vs 27%, P = 0.049), whereas aerobic gram-negative bacilli were less common (3% vs 13%, P = 0.03). After hospitalization, clinical failure occurred with similar frequency between the 2 groups (12% vs 11%, P = 0.73).

Conclusions

Patients hospitalized with skin infections after apparently failing outpatient therapy had clinical features suggestive of less severe infection and similar outcomes compared with patients who did not receive antibiotics prior to admission. Our results suggest that inpatient treatment for patients not responding to outpatient therapy should focus on methicillin-resistant S aureus, not gram-negative pathogens.

### A placebo-controlled trial of antibiotics for smaller skin abscesses [^113gWrmr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated skin abscesses are common, yet the appropriate management of the condition in the era of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, prospective, double-blind trial involving outpatient adults and children. Patients were stratified according to the presence of a surgically drainable abscess, abscess size, the number of sites of skin infection, and the presence of nonpurulent cellulitis. Participants with a skin abscess 5 cm or smaller in diameter were enrolled. After abscess incision and drainage, participants were randomly assigned to receive clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), or placebo for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical cure 7 to 10 days after the end of treatment.

Results

We enrolled 786 participants: 505 (64.2%) were adults and 281 (35.8%) were children. A total of 448 (57.0%) of the participants were male. S. aureus was isolated from 527 participants (67.0%), and MRSA was isolated from 388 (49.4%). Ten days after therapy in the intention-to-treat population, the cure rate among participants in the clindamycin group was similar to that in the TMP-SMX group (221 of 266 participants [83.1%] and 215 of 263 participants [81.7%], respectively; P = 0.73), and the cure rate in each active-treatment group was higher than that in the placebo group (177 of 257 participants [68.9%], P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The results in the population of patients who could be evaluated were similar. This beneficial effect was restricted to participants with S. aureus infection. Among the participants who were initially cured, new infections at 1 month of follow-up were less common in the clindamycin group (15 of 221, 6.8%) than in the TMP-SMX group (29 of 215 [13.5%], P = 0.03) or the placebo group (22 of 177 [12.4%], P = 0.06). Adverse events were more frequent with clindamycin (58 of 265 [21.9%]) than with TMP-SMX (29 of 261 [11.1%]) or placebo (32 of 255 [12.5%]); all adverse events resolved without sequelae. One participant who received TMP-SMX had a hypersensitivity reaction.

Conclusions

As compared with incision and drainage alone, clindamycin or TMP-SMX in conjunction with incision and drainage improves short-term outcomes in patients who have a simple abscess. This benefit must be weighed against the known side-effect profile of these antimicrobials. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00730028 .).

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^11537E23]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Identifying the infecting pathogen may not be necessary for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses, but cultures can provide helpful information in patients with recurrent abscesses or systemic illness. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, most often methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and several other bacteria, most originating from the skin flora.MRSA accounts for a substantial number of visits by patients with skin and soft tissue infections.

Table 1 summarises current management guidelines, which do not recommend antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses.

Table 1
Current recommendations for antibiotics in patients with skin abscesses*

IDSA = Infectious Diseases Society of America; EBM = Evidence-Based Medicine; NHG = Nederlands Huisartsen Genootschap; ESCMID = European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

How the recommendation was created

The scope of the recommendation and the outcomes important to patients were defined by an international guideline panel consisting of two adults with lived experience of skin abscesses, one adult with lived experience as a carer for a child with skin abscess, five general practitioners, three paediatric or adult infectious disease physicians, four general internists, a general paediatrician, a dermatologist, and several health research methodologists. They requested a systematic review on the benefits and harms of different antibiotics to inform the recommendation. The panel then met online to discuss the evidence and to formulate specific recommendations. As with all BMJ Rapid Recommendations, no panel member had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including using the GRADE approach to critically appraise the evidence and to move from evidence to recommendations (appendix 2 on bmj.com). The panel initially identified patient-important outcomes and subgroup hypotheses needed to inform the recommendation. When creating the recommendation, the panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, costs, burdens of the treatments, the quality of evidence for each outcome, typical patient values and preferences and their expected variations, as well as acceptability. Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. The recommendations take a patient-centred perspective which de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer point of view.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113KrirW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for skin abscess, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, MRSA coverage, IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend to administer an antibiotic active against MRSA in patients with carbuncles or abscesses not responding to initial antibiotic treatment or having markedly impaired host defenses or systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with hypotension.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^117L8GRv]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Future research

Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines are:

What is the impact of different types of antibiotics in settings where MRSA is rare (prevalence < 10%)?
Do antibiotics have different effects in different populations, such as people who are immunocompromised or in people with recurrent skin abscesses?
What are the long term effects (such as > 6 months) of antibiotics on abscess recurrence, Clostridium difficile infection, and MRSA resistance to TMP-SMX or clindamycin?
Is a shorter course of antibiotics (such as 5 days) as effective as a longer course (10 days)?
Is topical therapy (such as iodine, honey, silver, other antimicrobials) effective for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses compared with systemic therapy? Do other adjunctive measures, such as nasal decontamination or antisepsis for the body, reduce the risk that skin abscesses will recur?

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^113129Bg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs) are commonly encountered infections in various healthcare settings. Over the last 2 decades, community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as the most common cause of purulent skin infections in the United States with accompanying higher rates of complications (eg, abscess), recurrence, and treatment failures, often leading to hospitalization. The overall burden of managing such common infections has resulted in added healthcare costs.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definition of ABSSSI includes cellulitis/erysipelas, major skin abscesses, and wound infections, with all requiring a minimum lesion surface area of 75 cm 2 (Table 1). ABSSSI is a common reason for patients seeking care in various healthcare settings, including emergency departments. Most are treated effectively as outpatients. The decision-making process for admitting patients to the hospital for ABSSSI is complex and often very subjective. In general, patients with all of the following characteristics can be managed as outpatients: no signs of sepsis, low suspicion of deep soft tissue infection including necrotizing fasciitis, and lack of exacerbation of comorbidities. For the majority of patients, empiric treatment is most often directed against gram-positive cocci.

Table 1.
US Food and Drug Administration Definition of Acute Bacterial Skin and Structure Infection

During hospitalization, healthcare providers may need to reevaluate antimicrobial treatment and the need for surgical intervention. Antimicrobial therapy may need to be adjusted, particularly in the elderly due to comorbidities such as renal insufficiency. Once culture and susceptibility results are available, if indicated, deescalation of antimicrobial therapy is recommended. Of note, the role of MRSA in cellulitis without a wound or purulence is not as clear due to the absence of culturable material.

Here, I review ABSSSI treatment guidelines in the hospital setting and discuss current and future antibiotic options for treatment of this commonly encountered infection. Although many of the studies discussed here have used different terms to describe these infections, such as complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated skin and soft-tissue infections, throughout the article I will refer to them as ABSSSI.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^115NMPMS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for skin abscess, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, MRSA coverage, IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to consider administering any of the following agents covering MRSA in hospitalized patients with complicated SSTI, including major abscesses pending culture results, in addition to surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics:

- IV vancomycin

- IV or PO linezolid 600 mg BID

- IV daptomycin 4 mg/kg/dose once daily

- IV telavancin 10 mg/kg/dose once daily

- IV or PO clindamycin 600 mg TID.

### Current treatment options for community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection [^112wK17c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

During the past decade, there has been a marked increase in the prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in the United States and elsewhere. The most common such infections are those involving the skin and skin structures. Although a number of these lesions (including small furuncles and abscesses) respond well to surgical incision and drainage, oral antimicrobial agents are commonly used to treat these infections in outpatients. Unfortunately, with the exception of linezolid, none of the agents presently being used in this fashion has been subjected to rigorous clinical trial. Thus, current therapy is based largely on anecdotal evidence. For more-serious infections requiring hospitalization, parenteral antimicrobials such as vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline are presently available and have demonstrated effectiveness in randomized, prospective, double-blind trials.

### News, views, and reviews. less may be more for MRSA: the latest on antibiotics, the utility of packing an abscess, and decolonization strategies [^113NfFz6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The management of skin infections has evolved over time and new evidence suggests that less acute intervention may be as good or better. For acute treatment, evidence from the emergency medicine literature shows that empiric oral antibiotics may not improve outcomes relative to incision and drainage alone. The use of packing material for wounds after draining does not lead to a decreased rate of recurrence, more rapid healing, or fewer physician visits, but does cause more pain. For patients with multiple or recurrent skin and soft tissue infections, a comprehensive decolonization or eradication strategy is the most effective at preventing further recurrences. Several decolonization approaches exist and can be tailored to find the most appropriate for a particular individual.

### Current and future trends in antibiotic therapy of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections [^116pjXgX]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

In 2013 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued recommendations and guidance on developing drugs for treatment of skin infection using a new definition of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI). The new classification includes cellulitis, erysipelas, major skin abscesses and wound infection with a considerable extension of skin involvement, clearly referring to a severe subset of skin infections. The main goal of the FDA was to better identify specific infections where the advantages of a new antibiotic could be precisely estimated through quantifiable parameters, such as improvement of the lesion size and of systemic signs of infection. Before the spread and diffusion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in skin infections, antibiotic therapy was relatively straightforward. Using an empiric approach, a β-lactam was the preferred therapy and cultures from patients were rarely obtained. With the emergence of MRSA in the community setting, initial ABSSSI management has been changed and readdressed. Dalbavancin, oritavancin and tedizolid are new drugs, approved or in development for ABSSSI treatment, that also proved to be efficient against MRSA. Dalbavancin and oritavancin have a long half-life and can be dosed less frequently. This in turn makes it possible to treat patients with ABSSSI in an outpatient setting, avoiding hospitalization or potentially allowing earlier discharge, without compromising efficacy. In conclusion, characteristics of long-acting antibiotics could represent an opportunity for the management of ABSSSI and could profoundly modify the management of these infections by reducing or in some cases eliminating both costs and risks of hospitalization.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus placebo for uncomplicated skin abscess [^117E864F]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

U.S. emergency department visits for cutaneous abscess have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The role of antibiotics for patients with a drained abscess is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a randomized trial at five U.S. emergency departments to determine whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, respectively, twice daily, for 7 days) would be superior to placebo in outpatients older than 12 years of age who had an uncomplicated abscess that was being treated with drainage. The primary outcome was clinical cure of the abscess, assessed 7 to 14 days after the end of the treatment period.

Results

The median age of the participants was 35 years (range, 14 to 73); 45.3% of the participants had wound cultures that were positive for MRSA. In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure of the abscess occurred in 507 of 630 participants (80.5%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 454 of 617 participants (73.6%) in the placebo group (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 11.7; P = 0.005). In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 487 of 524 participants (92.9%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 of 533 participants (85.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.2 to 11.2; P < 0.001). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was superior to placebo with respect to most secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedures (3.4% vs. 8.6%; difference, -5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.2 to -2.2), skin infections at new sites (3.1% vs. 10.3%; difference, -7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -10.4 to -4.1), and infections in household members (1.7% vs. 4.1%; difference, -2.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.6 to -0.2) 7 to 14 days after the treatment period. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with slightly more gastrointestinal side effects (mostly mild) than placebo. At 7 to 14 days after the treatment period, invasive infections had developed in 2 of 524 participants (0.4%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and in 2 of 533 participants (0.4%) in the placebo group; at 42 to 56 days after the treatment period, an invasive infection had developed in 1 participant (0.2%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group.

Conclusions

In settings in which MRSA was prevalent, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment resulted in a higher cure rate among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess than placebo. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00729937.).

### The benefit of empiric treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^113sTpos]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged as a major pathogen causing skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). It is unclear whether treatment with antibiotics active in vitro against CA-MRSA improves patient outcomes. At our institution, where there is a high rate of CA-MRSA SSTI, we have adopted an empiric treatment algorithm that promotes both the use of antibiotics likely active against CA-MRSA and early incision and drainage of abscesses. The objective of this research was to study the effectiveness of an empiric treatment algorithm for SSTI directed against CA-MRSA. The study was a retrospective chart review. Treatment was categorized as either conforming or not conforming to the algorithm. Outcomes were categorized as worsening of infection or improvement, according to predefined criteria. There were 50 consecutive Emergency Department patients treated as outpatients for MRSA SSTI. Treatment conformed to the algorithm in 29 of 50 cases. Clinical failure occurred in 3% of cases treated according to the algorithm, compared with 62% of those not treated according to the algorithm (p < 0.001). Among 37 cases that underwent immediate incision and drainage, initial treatment with antibiotics active in vitro against the MRSA isolate was associated with a decreased clinical failure rate when compared to those treated with inactive antibiotics (0% vs. 67%, p < 0.001). Empiric treatment of CA-MRSA SSTI according to an algorithm that promotes use of antibiotics active in vitro against CA-MRSA is associated with improved clinical outcomes.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^111pS5Gp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be added for patients at risk for CA-MRSA and subsequently for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours or who have chills, fever, a new abscess, increasing erythema, or uncontrolled pain.

Although in cellulitis, swabs and aspirates of the leading edge of the site of infection have a low yield of around 10%, when it is possible, antibiotic treatment should be modified, on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms obtained.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for a simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. Simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

The cornerstone of treatment is early surgical drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis.

Complicated abscesses may involve a variety of pathogens. Aerobic gram-positive pathogens are isolated in most complicated abscesses. They may involve only a single pathogen but are frequently poly-microbial in origin and may involve a number of organisms.

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved. Broad-spectrum agents with coverage of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic pathogens may be required depending on the clinical setting. Given the high frequency of MRSA, this pathogen should be empirically covered if it is suspected, but no randomized studies are available for the treatment of SSTI specifically caused by CA-MRSA.

### Avoidable antibiotic exposure for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections in the ambulatory care setting [^1137MrAc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections are among the most frequent indications for outpatient antibiotics. A detailed understanding of current prescribing practices is necessary to optimize antibiotic use for these conditions.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of children and adults treated in the ambulatory care setting for uncomplicated cellulitis, wound infection, or cutaneous abscess between March 1, 2010 and February 28, 2011. We assessed the frequency of avoidable antibiotic exposure, defined as the use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity, combination antibiotic therapy, or treatment for 10 or more days. Total antibiotic-days prescribed for the cohort were compared with antibiotic-days in 4 hypothetical short-course (5–7 days), single-antibiotic treatment models consistent with national guidelines.

Results

A total of 364 cases were included for analysis (155 cellulitis, 41 wound infection, and 168 abscess). Antibiotics active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were prescribed in 61% of cases of cellulitis. Of 139 cases of abscess where drainage was performed, antibiotics were prescribed in 80% for a median of 10 (interquartile range, 7–10) days. Of 292 total cases where complete prescribing data were available, avoidable antibiotic exposure occurred in 46%. This included use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity in 4%, combination therapy in 12%, and treatment for 10 or more days in 42%. Use of the short-course, single-antibiotic treatment strategies would have reduced prescribed antibiotic-days by 19% to 55%.

Conclusions

Approximately half of uncomplicated skin infections involved avoidable antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic use could be reduced through treatment approaches using short courses of a single antibiotic.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113UkXua]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — cutaneous abscess and inflamed epidermoid cyst management emphasizes that aspiration was successful in only 25% of cases overall and < 10% with MRSA infections, and accordingly, this form of treatment is not recommended. Simply covering the surgical site with a dry dressing is usually the easiest and most effective treatment of the wound, and one small study found that packing caused more pain and did not improve healing when compared to just covering the incision site with sterile gauze. The addition of systemic antibiotics to incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses does not improve cure rates, even in those due to MRSA, but systemic antibiotics should be given to patients with severely impaired host defenses or signs or symptoms of systemic infection; multiple abscesses, extremes of age, and lack of response to incision and drainage alone are additional settings in which systemic antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

### Management of cutaneous abscesses by dermatologists [^111FyT47]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Importance

There is currently no data detailing the degree to which dermatologists follow CDC/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines in the treatment of abscesses, which recommend that incision and drainage (I+D) as primary therapy for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI).

Objective

To evaluate the management of skin abscesses by dermatologists.

Design, Setting, Participants

A national email survey of 780 dermatologists was conducted from May-June 2012. Awareness, experience, and preparedness of respondents for abscess treatment, as well as the treatment practices in different clinical scenarios were evaluated. Response rate = 65% (n = 510).

Eligibility Criteria

board certified/eligible dermatologists practicing in US. Main practice affiliation: solo (20%), group (33%), university health system/academic (32%), multi-specialty (13%), and other (2%). Main practice setting: urban (49%), suburban (42%), and rural (9%).

Main Outcome and Measures

Practitioner report of: awareness of national guidelines, use of I+D in initial management of uncomplicated abscess found on face, trunk, and extremity on patients age 6 months, 3, 15, 50, and 80 years, and use of antibiotics in the initial management.

Results

99% of respondents were capable of performing I+D in their practice. The IDSA recommends cultures in all patients treated with antibiotic therapy, and does not recommend antibiotics for the treatment of simple abscess. 18% of respondents reported culturing abscesses less than 50% of the time, while 91% incorporated antibiotics into initial treatment. Nearly a quarter (24%) of respondents would choose an initial antibiotic that would not cover Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For facial abscesses, as the age of the patient increased from infant, respondents were more likely to incorporate I+D into their initial treatment. For abscesses on the trunk and extremities, respondents were less likely to I+D infants and toddlers, compared to adolescents, adults and the elderly.

Conclusion

Although most dermatologists were prepared to manage uncomplicated abscesses (98%), this survey identifies gaps in clinical standards of care established by the CDC/IDSA. Identification of these practice gaps may impact physician practice and dermatology residency curricula, and may serve to improve abscess management and antibacterial stewardship in the outpatient setting.

### Clindamycin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for uncomplicated skin infections [^116Ubdzu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Skin and skin-structure infections are common in ambulatory settings. However, the efficacy of various antibiotic regimens in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is unclear.

Methods

We enrolled outpatients with uncomplicated skin infections who had cellulitis, abscesses larger than 5 cm in diameter (smaller for younger children), or both. Patients were enrolled at four study sites. All abscesses underwent incision and drainage. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for 10 days. Patients and investigators were unaware of the treatment assignments and microbiologic test results. The primary outcome was clinical cure 7 to 10 days after the end of treatment.

Results

A total of 524 patients were enrolled (264 in the clindamycin group and 260 in the TMP-SMX group), including 155 children (29.6%). One hundred sixty patients (30.5%) had an abscess, 280 (53.4%) had cellulitis, and 82 (15.6%) had mixed infection, defined as at least one abscess lesion and one cellulitis lesion. S. aureus was isolated from the lesions of 217 patients (41.4%); the isolates in 167 (77.0%) of these patients were MRSA. The proportion of patients cured was similar in the two treatment groups in the intention-to-treat population (80.3% in the clindamycin group and 77.7% in the TMP-SMX group; difference, -2.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -10.2 to 4.9; P = 0.52) and in the populations of patients who could be evaluated (466 patients; 89.5% in the clindamycin group and 88.2% in the TMP-SMX group; difference, -1.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -7.6 to 5.1; P = 0.77). Cure rates did not differ significantly between the two treatments in the subgroups of children, adults, and patients with abscess versus cellulitis. The proportion of patients with adverse events was similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

We found no significant difference between clindamycin and TMP-SMX, with respect to either efficacy or side-effect profile, for the treatment of uncomplicated skin infections, including both cellulitis and abscesses.

Table 2.
Summary of Recently Approved Antibiotics for the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Structure Infection

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. To provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA, an understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility patterns is essential. For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when the initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension. For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS. Further, including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism (nasal colonization or prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration). Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, which is considered the first-line parenteral treatment of serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline (Table 3). Other agents with reliable MRSA activity that have been approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin. Additional factors for administering these medications include tolerability, formulation, cost, and dosing limitations associated with these agents, such as vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity and linezolid-associated myelosuppression.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^116VEGCz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — purulent skin and soft tissue infections (abscesses, furuncles, carbuncles, inflamed epidermoid cysts) recommendations are as follows: Gram stain and culture of pus from carbuncles and abscesses are recommended, but treatment without these studies is reasonable in typical cases (strong, moderate). Gram stain and culture of pus from inflamed epidermoid cysts are not recommended (strong, moderate). Incision and drainage is the recommended treatment for inflamed epidermoid cysts, carbuncles, abscesses, and large furuncles (strong, high). The decision to administer antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage should be based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria such as temperature ≥ 38°C or < 36°C, tachypnea > 24 breaths per minute, tachycardia > 90 beats per minute, or white blood cell count > 12 000 or < 4000 cells/µL (moderate; Figure 1) (strong, low), and an antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have markedly impaired host defenses and in patients with SIRS (Figure 1, Table 2) (strong, low).

### Effectiveness of outpatient antibiotics after surgical drainage of abscesses in reducing treatment failure [^111ov3Q3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal approach to outpatient antibiotic use after surgical drainage of abscesses is unclear given conflicting clinical trial results.

Objective

Our primary objective was to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of outpatient antibiotic prescribing after surgical drainage of cutaneous abscesses on reducing treatment failure.

Methods

We performed a retrospective observational study using data extracted from the electronic health record of a single academic health care system. All emergency department (ED) visits that resulted in discharge with a surgical drainage of a cutaneous abscess procedure code were included in the sample. All visits were categorized into having received or not having received an antibiotic prescription at the index visit. Outcome frequencies were compared using Pearson's chi-squared test. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds of treatment failure among those who did and did not receive an antibiotic prescription at their index ED visit.

Results

The final sample consisted of 421 index ED visits, of which 303 (72%) received an antibiotic prescription. Treatment with antibiotics after drainage did not significantly reduce the odds of composite treatment failure within 30 days when controlling for sociodemographic and clinical encounter variables (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.23–1.21).

Conclusions

This real-world, comparative effectiveness analysis did not demonstrate any significant reduction in treatment failure with the use of antibiotics after drainage of abscesses in the ED. It is unclear if the clinical benefit observed under controlled trial conditions will carry over to routine clinical practice where varied antibiotic regimens are the norm and local bacterial resistance patterns vary.

### Clinical failures of appropriately-treated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections [^112dnTbJ]. The Journal of Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections can be difficult to treat. We evaluated the rate of clinical failure in appropriately-treated patients and determined risk factors for failure.

Methods

We retrospectively studied a cohort of patients with invasive MRSA infections who completed recommended therapy at one hospital over a 7 year period.

Results

Two-hundred and fifteen cases were included. Vancomycin monotherapy was given in 73%. Failure rates by infection site were as follows: osteomyelitis 37/81 (46%), epidural abscess five/18 (28%), surgical wound four/15 (27%), pneumonia eight/45 (18%), endocarditis five/32 (16%), bloodstream five/42 (12%), joint one/23 (4%), and meningitis zero/one (0%). In multivariate analysis, only a diagnosis of osteomyelitis was independently associated with relapse (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

We found a high rate of treatment failure in an urban population among patients who completed recommended therapy, largely with vancomycin alone. Failure in osteomyelitis was particularly common. High quality comparative studies of antibiotic regimens for MRSA infections, particularly osteomyelitis, are needed.

### 2018 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline for the management of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^116v37df]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) — therapeutic considerations — emphasizes that correct treatment begins with the correct diagnosis and that it is essential to identify the infection being treated, including the primary site, extent, and distant sites. Adequate source control, such as debridement, drainage, and removal of infected prosthetic devices, is highlighted, and control at the primary site should be addressed early. The selected antimicrobial agent should have activity against the causative pathogen(s), appropriate site activity, and proven therapeutic efficacy, and patient factors including underlying conditions, concomitant therapies, age, and organ function may impact selection. Programmable infusion pumps and elastomeric devices can facilitate drugs that require multiple daily infusions; however, in general, for OPAT, drugs that allow for infrequent dosing and rapid/bolus infusions are preferred, and if multiple daily home doses are feasible, efficacy should not be sacrificed for convenience.

### Prioritizing emergency department antibiotic stewardship interventions for skin and soft tissue infections using judgment analysis [^11786Tfj]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) account for over 2.8 million annual emergency department (ED) visits and often result in suboptimal antibiotic therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate a set of interventions in minimizing inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for presumed SSTIs in the ED.

Design

Case vignette survey.

Participants

A national sample of emergency medicine (EM) physicians.

Methods

Each vignette described a clinical scenario of a presumed SSTI (cellulitis or abscess) and included a unique combination of zero to five interventions (outpatient follow-up, inappropriate antibiotic request flag, thermal imaging for cellulitis or rapid wound MRSA PCR for abscess, patient education/shared decision-making, and clinical decision support). Out of 64 possible vignettes, we asked participants to respond to eight vignettes. Following each vignette, we asked participants if they would prescribe an antibiotic in their everyday practice (yes/no). We built adjusted hierarchical logistic regression models to estimate the probability of prescribing an antibiotic for each intervention and vignette.

Results

Surveys were completed by 113 EM physicians. The thermal imaging, rapid wound MRSA PCR, and patient education/shared decision-making interventions showed the largest decrease (15–20%) in antibiotic prescribing probability. Vignettes with a combination of both a diagnostic intervention (thermal imaging or rapid wound MRSA PCR) and a patient education/shared decision-making intervention had the lowest prescribing probabilities.

Conclusion

We recommend future research focuses on the development and integration of novel diagnostic tools to identify true infection and incorporate shared decision-making to improve diagnosis and management of SSTIs.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^115FF4Ke]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The occurrence of adverse effects depends on the antibiotic. With clindamycin, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects (predominately diarrhoea) is approximately 10% higher than with no antibiotics (high quality evidence). TMP-SMX probably increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects by a smaller amount (approximately 2%; moderate quality evidence), and it is predominately nausea rather than diarrhoea. The severity of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea was not described, but is likely to range from mild to severe. Two large trials monitored for Clostridium difficile infection with routine clinical monitoring and no such infection occurred in any treatment arm.

Overall, there is no important difference in treatment failure between TMP-SMX and clindamycin (high quality evidence). In patients who were initially cured, one study suggested that clindamycin may reduce the risk of early recurrence at one month by approximately 7% (low quality evidence), but the confidence interval was wide and this result is inconsistent with indirect evidence from other RCTs, which suggests that the reduction in risk of abscess recurrence compared with placebo is similar for both TMP-SMX and clindamycin. Whether clindamycin reduces abscess recurrence more than TMP-SMX is therefore uncertain (low quality evidence). Local resistance patterns may affect the relative effectiveness of each antibiotic option. Clindamycin has a 10% higher risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea than TMP-SMX (high quality evidence).

The panel also considered evidence for cephalosporins compared with TMP-SMX and clindamycin used for uncomplicated skin abscesses. The network meta-analysis suggested that, at least in settings with a substantial prevalence of MRSA, cephalosporins in addition to incision and drainage probably do not reduce treatment failure compared with incision and drainage alone (moderate quality evidence). Both early and later generation cephalosporins probably confer a higher risk of treatment failure compared with either TMP-SMX or clindamycin (moderate quality evidence). The RCTs investigating cephalosporins did not report sufficient information to directly compare other outcomes. However, the panel felt that cephalosporins were unlikely to provide any other benefits if they do not reduce the risk of treatment failure compared with placebo (low quality evidence). This evidence directly applies to almost all settings where the prevalence of MRSA is more than 10%.

Outpatient follow-up visits — No generalized recommendation on frequency of outpatient follow-up can be made for patients treated with OPAT (no recommendation, no evidence). The treating physician should dictate the frequency of office visits, giving consideration to patient characteristics, the nature of the infection, the patient's tolerance of and response to therapy, and individual patient social factors.

### Prioritizing emergency department antibiotic stewardship interventions for skin and soft tissue infections using judgment analysis [^111w4rNe]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective:

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) account for over 2.8 million annual emergency department (ED) visits and often result in suboptimal antibiotic therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate a set of interventions in minimizing inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for presumed SSTIs in the ED.

Design:

Case vignette survey.

Participants:

A national sample of emergency medicine (EM) physicians.

Methods:

Each vignette described a clinical scenario of a presumed SSTI (cellulitis or abscess) and included a unique combination of zero to five interventions (outpatient follow-up, inappropriate antibiotic request flag, thermal imaging for cellulitis or rapid wound MRSA PCR for abscess, patient education/shared decision-making, and clinical decision support). Out of 64 possible vignettes, we asked participants to respond to eight vignettes. Following each vignette, we asked participants if they would prescribe an antibiotic in their everyday practice (yes/no). We built adjusted hierarchical logistic regression models to estimate the probability of prescribing an antibiotic for each intervention and vignette.

Results:

Surveys were completed by 113 EM physicians. The thermal imaging, rapid wound MRSA PCR, and patient education/shared decision-making interventions showed the largest decrease (15–20%) in antibiotic prescribing probability. Vignettes with a combination of both a diagnostic intervention (thermal imaging or rapid wound MRSA PCR) and a patient education/shared decision-making intervention had the lowest prescribing probabilities.

Conclusion:

We recommend future research focuses on the development and integration of novel diagnostic tools to identify true infection and incorporate shared decision-making to improve diagnosis and management of SSTIs.

### Optimal antibacterial treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections: applying a novel treatment algorithm [^113EN1oM]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Incision and drainage combined with antibiotic therapies form the backbone of managing uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs). An algorithm has been developed to guide the treatment of uSSSIs in the primary care setting in situations where initial empiric therapy is appropriate. This includes instances when a culture is taken, but it is deemed appropriate to begin an antibiotic empirically pending the results of the culture. The panel that developed the algorithm was chaired by Dr. Richard Scher of Columbia University and included thought leaders in the fields of clinical dermatology, dermatologic surgery, infectious disease, pediatric infectious disease, podiatry, and HIV infection. The panel acknowledged that the initial choice of antibiotic is generally determined by tolerability, ease of administration, cost, and efficacy. The usual choices for initial empiric therapy include cephalosporins, penicillinase-resistant penicillins, and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Currently marketed cephalosporins, penicillinase-resistant penicillins, and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations lack activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the increasing prevalence of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) was a major consideration when designing the treatment algorithm. Many CA-MRSA skin infections present as abscess, and drainage is the most important component of therapy in this setting. When the history and physical exam suggest CA-MRSA infection, and there is no fluctuant collection of purulent material to be drained, a sulfa drug or tetracycline is generally the best choice for initial empiric therapy.

Management of SSTIs — purulent infection (furuncle/carbuncle/abscess): For mild infection, "incision and drainage is indicated". Moderate infection involves incision and drainage (I & D) and culture and sensitivity (C & S) with empiric "TMP/SMX or Doxycycline", then defined treatment as "MRSA — TMP/SMX" and "MSSA — Dicloxacillin or Cephalexin". Severe infection involves I & D and C & S with empiric "Vancomycin or Daptomycin or Linezolid or Telavancin or Ceftaroline" and defined treatment as "MRSA — See Empiric" and "MSSA — Nafcillin or Cefazolin or Clindamycin". Since "daptomycin and telavancin are not approved for use in children, vancomycin is recommended; clindamycin may be used".

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^114nXAy1]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What role do antibiotics have in the treatment of uncomplicated skin abscesses after incision and drainage? A recent study suggested that, for small uncomplicated skin abscesses, antibiotics after incision and drainage improve the chance of short term cure compared with placebo. Triggered by this trial, the Rapid Recommendation team produced a new systematic review. Relying on this review and using the GRADE framework according to the BMJ Rapid Recommendation process, an expert panel makes a weak recommendation in favour of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole) or clindamycin in addition to incision and drainage over incision and drainage alone. For patients who have chosen to initiate antibiotics, the panel issues a strong recommendation for TMP-SMX or clindamycin rather than a cephalosporin and a weak recommendation for TMP-SMX rather than clindamycin. Box 1 shows the articles and evidence linked to this Rapid Recommendation. The infographic presents the recommendations together with other pertinent information, including an overview of the absolute benefits and harms of candidate antibiotics in the standard GRADE format. The panel emphasises shared decision making in the choice of whether to initiate antibiotics and in which antibiotic to use, because the desirable and undesirable consequences are closely balanced: clinicians using MAGICapp will find decision aids to support the discussion with patients. Table 2 below shows any evidence that has emerged since the publication of this article.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

### Clinical trial: comparative effectiveness of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus cephalexin alone for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized controlled trial [^1148wif9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is the most common organism isolated from purulent skin infections. Antibiotics are usually not beneficial for skin abscess, and national guidelines do not recommend CA-MRSA coverage for cellulitis, except purulent cellulitis, which is uncommon. Despite this, antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are prescribed commonly and increasingly for skin infections, perhaps due, in part, to lack of experimental evidence among cellulitis patients. We test the hypothesis that antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are beneficial in the treatment of cellulitis.

Methods

We performed a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2007 to 2011. We enrolled patients with cellulitis, no abscesses, symptoms for < 1 week, and no diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, or hospitalization (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00676130). All participants received cephalexin. Additionally, each was randomized to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo. We provided 14 days of antibiotics and instructed participants to continue therapy for ≥ 1 week, then stop 3 days after they felt the infection to be cured. Our main outcome measure was the risk difference for treatment success, determined in person at 2 weeks, with telephone and medical record confirmation at 1 month.

Results

We enrolled 153 participants, and 146 had outcome data for intent-to-treat analysis. Median age was 29, range 3–74. Of intervention participants, 62/73 (85%) were cured versus 60/73 controls (82%), a risk difference of 2.7% (95% confidence interval, -9.3% to 15%; p = 0.66). No covariates predicted treatment response, including nasal MRSA colonization and purulence at enrollment.

Conclusions

Among patients diagnosed with cellulitis without abscess, the addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin did not improve outcomes overall or by subgroup.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) after operations — initial management and when to use antibiotics — are outlined as follows: surveillance standards mandate 30 days of follow-up for operations without placement of prosthetic material and for 1 year for operations where a prosthesis was inserted; the most important therapy for an SSI is to open the incision, evacuate the infected material, and continue dressing changes until the wound heals by secondary intention; if there is < 5 cm of erythema and induration with minimal systemic signs (temperature < 38.5°C, white blood cell (WBC) count < 12 000 cells/μL, and pulse < 100 beats/minute), antibiotics are unnecessary; patients with temperature > 38.5°C or heart rate > 110 beats/minute or erythema extending beyond the wound margins for > 5 cm may require a short course (eg, 24–48 hours) of antibiotics and opening of the suture line; for intestinal or female genital tract operations with mixed flora, antibiotics considered suitable for treatment of intra-abdominal infection are appropriate, and when MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) risk is present the initial antibiotic should include vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline plus piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftriaxone and metronidazole for gram-negative and anaerobic coverage; for incision and drainage of superficial abscesses, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^112pM8B3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

ABSSSIs pose a significant burden to the healthcare system. The challenge of treating these infections has been lessened by recent development of new antibiotic treatment options that target gram-positive organisms including MRSA strains. However, new antibiotics that can cover both gram-positive pathogens (including MRSA) and gram-negative pathogens can fulfill an important need in the treatment of selected hospitalized patients with acute skin infections. Examples of such infections include abscesses with mixed bacterial growth, surgical-site infections, particularly those related to abdominal surgery, and selected acute skin infections in patients with diabetes. Furthermore, antibiotics that can offer hospital clinicians other attributes, such as the flexibility to transition from IV to oral formulation, infrequent dosing, pharmacokinetics that are unaffected by various patient characteristics, a low risk of drug–drug interactions, and no requirement for therapeutic monitoring, will be particularly useful when treating ABSSSIs.

### Empiric antimicrobial therapy for pediatric skin and soft-tissue infections in the era of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^115yTmVC]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to compare the clinical effectiveness of monotherapy with beta-lactams, clindamycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the outpatient management of nondrained noncultured skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs), in a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-endemic region.

Methods

A retrospective, nested, case-control trial was conducted with a cohort of patients from 5 urban pediatric practices in a community-acquired MRSA-endemic region. All subjects were treated as outpatients with oral monotherapy for nondrained noncultured SSTIs between January 2004 and March 2007. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as a drainage procedure, hospitalization, change in antibiotic, or second antibiotic prescription within 28 days.

Results

Of 2096 children with nondrained noncultured SSTIs, 104 (5.0%) were identified as experiencing treatment failure and were matched to 480 control subjects. Compared with beta-lactam therapy, clindamycin was equally effective but trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with an increased risk of failure. Other factors independently associated with failure included initial treatment in the emergency department, presence or history of fever, and presence of either induration or a small abscess.

Conclusions

Compared with beta-lactams, clindamycin monotherapy conferred no benefit, whereas trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with an increased risk of treatment failure in a cohort of children with nondrained noncultured SSTIs who were treated as outpatients. Even in regions with endemic community-acquired MRSA, beta-lactams may still be appropriate, first-line, empiric therapy for children presenting with these infections.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1149CyRV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset with fever and raised white blood cell count. As already reported in a previous paragraph, cellulitis has been recently classified as an ABSSSI together with erysipelas, SSIs, and major abscesses.

In a large European multicenter study, Garau et al. analyzed a population of patients diagnosed with complicated SSTI hospitalized between December 2010 and January 2011 reporting that cellulitis was the most frequent diagnosis accounting for 59.1% of the total. Streptococci cause diffuse, rapidly spreading infection; staphylococcal cellulitis is typically more localized.

Treatment should begin promptly with agents effective against the typical Gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci. If the cellulitis is very early and mild and no significant co-morbidities are present, oral beta-lactams might be sufficient in areas where CA-MRSA is not prevalent. Other available options are macrolides and lincosamides; however, resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin are increasing. Fluoroquinolones have been approved for the treatment of most uncomplicated cellulitis but are not adequate for treatment of MRSA infections. For more severe infections, parenteral route is the first choice.

If MRSA is suspected (both hospital acquired MRSA [HA-MRSA] and CA-MRSA), glycopeptides and newer antimicrobials are the best options. For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its borders. Additionally, simple abscesses do not extend into deeper tissues or have multiloculated extension. Cutaneous abscesses are typically caused by bacteria that represent the normal regional skin flora of the involved area.

TREATMENT GUIDELINES

Most recently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIs. This publication predates the FDA approval of several newer antibiotics for the treatment of ABSSSIs, including dalbavancin, oritavancin, tedizolid, and delafloxacin. The guidelines divide ABSSSIs into purulent and nonpurulent categories. Cellulitis and erysipelas are considered nonpurulent, while abscesses are categorized as purulent. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and telavancin are all considered appropriate antimicrobial agents for treatment of severe purulent infections, while trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are recommended for moderate purulent infections. For methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), cefazolin and clindamycin are recommended for severe infections and dicloxacillin and cephalexin for moderate infections. Vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam is recommended as a first-line treatment option for severe nonpurulent infections, particularly suspected necrotizing or polymicrobial infections. However, this combination has been associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury when compared with vancomycin with or without other beta-lactams. Options for treatment of mild to moderate nonpurulent infections include cefazolin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and penicillin. Although there is a lack of data to support the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, the guidelines recommend a treatment duration of 7–10 days.

Recent antibiotic development for ABSSSIs has focused largely on the coverage of gram-positive organisms, especially MRSA (Table 2). However, acute skin infections that involve gram-negative pathogens are associated with a potential risk for inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Clinicians need to consider risk factors for infections due to gram-negative pathogens in selected patients. Moreover, although gram-negative pathogens are commonly found in polymicrobial infections, they have also been observed in monomicrobial skin infections. Cultures with only gram-negative pathogens have been reported in approximately 13% of patients hospitalized with serious skin infections (not limited to ABSSSI), while mixed cultures have been found in 11%–21%. Selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected gram-negative skin infections should be guided by local epidemiologic patterns, as well as infection type and individual patient characteristics.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

Diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections

11) A rapidly progressive soft tissue infection should be always treated aggressively as a necrotizing soft tissue infection (Recommendation 1 C)

12) Both CT and MRI may be useful for diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infections. However MRI may be difficult to perform under emergency situations. (Recommendation 2 C).

13) In unstable patients, ultrasound may be useful to differentiate simple cellulitis from necrotizing fasciitis (Recommendation 2 C).

Management of patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

14) Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock caused by NSTI require early source control, antimicrobial therapy, and supportive treatment (Recommendation 1 C).

Source control in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

15) Surgical source control must be early and aggressive to halt progression of the inflammatory process caused by NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

Hyperbaric oxygen in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

16) Although the benefit of adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy remains controversial, it may be considered where it is available (Recommendation 2 C).

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^111Tviut]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Person-centred versus societal perspective (impact on antibiotic resistance)

The recommendations explicitly take a person-centred perspective rather than a public health or societal perspective. The use of antibiotics is associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance within the community and may increase the risk of antibiotic resistant infections in community members. The increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance are a public health priority. From a societal perspective, it is possible that the modest benefits from adjuvant antibiotics in this scenario would not outweigh the risk of increased antimicrobial resistance in the community. However, the impact of an individual course of antibiotics on community resistance rates is unknown. Therefore, whether antibiotics in this situation provide a net benefit or harm to society is highly speculative. Clinicians engaging in shared decision making can also address the issue of antibiotic resistance or the local prevalence of other pathogens (such as Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) positive Staphylococcus aureus) with patients facing this decision.

Practical issues and other considerations

Figure 2 outlines the key practical issues for patients and clinicians discussing initiating antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses after incision and drainage, which are also accessible as decision aids along with the evidence in an expanded format to support shared decision making in MAGICapp. The antibiotic course was typically five to 10 days in the RCTs, and dosing varied. TMP-SMX may slightly increase the risk of congenital malformations, including neural tube defects, when prescribed to pregnant women.

Costs and resources

TMP-SMX is inexpensive; clindamycin is probably more expensive in most places. However, the overall impact on costs to the individual and the healthcare payer are uncertain when the consequences of each option are considered.

### Management of skin and soft tissue infections in community practice before and after implementing a "best practice" approach: an Iowa research network (IRENE) intervention study [^113ScExV]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a major pathogen among skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). Most CA-MRSA infections are managed initially on an outpatient basis. It is critical that primary care clinicians recognize and appropriately treat patients suspected of having such infections.

Objective

To identify and evaluate best methods and procedures for primary care clinicians to manage skin and soft tissue infections.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Preintervention/postintervention study in eight Iowa Research Network offices conducted between October 2007 and August 2010. We reviewed medical records of 216 patients with SSTI before a set of interventions (preintervention) and 118 patients after the intervention (postintervention).

Interventions

Included a focus group meeting at each office, distribution of a modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) algorithm, "Outpatient Management of MRSA Skin and Soft Tissue Infections", education handouts, and an office policy for patients with skin infections.

Main Outcome Measures

Proportion of subjects who were prescribed an antibiotic that would cover MRSA at the initial visit and proportion who were prescribed an antibiotic that would cover MRSA at any time.

Results

Three hundred sixty-eight forms (244 preintervention and 124 postintervention) were returned; 216 (89%) preintervention forms and 118 (95%) postintervention forms were usable. Multivariable logistic regression models found statistically significant and independent factors associated with MRSA coverage at the initial visit included being in the postintervention rather than the preintervention group, having an abscess component compared with cellulitis alone, having a culture sent, being prescribed two or fewer antibiotics, and not being hospitalized.

Conclusions

The CDC algorithm was feasible for offices to use. Following a discussion of SSTI management in the outpatient setting, use of MRSA coverage increased both initially and overall. Thus, involving clinicians in a discussion about guidelines rather than simply providing guidelines or a didactic session may be a useful way to change physician practices.

### Emergency department treatment failures for skin infections in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^112BapC9]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite rapidly increasing incidence of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) presenting to emergency departments (EDs), outcome data for these infections are limited.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of children with culture-positive SSTI, managed as outpatients from a large pediatric ED in the year 2006. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as presence of 1 or more of the following: (1) change in antibiotic owing to poor clinical response, (2) subsequent incision and drainage, or (3) hospitalization. Demographics, isolated pathogens, and therapeutics were also assessed. To accurately capture the outcome of interest, only children who are observed in the hospital-based primary care network were included.

Results

Among 148 eligible subjects, there were 158 SSTIs including 131 abscesses, 19 folliculitis, and 8 cellulitis. Mean age was 9.1 ± 6.2 years, 41.2% were male, and 94.6% were African American. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was isolated in 66%, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) in 21%, and others in 13%. Outcome data were available for 144 subjects (97.2%). Emergency department treatment failure rate was 7.6% (95% confidence interval, 3.3%-12.0%); 10 of 11 failures were abscesses. Only S. aureus produced treatment failure and occurred in 13.3% of MSSA and 6.4% MRSA infections (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.5–7.1). An antibiotic to which the organism was sensitive was prescribed for 9 (81.8%) of 11 treatment failures and did not differ between MRSA and MSSA; appropriate antibiotics were used in 91.5% of treatment successes.

Conclusions

The rate of ED treatment failure for SSTI is low and is more likely to occur with S. aureus infection, irrespective of methicillin resistance or appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Vancomycin 25–30 mg/kg loading dose then 15–20 mg/kg/dose every 12 h
Linezolid 600 mg every 12 h
In patients at risk for Gram-negative infections or severe forms who do not respond to first-line therapy consider
Piperacillin/tazobactam 4,5 g every 6 h.

Culture is not recommended as principle for identifying the causative bacteria in cellulitis patients. However, in immunosuppressed patients or those with neutropenia or in severe forms associated with systemic signs of inflammation or that do not respond to first-line therapy, culture may be helpful to identify the causative bacteria and define a targeted therapy.

Cellulitis in following situations can be life-threatening thus requiring early diagnosis and prompt intervention:

Orbital cellulitis The infection usually spreads from paranasal sinuses and the patient presents with proptosis, chemosis, ophthalmoplegia and diminished vision due to pressure on optic nerve. Uncontrolled infection may have intra-cranial extension leading to cavernous sinus thrombosis and meningitis. Early intravenous empirical antibiotic therapy is required. Surgical drainage is required in progressive disease to prevent loss of vision.

Ludwigs angina It is cellulitis of submandibular region occurring deep to deep cervical fascia leading to brawny induration in this region with edema of floor of the mouth. Untreated cases may have laryngeal edema and stridor. In case of no response to antibiotics, liberal fasciotomy of deep cervical fascia in the submandibular region is required.

### Methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: management principles and selection of antibiotic therapy [^112XFSfn]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

Strains of community-acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) have emerged as an important group of pathogens. Most infections present as cutaneous abscess and most of these may respond to drainage alone. Sulfonamide and tetracycline antibiotics remain valuable agents for most CA-MRSA infections, but inducible resistance to clindamycin is problematic in some areas. Linezolid, and the newer parenteral antibiotics should be reserved for serious infections.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^1111axwo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Considerable variation in the resistance rates of S. aureus to methicillin (or oxacillin) has been noted between continents, with the highest rates in North America (35.9%), followed by Latin America (29.4%) and Europe (22.8%).

Although MRSA has been usually acquired during exposure in hospitals and other healthcare facilities (HA-MRSA), there has been a recent increase in MRSA infections presenting in the community (CA-MRSA).

CA-MRSA strains are genetically and phenotypically distinct from HA-MRSA. They may be susceptible to a wider range of anti-staphylococcal antimicrobials (some are resistant only to β-lactams). Populations at increased risk for CA-MRSA are listed below:
Children < 2 years old
Athletes (mainly contact-sport participants)
Injection drug users
Men who have sex with men
Military personnel
Inmates of correctional facilities, residential homes or shelters
Vets, pet owners and pig farmers
Patients with post-flu-like illness and/or severe pneumonia
Patients with concurrent SSTI
History of colonization or recent infection with CA-MRSA
History of antibiotic consumption in the previous year, particularly quinolones or macrolides

CA-MRSA infections are becoming increasingly common. They can have a rapid and devastating course and may produce the pathogenic Panton–Valentine leucocidin toxin (PVL), which destroys white blood cells and is an important virulence factor.

Antibiotics recommended for CA-MRSA infections are listed below.

Outpatient treatment:

Minocycline100 mg q12h
or
Trimethoprim and Sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg q12h

Treatment of Skin Infections

Bacterial Infections

Effective management of recurrent skin infections involves identifying and treating the underlying microbiologic agent, and implementing infection prevention measures. If left untreated, skin infections can become systemic and lead to life-threatening complications.

Topical and systemic antibiotics may be necessary to treat bacterial infections. However, antibiotics should only be used in clinically affected AD, as indiscriminate use increases the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant strains, which poses a therapeutic challenge. Choice of treatment depends on local patterns of antibacterial resistance, particularly the prevalence of MRSA. Culture of the causative pathogen is recommended to guide therapy, but empiric therapy is reasonable in uncomplicated cases or before culture results become available.

Table 2 summarises the guideline-recommended antibacterial options for empiric treatment of skin infections and when they are indicated. Topical antibacterial agents can be used for the treatment of localised skin infections and decolonisation. For uncomplicated, non-purulent skin infections, preferred empiric antibacterial treatments are usually oral β-lactam antibiotics, such as a penicillin or cephalosporin. In patients with AD and a skin abscess, oral antibiotics such as clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or linezolid can be considered. Infections occurring in countries/regions with a high prevalence of MRSA require treatment with agents that are active against MRSA (e.g. trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, clindamycin, tetracyclines [doxycycline or minocycline], vancomycin or linezolid) and complicated infections may require agents active against Gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam). MRSA-associated AD flares are difficult to treat with TCS because of corticosteroid resistance induced by staphylococcal superantigens. In such a situation, prolonged use of corticosteroids may lead to skin atrophy and adrenal insufficiency, so alternative AD therapy should be considered.

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in community-acquired skin infections [^117Qe97N]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The Study

We participated in several clinical trials of antimicrobial drugs for SSTI for which cultures were obtained from all enrolled patients. This opportunity made it possible for us to determine the prevalence of CA-MRSA among a group of emergency department patients with SSTIs. This report describes the proportion of emergency department patients with community-acquired SSTIs due to MRSA.

The study was performed in a county-owned hospital in the Los Angeles, California (USA) area, which serves a largely uninsured, low-income population. More than 43,000 persons are treated in the emergency department each year. At the hospital, we have participated in a number of clinical trials of various antimicrobial agents for treating SSTIs. All patients enrolled in these studies had cultures obtained from the infected site. Eligibility criteria for the studies included age ≥ 18 and an SSTI with purulent material available for culture. One study included patients with uncomplicated infections that were suitable for outpatient treatment with oral agents. Patients were also enrolled in 3 studies of complicated infections for which the treating physicians believed admission for intravenous antimicrobial drugs was indicated. Patients were excluded if they had previously received antimicrobial drugs for the infection, unless antimicrobial drugs had been taken for > 72 hours with treatment failure. Patients were also excluded if they had simple abscesses that did not require antimicrobial agents, if they had severe infections involving bone or joint, or if they required amputation of an affected limb.

### Staphylococcus aureus-associated skin and soft tissue infections in ambulatory care [^112uKtxe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is the almost-universal cause of furuncles, carbuncles, and skin abscesses and worldwide is the most commonly identified agent responsible for skin and soft tissue infections. S. aureus skin and soft tissue infections frequently begin as minor boils or abscesses and may progress to severe infections involving muscle or bone and may disseminate to the lungs or heart valves (i.e. endocarditis). Treatment of early infections consists of incising and draining the lesion, often accompanied by β-lactam antimicrobial drugs, which are also effective against β-hemolytic streptococci.

Strains resistant to β-lactam antimicrobial drugs, termed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), were recognized from the 1960s through the 1990s as healthcare-associated (HA) pathogens. In the late 1990s, MRSA disease without established healthcare risk factors, called community-associated (CA)–MRSA, was increasingly reported in the literature. A study conducted in 2004 in emergency departments in 11 US cities found that MRSA was isolated from 59% of patients with skin and soft tissue infections. The biology of CA-MRSA appears to differ from that of HA-MRSA and CA–methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), perhaps allowing CA-MRSA to cause disease other than that expected from MSSA. As HA-MRSA emerged, it likely did not merely replace HA-MSSA but led to an overall increase in S. aureus infections in healthcare settings.

Because most skin and soft tissue infections are treated in outpatient settings with empiric antimicrobial therapy, few studies have attempted to estimate the number of S. aureus skin and soft tissue infections, and none have evaluated the antimicrobial drugs prescribed for these conditions. Therefore, with regard to skin and soft tissue infections likely caused by S. aureus, we 1) estimated the number and rate of ambulatory care visits in the United States during 2 periods and examined any changes in these estimates between these periods; 2) described patient demographic characteristics; and 3) characterized antimicrobial and outpatient surgical therapy provided. Our results are based on a secondary data analysis of the 1992–1994 and 2001–2003 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (NHAMCS).

Anorectal abscess — antibiotics after incision and drainage: Routine postoperative antibiotics for a routine, uncomplicated abscess in a healthy patient do not improve healing or recurrence and are typically not recommended; antibiotics may be used selectively for abscesses with cellulitis, systemic illness, or immunosuppression, and the recommendation grade was changed from 2C to 2B. Supporting data include a retrospective series of 172 patients undergoing incision and drainage with (n = 64) or without (n = 108) 5 to 7 days of oral antibiotics reporting 9% repeat surgery with no significant group difference; a single-blinded randomized trial of 307 patients found at 3 months that fistula developed in 14% with a 7-day ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole course versus 30% in controls (p < 0.001), whereas a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded multicenter trial of 334 patients showed no protective effect. Additional considerations are that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has been reported in up to 33% of patients, for which a combination of drainage and antibiotics is typically recommended for patients with systemic signs of sepsis, leukocytosis, or leukopenia; microbial cultures should also be considered for recurrent infection or nonhealing wounds; and in immunosuppressed settings, patients with a higher absolute neutrophil count (ie, > 1000/mm3) and fluctuance typically do well with drainage, whereas those with lower counts and lack of fluctuance may initially be treated with antibiotics alone.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^114CSRxj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections — culture indications and specimen approach emphasize that for the common forms of SSTIs, cultures are not indicated for uncomplicated infections (cellulitis, subcutaneous abscesses) treated in the outpatient setting, and whether lesion or tissue cultures are beneficial in managing cellulitis in the hospitalized patient is uncertain and the sensitivity of blood cultures in this setting is low; cultures are indicated for the patient who requires operative incision and drainage because of risk for deep structure and underlying tissue involvement. In this section, cutaneous infections, involving skin and soft tissue, have been expanded and categorized as follows: trauma-associated, surgical site, burn wound, fungal, viral, human and animal bites, and device-related, and although S. aureus, especially MRSA, and S. pyogenes are the causative agents in the majority of these infections, other microorganisms, including fungi and viruses, are important and require appropriate medical and therapeutic management. At minimum, a Gram stain should be performed to assess and characterize indicators of surface contamination or infection combined with a description of morphotypes.

### Acute bacterial skin infections: developments since the 2005 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines [^114maJKF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) commonly present to Emergency Departments (EDs) where physicians encounter a wide spectrum of disease severity. The prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has increased in the past decade, and CA-MRSA is now a predominant cause of purulent ABSSSI in the United States (US).

Objectives

This article reviews significant developments since the most recent Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the management of ABSSSI in the CA-MRSA era, focusing on recent studies and recommendations for managing CA-MRSA, newer antimicrobials with improved MRSA activity, new diagnostic technologies, and options for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT).

Discussion

The increasing prevalence of CA-MRSA has led the IDSA and other organizations to recommend empiric coverage of CA-MRSA for purulent ABSSSI. The availability of rapid MRSA detection assays from skin and soft tissue swabs could potentially facilitate earlier selection of targeted antimicrobial therapy. Several newer intravenous antibiotics with expanded MRSA coverage, including ceftaroline fosamil, daptomycin, linezolid, and telavancin, may be utilized for treatment of ABSSSI. OPAT may be an option for intravenous administration of antibiotics in selected patients and may prevent or shorten hospitalizations, decrease readmission rates, and reduce nosocomial infections and complications.

Conclusion

The growing prevalence of CA-MRSA associated with ABSSSI in the US has a significant impact on clinical management decisions in the ED. Recent availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options may help meet the demand for effective antistaphylococcal agents.

Evidence grading — downgrading rules and definitions specify that randomized, controlled trials start at a high level of evidence strength, while observational studies (cohort and case-control studies) start at a low level, and that characteristics decreasing strength are risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Downgrading for risk of bias was done if 50% or more of the studies evaluated for a given outcome were at medium or high overall risk of bias, with a downgrade by 2 points if 50% or more were at high overall risk of bias, otherwise by 1 point. Downgrading for inconsistency was done when heterogeneity in effects across studies for a given outcome could not be explained. Downgrading for indirectness was done if 50% or more of the studies evaluating the given outcome suffered from indirectness. Imprecision was considered present when the width of the confidence interval spanned more than 1 logarithm on a base 10 scale, and downgrading for imprecision was also done when more than 50% of studies suffered from imprecision or if there was only 1 study evaluating a particular outcome. Reporting bias includes publication, outcome reporting, and analysis reporting biases, and downgrading for reporting bias was done when a likelihood of outcome or analysis reporting bias was detected in 50% or more of the studies evaluating the given outcome.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^114WJkTq]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

For uncomplicated skin abscesses, we suggest using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or clindamycin in addition to incision and drainage rather than incision and drainage alone, and emphasise the need for shared decision making
TMP-SMX or clindamycin modestly reduces pain and treatment failure and probably reduces abscess recurrence, but increases the risk of adverse effects including nausea and diarrhoea
We suggest TMP-SMX rather than clindamycin because TMP-SMX has a lower risk of diarrhoea
Cephalosporins in addition to incision and drainage are probably not more effective than incision and drainage alone in most settings
From a societal perspective, the modest benefits from adjuvant antibiotics may not outweigh the harms from increased antimicrobial resistance in the community, although this is speculative

### Antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infections: the challenge of outpatient therapy [^115w8uoj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are becoming increasingly prevalent in both community and hospital settings. Certain strains are notorious for causing skin and soft tissue infections in patients with no established risk factors. In this article, we report our findings on the dynamic antibiotic resistance pattern of MRSA and outpatient prescription trend for skin and soft tissue infections within our community.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective medical record review of 1876 patients evaluated in the emergency department of an urban community hospital from 2003 to 2012. Data regarding culture isolates and associated antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic treatment, site of specimen collection, age, race, and sex were collected and analyzed.

Results

Analysis of 1879 culture specimens yielded 2193 isolates. In some cases, a single specimen yielded polymicrobial growth. Staphylococcus aureus represented 996 isolates (45.4%); 463 were methicillin-susceptible (21.1%) and 533 (24.3%) were methicillin-resistant. Most patients were prescribed a single- or poly-drug regimen of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin, and clindamycin. Antimicrobial resistance analysis indicated that MRSA became increasingly resistant to the aforementioned antibiotics over time: 10% and 6% in 2012 vs 3.5% and 3.4% in 2007 for clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respectively.

Conclusion

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a particularly virulent, rapidly adaptive pathogen that is becoming increasingly difficult to combat with existing antibiotics. Care must be taken to ensure appropriate treatment and follow-up of patients with known MRSA infections.

The clinical presentation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection ranges from asymptomatic colonization to cutaneous and invasive involvement. This review discusses the cutaneous presentations of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) and hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) that one may encounter in the hospital or outpatient setting. Cutaneous CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA are often clinically indistinguishable, although they have different epidemiologic profiles and virulence factors. Bacterial culture is necessary for diagnosis and guides treatment, as infection with CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA require distinct clinical management. Guidelines for surgical interventions and antibiotic treatment of CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA will be discussed. Strategies for MRSA decolonization and prevention of further spread will also be reviewed.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^116XRX5P]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

For empirical coverage of CA-MRSA in outpatients with SSTI, oral antibiotic options include clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline), and linezolid. If coverage for both β-hemolytic streptococci and CA-MRSA is required, options include clindamycin alone or TMP-SMX or a tetracycline in association with a β-lactam (eg, amoxicillin) or linezolid alone.

For hospitalized patients with severe SSTI, in addition to surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics, empirical therapy for MRSA should be considered, pending culture data. Options include intravenous (IV) vancomycin, PO or IV linezolid 600 mg twice daily, daptomycin 4 mg/kg/dose IV once daily, clindamycin 600 mg IV or PO 3 times a day, tigecycline 100 mg IV LD, then 50 mg twice daily.

Glycopeptides have been for many years the microbiological agents of choice for difficult Gram positive infections. Fortunately, staphylococcal resistance to glycopeptides remains rare, although rising minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of glycopeptides may affect the efficacy of these antibiotics.

Increased resistance to glycopeptides has encouraged the development of new agents active against Gram-positive bacteria, particularly for severe soft tissue infections where an aggressive antimicrobial management is always recommended, such as linezolid, tigecycline and daptomycin.

Linezolid has been considered an agent of choice in complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs), It has the advantages of early intravenous-to-oral switch with the oral preparation having very high bioavailability and excellent tissue penetration.

In 2010 an open-label study compared oral or intravenous linezolid with intravenous vancomycin for treatment of cSSTIs caused by MRSA.

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as a common cause of vulvar abscesses [^116uR3xZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among women with vulvar abscesses and to describe clinical factors associated with inpatient compared with outpatient treatment.

Methods

We reviewed all women with a vulvar abscess who were treated with incision and drainage between October 2006 to March 2008. We reviewed the abscess cultures and evaluated clinical and laboratory variables associated with inpatient compared with outpatient treatment.

Results

During the 80-week study period, 162 women were treated for a vulvar abscess. Methicillin-resistant S aureus was isolated from 85 of 133 (64%) cultured vulvar abscesses. No presenting signs or symptoms were more common among patients with MRSA abscesses. Women with an MRSA vulvar abscess were not more likely to require inpatient admission or experience treatment complications. Inpatient treatment occurred in 64 of 162 (40%) patients and was predicted by medical comorbidities: diabetes (45.3%, odds ratio [OR] 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–4.72), hypertension (34.4%, OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06–5.13), initial serum glucose greater than 200 (37.5%, OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.48–7.51), and signs of worse infection, ie, larger abscesses (mean 5.2 cm) (P < .001) and elevated white blood cell count of at least 12,000/mm3 (45.3%, OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.44–6.43).

Conclusion

Methicillin-resistant S aureus was the most common organism isolated from vulvar abscesses. Inpatient treatment is more common in women with medical comorbidities, larger abscesses, and signs of systemic illness. An antibiotic regimen with activity against MRSA, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, should be considered in similar populations with vulvar abscesses.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114pSATx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: an evidence-based review [^11689GoD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and abscess are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatient.

Conclusions

It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### Microbiology and initial antibiotic therapy for injection drug users and non-injection drug users with cutaneous abscesses in the era of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^114j7ABt]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The incidence of cutaneous abscesses has increased markedly since the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). Injection drug use is a risk factor for abscesses and may affect the microbiology and treatment of these infections. In a cohort of patients hospitalized with cutaneous abscesses in the era of CA-MRSA, the objectives were to compare the microbiology of abscesses between injection drug users and non-injection drug users and evaluate antibiotic therapy started in the emergency department (ED) in relation to microbiologic findings and national guideline treatment recommendations.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of two published retrospective cohorts of patients requiring hospitalization for acute bacterial skin infections between January 1, 2007, and May 31, 2012, in seven academic and community hospitals in Colorado. In the subgroup of patients with cutaneous abscesses, microbiologic findings and the antibiotic regimens started in the ED were compared between injection drug users and non-injection drug users. Antibiotic regimens involving multiple agents, lack of activity against MRSA, or an agent with broad Gram-negative activity were classified as discordant with Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline treatment recommendations.

Results

Of 323 patients with cutaneous abscesses, 104 (32%) occurred in injection drug users. Among the 235 cases where at least one microorganism was identified by culture, S. aureus was identified less commonly among injection drug users compared with non-injection drug users (55% vs. 75%, p = 0.003), with similar patterns observed for MRSA (33% vs. 47%, p = 0.054) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (17% vs. 26%, p = 0.11). In contrast to S. aureus, streptococcal species (53% vs. 25%, p < 0.001) and anaerobic organisms (29% vs. 10%, p < 0.001) were identified more commonly among injection drug users. Of 88 injection drug users and 186 non-injection drug users for whom antibiotics were started in the ED, the antibiotic regimens were discordant with IDSA guideline recommendations in 47 (53%) and 101 (54%), respectively (p = 0.89). In cases where MRSA was ultimately identified, the antibiotic regimen started in the ED lacked activity against this pathogen in 14% of cases.

Conclusions

Compared with non-injection drug users, cutaneous abscesses in injection drug users were less likely to involve S. aureus, including MRSA, and more likely to involve streptococci and anaerobes; however, MRSA was common in both groups. Antibiotic regimens started in the ED were discordant with national guidelines in over half of cases and often lacked activity against MRSA when this pathogen was present.

### 2018 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline for the management of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^111uFu4g]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

OPAT risk of bias assessment — tools, domains, and criteria: The Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was used to assess risk of bias for cohort and case control studies, and the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool for clinical trials, with risk of bias independently checked by 3 reviewers for each study. A summary assessment of "overall risk of bias" grouped NOS criteria into 3 domains and Cochrane criteria into 4 domains. For observational studies, an individual study was considered at "high" overall risk of bias if it lacked 1 or more stars in each of the 3 domains or if it lacked all stars in 1 domain and 2 or more stars in other domains, and was considered medium risk if it lacked stars in 1 domain or in at least 2 domains. Each clinical trial was examined and rated across 7 domains and considered "high" overall risk of bias if assigned a "high" risk rating for 1 or more discrete criteria in at least 2 domains; "medium" overall risk applied if assigned a "high" risk rating in only 1 domain or at "unclear" risk of bias in 1 or more discrete criteria in at least 2 domains.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111aNudS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^113QrJ7t]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs) are a common reason for seeking care at acute healthcare facilities, including emergency departments. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism associated with these infections, and the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has represented a considerable challenge in their treatment. To address this need, a number of new antibiotics have been developed for the treatment of ABSSSIs in the past several years. Most of these agents focus primarily on gram-positive organisms, particularly MRSA; however, there has not been an oral agent that can reliably treat MRSA, as well as relevant gram-negative pathogens. Acute skin infections that involve mixed gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens must also be considered as they can be associated with discordant antimicrobial therapy. Here, I review ABSSSI treatment guidelines in the hospital setting and discuss current and future antibiotic options for treatment of this commonly encountered infection.

### Pediatric community-acquired brain abscesses: a single-center retrospective study [^112YQff4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

There are other limitations to our study. It is a single-center investigation relying on retrospective data spanning the past 24 years. Given the significant changes in medical treatment and infrastructure during this period, larger cohorts and prospective studies should be carried out to further solidify the findings. Additionally, electronic documentation was implemented in 2016, the access to paper record-based data from before was more limited.

Nonetheless, our study underlines the importance of considering the patient population when choosing antimicrobial therapy, even in cases of community-acquired brain abscesses. The recent recommendations from the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases propose a conditional approach, suggesting that in the absence of severe conditions such as sepsis, imminent rupture or impending herniation, antimicrobials may be withheld until aspiration or excision of the brain abscess can be performed within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within 24 hours of radiological assessment. In instances where the patient is clinically unstable, an empirical treatment with the recommended combination of a 3rd generation cephalosporin and metronidazole is adequate for most detected pathogens in our cohort, especially in the most frequent group of S. intermedius infections. However, our data suggest that it may be prudent to include an effective antibiotic targeting S. aureus, such as high-dose intravenous Flucloxacillin. In some cases, when tested sensitive, cotrimoxazol can also be an option. Potential alternative treatment options pose disadvantages for various reasons. Clindamycin exhibits limited penetration in the central nervous system and current antibiotic stewardship guidelines recommend avoiding 3rd generation cephalosporin if possible. In patient populations with a high prevalence of MRSA, linezolid or vancomycin may be considered, with the latter suffering from poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier.

### Factors associated with emergency department methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus coverage in patients with skin and soft tissue infections in an urban, tertiary care emergency department [^116ywsAx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common and contribute significantly to morbidity and healthcare costs in emergency departments (EDs). The rise of antimicrobial resistance, particularly due to community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), complicates treatment decisions. Objective physical examination findings suggesting need for empiric MRSA coverage are sometimes ignored. Improving initial antimicrobial selection in the ED, especially regarding MRSA, could enhance antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of patient records for those who presented with SSTIs to an urban tertiary care ED between January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2019. Patients admitted during their initial visit were excluded. Data collected included demographics, vital signs, and laboratory results. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with the decision to provide MRSA coverage at presentation, reporting odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Among 1675 patients, 42.2% received empiric MRSA coverage. Factors associated with MRSA coverage included male gender, white race, intravenous drug use, immunocompromised status, systemic symptoms, tachycardia, presence of abscess, and surgical consultation. After adjusting for confounders, male gender, history of intravenous drug use, immunocompromised status, systemic symptoms, tachycardia, surgical consultation, and recent antibiotic use remained significantly associated.

Conclusion

Several factors, not always aligned with clinical guidelines, influenced the decision to initiate MRSA coverage in the ED. Understanding these determinants may improve antimicrobial stewardship and reduce costs. Future research should focus on patient outcomes based on methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) versus MRSA coverage decisions and educational initiatives to improve guideline compliance.

### Mrsa bone and joint… [^1131cRoq]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Skin and Soft-Tissue Infections in Community-Associated MRSA Simple abscesses or boils may be managed with incision and drainage alone; more data are needed on the use of antibiotics in this setting. Antibiotics are recommended for patients who have abscesses associated with severe or extensive disease or rapid progression in the presence of associated cellulitis; signs and symptoms of systemic illness; associated comorbidities or immunosuppression; very young or very old age; abscesses in areas difficult to drain; associated septic phlebitis; or lack of response to incision and drainage alone. Empiric therapy for five to 10 days is recommended pending culture results for outpatients with purulent cellulitis. Infection from β-hemolytic streptococci does not usually require empiric therapy.

For those with nonpurulent cellulitis, five to 10 days of empiric therapy for β-hemolytic streptococcal infection is recommended, based on the patient's clinical response. Empiric coverage for community-associated MRSA is recommended in patients who do not respond to beta-lactam antibiotics, and also may be considered in those with systemic toxicity. Oral antibiotic options for treating skin and soft-tissue infections in patients with community-associated MRSA include clindamycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, a tetracycline, and linezolid. A beta-lactam antibiotic may be considered in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. MRSA-active therapy may be modified if there is no clinical response. Treatment for seven to 14 days is recommended, but should be individualized to the patient's clinical response.

Cultures from abscesses and other purulent infections are recommended in patients who have received antibiotic therapy, those with severe local infection or signs of systemic illness, and those who have not responded adequately to initial treatment. Cultures are also recommended if there is concern of a cluster or outbreak. Some experts recommend adding oral rifampin to the chosen antibiotic. For patients with concurrent bacteremia, rifampin should be added after bacteremia has cleared.

### Outpatient management… [^116tzahZ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Outpatient Management CDC encourages clinicians to consider MRSA in the differential diagnosis of skin and soft tissue infections compatible with S. aureus infections, especially those that are purulent. A patient's presenting complaint of "spider bite" should raise suspicion of an S. aureus infection. Recent data suggest that MRSA as a cause of skin infections in the general community remains at high probability. The spectrum of disease caused by MRSA appears to be similar to that of Staphylococcus aureus in the community. SSTIs, specifically furuncles, carbuncles, and abscesses, are the most frequently reported clinical manifestations.

The role of MRSA in cellulitis without abscess or purulent drainage is less clear since cultures are rarely obtained.

- Infectious Diseases Society of America external icon. In the community, incision and drainage remains the primary therapy for these purulent skin infections. Empiric antibiotic coverage for MRSA may be warranted in addition to incision and drainage based on clinical assessment. Antibiotic treatment, if indicated, should be guided by the susceptibility profile of the organism.

Obtaining specimens for culture and susceptibility testing is useful to guide therapy, particularly for those with more severe infections and those who fail to respond adequately to initial management. MRSA skin infections can develop into more serious infections. It is important to discuss a follow-up plan with your patients in case they develop systemic symptoms or worsening local symptoms, or if symptoms do not improve within 48 hours.

### Recommended treatments for community-acquired MRSA infections… [^113BHvRB]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

S. aureus treatments such as antistaphylococcal penicillins and cephalosporins, U. S. physicians have prescribed a variety of other antibiotics to treat these infections *. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the agent most commonly used to treat adults with community-acquired MRSA infections in the United States. In vitro evidence suggests TMP/SMX has greater bactericidal activity against community-acquired MRSA than linezolid, rifampin, clindamycin, or minocycline. Long-acting tetracyclines were successfully used in Japan for MRSA infections before the availability of vancomycin.

A clinical review found response rates between 80 to 100 percent with these agents, and one small prospective trial reported a 100 percent response rate in doxycycline-treated patients after incision and drainage of MRSA abscesses. However, resistance of community-acquired MRSA to these agents has been reported on both coasts in the United States. Rifampin has excellent in vitro activity against community-acquired MRSA, but it cannot be used by itself because of rapid development of resistance, which can occur during active treatment. Combining rifampin with TMP/SMX, or fusidic acid where available, may be more effective than using either agent alone. Linezolid is the only oral agent with demonstrated effectiveness against MRSA in controlled trials, but its use has been restricted because it is expensive. Parenteral therapy is available for serious community-acquired MRSA infections. Vancomycin remains the first choice for MRSA therapy.

There have been reports of resistance to vancomycin through a heteroresistance mechanism, but this is not easily identified with clinical microbiology testing and requires special detection techniques. Although daptomycin has not been widely studied for treatment of community-acquired MRSA, it has recently been approved for treating bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis caused by.
