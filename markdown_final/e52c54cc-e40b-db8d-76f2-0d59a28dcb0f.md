## Question

New guidelie in treating asthma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the new guidelines in treating asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which guideline sources are most authoritative and current. Then, I should verify the major paradigm shifts and how they differ from older approaches. Next, I will examine the stepwise treatment algorithms, including Track 1 versus Track 2 and SMART/MART. After that, I need to check special populations and implementation nuances. Finally, I will synthesize practical takeaways and acknowledge controversies or gaps, making sure I cite the most recent GINA and NAEPP documents throughout.

> Let me first confirm the primary sources. GINA 2024/2025 is the most current, globally applicable strategy updated annually, while NAEPP 2020 is the most recent U.S. focused update using GRADE methodology; both are the anchors for this summary, and I should double-check that I'm aligning with their latest iterations before proceeding [^113jgRQU] [^111eRZXy] [^11152fzZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the overarching paradigm shift. The most consequential change is the move away from SABA-only treatment and toward anti-inflammatory reliever strategies, with GINA recommending that no patient should be treated with SABA alone because of increased exacerbation risk and lack of anti-inflammatory effect, which is a departure from older stepwise models that allowed SABA-only in intermittent asthma [^113jgRQU].

> I will now examine the new stepwise framework. GINA divides adults and adolescents into Track 1 (preferred) and Track 2 (alternative). Track 1 uses low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed for Steps 1–2 and maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with ICS-formoterol for Steps 3–5, while Track 2 retains SABA as reliever with daily ICS or ICS-LABA, reflecting a more conservative approach where ICS-formoterol is not available or acceptable [^111224H3].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for SMART/MART. Large randomized trials show that as-needed ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by at least 60% versus SABA alone in mild asthma, with similar or better outcomes than daily ICS plus SABA, which underpins GINA's preference for Track 1; NAEPP 2020 conditionally supports SMART in selected patients, reflecting more cautious U.S. adoption and regulatory constraints [^112uwgAT] [^116Fwu3c] [^111KPxZK].

> Next, I should review pediatric specifics. For children 6–11 years, GINA now includes ICS-formoterol options at Steps 3–4 and emphasizes regular reassessment; for preschool children, GINA advises against SABA-only and supports ICS-containing therapy when asthma is likely, with careful diagnostic uncertainty given the prevalence of viral wheeze in this age group [^111224H3] [^112uwgAT].

> I need to ensure I capture severe asthma advances. Both GINA and specialty society guidance endorse phenotype-guided biologics for Type 2–high severe asthma, with anti-IgE, anti–IL-5/5R, and anti–IL-4R agents as options; selection should be driven by biomarkers such as blood eosinophils, FeNO, and allergic status, acknowledging that NAEPP 2020 did not cover biologics due to timing and scope limits [^112uwgAT] [^116pkF4Q] [^114Tjudn].

> Let me consider add-on therapies and special situations. GINA supports LAMA add-on in Steps 4–5 for adults and adolescents with persistent symptoms, and NAEPP 2020 conditionally recommends LAMA as an add-on when LABA is not used or is insufficient; FeNO-guided strategies can reduce exacerbations in selected patients, and sputum eosinophil–guided treatment is reasonable in experienced centers for difficult-to-treat asthma [^112uwgAT] [^114zsbfj] [^116GedJP] [^116vEoQh].

> I should double-check implementation principles. Both guidelines emphasize treat-to-target, regular review every 3–12 months, and step-down after 3 months of good control; GINA advises reducing ICS by 25–50% at 3-month intervals and warns that abrupt ICS withdrawal increases exacerbation risk, reinforcing the need for gradual, monitored de-escalation [^117WXWT7] [^116ggyuk].

> But wait, what about real-world adoption and controversies. SMART adoption in the U.S. faces barriers including FDA labeling, limited device options, payer coverage, and clinician inertia; additionally, concerns about industry influence on SMART trials and guideline positions have been raised, so shared decision-making and local adaptation are essential to navigate these issues responsibly [^116Fwu3c] [^1125Ea9Y].

> Let me synthesize practical takeaways. For adults and adolescents, prefer Track 1 with ICS-formoterol as needed or MART depending on step, avoid SABA-only, and escalate thoughtfully; for children 6–11, incorporate ICS-formoterol at higher steps and reassess frequently; for severe, uncontrolled asthma, phenotype and biomarker-guided biologics are indicated; across ages, prioritize inhaler technique, adherence, trigger mitigation, and equitable access to care to close implementation gaps [^112uwgAT] [^111224H3] [^1139aC4H].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought NAEPP 2020 endorsed SMART as preferred for mild persistent asthma; hold on, I should verify and correct that. NAEPP 2020 actually presents SMART as a conditional option for mild persistent asthma and reserves stronger support for moderate persistent disease, whereas GINA positions ICS-formoterol as preferred across Steps 1–5 in Track 1, so I need to be precise about that distinction in counseling and documentation [^112uwgAT].

---

The new asthma guidelines emphasize **ICS-containing therapy for all patients** [^112uwgAT] to reduce exacerbation risk, with **SMART/MART as preferred care** for adults and adolescents [^112uwgAT] and as-needed ICS-formoterol for mild asthma [^112uwgAT]. SABA-only treatment is discouraged due to increased risk [^112uwgAT]. For severe asthma, **biologics are recommended** [^116pkF4Q] based on phenotype/endotype, and FeNO is suggested to guide therapy in selected patients [^117Aq171]. Treatment is individualized, with regular review and step-up/down based on control and risk [^112CysyE] [^117WXWT7].

---

## Key changes in the new guidelines

### 1. Universal ICS-containing therapy

- **ICS for all**: All adults, adolescents, and most children should receive ICS-containing therapy to reduce exacerbation risk [^112uwgAT] [^114P9Uja].
- **SMART/MART**: Preferred for adults/adolescents; ICS-formoterol used daily and as needed [^112uwgAT] [^116GSdob].
- **Mild asthma**: As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol is preferred over SABA-only [^112uwgAT] [^114P9Uja].

---

### 2. Discouragement of SABA-only treatment

Avoid **SABA-only** because of increased exacerbation risk and lack of anti-inflammatory benefit [^112uwgAT] [^114P9Uja].

---

### 3. Personalized and phenotype-guided therapy

- **Biologics**: Recommended for severe asthma based on phenotype/endotype (e.g. anti-IgE, anti-IL5, anti-IL4R) [^112uwgAT] [^116pkEyz].
- **FeNO**: Use to guide therapy and reduce exacerbations in selected patients [^117Aq171] [^116GedJP].
- **Individualization**: Tailor treatment to patient characteristics, preferences, and response [^112uwgAT] [^115Qbc6X].

---

### 4. Enhanced monitoring and follow-up

Regular **review** should occur every 3–12 months, with step-up/down based on control and risk [^117WXWT7] [^112CysyE]. Written **action plans** are recommended to improve self-management and outcomes [^112uwgAT] [^114XYDe7].

---

## Summary of recommendations by severity

| **Severity** | **Recommended therapy** |
|-|-|
| Mild | As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol [^112uwgAT] [^114P9Uja] |
| Moderate | SMART/MART (ICS-formoterol) [^112uwgAT] [^116GSdob] |
| Severe | - ICS-LABA ± LAMA <br/> - Add biologics if Type 2 inflammation [^112uwgAT] [^116pkEyz] |

---

## Implications for clinical practice

- **Implementation**: Emphasize education, inhaler technique, and adherence to realize benefits [^112uwgAT] [^113trePa].
- **Barriers**: Address cost, access, and clinician awareness to improve uptake [^1139aC4H] [^116Fwu3c].
- **Outcomes**: Expected reductions in exacerbations, improved control, and better quality of life [^112uwgAT] [^116GSdob].

---

The new guidelines prioritize **ICS-containing therapy**, **SMART/MART**, and **personalized care**, with regular monitoring and biologics for severe disease. These changes aim to improve control and reduce exacerbations across severities [^112uwgAT] [^116GSdob].

### Guidelines for asthma management: a review and comparison of 5 current guidelines [^115vixQ2]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines for the assessment and management of asthma were published over 20 years ago in New Zealand and Australia. During the same period, British and Scottish groups were collaborating on a United Kingdom version of asthma guidelines. Shortly after the introduction of the New Zealand and Canadian guidelines, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the United States National Institutes of Health participated in 2 additional asthma guideline endeavors, which were published in the early 1990s. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute formed the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program to develop asthma guidelines for the United States, and participated with an international task force to develop guidelines for the treatment of asthma in all countries, which resulted in the formation of the Global Initiative for Asthma in the mid-1990s. The asthma guidelines issued by professional societies and other groups prior to the late 1990s were primarily based on consensus or expert opinion in each guideline committee, though those opinions were based on the available studies. The early guidelines played a vital role in bridging the gap between various treatment options and recent discoveries in basic science, and served as the vehicle to implementation into daily clinical practice. Asthma guidelines have been published and revised in dozens of countries around the world and have become reputable directives or "road maps" in asthma diagnosis, treatment, and management for patients of all ages. The guidelines have similar formats. The dissemination and implementation of the early guidelines was inconsistent, and they were criticized for not being evidence-based. As the knowledge of asthma pathophysiology continues to expand, along with basic science research on asthma diagnosis, treatment, and management, as well as education of the asthma patient, it is essential that the asthma guidelines be frequently updated and based on evidence-based-medicine processes.

Background

While we have international guidelines and various national guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, asthma remains poorly controlled in many children and adults. In this paper we review the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe important issues and remaining questions regarding asthma guidelines for use, particularly in primary care.

Discussion

Clinical practice guidelines based on evidence from randomized controlled trials are considered the most rigorous and accurate. Current evidence-based guidelines are written predominantly from the perspective of the patient with a clear-cut asthma diagnosis, however, and tend not to consider the heterogeneity of asthma or to accommodate individual patient variations in response to treatment or their needs, differences in practice settings, or local differences in availability and cost of therapies. The results of randomized controlled trials, which are designed to establish efficacy of treatment under ideal conditions, may not apply to 'real-world' clinical practice, where patients are unselected, monitoring is less frequent, and effectiveness — the benefit of treatment in routine clinical practice — is the most relevant outcome. Moreover, most guidelines see asthma in isolation rather than considering other factors that may impact on asthma and response to asthma therapy, particularly age, allergic rhinitis, cigarette smoking, adherence, and genetic factors. When these links are recognized, guidelines rarely provide practical recommendations for treatment in these scenarios. Finally, there is some evidence that general practitioners are not convinced of the applicability of asthma guidelines to their practice settings, especially when those writing the guidelines principally work in specialist practice.

Conclusion

Developing country-specific guidelines or, ideally, local guidelines could provide more practical solutions for asthma care and could account for regional factors that influence patient choice and adherence to therapy. Pragmatic clinical trials and well-designed observational trials are needed in addition to randomized controlled trials to assess real-world effectiveness of therapies, and such evidence needs also to be considered by guideline writers. Finally, practical tools to facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of asthma and factors responsible for poor control, such as associated allergic rhinitis, limited adherence, and smoking behavior, are needed to supplement treatment information provided in clinical practice guidelines for asthma.

### Balancing the needs of the many and the few: where next for adult asthma guidelines? [^114uR6NB]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Asthma differs from many other chronic conditions in that most key management decisions are made in non-specialist settings, such as general practitioner surgeries and accident and emergency departments. Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalise management. This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalised stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be. Rather than use of either a population-based or personalised approach for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we recommend a new combined approach, in which treatment decisions are driven by objective assessment of key treatable mechanistic traits.

Conclusion

The new GINA strategy report and supporting resources provide a substantial array of new, practical, evidence-based materials that supplement current national asthma guidelines, or can be adapted for local use, in both high- and low-resource countries. In the 2014 revision and 2015 update, GINA has moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk in a practical, practice-centred format. The aim is to reduce the burden of asthma, both for patients who suffer from this disease and for health-care systems.

What are the goals of diagnosis and treatment in asthma?

Correct diagnosis is essential to ensure that every patient receives treatment appropriate to their condition and, unfortunately, misdiagnosis of asthma is still common. Correct diagnosis of asthma is generally based on a history of symptoms, family history (e.g. atopic disease), physical examination and, as the essential part of the diagnostic process, demonstration of variable airflow limitation by spirometry or peak flow measurement, with consideration of differential diagnoses, (Table 1).

Table 1
Factors in asthma diagnosis in adults.

Various guidelines and reports, such as the GINA Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention, have been developed with the aim of providing consistency of asthma treatment around the world. Most guidelines share a 'step care' approach to treatment, with the aim of achieving daily asthma control and preventing exacerbations (future risk) using the lowest level of medication needed to achieve these goals (Fig. 2). Controller medication should be stepped up or down in line with the observed variations in level of asthma control which can be detected by regular assessment, treatment and review.

### Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines [^116ckXw4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is estimated to affect 300 million people worldwide, with an expected increase to 400 million worldwide by 2025. A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, asthma causes 0.25 million deaths annually and substantial socioeconomic burden around the globe. Moreover, despite the development and dissemination in recent years of both international guidelines and various national guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, there is evidence that asthma is frequently not well controlled in many children and adults. In this paper we review the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe important issues and remaining questions regarding asthma guidelines for use in primary care practice.

Limitations of current guidelines

Clinical practice guidelines are by their nature general recommendations aimed for broad applicability in the clinical setting. Applicability, however, is limited by several factors. One of the challenges to the daily use of current asthma guidelines by physicians is that these guidelines tend to be disease-oriented, not patient-oriented. Guidelines are written not from the perspective of the patient who comes to the physician's office with symptoms, but rather from the perspective of the patient with a clear-cut asthma diagnosis. Symptom-based guidelines are needed. In addition, there are patients who do not fit within many current guideline definitions; for example, children with intermittent wheezing that does not appear to be the classical asthmatic phenotype. Moreover, guideline recommendations tend to be based on disease severity without accounting for concomitant conditions, such as allergic rhinitis, or the time course of disease – factors used by clinicians to individualize the diagnosis and the treatment plan.

In addition, clinical practice guidelines for asthma tend not to consider the heterogeneity of asthma or to accommodate individual patient variations in response to treatment or their needs, differences in practice settings, or local differences in availability and cost of therapies. Guideline recommendations are generally made on the basis of grouped mean data, and fail to recognize individual heterogeneity. For instance, a recent crossover trial comparing an inhaled corticosteroid with a leukotriene receptor antagonist for the treatment of persistent childhood asthma found that, while both treatments were effective, on average the effect was greater in those treated with inhaled corticosteroid. When individual patient responses on each treatment were compared, however, 29% of children had better asthma control (asthma control days/week) on the leukotriene receptor antagonist, indicating that for this subgroup the leukotriene receptor antagonist would be the ideal monotherapy.

Asthma is most commonly managed in the community in general practice settings, and the organization of medical care will affect how asthma care can be delivered. Differential diagnoses vary according to location, with infectious disease being more common in less developed countries. Moreover, currently available guidelines are based on the assumption that the recommended drugs are available and affordable, an assumption that is not true in many parts of the world. There is therefore a pressing need for local guidelines. To be useful to primary care physicians, these guidelines must be in the local language as well as physically available, whether by Internet or in print.

### GINA guidelines on asthma and beyond [^117Kb3cg]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements designed to help practitioners and patients make decisions regarding the appropriate health care for specific circumstances. Guidelines are based on the scientific evidence on therapeutic interventions. The first asthma guidelines were published in the mid 1980s when asthma became a recognized public health problem in many countries. The Global Initiative on Asthma (GINA) was launched in 1995 as a collaborative effort between the NHLBI and the World Health Organization (WHO). The first edition was opinion-based but updates were evidence-based. A new update of the GINA guidelines was recently available and it is based on the control of the disease. Asthma guidelines are prepared to stimulate the implementation of practical guidelines in order to reduce the global burden of asthma. Although asthma guidelines may not be perfect, they appear to be the best vehicle available to assist primary care physicians and patients to receive the best possible care of asthma.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^111437LB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. GINA reports, now funded independently through the sale of GINA products, have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. They are prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, and are annually updated following a review of evidence. In 2014, a major revision of the GINA report was published, that took into account advances in evidence not only about asthma and its treatment, but also about how to improve implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice. This paper summarises key changes relevant to primary care in the new GINA report. A noticeable difference is the report's radically different approach, now clinically-focussed, with multiple practical tools and flow charts to improve its utility for busy frontline clinicians. Key changes in recommendations include a new, diagnosis-centred definition of asthma; more detail about how to assess current symptom control and future risk; a comprehensive approach to tailoring treatment for individual patients; expanded indications for commencing inhaled corticosteroids; new recommendations for written asthma action plans; a new chapter on diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome; and a revised approach to diagnosing asthma in preschool children. The 2014 GINA report (further updated in 2015) moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk, in a practical, practice-centred format.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^114P9Uja]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and the US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to improve asthma awareness, prevention and management worldwide. GINA develops and publishes evidence-based, annually updated resources for clinicians. GINA guidance is adopted by national asthma guidelines in many countries, adapted to fit local healthcare systems, practices, and resource availability. GINA is independent of industry, funded by the sale and licensing of its materials. This review summarizes key practical guidance for primary care from the 2022 GINA strategy report. It provides guidance on confirming the diagnosis of asthma using spirometry or peak expiratory flow. GINA recommends that all adults, adolescents and most children with asthma should receive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing therapy to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations, either taken regularly, or (for adults and adolescents with "mild" asthma) as combination ICS-formoterol taken as needed for symptom relief. For patients with moderate-severe asthma, the preferred regimen is maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with ICS-formoterol. Asthma treatment is not "one size fits all"; GINA recommends individualized assessment, adjustment, and review of treatment. As many patients with difficult-to-treat or severe asthma are not referred early for specialist review, we provide updated guidance for primary care on diagnosis, further investigation, optimization and treatment of severe asthma across secondary and tertiary care. While the GINA strategy has global relevance, we recognize that there are special considerations for its adoption in low- and middle-income countries, particularly the current poor access to inhaled medications.

### Comparison of national and global asthma management guiding documents [^1152timh]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects both adults and children, and that continues to have a high economic burden. Asthma management guidelines were first developed nearly 30 years ago to standardize care, maintain asthma control, improve quality of life, maintain normal lung function, prevent exacerbations, and prevent asthma mortality. The two most common asthma guidelines used today were developed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Working Group and the Global Initiative for Asthma Science Committee. Both guiding documents use scientific methodology to standardize their approach for formulating recommendations based on pertinent literature. Before the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (Expert Panel Report 4), nothing had been released since the 2007 guidelines, whereas the Global Initiative for Asthma publishes updates annually. Although each of these asthma strategies is similar, there are some noted differences. Over the years, the focus of asthma treatment has shifted from acute to chronic management. Frontline respiratory therapists and other health-care providers should have a good understanding of these 2 guiding references and how they can impact acute and chronic asthma management. The primary focus of this narrative is to look at the similarities and differences of these 2 guiding documents as they pertain to the 6 key questions identified by the Expert Panel of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

### Update on the NAEPPCC asthma guidelines: the wait is over, or is it? [^113G5DCD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

As an asthma specialist, one is often asked to discuss the asthma guidelines. The challenge that one faces is deciding which guidelines to use as a resource for discussion or presentation. It often comes down to the following questions: What is the question? What message does one want to deliver? Where is the most current information? and Who is the target audience? This commentary will help answer those questions as it guides the reader through the new update of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines and then outlines differences between 2 widely used strategies for the management of asthma: the Global Initiative for Asthma and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma.

### Generating evidence to inform an update of asthma clinical practice guidelines: perspectives from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [^111yCWSZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide. Its increasing prevalence and evidence of suboptimal control require renewed efforts in the development and widespread implementation of clinical practice guidelines for prevention, treatment, and control. Given the rapidly changing landscape and evolving best practices for guideline development, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute made a commitment to support rigorous systematic evidence reviews that frontline health care providers and stakeholders could use to create new or update existing guidelines. This article describes the protocols, key questions, methodology, and analytic framework to support the update of the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3) on the diagnosis and management of asthma in adults and children. It also describes the expert panel's practical experience in managing asthmatic patients across the age and severity spectrum. The article explains the process for ensuring that the expert panel's deliberations are conducted in accordance with the Institute of Medicine's standards and recommendations for guideline development. The outcome of this ambitious effort will be an update of the EPR-3 asthma guidelines and publication of the key recommendations in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Importantly, several novel approaches will be explored and incorporated as appropriate to accelerate adoption and sustained implementation of the guidelines.

### Implementing the guidelines: what do you do when the rubber hits the road? [^112eHz5m]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Report 4 Working Group has issued a selected update to the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines based on predetermined questions. This rostrum provides an overview of the clinically important recommendations and a guide to practical issues that clinicians may face as they implement the working group's updated guidance. It also draws attention to areas in which the recommendations differ from those of the Global INitiative for Asthma. Factors that clinicians may wish to consider as they step up therapy in the continuum of care are elaborated, especially in areas in which the update does not provide sufficient information to make a recommendation.

### Medication regimens for managing stable asthma [^116Q5po1]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Guideline-based management of asthma was developed as a means of standardizing asthma therapies and of improving outcomes. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines provide recommendations to care providers about the routine management of asthma. There has been rapid development of new therapies for asthma, specifically with the advent of new drug delivery devices and biologic therapies for severe asthma. We are increasingly recognizing that asthma is a heterogenous disease with a diverse underlying pathophysiology, and therefore, it is imperative for care providers to begin to understand asthma phenotypes and endotypes, and the implications of these classifications on management, especially of severe refractory asthma. This article serves as a review of guideline-based therapy for asthma and includes updates on alternative therapies, new approaches that use previously recognized therapies, and special populations with asthma.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^11133V4n]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma affects more than a quarter of a billion people worldwide, is the most common chronic condition in childhood, and is responsible for over 1000 deaths a day, of which the majority are preventable –.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established by the World Health Organization and the US National Heart Lung and Blood institute in 1993 to improve asthma awareness, prevention, and management worldwide. GINA is independent of industry, funded by the sale and licensing of its evidence-based, annually updated reports and figures. The GINA methodology is published on its website.

The GINA report is a global evidence-based strategy that can be adapted for local health systems and local medicine availability. Many countries have their own national asthma guidelines, with many of these based on GINA. However, most national guidelines are updated only infrequently, so they may not reflect current best evidence. In recent years, some countries have conducted partial updates of their asthma guidelines, by undertaking a detailed review of evidence for a limited number of clinical questions, but this process often takes several years. By contrast, the GINA strategy is updated every year based on a twice-yearly cumulative review of new evidence. Hence, even when national asthma guidelines are available, the GINA report may provide a useful resource for clinicians (both primary care and specialists) to be aware of the most recent evidence, and to understand how it can be integrated into holistic asthma care. However, when assessing and treating patients, health professionals are strongly advised to use their own professional judgment, and to take into account local and national regulations and guidelines, and the needs of the individual patient.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^112R9cdG]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma

Asthma is a major burden worldwide, for governments, health-care providers, patients and their carers, and there is considerable variation in asthma prevalence, morbidity and mortality. Asthma remains a common cause of death in many countries, and many asthma deaths are preventable, so there is a need for a different approach.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in 1993 to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. The GINA report is not a guideline, but a global strategy that can be adapted to local conditions; over the years, the reports have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. The GINA strategy report, prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, is annually updated following a review of evidence, and is now independently funded by the sale of GINA documents and resources.

Over recent years, research has led to considerable advances not only in our knowledge about asthma and treatment optionsbut also in our understanding of how to implement evidence-based recommendations within clinical practice. This evidence is reflected in a major revision of GINA's landmark Global Strategy Report (published in May 2014, with further minor updates in 2015). The report not only provides up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk but also presents these in a radically different style to improve their utility for busy frontline clinicians.

This paper summarises the key changes in the GINA strategy report that are most relevant to health professionals working in primary care.

Overview of current guidelines

The systematic establishment of a thorough evidence base is currently considered the most rigorous and accurate means to develop clinical practice guidelines. Developing evidence-based consensus guidelines is an enormous undertaking in a field such as asthma, involving a major literature search, consideration of thousands of papers, and time commitment by numerous individuals in the respiratory medical community. Several hierarchies of evidence and grading recommendations have been used by different working groups; those used by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network are presented in Table 1. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group has recently proposed a system for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations that can be applied across a wide range of interventions and contexts.

Hierarchy of levels of evidence from published papers, and grades of recommendation based on this hierarchy, as used by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [6]

Reprinted with permission from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) [6].

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was first launched in 1993 as a program to reduce asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health in the United States. GINA has published evidence-based asthma guidelines since 2002; annual updates are available on the GINA website. These guidelines emphasize the fact that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways and that, while asthma exacerbations are episodic, airway inflammation is chronically present. Exposure to allergens is listed as a common risk factor. The fact that medication must be taken every day by most patients to control symptoms, to improve lung function, and to prevent attacks is noted. Criteria defining the control of asthma are presented in the guidelines (Table 2). Moreover, the guidelines provide criteria for determining asthma severity; and recommendations for pharmacological management of asthma are outlined according to a stepwise approach based on asthma severity.

Where Do We Go from Here?

The NHLBI Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma Network is conducting clinical trials to further refine a biomarker-driven approach to severe asthma. A biomarker-driven strategy may also be warranted in mild asthma, although confirmatory studies are needed. These observations suggest a future in which guidelines support a precision-medicine approach to asthma management that is based on endotype and not on age and presumed disease severity (current approach). Also, the pace of discovery is only getting faster; an update every 10–15 years is unacceptable. A more agile approach to developing guidelines that retains the benefits of rigor and trustworthiness is needed. We therefore advocate for a dynamic or "living" topic-driven guideline to respond more rapidly to a new body of evidence for an individual recommendation rather than the whole guideline. Such an approach would require a greater level of collaboration between those who develop new evidence (e.g. clinical trialists), experts in evidence synthesis (e.g. guideline methodologists), and funders who can support and plan for topic-specific updates. Importantly, an update to the NAEPP 2020 update that includes the management of severe asthma is urgently needed.

### The pediatric asthma yardstick: practical recommendations for a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for children with inadequately controlled asthma [^112PixgH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Current asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management involving assessment of impairment and risk followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. However, for children with asthma, achieving control can be elusive. Although tools are available to help children (and families) track and manage day-to-day symptoms, when and how to implement a longer-term step-up in care is less clear. Furthermore, treatment is challenged by the 3 age groups of childhood-adolescence (12–18 years old), school age (6–11 years old), and young children (≤ 5 years old)-and what works for 1 age group might not be the best approach for another. The Pediatric Asthma Yardstick provides an in-depth assessment of when and how to step-up therapy for the child with not well or poorly controlled asthma. Development of this tool follows others in the Yardstick series, presenting patient profiles and step-up strategies based on current guidance documents, but modified according to newer data and the authors' combined clinical experience. The objective is to provide clinicians who treat children with asthma practical and clinically relevant recommendations for each step-up and each intervention, with the intent of helping practitioners better treat their pediatric patients with asthma, particularly those who do not always respond to recommended therapies.

### Asthma control or severity: that is the question [^1112ugx6]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

In the first National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, the level of symptoms and airflow limitation and its variability allowed asthma to be subdivided by severity into four subcategories (intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent). It is important to recognize, however, that asthma severity involves both the severity of the underlying disease and its responsiveness to treatment. Thus, the first update of the GINA guidelines defined asthma severity depending on the clinical features already proposed as well as the current treatment of the patient. In addition, severity is not a fixed feature of asthma, but may change over months or years, whereas the classification by severity suggests a static feature. Moreover, using severity as an outcome measure has limited value in predicting what treatment will be required and what the response to that treatment might be. Because of these considerations, the classification of asthma severity is no longer recommended as the basis for treatment decisions, a periodic assessment of asthma control being more relevant and useful.

### Promoting prevention and targeting remission of asthma: a EUFOREA consensus statement on raising the bar in asthma care [^112Us43S]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common, multifaceted respiratory disease with a major impact on quality of life. Despite increased insights into mechanisms underlying various asthma phenotypes and endotypes and the availability of targeted biologic treatment options, the disease remains uncontrolled in a substantial proportion of patients with risk of exacerbations, requiring systemic corticosteroids, and with progressive disease. Current international guidelines advocate for a personalized management approach to patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. The European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Diseases (EUFOREA) asthma expert panel was convened to discuss strategies to optimize asthma care and to prevent systemic corticosteroid overuse and disease progression. In this meeting report, we summarize current concepts and recommendations and provide a rationale to implement personalized asthma management at earlier stages of the disease. The ultimate goal is to move away from the current one-size-fits-most concept, which focuses on a symptom-driven treatment strategy, and shift toward a phenotype- and endotype-targeted approach aimed at curbing the disease course by improving clinical outcomes and preserving health-related quality of life. Herein, we provide a consensus view on asthma care that advocates a holistic approach and highlight some unmet needs to be addressed in future clinical trials and population studies.

### National asthma education and prevention program 2020 guideline update: where Do we Go from here? [^115bxNVf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) oversaw the development of national asthma guidelines nearly 30 years ago. Since that time, there have been two major revisions (1997 and 2007) and one interim update (2002). In December 2020, the 2020 Focused Update to the Asthma Management Guidelines was released — the first update to the guidelines in 13 years.

The NAEPP 2020 update adheres to standards for trustworthy guidelines promulgated by the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, including a systematic review of the evidence that addresses specific questions, a multidisciplinary panel of experts and representatives of key affected groups, consideration of important patient subgroups and preferences, an explicit and transparent process to minimize bias and conflicts of interest, and ratings of both the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. An Expert Panel coordinated by the NHLBI of the NIH was first convened in July 2018 to examine six priority topics that were selected after an extensive needs assessment. The six topics included intermittent inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), add-on inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists, bronchial thermoplasty, indoor allergen mitigation strategies, immunotherapy, and use of fractional exhaled nitric oxide. No other aspects of asthma management in the NAEPP 2007 asthma guidelines were considered by the Expert Panel.

Ultimately, broad change in clinical practice depends on the uptake, adoption, and implementation of clinical practice recommendations by primary care providers with input from people who have asthma and their families, as well as support from health care systems. This update can serve as a basis to disseminate and facilitate adoption of the asthma recommendations at all levels and to ensure optimal care and equitable outcomes for all individuals with asthma. We ask for the assistance of every stakeholder in reaching our goal: improving asthma care and the quality of life of every person with asthma.

2020 focused updates to the 2007 Asthma Guidelines

After the Expert Panel reached consensus on the recommendations, each topic team drafted a narrative to provide further information on each recommendation. These narratives form the body of this report. Each topic narrative has the following sections:
A brief background section that includes definitions of the terms used in the recommendations
The key questions addressed
The recommendations
An Implementation Guidance section that explains the recommendation in greater detail and provides Expert Panel opinion about how to implement the recommendation in clinical practice
A summary of the evidence
The rationale for the recommendation
A discussion of the evidence supporting the recommendation
A list of topic-specific research gaps and questions

Differences (if any) between the new recommendations and the recommendations in EPR-3 are discussed in Appendix A (in this article's Online Repository at).

The Implementation Guidance sections are for practicing clinicians, and they contain the following information:
Clinician's summary (more detailed explanation of the recommendation)
Population most likely to benefit from the recommendation
Any populations to which the recommendation does not apply
Topic-specific considerations
Issues that clinicians should discuss with their patients as part of the shared decision-making process

Review and public comment

The NAEPPCC reviewed an initial draft report. The NHLBI subsequently made the draft report available for public review and comment from December 2, 2019, to January 17, 2020. Interested stakeholders — including health professionals; representatives of the scientific community, academic institutions, the private sector, professional societies, advocacy groups, and patient communities; and other interested members of the public — were invited to submit comments. The Expert Panel received and reviewed approximately 500 comments from almost 100 individuals and organizations, and the panel used this input to revise the draft report.

One or more individuals and organizational representatives who submitted public comments mentioned almost all of the emerging topics. Of the 11 emerging topics (see list toward the beginning of Section I of this report), biologic agents received the most attention. The first biologic agent for asthma received approval from the US FDA in 2003, but the second biologic agent did not receive approval until November 2015. Between November 2015 and November 2017, four biologic agents received approval, but several others were not shown to be effective in clinical trials. Thus, at the time that the priority topics and key questions were developed, the only biologic agent available for use in the United States was omalizumab, which EPR-3 had addressed. The NHLBAC Asthma Expert Working Group did not believe that this single available biologic agent warranted inclusion in the update and included biologic agents as an emerging topic.

The 2020 Focused Updates to the Asthma Management Guidelines: A Report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group was coordinated and supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health. It is designed to improve patient care and support informed decision making about asthma management in the clinical setting. This update addresses six priority topic areas as determined by the state of the science at the time of a needs assessment, and input from multiple stakeholders:A rigorous process was undertaken to develop these evidence-based guidelines. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Evidence-Based Practice Centers conducted systematic reviews on these topics, which were used by the Expert Panel Working Group as a basis for developing recommendations and guidance. The Expert Panel used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation), an internationally accepted framework, in consultation with an experienced methodology team for determining the certainty of evidence and the direction and strength of recommendations based on the evidence. Practical implementation guidance for each recommendation incorporates findings from NHLBI-led patient, caregiver, and clinician focus groups. To assist clincians in implementing these recommendations into patient care, the new recommendations have been integrated into the existing Expert Panel Report-3 (EPR-3) asthma management step diagram format.

### Asthma update: part II. medical management [^115bAHRQ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program recently updated its guidelines for the management of asthma. An evidence-based approach was used to examine several key issues regarding appropriate medical therapy for patients with asthma. The updated guidelines have clarified these issues and should alter the way physicians prescribe asthma medications. Chronic inhaled corticosteroid use is safe in adults and children, and inhaled corticosteroids are recommended as first-line therapy in adults and children with persistent asthma, even if the disease is mild. Other medications, such as cromolyn, theophylline, and leukotriene modifiers, now are considered alternative treatments and should have a more limited role in the management of persistent asthma. The addition of a long-acting beta2 agonist to an inhaled corticosteroid is superior to all other combinations as well as to higher dosages of inhaled corticosteroids alone. Combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2 agonist is the preferred treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe asthma. Antibiotic therapy offers no additional benefit in patients with asthma exacerbations.

### Asthma: guidelines-based control and management [^113trePa]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Guidelines-based management of the patient with asthma allows maximal levels of function with few adverse effects. A flexible approach to therapy that emphasizes an ongoing partnership between the patient and physician allows optimal communication, facilitating treatment adherence and maximal levels of control. Through assessment of the patient's initial severity of disease and an evaluation of the patient's ongoing level of control, appropriate medical therapy can be initiated and level of therapy can be modified based on the patient's response. Patient education, environmental control strategies, and proper use of medications are vital in achieving maximal benefit in asthma management. Excellent asthma control is possible and should be a goal of both physicians and patients.

### Recent changes in international asthma guidelines may… [^1125Ea9Y]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

As highlighted in this month's issue of American Family Physician, asthma treatment recommendations have recently changed. 1 Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines now recommend the combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and formoterol as the preferred as-needed therapy for asthma in adults and adolescents 12 years and older. 2 The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program takes a different approach and suggests a combined rescue strategy as only an option for patients with mild asthma and conditionally recommends combination therapy as needed in patients with additional symptoms. 3 This treatment approach is called single maintenance and reliever therapy. These recommendations and the randomized controlled trials of SMART were heavily influenced by the pharmaceutical industry. Drs. Raymond, Peterson, and Coulter state that, "Most RCTs evaluating SMART used budesonide/formoterol".

1 Budesonide/formoterol is marketed by Astra-Zeneca under the brand name Symbicort in the United States. AstraZeneca reported more than $2. 5 billion in sales of Symbicort worldwide in
2021. 4 The GINA board of directors and scientific committee members have substantial financial conflicts of interest. Twelve of 17 members, including both chairs, have received personal fees from AstraZeneca. 5 The NAEPP guideline has fewer members with similar conflicts of interest, and members with conflicts of interest recuse themselves from discussions on related topics. 3 This difference aligns with how SMART is presented in the guidelines, with GINA recommending SMART as the preferred option, whereas the NAEPP recommends including SMART as the preferred approach for a smaller subset of patients. The research base used to create these guidelines is substantially influenced by industry.

A 2021 Cochrane review evaluated a single combined inhaler used as rescue therapy in people with mild asthma. 6 The review found six studies and used five for the meta-analysis. Four of the studies were funded by AstraZeneca, and some authors in the studies were employees of AstraZeneca. Other authors received personal payments from AstraZeneca. 7–10. A 2018 systematic review of SMART for persistent asthma found 16 RCTs, and 15 of those evaluated SMART as a combination therapy with budesonide and formoterol in a dry-powder inhaler. 11 Fourteen of the 15 studies were funded by AstraZeneca, had an AstraZeneca employee as a coauthor, or had authors who received honoraria or fees from Astra-Zeneca. 12–27 Many of the studies have a high or unclear risk of bias, especially in blinding of participants and outcome assessment and in selective reporting.
11. Conflicts of interest can influence health care decisions.

28 Industry influence may lead to more favorable recommendations in guidelines. 29 Most organizational guidelines still permit conflicts of interest and many do not follow the National Academy of Medicine conflict-of-interest recommendations for guideline creation. 30 The National Academy of Medicine recommends that guideline development group members should have no conflicts of interest whenever possible, members with conflicts of interest should not represent more than a minority of the guideline development group, and the chair or cochairs should not have a conflict of interest. 28 GINA does not follow these recommendations. Trial design, results, and conclusions can be influenced by industry. Industry-sponsored studies have more favorable results and conclusions than studies sponsored by other sources, 31 and financial ties between principal investigators and industry are associated with positive trial results.

### National asthma education and prevention program 2020 guideline update: where Do we Go from here? [^112tPDXG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

How Does the NAEPP 2020 Asthma Guideline Update Compare with Recommendations by the 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma?

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and the NHLBI to promote a coordinated worldwide effort in asthma prevention and management. Although the Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention 2020 Update (GINA 2020 report) is not a guideline, many readers of the NAEPP update are likely to ask whether the recommendations in the two documents are similar or different. The answer is yes and yes. For example, note the similarities and differences in pharmacologic step therapy recommendations for individuals age 12 years or older (Table 1).

Table 1.
Preferred Controller and Reliever Pharmacotherapy Recommendations for Individuals ≥ 12 Years with Asthma in the NAEPP 2020 Guideline Update and GINA 2020 Report

We believe the differences are largely the result of different objectives, methods used to review evidence, and definitions. The GINA report is intended to inform a comprehensive global strategy for various aspects of diagnosis and management of mild to severe asthma, including in low- and middle-income countries. The NAEPP update offers recommendations for six priority topics. GINA updates its report annually based on a twice-yearly review of the recently published literature by asthma clinicians and researchers from diverse geographic regions in the world. The GINA report is not a guideline, so it does not adhere to methodologies recommended for guidelines. GINA advises healthcare professionals "to use their own professional judgement, and to take into account local and national regulations and guidelines".

The GINA report includes five levels of progressive treatment intensification ("steps"), with step 1 therapy reserved for individuals with symptoms less than 2 times/mo. The NAEPP 2020 guideline update "pulled-through" the six-step pharmacotherapy framework used in the NAEPP 2007 asthma guidelines but only made changes to some of the pharmacotherapy recommendations in the six steps in each age group. For example, in individuals 12 years or older, the Expert Panel's pharmacotherapy recommendations for the preferred controller only address steps 2–5 (Table 1). The NAEPP 2007 asthma guideline pharmacotherapy recommendations for step 1, reserved for "intermittent asthma", was not reviewed by the Expert Panel for 2020 update. GINA does not include the construct of intermittent asthma because all patients with asthma are at risk for severe exacerbations.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114N84ew]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The methodology framework used for this update, GRADE, is the internationally recommended approach for developing recommendations that clinicians can trust. This framework endorses a systematic and transparent approach to decision making, uses established criteria to rate the certainty of evidence, and determines the strength of the recommendations. Recommendations developed using GRADE combine certainty of evidence with patient values and preferences and weigh the benefits and harms of making treatment recommendations. Importantly, the recommendations are based on the key questions that clinicians, both generalists and specialists, wanted to be answered.

Users of these recommendations may be disappointed by the absence of many strong recommendations — that is, recommendations that clinicians should adhere to for almost all individuals with asthma as the standard of care. This is not, however, surprising given the variations in asthma phenotypes and endotypes and in the outcomes used in the studies reviewed to develop the recommendations. When the GRADE framework is used, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are initially rated as offering a high certainty of evidence, but issues with study designs (eg, lack of blinding or of a placebo control), heterogeneity of study results, or small numbers of events may result in downgrading the certainty of evidence. For most of the asthma recommendations, the overall certainty of the evidence was downgraded because of inconsistencies in study results, risk of bias, or absence of critical standardized outcome measures. The need to downgrade the evidence should be a clarion call to investigators to use standardized and validated outcome measures that were outlined in the Asthma Outcomes Workshop (2012). This single activity will create more robust evidence to support recommendations in the future.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^117DP1Z1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma guideline consensus and recommendation strength definitions — strong recommendations are those for which, in the judgment of the Expert Panel after it has reviewed all of the evidence and individual judgments, all or almost all people would choose the recommended course of action, whereas conditional recommendations are those for which the Expert Panel believes that many informed people are likely to make different decisions about whether to take the recommended course of action, and a conditional recommendation implies that engaging in a shared decision-making process is essential for individuals with asthma and their health care providers. The Expert Panel achieved consensus when more than 90% of the Expert Panel members voted in favor of a recommendation, and if less than 90% of members voted in favor of a recommendation the topic team continued to revise the recommendation until it achieved consensus approval according to these criteria.

### Asthma management guidelines: focused updates for 2020… [^111KPxZK]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The 2020 Focused Updates to the asthma management guidelines represent the first revision of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines in more than 10 years. 1 The report differs from the Global Initiative for Asthma recommendations because of the focused number of issues addressed and the nature of the evidence review.
2. Whereas the GINA guidelines are an ongoing series of revisions on a broad range of asthma topics, the 2020 Focused Updates targeted six key areas of asthma care for which there was strong interest and sufficient evidence to influence patient care. In addition, it used Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality systematic reviews and the rigorous GRADE methodology to assess study design and relevance of the current evidence. 3 Other strengths include attention to the perspective of primary care and participation by primary care representatives in leadership roles on the panel.

Inhaled Corticosteroids INTERMITTENT ASTHMA GINA recommends treating patients with mild intermittent asthma with as-needed inhaled corticosteroids with short-acting beta. 2 agonists for children six to 11 years of age and as-needed ICS/formoterol in adults. 4 However, the Focused Updates panel did not address this topic and carried forward its previous recommendation for as-needed SABA use. The panel identified limitations in the literature describing the risks of albuterol but chose to emphasize the importance of patient education with SABA use instead of discouraging its use. Switching rescue therapy from a SABA to ICS/formoterol for intermittent asthma would also incur a significant additional cost. PERSISTENT ASTHMA For patients with mild persistent asthma, the Focused Updates recommend either of the following: daily low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA or as-needed ICS with SABA for worsening asthma.

For mild to moderate persistent asthma, single maintenance and reliever therapy is preferred. This approach reduces the potential adverse effects of chronic steroid use, lowers emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and simplifies patients' medication regimens. 1 For patients four years or older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, SMART with ICS/formoterol, used daily and as needed, is preferred. For patients 12 years or older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, a single ICS/formoterol inhaler, used daily and as needed, is conditionally preferred. 5 GINA recommends daily moderate-dose ICS or ICS/long-acting beta 2 agonist with as-needed ICS/formoterol as equivalent options; however, the Focused Updates panel found the evidence for ICS/formoterol daily and as-needed to be more compelling. SMART carries several caveats. Budesonide/formoterol is not approved by the U. S.

Food and Drug Administration for use as a quick relief agent. The device most studied was the dry-powder Symbicort Turbohaler; however, in the United States, only the metered-dose device is available. Studies suggest that salmeterol is less effective, and it is not recommended as an alternative to formoterol. As of September 30, 2021, studies of as-needed use of vilanterol or mometasone/formoterol have not been published. ACUTE ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS The use of ICS for acute asthma without the concomitant use of oral steroids was previously discouraged. However, for patients from birth to four years of age with recurrent wheezing triggered by respiratory tract infections only and no wheezing between infections, the Focused Updates now conditionally recommend a short course of ICS at the onset of an upper respiratory tract infection with an inhaled SABA as needed.

### Chinese guidelines for childhood asthma 2016: major updates, recommendations and key regional data [^112NzW25]. The Journal of Asthma (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

With increased industrialization and urbanization in China, pediatric asthma is becoming more prevalent. Despite a growing body of evidence, there remains a significant unmet need for adequate management of childhood asthma. The Subspecialty Group of Respiratory Diseases of the Society of Pediatrics, the Chinese Medical Association, and the editorial board of the Chinese Journal of Pediatrics have recently updated the "Guidelines for diagnosis and optimal management of asthma in children", first published in 2008.

Methods

This article reviews the major updates to the guidelines and covers the main recommendations for diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of pediatric asthma in China. Key regional data on epidemiology, clinical features, disease burden, knowledge among children and parents, and risk factors including pollution are provided to contextualize the recommendations.

Results

The major updates to the guidelines include: (1) A more practical definition of asthma; (2) assessment of asthma control that takes into account both current symptom control and future risk; (3) classification based on disease severity that corresponds with treatment step; (4) differentiation between difficult-to-treat and poorly controlled asthma; (5) an open-ended approach to pharmacological management; and (6) allergen immunotherapy (AIT) in mild- to moderate-persistent asthma.

Conclusions

The updated "Guidelines for the diagnosis and optimal management of asthma in children (2016)" combine the latest national and international clinical evidence and experience to provide practical and reliable recommendations to Chinese clinicians.

### Treating asthma: is there a place for leukotriene receptor antagonists? [^1117Yzn3]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic disorder, characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), airway inflammation and airway remodelling. Evidence has been provided for a relationship between pathophysiology, airway inflammation and remodelling. Moreover, these asthma features have been shown to respond to anti-inflammatory therapy. According to current guidelines, monitoring of asthma is predominantly based on symptoms and lung function data. However, these parameters appeared as poor indices for asthma control. Alternatively, asthma control relates well to exacerbations and (anamnestic) surrogate biomarkers of airway inflammation. Hence, appropriate treatment of asthma should primarily target the airway inflammation. According to current guidelines for asthma management, anti-inflammatory therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is the cornerstone in the treatment of persistent asthma. To further optimize asthma control, add-on therapy with long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) should be combined with low to high doses of ICS. While the first combination focuses on optimal control of symptoms and lung function, the second provides a more complete suppression of the airway inflammation. In this paper we discuss treatment of asthma according to current guidelines versus new insights, addressing practical issues.

### The revised 2014 GINA strategy report: opportunities for change [^111NU66J]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This document reviews a major revision of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention that was published in 2014. The report aimed not only to update evidence-based recommendations for asthma diagnosis and management but also to innovate through a new format and layout to make its recommendations more clinically relevant and easier to implement.

Recent Findings

The GINA 2014 report includes a new definition of asthma that recognizes the heterogeneity of the disease and its phenotypes, and a new chapter about the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome. Among key messages, the report stresses that therapeutic decisions should be based not only on assessment of symptoms but also on risk factors for exacerbations, side effects of therapy and development of fixed airflow limitation. Asthma management includes not only medications but also nonpharmacological therapies and strategies, in a coordinated and personalized approach to individual patient care. On the basis of evidence about how to achieve behaviour change by health professionals, the recommendations are presented in a user-friendly format, with numerous tables, algorithms and flow-charts facilitating implementation. Background supporting material has been gathered online.

Summary

The GINA 2014 report provides updated and more easily implementable recommendations on optimal asthma management.

### Diagnosis and treatment of asthma in childhood: a PRACTALL consensus report [^115ucQ8x]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is the leading chronic disease among children in most industrialized countries. However, the evidence base on specific aspects of pediatric asthma, including therapeutic strategies, is limited and no recent international guidelines have focused exclusively on pediatric asthma. As a result, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology nominated expert teams to find a consensus to serve as a guideline for clinical practice in Europe as well as in North America. This consensus report recommends strategies that include pharmacological treatment, allergen and trigger avoidance and asthma education. The report is part of the PRACTALL initiative, which is endorsed by both academies.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^1168dN8q]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a serious global health problem affecting all age groups. Its prevalence has increased in many countries, especially among children. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) aims to improve the diagnosis, management, and prevention of asthma by providing an up-to-date evidence-based strategy and tools and practical resources for clinicians worldwide.

GINA was established through a 1993 collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. NHLBI to develop a strategy for the diagnosis and management of asthma. The Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention (GINA strategy report) has been updated annually since 2002 to provide clinicians with up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations as new evidence emerges and new therapies are approved. The GINA strategy report is under continual review by the Science Committee. GINA methodology involves evaluation of new evidence identified from a twice-yearly rolling review of original research and systematic reviews (not limited to specific population/intervention/comparison/outcomes questions), assessment of its impact on existing or new recommendations, and consideration of whether and how it should be integrated into the overall asthma management strategy. GINA is independent of industry.

This article summarizes key recommendations from the 2021 GINA strategy report, published in April 2021, and briefly summarizes the evidence and rationale for recent important changes.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^113VQCMK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

FOREWORD

It has been 13 years since the last revision of the asthma recommendations, and substantial progress has been made since that time in understanding the origins of asthma as well as its pathophysiology and treatment. As members of the pulmonary and allergy provider community and the primary care community that provide more than half of all asthma care in the United States, we now recognize that asthma is not one disease, but it is a syndrome composed of multiple phenotypes. Asthma is much more complex than indicated in the Expert Panel Report: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-1), released in 1991, which characterized asthma as an inflammatory disease that is responsive to corticosteroids.

This document updates selected topics that were identified as high priority by an NHLBI Advisory Council Asthma Expert Working Group based on input from previous guideline developers, NAEPP participant organizations, and the public. The list of these priority topics was published in 2015.

### Guiding principles for use of newer biologics and bronchial thermoplasty for patients with severe asthma [^117HmiaT]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Severe asthma poses significant disease-related and economic burdens in the United States. Challenges in practice include how to define "severe asthma" for a given patient, knowing which are the right tests to perform and when, and having a better understanding of a patient's asthma phenotype. Furthermore, current guidelines do not address a clear, practical approach to treatment that is based on a patient's asthma phenotype.

Objective

To develop a consensus on the definition of severe asthma, the role of biomarkers and phenotyping severe asthma, and the use of newer biologic therapies and bronchial thermoplasty to help guide practicing clinicians.

Methods

A roundtable meeting was convened with a panel of severe asthma experts to discuss areas in practice that are not adequately addressed by current guidelines, specifically phenotype-guided treatment.

Results

We describe a consensus on the definition of severe asthma, asthma phenotyping with the use of available biomarkers, and guiding principles for newer biologic therapies and bronchial thermoplasty.

Conclusion

To optimize therapy and improve outcomes such as daily symptoms, quality of life, exacerbations, and hospitalizations, a clear picture of a patient's asthma phenotype is needed to guide therapy. Determining asthma phenotypes is the foundation of precision medicine for this persistent, often difficult-to-treat disease.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117WXWT7]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to adjustment of treatment (assessment), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to review patients with asthma regularly, ideally 1–3 months after starting treatment and every 3–12 months thereafter, and within 1 week after an exacerbation,
to monitor symptom control, risk factors and occurrence of exacerbations, as well as to document the response to any treatment changes.

GINA recommends the continuation of medications, avoidance of nebulization and spirometry, and ensuring a written asthma action plan in COVID-19 times. GINA 2020 specifies which step of management is to be followed according to the patient's symptoms in an easy flowchart. Clinicians need to be aware of the changes and the evidence behind them.

### SMART-is it practical in the United States? [^116Fwu3c]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group advocate for inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol combinations as single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) for patients with persistent asthma. We review the rationale, the evidence supporting SMART use in asthma, and barriers limiting its wide adoption in the United States.

Recent Findings

A growing body of evidence supports the use of SMART over the conventional use of controller medicaments with an as-needed short-acting β2 agonist for rescue therapy for the purpose of reducing the risk of asthma exacerbation and maintaining asthma control in adolescents and adults with persistent disease. Lack of US Food and Drug Administration approval, inconsistent insurance coverage, and limited options of ICS-formoterol combination available for use as SMART represent obstacles to wider integration of SMART in clinical practice.

Summary

SMART represents a paradigm shift in asthma management. By identifying and addressing the current and anticipated barriers to implementing SMART, its adoption by providers is likely to increase in the United States.

### EAACI biologicals guidelines-recommendations for severe asthma [^116pkF4Q]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe asthma imposes a significant burden on patients, families and healthcare systems. Management is difficult, due to disease heterogeneity, co-morbidities, complexity in care pathways and differences between national or regional healthcare systems. Better understanding of the mechanisms has enabled a stratified approach to the management of severe asthma, supporting the use of targeted treatments with biologicals. However, there are still many issues that require further clarification. These include selection of a certain biological (as they all target overlapping disease phenotypes), the definition of response, strategies to enhance the responder rate, the duration of treatment and its regimen (in the clinic or home-based) and its cost-effectiveness. The EAACI Guidelines on the use of biologicals in severe asthma follow the GRADE approach in formulating recommendations for each biological and each outcome. In addition, a management algorithm for the use of biologicals in the clinic is proposed, together with future approaches and research priorities.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^111X2tdK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations and research gaps

The Expert Panel identified several limitations in the process it used to identify topics and develop recommendations, including the following:
A better mechanism is needed to identify topics that need updating and to decrease the time between updates.
The process would benefit from a discussion and development of a plan about how to tailor guideline recommendations in the emerging era of personalized medicine.
Expanding engagement with professional societies might benefit both the development and the implementation of new recommendations.

The Expert Panel also identified several overarching research gaps listed below. Research gaps that are specific to individual topics are listed at the end of each topic section.

Research studies need to use the core outcome measures identified in the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop. Federal agencies that contributed to the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop report should require the studies they fund to measure outcomes as recommended in that report. Because new information on asthma outcomes is now available, the workshop report should be reexamined to determine whether it needs to be revised.
The clinical relevance of changes in outcome measures should be formally established to provide MIDs for all asthma outcomes (eg, exacerbations and asthma symptoms) and the cutoffs for tests (eg, F). Clinical relevance should be established using a wide range of stakeholder input, especially from individuals with asthma, who should also be included as members of the Expert Panel.
Updates are needed to the definitions of asthma severity that incorporate asthma phenotypes and endotypes. The definitions of low-, medium-, and high-dose ICSs also need to be updated.
Biologically appropriate subpopulations with asthma should be established and standardized. Although the populations of interest for the focused updates were defined for the systematic reviews, the characterizations of study participants did not reflect current understanding of relevant phenotypes and endotypes (eg, based on asthma severity, allergen-specific sensitization, or airway inflammatory type).
Standard reporting of results stratified by race and ethnicity as well as by age groups (0–4 years, 5–11 years, and 12 years and older) is needed to combine results across studies.
The vast majority of studies used to inform the guidelines were designed as efficacy studies, which evaluate treatment effects in relatively homogeneous populations and conditions in which fidelity to study protocols is actively promoted. Applicability to real-world clinical and community contexts requires studies with comparative effectiveness designs. Such research would benefit from the use of validated outcome measures and definitions of biologically appropriate subpopulations.
Studies need to use measures and outcomes that are important to individuals with asthma. The GRADE methodology gives highest priority to patient-centered outcomes. However, the studies that the Expert Panel used to develop the recommendations often did not measure outcomes that are most relevant or important to individuals with asthma. Research is needed to understand how preferred outcomes vary by race or ethnicity, asthma severity, age (eg, children or older adults), and socioeconomic status.
All measures and outcomes relevant to making judgments need to be included in the systematic reviews. For example, although cost-effectiveness data are available for some asthma interventions, the systematic review reports used for the updates did not include these data. Moreover, data regarding the safety of all interventions should be explicitly reported in publications on clinical trials.

### Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines [^11796vSa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Practice guidelines are more likely to be followed if they are simple and flexible. The development of country-specific guidelines or, ideally, local guidelines for each region would provide more practical solutions for asthma care and would account for factors, such as social factors and costs, that influence patient choice and adherence to therapy. Pragmatic clinical trials and well-designed observational trials are needed to provide information on the effectiveness of therapies in real-world settings. Finally, practical tools to facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of asthma and factors responsible for poor control, such as associated allergic rhinitis, limited adherence, and smoking behavior, are needed to supplement treatment information provided in clinical practice guidelines for asthma.

### Use of fractional exhaled nitric oxide to guide the treatment of asthma: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117Aq171]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Target Audience

This practice guideline is designed to provide guidance to clinicians who manage adults and children 4 years of age and older with asthma, including adult and pediatric pulmonologists, adult and pediatric allergists, internists, pediatricians, family medicine specialists, and other healthcare providers involved in the care of patients with asthma. The use of this guideline is not designed for the evaluation and management of acute asthma but rather is designed for treatment decisions in ambulatory settings for the ongoing management of this common disease.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^112CysyE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Step diagrams for asthma management — Each figure applies to the care of individuals with asthma in one age group; Fig 2 applies only to ages 0 to 4 years, Fig 3 applies only to ages 5 to 11 years, and Fig 4 applies only to ages 12 years and older. Clinicians decide which step of care is appropriate depending on whether the individual is newly diagnosed (ie, is treatment naive) or whether the clinician is adjusting the individual's therapy to achieve asthma control. Preferred and alternative treatments within a step category are listed alphabetically unless the Expert Panel has established a rank order of preference for the preferred or alternative treatments, and a lack of rank order is indicated by "or" between treatment options. In the stepwise approach to therapy for asthma, the clinician escalates treatment as needed (by moving to a higher step) or, if possible, deescalates treatment (by moving to a lower step) once the individual's asthma is well controlled for at least three consecutive months. For individuals with persistent asthma (ie, who require treatment at Step 2 or above), clinicians should be guided by the current step of treatment and the individual's response to therapy (in terms of both asthma control and adverse effects) both currently and in the past to decide whether to step up, step down, or continue the current therapy. For individuals with persistent asthma who are using an alternative treatment and have an unsatisfactory or inadequate response to that therapy, the Expert Panel suggests replacing the alternative treatment with the preferred treatment within the same step before stepping up therapy. The Expert Panel did not add management options that the panel recommends against, or for which the evidence is insufficient to determine harms and benefits, to the step diagrams; instead, these options are listed in Table IF, and the guidance provided in the step diagrams is meant to assist and not replace the clinical decision making required for individual patient management and the input from individuals with asthma about their preferences.

### Ensuring equitable access to guideline-based asthma care across the lifespan: tips and future directions to the successful implementation of the new NAEPP 2020 guidelines, a work group report of the AAAAI asthma, cough, diagnosis, and treatment committee [^1139aC4H]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

The most recent recommendations from the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Update and Global Initiative for Asthma 2021 guide evidence-based clinical decision making. However, given the present state of health disparities by age, income, and race, the equitable implementation and dissemination of these guidelines will be unlikely without further guidance. This work group report reviews the current state of the new asthma guideline implementation; presents updated evidence-based therapeutic options with attention to specific patient populations; and addresses barriers to the implementation of these guidelines in minoritized, historically marginalized, and underresourced communities. Allergists and immunologists can use practical ways to accomplish the goals of improved asthma care access and advanced asthma care across the life span, with specific considerations to historically marginalized populations. Modifiable barriers to guideline implementation include financial barriers, environmental factors, and allergy subspecialty access and care coordination. Various programs to improve access to guideline-based asthma care include community programs, school-based asthma programs, and digital health solutions, with an emphasis on reducing disparities by race.

### The disease management approach to controlling asthma [^114XYDe7]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma has become an important public health issue worldwide and certain groups, such as children, are at particular risk of the disease. Often asthma remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. Despite these worrying trends, the disease management approach to asthma control can help most asthma patients achieve a 'normal' way of life. The increased prevalence and greater diagnostic awareness of asthma have placed increased demands on healthcare resources, but effective asthma control can minimize the personal, social and economic burdens of asthma. Early diagnosis and immediate anti-inflammatory treatment is the first step in gaining control of symptoms. A stepwise approach is then used to classify asthma severity and treatment, with the number and frequency of medications increasing (step up) as asthma severity increases and decreasing (step down) when asthma is under control. This stepwise approach to asthma management necessitates regular review of treatment once asthma is under control. However, effective asthma management is dependent on successful patient education, adherence to prescribed medication and good doctor patient partnerships. Current treatment guidelines recommend the use of a written asthma management plan that should be agreed between the doctor and patient. These plans should cover all aspects of asthma treatment, including prevention steps for long-term control and action steps to stop attacks once a worsening in asthma has been recognized. This comprehensive approach to asthma management increases the likelihood of achieving asthma control, which in turn reduces the need for emergency visits to the hospital or clinic and reduces the limitations on physical activity previously imposed by the condition.

### National asthma education and prevention program 2020 guideline update: where Do we Go from here? [^114Tjudn]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What Is the Role of Asthma Biologics for Severe Asthma?

The Expert Panel acknowledges that there has been remarkable progress in our understanding of the different endotypes of severe asthma and the work that has helped to establish the therapeutic use of various monoclonal antibodies ("biologics"; e.g. anti-IL5, anti-IL5 receptor-α, and anti-IL4 receptor-α) for such patients. The absence of recommendations for the use of asthma biologics in the NAEPP 2020 guideline update is a major gap, especially given the rapid pace of discoveries after the priority topics for the update were established. Interested readers are encouraged to review recommendations regarding the use of asthma biologics by other groups, including GINA and the European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society.

### Treat to target approach for asthma [^111bEcUF]. The Journal of Asthma (2020). Medium credibility.

Recognition that about half of asthma deaths might be preventable if recommended guidelines are followed suggests that better implementation of established management strategies is needed. However, to achieve a further substantive reduction in asthma mortality, novel strategies will also be required. It is well established that asthma is a disease of chronic inflammation, with episodes of worsening inflammation associated with increased symptoms and/or exacerbations; however, current guidelines paradoxically recommend that initial treatment is only symptomatic, rather than directed at the underlying inflammatory mechanism. The "Treat to target" (TTT) approach has become a popular concept in the medical management of several common chronic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. For example, as part of a TTT approach, rheumatologists recommend methotrexate for RA with onset within 6months. Applying the TTT approach to asthma, the primary target could be clinical remission and the primary goals as follows: eliminate symptoms and exacerbation risk; prevent airway remodeling; and normalize lung function. To construct a TTT algorithm for chronic asthma, the proposal is to eradicate short-acting β2-agonists (SABA) at all asthma severity levels and replace SABA with "Anti-Inflammatory Reliever Therapy" (AIR), using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/SABA or ICS/formoterol. For individuals with equal to or less than 12 months' history of symptoms, fewer than two symptoms per month, no exacerbations in the last 12months and normal lung function, the recommendation is early initiation of ICS/SABA or ICS/formoterol as AIR.

### Real-world treatment trajectories of adults with newly diagnosed asthma or COPD [^116RfsVQ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are prevalent chronic respiratory conditions with a large global health burden (21.6 and 74.4 million disability-adjusted life-years, respectively). Both diseases have a negative impact on all aspects of life when not properly controlled and are responsible for (preventable) deaths, often as a result of acute exacerbations. Treatment is mainly organised via primary care and is aimed to minimise symptoms and prevent acute exacerbations. To support clinicians in the management of patients with asthma or COPD, several national and international guidelines have been developed which are frequently updated based on the latest research and insights. These guidelines suggest a stepwise treatment approach where treatment is initiated and tailored on the needs (ie, symptoms, severity, disease control and future risk) of the individual patient.

There is a lack of global knowledge on how patients with asthma or COPD are treated in the real world, especially with regard to the initial pharmacological treatment of newly diagnosed patients and the different treatment trajectories (encompassing both treatment step-up and treatment step-down strategies). Therefore, the purpose of this global characterisation study was to shed light on real-world treatment trajectories of newly diagnosed adults with asthma and COPD across different countries and continents. This descriptive study provides high-level insight into real-world treatment practices and helps to generate hypotheses for follow-up studies to address current gaps in clinical practice.

### Managing asthma in adolescents and adults: 2020 asthma guideline update from the national asthma education and prevention program [^116GSdob]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Asthma is a major public health problem worldwide and is associated with excess morbidity, mortality, and economic costs associated with lost productivity. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program has released the 2020 Asthma Guideline Update with updated evidence-based recommendations for treatment of patients with asthma.

Objective

To report updated recommendations for 6 topics for clinical management of adolescents and adults with asthma: (1) intermittent inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs); (2) add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists; (3) fractional exhaled nitric oxide; (4) indoor allergen mitigation; (5) immunotherapy; and (6) bronchial thermoplasty.

Evidence Review

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council chose 6 topics to update the 2007 asthma guidelines based on results from a 2014 needs assessment. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducted systematic reviews of these 6 topics based on literature searches up to March-April 2017. Reviews were updated through October 2018 and used by an expert panel (n = 19) that included asthma content experts, primary care clinicians, dissemination and implementation experts, and health policy experts to develop 19 new recommendations using the GRADE method. The 17 recommendations for individuals aged 12 years or older are reported in this Special Communication.

Findings

From 20 572 identified references, 475 were included in the 6 systematic reviews to form the evidence basis for these recommendations. Compared with the 2007 guideline, there was no recommended change in step 1 (intermittent asthma) therapy (as-needed short-acting β2-agonists [SABAs] for rescue therapy). In step 2 (mild persistent asthma), either daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA therapy or as-needed concomitant ICS and SABA therapy are recommended. Formoterol in combination with an ICS in a single inhaler (single maintenance and reliever therapy) is recommended as the preferred therapy for moderate persistent asthma in step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol therapy) and step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol therapy) for both daily and as-needed therapy. A short-term increase in the ICS dose alone for worsening of asthma symptoms is not recommended. Add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists are recommended in individuals whose asthma is not controlled by ICS-formoterol therapy for step 5 (moderate-severe persistent asthma). Fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing is recommended to assist in diagnosis and monitoring of symptoms, but not alone to diagnose or monitor asthma. Allergen mitigation is recommended only in individuals with exposure and relevant sensitivity or symptoms. When used, allergen mitigation should be allergen specific and include multiple allergen-specific mitigation strategies. Subcutaneous immunotherapy is recommended as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy for individuals with symptoms and sensitization to specific allergens. Sublingual immunotherapy is not recommended specifically for asthma. Bronchial thermoplasty is not recommended as part of standard care; if used, it should be part of an ongoing research effort.

Conclusions and Relevance

Asthma is a common disease with substantial human and economic costs globally. Although there is no cure or established means of prevention, effective treatment is available. Use of the recommendations in the 2020 Asthma Guideline Update should improve the health of individuals with asthma.

### Asthma update [^112whHmD]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and a leading cause of hospitalization. Acute management involves severity-based treatment of bronchoconstriction and underlying airway inflammation. Optimal treatment has been defined and standardized through randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and consensus guidelines. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines may improve clinical, quality, and safety outcomes. Asthma morbidity is disproportionately high in poor, urban, and minority children. Children treated in emergency departments commonly have persistent chronic severity, significant morbidity, and infrequent follow-up and primary asthma care, and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids is appropriate.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^115Qbc6X]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

6. Expanded indications for starting regular controller (preventer) treatment

The GINA report now includes a new table with evidence-based recommendations for initiating controller treatment. The most important change is a recommendation for earlier initiation of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids; for example, in patients with symptoms twice or more a month and/or risk factors for exacerbations, such as a need for oral corticosteroids in the last year. The aim is to reduce asthma risk, even if day-to-day symptoms are not frequent enough to be burdensome.

7. Tailoring asthma treatment for individual patients

The GINA report now describes a framework for personalised asthma management. While national guidelines provide recommendations about the treatment that may be most cost-effective across the whole population, patient-level decisions should also take into account any characteristics or phenotypes that predict the patient's risk or likely treatment response (e.g. smoking status, blood eosinophilia, admission to hospital for asthma in the previous year) together with patient goals and concerns and practical issues such as inhaler technique, adherence and cost to the patient.

8. Patients with features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

A new feature in GINA relates to the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome. Past guidelines for asthma and COPD have been separate, and most regulatory studies have excluded patients with both conditions. However, many patients have features of both asthma and COPD, including symptomatic smokers with a history of childhood asthma, and patients with asthma and fixed airflow limitation. In collaboration with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GINA 2014 included a new chapter outlining a syndromic approach to diagnosis in primary care, with pragmatic advice about safety considerations in choice of initial treatment (avoidance of long-acting β₂-agonist alone if the features suggest asthma, and avoiding inhaled corticosteroid-only treatment if the features suggest COPD). Therefore, it is important that asthma (or asthma–COPD overlap syndrome) should remain in the patient's list of diagnoses, even if they develop fixed airflow limitation.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^116Hnyhn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Moving forward, the process of guideline development needs to be more agile. Creating an ongoing process for developing recommendations that includes individuals with varied expertise and from multiple organizations may facilitate this process. In addition, the structure of the recommendations may need to change. The step diagrams, although useful, are a one-size-fits-all approach. The current recommendations use a patient-centered approach that is critical but not sufficient. In the emerging era of personalized medicine, tailored interventions and treatments customized to particular individuals with specific characteristics will be needed. Discussions about how to address individualized approaches to asthma care and how to incorporate these approaches into the standard of care are needed now so that future recommendations can integrate these new approaches.

Finally, I thank the members of the Expert Panel who voluntarily gave their time and expertise to complete this work. The amount of work that was needed in a compressed period of time from each member was very high. To them, to Drs Kiley and Mensah, whose support was unwavering, and to the NHLBI and Westat staff, thank you.

### New insights into the treatment of severe asthma in children [^112akKt7]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Severe asthma accounts for 0.5% of the general paediatric population and 4.5% of children with asthma, representing the major burden of asthma-health-care-associated costs. After ensuring a diagnosis of asthma and excluding difficult-to-treat patients with co-morbidities and non-adherence profiles, there remains children with real therapy-resistant asthma for whom the recommendations are to treat beyond guidelines. We describe new insights into the treatment of severe asthma in children, regarding both "classic drugs" (corticosteroids, bronchodilators) and innovative biological therapies targeting airway inflammation and impaired innate immunity. All of these new avenues remain to be studied and validated in children and will require fine clinical and biological phenotyping.

### Formoterol – where does it fit in the current guidelines? [^113RyRRy]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Drugs available to treat asthma have improved considerably over the past three decades and understanding of the disease process is continually improving. However, the incidence of asthma is increasing and the cause(s) of this increase are not yet identified. Asthma is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Poor compliance with medication is also an important consideration in how effective management strategies can be. The aim of current asthma treatment, according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), is to control the disease. However, two surveys, one in Europe and the other in the U.S. A. indicate that the objectives of treatment guidelines are not being met. Patients were shown to experience high rates of exacerbations and require many doses of reliever medication. There was also a large difference between patient and physician perceptions of treatment — this needs to be countered by improved education for both the general public and healthcare professionals. Formoterol, which is the only beta2-agonist to possess both fast- and long-acting properties, may help to improve patient compliance by allowing a single inhaler to be used for both maintenance and as-needed therapy. However, although formoterol is already widely used as maintenance therapy current treatment guidelines do not include the use of formoterol as first-line reliever medication. Evidence is increasing to support as-needed use and a large, randomized effect veness study in 18,000 patients across the world is ongoing to assess the safety and efficacy of formoterol as needed in a real-life setting. The results from the Real-Life Effectiveness of Oxis Turbuhaler (RELIEF) study should help to establish the position of formoterol as an effective first line reliever medication and ultimately lead to the inclusion of formoterol as needed in treatment guidelines.

### Asthma guidelines: comparison of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute expert panel report 4 with Global Initiative for Asthma 2021 [^114mz3rF]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma continues to be a prevalent respiratory disease that affects lives within the United States and worldwide. Clinical asthma guidelines based on scientific evidence on testing and therapeutic interventions are needed to control this disease better. To meet this need, the NAEPP (National Asthma Education and Prevention Program) and GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) were formed to assist with best practice diagnosis and treatments for asthma. This paper reviews the subtle differences and similarities between the most recent recommendations put forth by NAEPP 2020 and GINA 2021, mainly examining the six selected topics, as well as methodology, guidance on emerging topics, and implementation.

Recent Findings

In December 2020, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee released their focused update on fraction of exhaled nitric oxide, indoor allergen mitigation, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, allergen immunotherapy, and bronchial thermoplasty. The Global Initiative for Asthma comprehensive document is published annually as a framework for all nations. Therefore, it is timely to consider the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee 2020 in relation to the GINA 2021.

Summary

The comparison provides a better understanding of evidence-based recommendations for asthma. The NAEPP 2020 and GINA 2021 will equip providers with the knowledge to provide their patients with the best and most updated asthma care.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^112uwgAT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β₂-agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ≥ 60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β₂-agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

### The 2007 national asthma education and prevention program asthma guidelines: accelerating their implementation and facilitating their impact on children with asthma [^112hAGnZ]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Nearly 2 decades have elapsed since the National Center for Health Statistics raised concerns regarding the trends in increasing asthma prevalence. Additional research highlighted the large racial disparities and geographic variations in asthma morbidity and mortality rates. Although there was little national consensus on the care of children with asthma at the time, there were improvements in the understanding of the mechanisms and treatment of asthma. It was in this context that the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute launched the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program, which convened its first panel of experts to create the national consensus clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of asthma. More than 15 years have passed since the publication of those first guidelines and, in August 2007, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute released its newest updates, which are the product of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program third expert panel. The release of the updated guidelines serves as an occasion to examine important issues regarding the dissemination and clinical implementation of National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines. The goals of this report are to examine the adoption of earlier versions of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines and to suggest opportunities for rapid adoption of the newly released guidelines.

### A proposed revision of the stepwise treatment algorithm in asthma [^111sZBzt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The stepwise approach to the pharmacologic treatment of asthma is a core foundation of asthma guidelines. Through this approach, treatment intensity is increased in discrete steps to obtain symptom control and reduce exacerbation risk and is decreased after a period of prolonged control. The stepwise approach is usually shown by an algorithm, as illustrated in the 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) strategy update (Figure 1). Here, we review the 2020 GINA stepwise algorithm and suggest alternative evidence-based algorithms that address potential problems with the currently recommended approach.

Asthma guideline focused update — scope and features: The update is limited in scope and excludes biologic agents because including them "would have delayed the release of these recommendations for another 1 to 2 years", and "This update also is not a complete revision of EPR-3", with some areas "not covered". Reasons for these limits included "lack of time, lack of resources, and, for some topics, insufficient new evidence". To aid use, "the addition of an Implementation Guidance section for each recommendation" was made, and "Amended step diagrams for asthma management are also provided for the topics being updated".

Limitations and research gaps — The Expert Panel noted that a better mechanism is needed to identify topics that need updating and to decrease the time between updates, that the process would benefit from a plan about how to tailor guideline recommendations in the emerging era of personalized medicine, and that research studies need to use the core outcome measures identified in the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop. The clinical relevance of changes in outcome measures should be formally established to provide MIDs for all asthma outcomes and the cutoffs for tests, and updates are needed to the definitions of asthma severity that incorporate asthma phenotypes and endotypes; the definitions of low-, medium-, and high-dose ICSs also need to be updated. Biologically appropriate subpopulations with asthma should be established and standardized, and standard reporting of results stratified by race and ethnicity as well as by age groups (0–4 years, 5–11 years, and 12 years and older) is needed to combine results across studies. The vast majority of studies used to inform the guidelines were designed as efficacy studies, and applicability to real-world clinical and community contexts requires studies with comparative effectiveness designs; such research would benefit from the use of validated outcome measures and definitions of biologically appropriate subpopulations. Studies need to use measures and outcomes that are important to individuals with asthma, and the GRADE methodology gives highest priority to patient-centered outcomes; however, the studies that the Expert Panel used to develop the recommendations often did not measure outcomes that are most relevant or important to individuals with asthma. All measures and outcomes relevant to making recommendations need to be included in the systematic reviews, and although cost-effectiveness data are available for some asthma interventions, the systematic review reports used for the updates did not include these data; moreover, data regarding the safety of all interventions should be explicitly reported in publications on clinical trials.

Box 3–4. Population-level versus patient-level decisions about asthma treatment — population-level selection states that when choosing between treatment options at a population level (e.g., national formularies, health maintenance organizations, national guidelines), the 'preferred' medication at each step is the best treatment for most patients, based on efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and availability and cost at the population level, mainly based on evidence about symptoms and exacerbations (from randomized controlled trials, pragmatic studies and strong observational data). For Steps 1–5, there are different population-level recommendations by age-group (adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, children 5 years and younger), and in Step 5, there are also different population-level recommendations depending on the inflammatory phenotype, Type 2 or non-Type 2.

### How to compare the efficacy of biologic agents in asthma [^117DtY5v]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The use of biologics in severe asthma has made substantial strides in disease management and fostered a personalized medicine approach; however, how, when, and which biologic to choose are unresolved issues, which form the focus of this review.

Data Sources

The data sources were published literature, including current guidelines, available through PubMed searches and online resources.

Study Selections

Studies and randomized controlled trials pertaining to the use of biologics in various phenotypes and/or endotypes of asthma and comparative analyses between biologics in asthma were included.

Results

Inflammatory constructs in asthma are complex and translate differentially into clinical practice for both disease severity and treatment responsiveness. The utilization of biologics, which target selected components of inflammation, has begun to dramatically improve the course of management for many patients with severe asthma. A retuning of our approach into selecting appropriate patient cohorts or phenotypes for studies and selection of clinically relevant outcomes, which are reflected by existing and novel emerging biomarkers, is enabling a paradigm shift in asthma management. Comparing the efficacy of the available biologics for asthma is challenging as no direct head-to-head studies are available, and indirect comparisons to this query provide varying results.

Conclusion

Significant progress has been achieved in the management of severe asthma with treatment of target-specific biologics. Sophisticated algorithms and trial designs, using a combination of available biomarker profiles and clinical characteristics to stratify patient populations into more precise subphenotypes and endotypes to guide our choice of a biologic or therapy, are critically needed but currently not formulated.

SECTION V: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF LAMAs FOR ASTHMA

Background

LAMAs comprise a pharmacologic class of long-acting bronchodilators. The role of LAMAs in the management of asthma was not addressed in Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. Since that report's publication in 2007, several trials have investigated LAMAs as controller therapy for individuals with asthma.

The Expert Panel examined the harms and benefits of LAMAs in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma and addressed three key questions. The Expert Panel did not examine the role of LAMA treatment in children aged 6 to 11 years because the key questions and systematic reviews did not address this age group. With the exception of one study that examined the LAMA umeclidinium, the RCTs reviewed by the Expert Panel used tiotropium bromide as the LAMA. At the time this report was written, tiotropium bromide (Respimat) was the only formulation of LAMA with US FDA approval for asthma treatment. The majority of LAMA studies used a comparative efficacy design, and not an effectiveness design, but the key questions were about effectiveness. Therefore, the clinical impact of LAMA treatment in real-world settings is not well understood. Table V provides an overview of the key questions and recommendations on LAMAs.

Definitions of terms used in this section

In this section, "controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. The term "ICS-LABA" indicates therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually (and preferably) in a single inhaler.

Question 5.1

What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA compared with other controller therapy as add-on therapy to ICSs in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

Question 5.2

What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA as add-on therapy to ICS controller therapy compared with placebo or increased ICS dose in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

Recommendation 14: In individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against adding LAMA to ICS compared to adding LABA to ICS.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

Recommendation 15: If LABA is not used, in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends adding LAMA to ICS controller therapy compared to continuing the same dose of ICS alone.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

Update on strategies to manage the elderly patient with asthma — guideline context and nonpharmacologic care: Current evidence-based guidelines for asthma are derived from studies on younger individuals, as older patients are frequently excluded from clinical trials, and only a few reports have addressed the management of the elderly population with asthma. It is widely accepted that asthma is often undertreated in older patients. The appropriate management of any chronic disease in the elderly, including asthma, should include multidimensional assessment (MDA) of physical, psychological, cognitive, and social factors that may impact successful treatment. Nonpharmacological management strategies emphasize that optimal asthma management for all patients incorporates avoidance of known asthma triggers.

Recognize that too far or too quickly stepping down may increase exacerbation risk even if symptoms remain reasonably controlled,
and complete cessation of ICSs is associated with a significantly increased risk of exacerbations.

Implementing asthma management strategies — methodology and adaptation note that when asthma care is consistent with evidence-based recommendations, outcomes improve; rigorous methodologies such as GRADE for developing recommendations and ADAPTE for adapting them have assisted in reducing biased opinion in asthma programs; adaptation of recommendations to local conditions using the GRADE method is costly and often requires expertise not available locally, with regular revision required; the GINA annual report is not a formal guideline but an evidence-based strategy, updated yearly from a review of the evidence published in the last 18 months; and, as with other evidence-based clinical recommendations, the GINA strategy must be adapted to the local context for implementation in clinical practice.

### Can we measure whether asthma guidelines lead to improved care? [^111NdquG]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) and Scottish Intercollege Guidelines Network (SIGN), as well as National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), have previously produced separate asthma guidance differing in some key aspects in diagnosis and management leading to confusion, potentially hampering guideline dissemination and uptake. While there are inherent challenges, the upcoming release of new joint BTS/SIGN/NICE asthma guidance presents an opportunity to assess guideline adoption and its impact on clinical practice. The use of prescription data via databases such as OpenPrescribing can be used as a surrogate for guideline adoption and potentially linked to clinical outcomes such as hospital episode statistics (HES). The potential recommendation for anti-inflammatory reliever therapy (AIR) and maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) with inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol combination therapy in the next iteration of UK asthma guidance will require the accurate coding for the respective therapeutic approaches on prescribing platforms in order to assess their impact in real-life clinical practice. This could then direct targeted measures to improve wider guidance adoption leading to better clinical care in asthma based on up to date evidence.
