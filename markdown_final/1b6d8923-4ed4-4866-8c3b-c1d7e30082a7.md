## Question

fosfomycin for klebsiella uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether and how to use fosfomycin for Klebsiella urinary tract infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context distinctions that drive therapy. Then, I should verify what regulators and major guidelines actually endorse. Next, I will review in vitro susceptibility patterns and their reliability, followed by pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in urine. After that, I'll examine clinical effectiveness data, safety, and resistance concerns. Finally, I'll synthesize practical recommendations, checking for special populations and correcting any premature conclusions along the way to ensure the advice is clinically defensible and reference-aligned [^112HsPQX] [^115gXGo1] [^116o8CN8].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario framing, because the appropriateness of fosfomycin hinges on whether this is acute uncomplicated cystitis in a nonpregnant woman versus complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, and on the organism's resistance phenotype, including ESBL or carbapenemase production, which will steer agent selection and route of therapy [^116GR3iW] [^116o8CN8].

> I need to check the regulatory label, since off-label use affects risk–benefit calculus and medico-legal framing. The FDA labeling for oral fosfomycin tromethamine indicates use only for uncomplicated cystitis due to susceptible E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis, explicitly noting it is not indicated for pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess and that clinical effectiveness for other organisms, including Klebsiella, has not been established, which means any use for Klebsiella is off-label and lacks manufacturer-supported clinical efficacy data [^112HsPQX] [^116AD9zT].

> Next, I should review current guideline recommendations. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the EAU lists fosfomycin, pivmecillinam, or nitrofurantoin as first-line for acute cystitis in women, but that is organism-agnostic and not a Klebsiella endorsement per se, while the IDSA 2024 AMR guidance is explicit that for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, oral fosfomycin is an alternative for E. coli only in uncomplicated cystitis and should not be used for Klebsiella, and that oral fosfomycin is not recommended for pyelonephritis/complicated UTI, aligning with EAU advice against oral fosfomycin for pyelonephritis [^115gXGo1] [^116GR3iW] [^111pVC8n] [^116o8CN8].

> I will now examine in vitro susceptibility to set expectations. Klebsiella pneumoniae susceptibility to fosfomycin hovers around 80% overall and approximately 81% among ESBL producers in pooled surveys, notably lower and more variable than for E. coli, which is typically 95–97%, meaning empiric coverage for Klebsiella is unreliable and geographically labile, and susceptibility tends to erode with increased use over time, all of which should temper enthusiasm for empiric fosfomycin against suspected Klebsiella cystitis [^114rZhkp] [^113WhEj8] [^115yDk7c].

> Hold on, I should verify whether clinical trials actually support efficacy in Klebsiella UTIs. The pivotal outpatient cystitis RCT showed 5-day nitrofurantoin superior to single-dose fosfomycin, but the population was predominantly E. coli and does not provide robust Klebsiella-specific outcomes, while meta-analyses in acute cystitis show noninferiority overall but again with very small Klebsiella representation, so we cannot extrapolate efficacy for Klebsiella with confidence; IV fosfomycin in ZEUS for complicated UTI did include K. pneumoniae with apparently similar subgroup cure rates, but those Klebsiella analyses were underpowered and do not validate oral fosfomycin for Klebsiella cystitis or any oral use in complicated disease [^1139v98s] [^111ZFoxh] [^114jxCZz].

> Let me think about PK/PD next, because urinary exposure is the linchpin of single-dose oral fosfomycin. After a 3 g oral dose, urine concentrations peak very high but demonstrate marked interindividual variability, with a substantial minority falling below the EUCAST urinary breakpoint by 48–72 hours, and Klebsiella MIC distributions often sit near the breakpoint, creating an exposure–response risk window that could favor clinical failure and resistance selection in Klebsiella, especially without validated multi-dose regimens for this pathogen in uncomplicated infections [^115JfJLz] [^114eMU4Y].

> I should confirm that the susceptibility test itself is reliable before interpreting a "susceptible" result for Klebsiella. Diffusion-based fosfomycin tests, especially in fosA-positive K. pneumoniae, have high major error rates, risking false susceptibility calls; agar dilution or carefully performed broth microdilution is preferred when therapeutic decisions hinge on fosfomycin activity, which complicates real-world use for Klebsiella where standard lab methods may mislead [^113d6cVo] [^114eMU4Y].

> Next, I should review safety and resistance emergence. Single-dose oral fosfomycin is generally well tolerated with mostly mild GI adverse effects, but importantly the FDA warns not to repeat daily doses for a single episode due to lack of added efficacy and increased adverse events, and the drug is prone to resistance emergence with repeated or suboptimal exposures, further arguing against marginal PK/PD use cases such as Klebsiella near-breakpoint infections without robust supportive data [^1145BgAP] [^1165FGVC] [^114eMU4Y].

> Let me synthesize implications for uncomplicated cystitis when Klebsiella is suspected. I should double-check my impulse to allow empiric fosfomycin if local susceptibility is "high"; wait, given IDSA's E. coli-only stance for ESBL cystitis and the lower, variable Klebsiella susceptibility and testing pitfalls, empiric oral fosfomycin should be avoided for suspected Klebsiella cystitis, with preferred oral agents being nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX if susceptible and fluoroquinolones as alternatives when necessary, and only considering oral fosfomycin in rare circumstances when culture confirms reliable susceptibility by a robust method and other preferred options are unavailable or contraindicated [^115gXGo1] [^1139v98s] [^115fXgm6].

> For pyelonephritis or complicated UTI due to Klebsiella, my first thought is to call oral fosfomycin an absolute contraindication; hmm, wait a minute, I should correct that wording. It is not "contraindicated" per se, but it is not indicated and is not recommended by major guidelines; appropriate therapy should be TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone if susceptible, with carbapenems preferred when resistance precludes those options, and oral fosfomycin should not be used for pyelonephritis or complicated infections, which is consistent with both FDA labeling and EAU/IDSA guidance [^112HsPQX] [^116GR3iW] [^111pVC8n].

> But wait, what about MDR or ESBL-producing Klebsiella with few oral options. Let me reconsider the role of IV fosfomycin. Evidence such as ZEUS suggests IV fosfomycin can perform comparably to standard therapy in complicated UTI, including a K. pneumoniae subset, yet subgroup data are underpowered and resistance emergence remains a concern; if used, IV fosfomycin should generally be in combination regimens and ideally in consultation with infectious diseases, while novel beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor agents or carbapenems should be prioritized according to susceptibility and IDSA AMR guidance [^114jxCZz] [^116rLZrN] [^116bAmow].

> I should confirm special populations and caveats. In pregnancy, single-dose oral fosfomycin is an accepted option for uncomplicated cystitis, but this does not overcome the organism-level evidence gap for Klebsiella efficacy; it remains inappropriate for pyelonephritis, where parenteral therapy is indicated, and catheter-associated or structurally complicated infections similarly argue against oral fosfomycin use, particularly for Klebsiella; in renal impairment, formal dose adjustment is not required for oral fosfomycin, but given the high variability in urinary exposures, caution is warranted when MICs sit near breakpoints or when urine flow is high [^112cXzjt] [^112HsPQX] [^116GR3iW] [^115JfJLz].

> Final check before concluding: the key points cohere. There is a regulatory gap for Klebsiella, guideline restrictions limiting oral fosfomycin's role to E. coli cystitis in IDSA AMR guidance, lower and variable Klebsiella susceptibility with testing pitfalls, PK/PD uncertainty at Klebsiella MICs, and a lack of robust, Klebsiella-specific outpatient oral data; therefore, avoid empiric oral fosfomycin for suspected Klebsiella cystitis, reserve consideration for rare culture-proven susceptible cases when preferred agents cannot be used, and do not use oral fosfomycin for pyelonephritis or complicated UTIs, while considering IV options, including IV fosfomycin in combination, only within a broader, susceptibility-guided framework for MDR infections [^112HsPQX] [^115gXGo1] [^114rZhkp] [^1139v98s].

Fosfomycin is **not recommended for Klebsiella UTIs** because Klebsiella pneumoniae has only moderate susceptibility (about 80%) [^114rZhkp] and resistance emerges rapidly, especially in ESBL- or carbapenemase-producing strains [^113WhEj8] [^115LC9Cn]. The 2024 IDSA guidance **does not include fosfomycin for Klebsiella UTIs** [^115gXGo1] and reserves it for E. coli when no alternatives exist. For Klebsiella UTIs, use nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX if susceptible [^115gXGo1], with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems as alternatives [^116GR3iW]; avoid fosfomycin unless no other options are available and susceptibility is confirmed.

---

## Susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae to fosfomycin

- **Moderate susceptibility**: Klebsiella pneumoniae shows about 80% susceptibility to fosfomycin [^114rZhkp], lower than E. coli (97%) [^112LE9a2].

- **Resistance in ESBL/AmpC**: ESBL- or AmpC-producing Klebsiella have significantly lower susceptibility to fosfomycin [^113WhEj8].

- **Rapid resistance emergence**: Resistance can develop quickly [^115LC9Cn] [^113d6cVo] during therapy, limiting effectiveness in Klebsiella UTIs.

---

## Clinical efficacy of fosfomycin in klebsiella UTIs

Evidence for fosfomycin in Klebsiella UTIs is **limited and less robust than for E. coli**, with consistently lower clinical and microbiological cure rates, particularly in resistant strains. Accordingly, it is **not recommended as first-line therapy** for Klebsiella UTIs, as moderate susceptibility and rapid resistance emergence undermine effectiveness.

---

## Current clinical guidelines

- **IDSA 2024 guidance**: Recommends nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems are alternatives [^115gXGo1].

- **Fosfomycin for E. coli only**: IDSA lists oral fosfomycin as an alternative for E. coli only, not Klebsiella [^115gXGo1] [^112HsPQX].

- **No recommendation for Klebsiella**: Fosfomycin is not recommended for Klebsiella UTIs in current guidelines [^115gXGo1].

---

## Resistance mechanisms in klebsiella pneumoniae

Klebsiella pneumoniae develops fosfomycin resistance via **plasmid-encoded FosA enzymes** [^113d6cVo] that inactivate the drug, as well as efflux pump upregulation and porin mutations that reduce intracellular concentrations. These mechanisms enable **rapid selection of resistance** during therapy, limiting clinical utility.

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Lower cure and higher recurrence are observed in **Klebsiella UTIs treated with fosfomycin** compared with E. coli. Resistance-driven failure occurs as **rapid resistance emergence** contributes to clinical failure and recurrence [^115LC9Cn].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Fosfomycin is **generally well tolerated** [^111ZFoxh]; gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea and diarrhea are most commonly reported [^112HsPQX]. Serious adverse events are uncommon; however, in Klebsiella UTIs the principal limitation is the **rapid emergence of resistance**.

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

- **Nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX**: Preferred for uncomplicated cystitis if susceptible [^115gXGo1] [^1139v98s].

- **Fluoroquinolones or carbapenems**: Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems are alternatives for complicated or resistant infections [^116GR3iW].

- **Aminoglycosides**: Consider as alternative options [^116GR3iW] [^116FBNfn].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended antibiotics** | **Fosfomycin role** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cystitis | - Nitrofurantoin <br/> - TMP/SMX [^115gXGo1] | Not recommended |
| Complicated UTIs | - Ciprofloxacin <br/> - Levofloxacin <br/> - Carbapenems [^116GR3iW] | Not recommended |
| ESBL-producing Klebsiella | - Carbapenems <br/> - Aminoglycosides [^116GR3iW] | Not recommended |
| Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella | - Ceftazidime-avibactam <br/> - Meropenem-vaborbactam [^116bAmow] <br/> - Cefiderocol | Not recommended |

---

Fosfomycin is **not recommended for Klebsiella UTIs** due to moderate susceptibility and rapid resistance emergence [^115gXGo1] [^115LC9Cn]. Use nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, fluoroquinolones, or carbapenems based on susceptibility and clinical context [^116GR3iW].

### Infectious diseases society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections [^115gXGo1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically in managing Enterobacterales infections with ESBL-producing strains, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend administering nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX as preferred options for treating uncomplicated cystitis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Alternative options include ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems; however, do not use these if nitrofurantoin and TMP/SMX are active. Additional alternative options include a single-dose aminoglycoside or oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only).

Susceptibility testing results show that *Escherichia* isolates exhibited very good susceptibility to fosfomycin (97.0%), nitrofurantoin (96.6%), and cefuroxime (90.5%), but demonstrated poorer susceptibility to other common first-line antibiotics such as co-trimoxazole (67.8%) and ciprofloxacin (75.8%). *Klebsiella* strains were highly susceptible only to fosfomycin (80.4%), with other tested first-line antibiotics showing poor activity (ranging from 52.4% to 43.5%). Moreover, fosfomycin was the most active antibiotic for *Enterobacter* isolates, with 82.8% susceptibility compared to a range of 77.2% to 0.0% susceptibility for other tested first-line antibiotics. Other Gram-negative bacterial isolates generally showed high susceptibility to fosfomycin, except for *Providencia* (44.1% susceptibility) and *Morganella* (only 16.2% susceptible).

- **Overall susceptibility**: Other susceptibility results for the main groups of Gram-negative bacteria are outlined in the paragraphs instead of a table format. Further species-specific results show:

Regarding the management of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, particularly those involving Enterobacterales, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend administering TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin as preferred options for the treatment of pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Ertapenem, meropenem, or imipenem/cilastatin should be administered as preferred options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP/SMX or fluoroquinolones. Aminoglycosides are suggested as an alternative option.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: data from a unicentric study [^111HMGzT]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin (Phosphomycin), introduced as a new antimicrobial substance in 1969, is characterized as an anti-cell wall bactericidal antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It was extensively used as a highly effective antimicrobial drug, particularly for treating urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, with the advent of new antibiotics such as β-lactams or fluoroquinolones, its use became somewhat obsolete.

In the past decade, reports of a rapid increase in resistant pathogens, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers and multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens (defined as non-susceptible to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories), have emerged. Due to the lack of effective antimicrobial drugs for these cases, some older antibiotics have been tested for their efficacy against multi-resistant bacteria. Fosfomycin was among these, and according to results from previously published studies, it has demonstrated considerable in vitro activity against resistant bacteria such as ESBL-producers, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This evidence has generated increased interest in the use of fosfomycin over the past five years.

For a long time, fosfomycin was not available in the Czech Republic, but since October 2014, it has been accessible in the oral formulation as fosfomycin trometamol.

### High interindividual variability in urinary fosfomycin concentrations in healthy female volunteers [^115JfJLz]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin is increasingly being prescribed for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in an era of emerging drug resistance. Surprisingly, little is known about the urinary concentrations of fosfomycin and its interindividual variation after the standard single 3-g oral dose. This study aimed to gain more insight into urinary fosfomycin pharmacokinetics to evaluate its effectiveness.

Three grams of fosfomycin trometamol was administered to 40 healthy female volunteers with an estimated mean glomerular filtration rate of > 90 mL/min/1.73m². Urine samples were collected from every urination during 48 hours and then twice daily for up to 7 days. Time, volume, and pH were recorded. Concentrations were quantified with UPLC-MS/MS. Effectiveness was evaluated based on urinary concentrations and the target MIC of E. coli, the most common uropathogen.

A high interindividual variability was found. Peak concentration was 1982.0 ± 1257.4 mg/L, urinary half-life 12.4 ± 5.7 hours, and excretion rate over 48 hours 29.9 ± 7.1 mg/h. Recovery was 44.5 ± 12.6% after 48 hours and 47.0 ± 10.4% after 7 days. Concentrations remained above the EUCAST breakpoint of 32 mg/L in 100% of the volunteers over the first 24 hours, 67.5% for 48 hours, and 30% for 72 hours. A high urinary output was associated with low urinary concentrations and consequently reduced time > MIC, AUC 0–7days/MIC, and C max/MIC values.

Considerable interindividual variability observed in the pharmacokinetics of fosfomycin signifies a risk for inadequate drug exposure in a significant portion of patients.

### Fosfomycin for injection (ZTI-01) versus piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection including acute pyelonephritis: ZEUS, a phase 2/3 randomized trial [^111EAchn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

- **Secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints**: Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoints were largely consistent across various baseline patient characteristics. Clinical cure rates were greater than 90% in both treatment groups at TOC in MITT, m-MITT, CE, and ME groups.

	- Baseline cUTI/AP caused by a baseline pathogen that was resistant to PIP-TAZ was uncommon, affecting 14 ZTI-01 patients and 9 PIP-TAZ patients. Of the 9 PIP-TAZ patients infected with a PIP-TAZ-resistant pathogen, 33.3% were clinical cures compared with 78.6% of ZTI-01-treated patients. Among patients infected with a PIP-TAZ-susceptible uropathogen at baseline, overall success rates were similar to those observed in the primary endpoint analysis, with 64.7% for ZTI-01 and 56.7% for PIP-TAZ.

- **Microbiology**: Most patients (92.4% ZTI-01, 94.4% PIP-TAZ, m-MITT) had a monomicrobial Gram-negative infection at baseline. The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli (72.3% ZTI-01, 74.7% PIP-TAZ) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.7% ZTI-01, 14.0% PIP-TAZ). All tested E. coli isolates in the ZTI-01 group were susceptible, with a provisional breakpoint MIC of ≤ 64 μg/mL, and 97.0% were susceptible to PIP-TAZ, with an MIC ≤ 16 μg/mL.

	- Overall success, as determined by PFGE analysis at TOC in the m-MITT group, occurred in 72.2% (96/133) of ZTI-01 and 57.9% (77/133) of PIP-TAZ patients who were infected with E. coli at baseline. For patients infected at baseline with K. pneumoniae, success was observed in 63.0% (17/27) of ZTI-01 and 52.0% (13/25) of PIP-TAZ patients.

### Once-daily plazomicin for complicated urinary tract infections [^116FBNfn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The increasing multidrug resistance among gram-negative uropathogens necessitates new treatments for serious infections. Plazomicin is an aminoglycoside with bactericidal activity against multidrug-resistant (including carbapenem-resistant) Enterobacteriaceae.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 609 patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), including acute pyelonephritis, in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous plazomicin (15 mg per kilogram of body weight once daily) or meropenem (1 g every 8 hours), with optional oral step-down therapy after at least 4 days of intravenous therapy, for a total of 7 to 10 days of therapy. The primary objective was to show the noninferiority of plazomicin to meropenem in the treatment of complicated UTIs, including acute pyelonephritis, with a noninferiority margin of 15 percentage points. The primary endpoints were composite cure (clinical cure and microbiologic eradication) at day 5 and at the test-of-cure visit (15 to 19 days after initiation of therapy) in the microbiologic modified intention-to-treat population.

- **Results**: Plazomicin was noninferior to meropenem with respect to the primary efficacy endpoints. At day 5, composite cure was observed in 88.0% of the patients (168 of 191 patients) in the plazomicin group and in 91.4% (180 of 197 patients) in the meropenem group (difference, -3.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -10.0 to 3.1). At the test-of-cure visit, composite cure was observed in 81.7% (156 of 191 patients) and 70.1% (138 of 197 patients), respectively (difference, 11.6 percentage points).

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^111Sijk9]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

The number of complications differed between groups: there were five cases of pyelonephritis in the ibuprofen group and one in the fosfomycin group (P = 0.12). Women who developed pyelonephritis had a higher initial symptom score than average (7.5 versus 6). Five women with pyelonephritis consulted their general practitioners with symptoms of upper urinary tract infection, such as fever and loin tenderness, within the first seven days; one consulted at day 16. All women were treated as outpatients and recovered fully. Figure 9, which is unavailable here, originally depicted the courses of symptoms in women with pyelonephritis.

- **Rate of urinary tract infection recurrence**: The rate of urinary tract infection recurrence was comparable in both groups. However, there were significantly more recurrences after day 14 in the fosfomycin group (11% versus 6% in the ibuprofen group, P = 0.049). Of these, 5 out of 14 (36%) women in the ibuprofen group had a prior history of recurrent urinary tract infections compared with 16 out of 27 (60%) in the fosfomycin group. In contrast, more women in the ibuprofen group experienced early relapses of symptoms (up to day 14), but this difference was not significant (5% versus 3%; P = 0.18).

### The role of challenges with fosfomycin susceptibility testing of multispecies Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates [^113d6cVo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Our data suggest that the addition of PPF may have a synergistic effect with fosfomycin against fosA-positive organisms. This is corroborated by a recently published study that found significant MIC reductions and restored fosfomycin susceptibility in fosA-positive Gram-negative organisms. PPF is available as the antiviral foscarnet but would likely be unattractive as an adjuvant therapy due to toxicity.

Our study is limited by a small sample size of bla KPC-positive multidrug-resistant isolates collected from a single center. We are unable to make inferences on non-KPC-positive isolates, as they were not included in this study. However, the clinical utility of fosfomycin is primarily against MDR isolates, and our study highlights the difficulty in accurately providing fosfomycin antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for these organisms. A further limitation is the lack of exploration of other molecular mechanisms of resistance, which were not evaluated in all isolates. Our study also lacks outcome data; therefore, we can make no conclusions on the clinical implications of fosfomycin susceptibility testing results.

In conclusion, fosfomycin appears to have reliable in vitro activity against KPC-producing Gram-negative organisms by agar dilution. However, methods readily available in a clinical microbiology laboratory, such as the Etest and DD, generate frequent major errors, with the presence of fosA impacting the interpretation of these diffusion-based methods. Caution is advised when interpreting and releasing AST results derived from diffusion-based methods for these organisms.

### Antimicrobials: A global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^112MjjLB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin: Renewed interest in "old" antibiotics has also focused attention on fosfomycin. Traditionally, fosfomycin disodium was administered parenterally; however, several countries have recently approved the oral administration of fosfomycin tromethamine for treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by *Escherichia coli* and *E. faecalis*. Its use as a single agent is usually restricted in critically ill patients. Intravenous fosfomycin has been administered in combination with other antibiotics for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including KPC.

The daily dose of intravenous fosfomycin disodium ranges from 12 to 16 g on average, administered in 2–4 infusions. Renal impairment significantly decreases the excretion of fosfomycin, and, for intravenous administration, the doses should be reduced if the creatinine clearance is less than 50 ml/min.

The primary limitations of fosfomycin are the lack of established regimens for complicated infections and the lack of availability of the intravenous formulation in many countries.

New antibiotics: Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam have recently been approved by some national agencies for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. By adding beta-lactamase inhibitors (tazobactam or avibactam), these new agents have strong activity against MDR Gram-negative pathogens. Unlike other beta-lactam and beta-lactamase inhibitor combination agents, these should be combined with metronidazole for complicated intra-abdominal infections due to limited activity against some *Bacteroides* species.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^114C7B8i]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

- **Methods**

- **Trial design and participants**: ICUTI (Immediate versus Conditional treatment of Urinary Tract Infection) was a double-blind, randomised multicentre comparative effectiveness trial with two parallel active treatment arms (ibuprofen and fosfomycin). The study was conducted according to the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Safety data were monitored throughout and assessed every six months by the data and safety monitoring board. Serious adverse events were defined as adverse events leading to admission to hospital, disability, permanent damage, or risk of dying or death.

The detailed study protocol has been published elsewhere. From February 2012 to February 2014, practice staff and general practitioners in 42 general practices in northern Germany systematically approached women aged 18–65 with typical symptoms of urinary tract infection for consent. The upper age limit was chosen as, until 2013, fosfomycin was approved only for patients up to age 65.

The study was designed as a pragmatic trial in a general practice setting. Inclusion criteria were dysuria and/or frequency/urgency of micturition, with or without lower abdominal pain. The main exclusion criteria were any signs of upper urinary tract infection (fever, loin tenderness); conditions that could increase the likelihood of potentially complicated courses (such as pregnancy or renal diseases); urinary tract infection within the past two weeks; and urinary catheterisation. We also excluded patients currently treated with non-steroidal drugs for pain or antibiotics.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^115YfPgB]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

- **Randomisation and baseline characteristics**: A total of 1184 women with suspected urinary tract infection were screened, and 779 were considered eligible. Of these, 494 were randomly assigned to the treatment or control groups (Fig. 1). On average, 12 women per practice were included in 42 practices. Ten women with exclusion criteria were incorrectly included by general practitioners and were excluded immediately after recruitment by a masked researcher. The intention-to-treat population comprised 241 women in the ibuprofen group and 243 in the fosfomycin group. Three women, in whom exclusion criteria were detected later after inclusion, remained in this population. Additionally, two women in the ibuprofen group and seven in the fosfomycin group refused further participation and withdrew from the trial.

- **Participant flow: Workflow**: The flow of participants through the trial of ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for women with urinary tract infection is depicted in Fig. 1.

- **Baseline characteristics**: There were no major differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Minor differences included the duration of symptoms, with 110 (46%) women in the fosfomycin group versus 87 (36%) in the ibuprofen group experiencing symptoms for more than two days. Additionally, urinary tract infections were reported more often by women assigned to the fosfomycin group (54 (23%) versus 42 (17%)).

Table 1 provides the baseline characteristics of women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection randomized to ibuprofen or fosfomycin. Figures are numbers of women (percentage) unless stated otherwise. SD = standard deviation; IQR = interquartile range; UTI = urinary tract infection.

### EAU guidelines on urological infections [^116o8CN8]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute cystitis, specifically in relation to antibiotic therapy, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend initiating fosfomycin trometamol, pivmecillinam, or nitrofurantoin as first-line therapy in female patients with cystitis.

### Effect of 5-day nitrofurantoin vs single-dose fosfomycin on clinical resolution of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women: A randomized clinical trial [^1139v98s]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

The study "Nitrofurantoin vs. fosfomycin in uncomplicated UTI" addressed diseases such as acute cystitis and acute pyelonephritis. The primary trial question was: What is the effect of a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin on female patients with uncomplicated UTIs?

The study design was a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 513 female patients. The inclusion criteria focused on female patients with uncomplicated UTIs. Key exclusion criteria included pregnancy and lactation, suspected upper urinary tract infections (UTI), antibiotic use or any symptoms consistent with UTIs in the preceding four weeks, the presence of an indwelling catheter, immunosuppression, and ongoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

- **Interventions**:
	- 255 patients received oral nitrofurantoin (100 mg PO TID for five days).
	- 258 patients received a single 3 g oral dose of fosfomycin.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- Significant increase in clinical resolution at 28 days after therapy completion (70% vs. 58%; ARD 12, 95% CI 4 to 21).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant increase in microbiologic resolution (74% vs. 63%; ARD 11, 95% CI 1 to 20).
	- Significant increase in clinical response at 14 days (75% vs. 66%; ARR 9, 95% CI 1 to 17).

### Fosfomycin for the treatment of multidrug-resistant, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing, enterobacteriaceae infections: A systematic review [^113WhEj8]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Rising rates of resistance to antimicrobial drugs among Enterobacteriaceae limit the choice of reliably active forms of these drugs. We evaluated the evidence on fosfomycin as a treatment option for infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae with advanced resistance to antimicrobial drugs, including producers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). We systematically reviewed studies evaluating the antimicrobial activity or the clinical effectiveness of fosfomycin.

Seventeen antimicrobial-susceptibility studies were found and included in our review, accounting for 5057 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae with advanced resistance to antimicrobial drugs (4448 were producers of ESBL). Eleven of the 17 studies reported that at least 90% of the isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin. Using a provisional minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility breakpoint of 64 mg/L or less, 1604 (96.8%) of 1657 Escherichia coli isolates producing ESBL were susceptible to fosfomycin. Similarly, 608 (81.3%) of 748 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates producing ESBL were susceptible to fosfomycin.

In two clinical studies, oral treatment with fosfomycin-trometamol was clinically effective against complicated or uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections caused by ESBL-producing E. coli in, cumulatively, 75 (93.8%) of the 80 patients evaluated. Initial clinical data support the use of fosfomycin for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by these pathogens, although further research is needed.

### Fosfomycin trometamol versus comparator antibiotics for the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ZFoxh]. The Journal of Urology (2020). High credibility.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness and safety profile of fosfomycin vs. comparator antibiotics in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis.

- **Materials and methods**: Relevant databases were searched using methods recommended by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. We assessed the risk of bias and confounders. The study's primary endpoint was clinical or microbiological success, defined as the complete (cure) and/or incomplete resolution of symptoms at the end of treatment (improvement) and/or microbiological eradication.

- **Results**: After screening 539 articles, 15 were included, which recruited a total of 2,295 adult female patients. Of these studies, 14 were used for microbiological eradication analysis. We used 11 of the 15 articles in a total of 1,976 patients for clinical resolution and 11 in a total of 1,816 patients for safety outcome analysis. No difference was found for clinical resolution in all comparators combined in 11 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 1,976 patients (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.91–1.49, p = 0.13). No difference was found for microbiological eradication in 14 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 2,052 patients (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.83–1.30, p = 0.09) or for safety outcome in 11 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 1,816 patients (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.86–1.58, p = 0.33). Most adverse effects reported for fosfomycin were transient and single-dose therapy seems to have resulted in better patient compliance.

- **Conclusions**: Single-dose oral fosfomycin trometamol appears to provide effective treatment with good patient compliance.

### β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor combinations in the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae: Time for a reappraisal in the era of few antibiotic options [^116vNZeZ]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes in Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp, is a major challenge to modern medical practice. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections caused by ESBL producers; however, carbapenem resistance has increased globally. ESBL producers might be susceptible to β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combination antibiotics such as piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate.

These drugs are frequently avoided in serious infections caused by ESBL producers because of the inoculum effect in vitro (especially for piperacillin-tazobactam), animal data suggesting inferior efficacy when compared with carbapenems, concerns about pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic drug target attainment with standard doses, and poor outcomes shown in some observational studies.

Prospective cohort data and a meta-analysis suggest that BLBLIs are non-inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by ESBL producers. We examine why BLBLIs are perceived as inferior in the treatment of infection with ESBL producers and discuss data that suggest these concerns might not be strongly supported by clinical evidence.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^111gSoAc]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

- **Symptom sum score**: Figure 3 illustrates the symptom sum score for dysuria, frequency/urgency, and low abdominal pain on days 0–7 by randomization group (range 0–12, intention-to-treat population).

- **Secondary outcomes**: All secondary outcomes related to symptoms favored the fosfomycin group. On days 0–4, the total symptom burden (area under the curve) in the ibuprofen group was significantly higher than in the fosfomycin group. The same results emerged when analyzing symptoms individually; for each symptom (dysuria, frequency/urgency, abdominal pain), a higher symptom burden on days 0–7 was observed in the ibuprofen group.

- **Duration of symptoms**: With a mean duration of 5.6 days, symptoms lasted about a day longer in the ibuprofen group. On day four, 129 (56%) women in the fosfomycin group versus 91 (39%) in the ibuprofen group were symptom-free (P < 0.001). By day seven, these rates increased to 82% and 70%, respectively (P < 0.001).

- **Impairment of activity**: Women in the ibuprofen group showed slightly higher scores in impairment of activity, indicating more frequent disruption of work or regular activities due to urinary tract infection. On day seven, 2% of the women in the fosfomycin group reported similar impairments.

### Comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose antibiotics for lower urinary tract infection in pregnancy [^112YwALJ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of fosfomycin trometamol, cefuroxime axetil, and amoxicillin clavulanate antibiotics, and to assess the difference in patient compliance, in the treatment of urinary tract infections during pregnancy.

Between September 2007 and May 2008, 90 out of 324 pregnant women with complaints of lower urinary tract infection, who were followed at the outpatient clinic or referred to the emergency department of Vakif Gureba Education and Research Hospital, were enrolled in a prospective study. Patients were randomized into three equal groups for treatment with single-dose fosfomycin trometamol, or 5-day courses of amoxicillin clavulanate or cefuroxime axetil. After follow-up, study data were obtained for 28, 27, and 29 patients, respectively.

The treatment groups did not differ significantly in terms of demographics, clinical success rate, microbiological cure rate, or adverse effects. Significantly higher drug compliance was observed in the fosfomycin trometamol group than in the other two groups (P < 0.05).

In conclusion, treatment with a single dose of fosfomycin trometamol was as effective for UTI as the standard course of treatment with amoxicillin clavulanate or cefuroxime axetil. Fosfomycin trometamol may be a preferable treatment for UTI because of its simpler use and better rates of compliance.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of Gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: data from a unicentric study [^112hUvER]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotic susceptibility in common susceptible isolates and isolates producing β-lactamase (ESBL or AmpC): For E. coli isolates, only two antibiotics remained highly active against both common susceptible and β-lactamase-producing isolates (ESBL or AmpC): fosfomycin (97.4% and 92.0% respectively) and nitrofurantoin (97.1% and 89.6% respectively). The susceptibility of β-lactamase-producing isolates was significantly lower for all other tested first-line antibiotics (p < 0.0001). A similar situation was found for Enterobacter isolates, where only fosfomycin showed susceptibility in both groups without a statistically significant decrease in β-lactamase-producing isolates (p = 0.1081). Fosfomycin remained the only highly effective antibiotic against β-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates, while susceptibility was significantly lower for all other tested antibiotics (p < 0.0001). Further comparisons of the commonly susceptible and β-lactamase-producing isolates are presented in Table 2.

- **Comparison of the susceptibility to commonly used first-line antibiotics and chemotherapeutics**: A beta lactamase positive means bacterial isolates producing ESBL or AmpC beta lactamase.

Comparison of the susceptibility of the four most frequent Gram-negative bacterial isolates to fosfomycin with that of the other first-line antibiotics: Fosfomycin showed relatively good activity against Proteus isolates, which are primarily resi

### Treatment of KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae: suboptimal efficacy of polymyxins [^116bbQre]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections (KPC-EI) remains a challenge. Combined therapy has been proposed as the best choice, but there are no clear data showing which combination therapy is superior. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of antimicrobial regimens for treating KPC-EI.

This was a retrospective cohort study of KPC-EI nosocomial infections (based on CDC criteria) between October 2009 and June 2013 at three tertiary Brazilian hospitals. The primary outcomes were the 30-day mortality for all infections and the 30-day mortality for patients with bacteremia. Risk factors for mortality were evaluated by comparing clinical variables of survivors and nonsurvivors.

In this study, 118 patients were included, of whom 78 had bacteremia. Catheter-related bloodstream infections were the most frequent (43%), followed by urinary tract infections (n = 27, 23%). Monotherapy was used in 57 patients and combined treatment in 61 patients. The most common therapeutic combination was polymyxin plus carbapenem (20, 33%).

- **Prognostic factors**: Multivariate analysis for all infections (n = 118) and for bacteremic infections (n = 78) revealed that renal failure at the end of treatment, use of polymyxin, and older age were prognostic factors for mortality.

In conclusion, polymyxins showed suboptimal efficacy, and combination therapy was not superior to monotherapy.

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^112HsPQX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Fosfomycin tromethamine is indicated only for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) in women due to susceptible strains of *Escherichia coli* and *Enterococcus faecalis*. It is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess.

If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with fosfomycin tromethamine, other therapeutic agents should be selected. (See PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL STUDIES sections.)

### Incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella infections in the United States: A systematic literature review [^115Z7Ysg]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite a reported worldwide increase, the incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella infections in the United States is unknown. Understanding the incidence and trends of ESBL infections will aid in directing research and prevention efforts.

- **Objective**: To perform a literature review to identify the incidence of ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella infections in the United States.

- **Design**: Systematic literature review.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE via Ovid, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for multicenter (≥ 2 sites), US studies published between 2000 and 2015 that evaluated the incidence of ESBL-E. coli or ESBL-Klebsiella infections. We excluded studies that examined resistance rates alone or did not have a denominator that included uninfected patients such as patient days, device days, number of admissions, or number of discharges. Additionally, articles that were not written in English, contained duplicated data, or pertained to ESBL organisms from food, animals, or the environment were excluded.

- **Results**: Among 51,419 studies examined, 9 were included for review. Incidence rates differed by patient population, time, and ESBL definition, ranging from 0 infections per 100,000 patient days to 16.64 infections per 10,000 discharges, with incidence rates increasing over time from 1997 to 2011. Rates were slightly higher for ESBL-Klebsiella infections than for ESBL-E. coli infections.

- **Conclusion**: The incidence of ESBL-E. coli and ESBL-Klebsiella infections in the United States has increased over time.

### Cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections caused by Gram-negative uropathogens: A phase 2, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial [^117PCWDx]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria represent the highest priority for addressing global antibiotic resistance. Cefiderocol (S-649266), a new siderophore cephalosporin, has broad activity against Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, including carbapenem-resistant strains. We assessed the efficacy and safety of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in patients at risk of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections.

- **Methods**: We conducted a phase 2, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group non-inferiority trial at 67 hospitals in 15 countries. Adults (≥ 18 years) admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of complicated urinary tract infection, with or without pyelonephritis, or those with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis were randomly assigned (2:1) by an interactive web or voice response system to receive 1-hour intravenous infusions of cefiderocol (2 g) or imipenem-cilastatin (1 g each), three times daily, every 8 hours for 7–14 days. Patients were excluded if they had a baseline urine culture with more than two uropathogens, a fungal urinary tract infection, or pathogens known to be carbapenem resistant. The primary endpoint was the composite of clinical and microbiological outcomes at test of cure (i.e. 7 days after treatment cessation), which was used to establish non-inferiority (15% and 20% margins) of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin. The primary efficacy analysis was done on a modified intention-to-treat population.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: A position statement by the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery [^115LC9Cn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with a wide therapeutic range and excellent tissue penetration. It is frequently administered in Europe, often in combination with other antibiotics, to combat severe bacterial infections, but it is seldom used in North America. Monotherapy with fosfomycin is not recommended due to the rapid emergence of resistance.

Both ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam effectively treat complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. These agents evade carbapenemases that hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, first-generation beta-lactamase inhibitors, and carbapenems.

New agents for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), especially K. pneumoniae, include meropenem/vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin/relebactam. CRE usually possesses multiple potential mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. Meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin/relebactam are effective against most Enterobacterales producing K. pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC) but not those producing OXA-48-like carbapenemases.

Metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are unique because they are zinc-dependent enzymes. MBLs hydrolyze most beta-lactam agents, including carbapenems, except for aztreonam. Ceftazidime/avibactam plus aztreonam or cefiderocol are treatment options for MBL-producing Enterobacterales, although the latter has not been studied in cIAI. Cefiderocol is a novel cephalosporin that overcomes three distinct mechanisms of carbapenem resistance. It avoids porin channels and efflux pumps by entering bacterial cells via iron transport mechanisms and demonstrates stability to all four classes of beta-lactamase.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of Gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: data from a unicentric study [^112LE9a2]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Our study confirmed the leading role of E. coli in urinary tract infection, as nearly 51.0% of urinary samples contained this pathogen. Other frequent isolates include Gram-negative rods, especially Klebsiella, Proteus, or Enterobacter, which together comprised 40.0% of all tested isolates. The results were in congruence with studies from other countries.

E. coli isolates were highly susceptible to fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin (97.0% and 96.6% respectively) and less susceptible to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (75.8% and 67.8%), which aligns with other studies from Europe and Asia. A similar pattern was found in K. pneumoniae, where 80.4% of isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin, although other tested antibiotics showed susceptibility in the range of 43.5% to 64.4%.

In β-lactamase producing bacterial isolates (ESBL or AmpC), fosfomycin showed the lowest proportion of resistant isolates. However, it is necessary to comment that the comparison of antibiotics and chemotherapeutics is sometimes difficult due to the absence of EUCAST break points for many of them.

A good example is nitrofurantoin, which according to EUCAST guidelines has a susceptibility range only for E. coli but which according to CLSI guidelines has assessed break points for all Enterobacteriaceae. The problematic assessment of susceptibility testing according to different guidelines is well known. The good activity of fosfomycin against extended spectrum β-lactamase positive Gram-negative bacteria in comparison with other first-line antibiotics has also been observed in other countries.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: Data from a unicentric study [^115t5QCS]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Against a background of the rapid increase of β-lactamase-producing or multi-resistant pathogenic bacteria, and the resulting lack of effective antibiotic treatment, some older antibiotics have been tested for new therapeutic uses. One of these is fosfomycin, to which, according to studies, these resistant bacteria are very sensitive. Our study was designed because there is no data on the fosfomycin susceptibility rate in the Czech Republic.

- **Method**: In this study, from January 2013 to June 2014, 3,295 unique isolates of gram-negative bacteria that had caused urinary tract infections were examined. The antibiotic susceptibility was measured by the disk diffusion test. Both EUCAST and CLSI guidelines criteria (for fosfomycin only) were used for the antibiotic susceptibility evaluation.

- **Results**: The most frequently tested bacterial isolates were *Escherichia coli* (51.3%, n = 1,703), *Klebsiella pneumoniae* (19.4%, n = 643), and *Proteus* spp. (11.8%, n = 392). Among all isolates, 29.0% (n = 963) were resistant to fluoroquinolones, 11.3% (n = 374) produced extended spectrum β-lactamase, and 4.2% (n = 141) produced AmpC β-lactamase. The overall in vitro susceptibility was significantly higher for fosfomycin compared to the other tested per-oral antibiotics (nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and cefuroxime) against all tested gram-negative rod isolates (excluding *Morganella morganii* and *Acinetobacter* spp. isolates). Fosfomycin also remained highly active against those isolates with extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production, showing 95.8% susceptibility in *Escherichia coli* isolates.

### Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria in urinary tract infections in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vQM8j]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

In the systematic review and meta-analysis, the predominant ESBL-producing pathogens were Klebsiella spp. and E. coli, with pooled prevalence estimates of 43.91% and 31.14%, respectively. Similarly, the predominant carbapenemase producer was Klebsiella spp. (17.78%), followed by E. coli (11.42%). These findings are consistent with those of other reported systematic reviews of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria in Ethiopia. Additionally, they are comparable to meta-analyses conducted on pediatric UTIs globally, as well as in Thailand, Nepal, India, Turkey, and Italy, which reported that K. pneumoniae and E. coli were the predominant ESBL-producing pathogens among gram-negative bacteria in urine.

Klebsiella spp., particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae, poses a significant public health threat as a common, severe MDR pathogen in the ESKAPE group, alongside Enterococcus, S. aureus, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species. Currently, these pathogens are common in both developed and developing countries. Cephalosporins and carbapenems, vital for treating gram-negative bacterial infections (including those from Klebsiella spp. and E. coli), have lost efficacy due to widespread resistance genes like ESBLs and carbapenemases. The predominance of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella spp. and E. coli in this systematic review and meta-analysis, and many other systematic reviews, may be because these pathogens are mostly multidrug resistant due to the production of these enzymes. These pathogens are ubiquitous and considered part of the "One Health" framework.

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^1165FGVC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Do not use more than one single dose of fosfomycin tromethamine to treat a single episode of acute cystitis. Repeated daily doses did not improve the clinical success or microbiological eradication rates compared to single-dose therapy but did increase the incidence of adverse events. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after the completion of therapy.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be informed that fosfomycin tromethamine can be taken with or without food. Their symptoms should improve in two to three days after taking fosfomycin tromethamine; if not improved, they should contact their healthcare provider. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics and usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools with or without stomach cramps and fever, even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **Metoclopramide**: When coadministered with fosfomycin tromethamine, metoclopramide — a drug that increases gastrointestinal motility — lowers the serum concentration and urinary excretion of fosfomycin. Other drugs that increase gastrointestinal motility may produce similar effects.
	- **Cimetidine**: Cimetidine does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fosfomycin when coadministered with fosfomycin tromethamine.

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^113vMb2M]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Febrile urinary tract infections (fUTIs), defined as UTIs with systemic symptoms, frequently occur in women and are predominantly caused by *Escherichia coli*. Guidelines recommend treating fUTIs that require hospitalization with a 7- to 14-day course of antibiotics, which usually consists of empiric intravenous (IV) treatment preferably followed by an oral step-down treatment targeted to the susceptibility pattern of the causal uropathogen. Optimal treatment of fUTIs is hampered by the increase in multiresistant gram-negative bacteria. While new antibiotics are being developed for the IV treatment of fUTIs, the arsenal of oral antibiotics has remained stable for decades. Based on antimicrobial resistance, 2%–5% of patients hospitalized for community-acquired fUTIs in the Netherlands cannot be treated with oral antibiotics, with even higher rates of antimicrobial resistance in other parts of the world, implying the need for prolonged IV antibiotic therapy and extended hospitalization.

Fosfomycin is a phosphoenolpyruvate analogue that is orally available as fosfomycin–trometamol. It is licensed for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women, has a good safety profile, and has in vitro activity against *E. coli*. Despite its increased use, persisting low resistance rates are observed against fosfomycin, up to 2%. In retrospective studies, fosfomycin appeared effective as a step-down treatment for fUTIs. Our objective in this randomized, controlled trial was to determine if fosfomycin is noninferior to ciprofloxacin for the oral step-down treatment of fUTIs caused by *E. coli*.

### Effectiveness and tolerability of intravenous fosfomycin in treating complicated urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli: A prospective cohort study from the FOSFOMIC project [^116NbyAh]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). High credibility.

The FOSFOMIC study assessed the clinical and microbiological effectiveness, as well as the safety, of intravenous fosfomycin in treating complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) caused by Escherichia coli in comparison with other intravenous antimicrobials.

- **Methods**: A prospective, multinational matched cohorts study involving adults with community-acquired cUTIs receiving targeted therapy with intravenous fosfomycin or other first-line drugs (beta-lactams or fluoroquinolones) was conducted from November 2019 to May 2023 in ten centers in Spain, Italy, and Türkiye. Matching criteria included type of infection acquisition, Charlson, and Pitt scores. Endpoints were clinical and microbiological cure, mortality, recurrence, and adverse effects. Analyses used conditional logistic regression and desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR).

- **Results**: Overall, 155 matched pairs were included. Clinical and microbiological cure rates were 65.2% (101/155; 95% CI, 57.4–72.2) and 63.2% (98/155; 95% CI, 55.4–70.4) with fosfomycin and comparators, respectively (adjusted OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.68–1.73; p 0.73). Mortality rates were 1.9% (3/155; 95% CI, 0.7–5.5) and 5.8% (9/155; 95% CI, 3.1–10.7) for fosfomycin and comparators, respectively (p 0.11). Recurrence rates were 14.2% (22/155; 95% CI, 9.6–20.6) in the fosfomycin group vs. 10.3% (16/155; 95% CI, 6.1–16.1) in comparators (p 0.39). Severe adverse effects occurred in 1.9% (3/155; 95% CI, 0.7–5.5) of patients treated with fosfomycin compared to 0.6% (1/155; 95% CI, 0.0–3.3) in the control group (p 0.62). Non-severe adverse effects were more frequent with fosfomycin, affecting 23.3%.

### Other antimicrobials of interest in the era of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin and tigecycline [^112KHYgF]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

The progressive increase of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enteric bacteria in recent years has called for a re-evaluation of antibiotic therapy for these infections. The activity and potential use of two old antimicrobials, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin, and the new compound tigecycline for the treatment of infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, with special emphasis on E. coli, are reviewed.

Fosfomycin continues to be active against the most common uropathogens. In a recent survey from Spain, among the 428 ESBL-producing isolates, the resistance rate of E. coli to fosfomycin was 0.3%, whereas the resistance rate of K. pneumoniae was 7.2%. Other recent surveys from other parts of the world confirm the activity of fosfomycin against ESBL-producing E. coli.

The rate of resistance to nitrofurantoin in recent surveys in the United States and Canada was 1.1% among 1,142 isolates of E. coli from outpatient urinary isolates. However, among 115 clinical isolates of E. coli ESBL producers, only 71.3% were sensitive to nitrofurantoin. Also, E. coli resistance to nitrofurantoin has been reported to be high in recent surveys in Latin American hospitals and in Italy.

Tigecycline is a glycylcycline that circumvents efflux and ribosomal protection, the two most frequent genetic mechanisms of tetracycline resistance. The recent activity of tigecycline against 285 non-clonally related isolates expressing well-characterized ESBLs from hospital settings and the community reveals susceptibility rates for tigecycline of 97.5%.

### Multicenter evaluation of the novel ETEST fosfomycin for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Enterobacterales, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus species [^114eMU4Y]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin (FO) is a bactericidal antibiotic that disrupts cell wall synthesis by inhibiting phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase, thus interfering with the production of peptidoglycan. FO shows in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The phosphonic acid derivative was first discovered in 1969 and is available as fosfomycin trometamol in the United States and Europe (EU) for oral use, as well as fosfomycin (di-)sodium for intravenous application in most EU countries. It is excreted in unchanged form in urine and feces, qualifying for the treatment of urinary tract infections.

Fosfomycin trometamol was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI) in women caused by susceptible strains. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved fosfomycin trometamol for oral use in uUTI in adult and adolescent females and for intravenous use for all susceptible pathogens. EMA has recently made recommendations to only use intravenous FO for serious or complicated infections when other antibiotic treatments are not feasible.

The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) provides different FO breakpoints, one for oral treatment of uUTI and a different breakpoint for FO intravenous use for Enterobacterales and Staphylococcus species. EUCAST also recommends the use of FO in severe infections always in combination with a β-lactam, aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone, or glycopeptide antibiotic. FO has been long established for treating urinary tract infections.

### The role of fosfomycin for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections [^116rLZrN]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

In the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in using fosfomycin for the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative (MDR-GNB) infections, especially when few or no other active alternatives are available.

Fosfomycin may remain effective against a considerable proportion of MDR-GNB. In observational studies, oral fosfomycin monotherapy has demonstrated a potential curative effect for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) and bacterial prostatitis caused by MDR-GNB. In contrast, intravenous fosfomycin is mostly used in combination with other agents for various severe MDR-GNB infections. The ZEUS randomized controlled trial (RCT) has begun to provide high-level evidence regarding the potential use of fosfomycin for complicated UTI caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing GNB. However, results from large RCTs are still unavailable to definitively guide the use of fosfomycin for carbapenem-resistant GNB.

Fosfomycin remains an important therapeutic option for MDR-GNB infections. Further pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and clinical research is needed to optimize its use.

### Antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired urine bacterial isolates in French Amazonia [^114m7WKZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Low credibility.

Enterobacterales were resistant to amoxicillin in 70.9%, to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 25.2%, and to cefotaxime in 5.9% of cases. Interestingly, they were sensitive to fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin in 98% and 86% of cases, respectively. For this reason, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin seem to be a reasonable option for empirical treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. Indeed, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin are active against common causes of UTIs, mainly E. coli, whereas nonfermentative GNRs are naturally resistant. Overall, resistance to these two antibiotics is uncommon in Enterobacterales, and many multidrug-resistant organisms retain susceptibility.

In contrast, fluoroquinolones were active against 90% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates. They were reported as effective for clinical and microbiological cures in patients with uncomplicated UTIs. However, fluoroquinolones should be spared in the first- and second-line UTI treatment because of their selection pressure, and they should be saved for more severe infections.

– **Susceptibility trends**:

	- The study shows a decreasing susceptibility profile over time for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, and nitrofurantoin. In contrast, the susceptibility trends for gentamycin and ofloxacin were stable. This can be explained by the antibiotic pressure in the community.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of Gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: Data from a unicentric study [^111EyzfF]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

We have confirmed in the Czech Republic the very high susceptibility to fosfomycin trometamol of urinary tract infection pathogens, particularly Gram-negative rods, including those producing β-lactamase. Our results will be used to rationalize the treatment of urinary tract infections by fosfomycin trometamol in our country.

### Fosfomycin: Use beyond urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections [^113nXmyK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The shortage of new antimicrobial agents has prompted the scientific community to reconsider the potential value of older antibiotics. A thorough literature search was conducted to gather relevant evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of fosfomycin for the treatment of patients with gram-positive and/or gram-negative bacterial infections, excluding urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections. Out of 1311 potentially relevant studies, 62 were reviewed in detail. Among 1604 patients with various gram-positive and gram-negative infections at various body sites (including pneumonia and other respiratory infections; osteomyelitis; meningitis; ear, nose, and throat infections; surgical infections; obstetric and gynecological infections; arthritis; septicemia; peritonitis; cervical lymphadenitis; eye infections; diabetic foot infections; and typhoid fever) treated with fosfomycin alone or in combination with other antibiotics, a cure was achieved in 1302 patients (81.1%), and improvement was noted in 47 patients (2.9%).

In comparative perioperative prophylaxis trials that included a total of 1212 patients, mainly those undergoing colorectal surgery, the fosfomycin-metronidazole combination led to results comparable to those achieved with other antibiotic combinations such as doxycycline, ampicillin, or cephalothin with metronidazole. In an era of limited new antibiotics, fosfomycin could be considered an alternative treatment for infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, beyond its traditional uses.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically with respect to the management of Enterobacterales infections:

- **Preferred treatment options**: The IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend administering meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin, or ertapenem for treating infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales.

- **Critically ill patients and hypoalbuminemia considerations**: Administer meropenem or imipenem/cilastatin as the preferred carbapenem in critically ill patients and/or patients experiencing hypoalbuminemia.

- **Oral transition after clinical response**: Consider transitioning to oral TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin after an appropriate clinical response is achieved, assuming susceptibility is demonstrated.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of Gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: data from a unicentric study [^115yDk7c]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The evaluation of overall antibiotic susceptibility in relation to patient status revealed significantly lower resistance in bacterial isolates from ambulatory patients compared to those of hospitalized patients. With the exception of ICU isolates, and using resistance of 10% as the limit for use as a first-line option for empirical therapy in non-life-threatening infections, only fosfomycin seems to have adequate coverage amongst agents suitable for oral therapy. In our study, there were no samples from the community (from GPs), which is why our samples had higher resistance.

Our results showed fosfomycin trometamol as a promising antibiotic for urinary tract infections in our country. However, according to some published studies, the increasing use of fosfomycin worldwide has led to increased resistance levels in isolates. For example, a Spanish study detected an increase in fosfomycin resistance in Escherichia coli isolates from 0.0% in 2005 to 14.4% in 2011. A change in the guidelines for UTI therapy is required to prevent this side effect of the mass use of fosfomycin trometamol for UTIs. We see the main future benefit of an oral fosfomycin formulation in our fosfomycin-naive population in treating specific groups of patients with non-life-threatening urinary tract infections, such as patients with long-term stents often colonized by multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. These patients are frequently threatened by chronic urinary tract infections, and after successful intravenous antibiotic therapy during hospitalization, they should…

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections, specifically with respect to Enterobacterales infections (AmpC beta-lactamase-producing), IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend deciding on the choice of antibiotic treatment for *S. marcescens*, *M. morganii*, and *Providencia* species infections based on antimicrobial sensitivity testing results. It is recognized that the basal production of AmpC β-lactamase renders these organisms intrinsically resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and first- and second-generation cephalosporins.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^112z2qrN]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

In a cohort of 126 patients who underwent urodynamic study (UDS), urinary tract infections (UTIs) were diagnosed in 26 cases (20.9%) — 14 (22.2%) from the levofloxacin group and 12 (19%) from the fosfomycin group — indicating no significant difference in incidence rates between the two groups (p = 0.660). The absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the levofloxacin and fosfomycin groups was 3.2% (22.2% − 19%). The relative effect size, expressed as an odds ratio (OR), was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.4–1.95). Of those with UTIs, 17 were male — 10 from the levofloxacin group and 7 from the fosfomycin group. Symptomatic UTIs were observed in six (4.8%) patients in the levofloxacin group and in seven (5.6%) patients in the fosfomycin group. The relative risk for symptomatic UTI was 1.17 (95% CI: 0.4–3.5), with an ARR of 0.8% (5.6% − 4.8%).

No subgroup or adjusted analyses were performed as this was not pre-specified in the protocol. Harms and unintended effects were minimal in both groups. In the fosfomycin group, three participants (4.76%) reported mild nausea, which resolved without intervention. In the levofloxacin group, two participants (3.17%) reported mild nausea. No serious adverse events were observed during the study period. E. coli was the most frequently identified bacterium in urine cultures, followed by K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Additionally, 10 patients with UTIs showed no bacterial growth in their urine culture/isolation.

Regarding medical management for recurrent urinary tract infections in women, more specifically concerning the choice of antibiotics, the AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend administering nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, or fosfomycin as first-line therapy. This choice should be based on the local antibiogram data for symptomatic patients with recurrent UTIs.

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^116AD9zT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Fosfomycin, the active component of fosfomycin tromethamine, demonstrates in vitro activity against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms associated with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. It is bactericidal in urine at therapeutic doses, with its action attributed to the inactivation of the enzyme enolpyruvyl transferase. This process irreversibly blocks the condensation of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine with p-enolpyruvate, a critical step in bacterial cell wall synthesis. Additionally, fosfomycin reduces the adherence of bacteria to uroepithelial cells.

There is generally no cross-resistance between fosfomycin and other classes of antibacterial agents, such as beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. Fosfomycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections, as described in the "Indications and Usage" section:

- **Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms**: Enterococcus faecalis
- **Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms**: Escherichia coli

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Fosfomycin exhibits in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 64 mcg/mL or less against most (≥ 90%) strains of certain microorganisms. However, the safety and effectiveness of fosfomycin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of Gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: data from a unicentric study [^111KAQ4x]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Against a background of the rapid increase in β-lactamase-producing or multi-resistant pathogenic bacteria and the resulting lack of effective antibiotic treatment, some older antibiotics have been tested for new therapeutic uses. One of these is fosfomycin, to which, according to studies, these resistant bacteria are very sensitive. Our study was designed due to the lack of data on fosfomycin susceptibility rates in the Czech Republic.

- **Method**: In this study, conducted from January 2013 to June 2014, 3295 unique isolates of Gram-negative bacteria that caused urinary tract infections were examined. Antibiotic susceptibility was measured using the disk diffusion test. Both EUCAST and CLSI guideline criteria (for fosfomycin only) were used for the antibiotic susceptibility evaluation.

- **Results**: The most frequently tested bacterial isolates were Escherichia coli (51.3%, n = 1703), Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.4%, n = 643), and Proteus spp. (11.8%, n = 392). Among all isolates, 29.0% (n = 963) were resistant to fluoroquinolones, 11.3% (n = 374) produced extended-spectrum β-lactamase, and 4.2% (n = 141) produced AmpC β-lactamase. The overall in vitro susceptibility was significantly higher for fosfomycin compared to other tested oral antibiotics (nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and cefuroxime) against all tested Gram-negative rod isolates, excluding Morganella morganii and Acinetobacter spp. isolates. Fosfomycin also remained highly active against those isolates with extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production (95.8% in Escherichia coli isolates and 85.3% in…).

### Intravenous fosfomycin for the treatment of nosocomial infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in critically ill patients: a prospective evaluation [^111B2ovt]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections as a result of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens remain a serious problem in critically ill patients. Adult ICU patients who received intravenous fosfomycin were prospectively examined to assess its safety and effectiveness as an adjunct to the antimicrobial therapy of life-threatening infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Fosfomycin was administered intravenously to 11 patients for treatment of hospital-acquired infections caused by carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. Fosfomycin (2–4 g every 6 h) was administered in combination with other antibiotics. The mean ± SD duration of treatment was 14 ± 5.6 days.

All patients had a good bacteriological and clinical outcome of infection. All-cause hospital mortality was two out of 11 (18.2%) patients. No patient experienced adverse events related to the administration of fosfomycin. Intravenous fosfomycin may be a beneficial and safe adjunctive treatment in the management of life-threatening ICU-acquired infections caused by carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae.

### Perioperative fosfomycin disodium prophylaxis against urinary tract infection in renal transplant recipients: a randomized clinical trial [^115DNAUE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Each member of the FOS group received one 4 g dose of fosfomycin disodium intravenously (IV) 3 hours before the following procedures: placement of the urinary catheter (UC) immediately before the renal transplant (RT) surgery, removal of the UC, and removal of the double-J stent (DJS). The placebo group received a saline solution (0.9% IV) following the same schedule.

All renal transplant recipients (RTRs) received cephalothin (1 g, IV single dose) for prophylaxis before RT surgery. The UC was placed using a sterile technique, and the patients received a DJS. The type of ureteral reimplantation, whether extra or intravesical, was decided by the surgical team.

All participants received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis at 160/800 mg (PO) daily when the estimated glomerular filtration rate, calculated according to the formula proposed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, was ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m². The timeline was defined by the date of DJS removal from Day 14 and UC removal from Day 2.

RTRs with high immunological risk, such as the presence of preformed donor-specific antibodies, a deceased donor, or retransplant, received induction with antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin®, Sanofi-Genzyme, Lyon, France) at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg divided into three daily doses given on consecutive days. Low-risk RTRs received induction with 20 mg basiliximab (Simulect®, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) on Days 0 and 4 after RT. Immunosuppression maintenance consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid, and prednisone. All RTRs were assessed at Weeks 1, 4, 6, and 7 after RT through questioning, physical examination, evaluation of FOS- or TMP/SMX-related adverse events, and a TMP/SMX tablet count to assess adherence.

### Furadantin [^1151Cp6Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Furadantin is indicated in adults and pediatric patients 1 month of age and older for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella species, and Enterobacter species.

- **Limitations of use**: Furadantin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Usage**: To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Furadantin and other antibacterial drugs, Furadantin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^112ADMKH]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

In our trial, ibuprofen was used to ease symptoms of urinary tract infection. An additional antimicrobial effect against E. coli has been postulated by Obad and colleagues but could not be confirmed. Currently, the same hypothesis is being investigated by Vik and colleagues.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (day 14–28) were more common in the fosfomycin group. This could be because more women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection were randomized into the fosfomycin group. Additionally, antimicrobial treatment might result in recurrent urinary tract infections; in a recent trial, women with asymptomatic bacteriuria treated with antibiotics had significantly higher rates of subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection during 12 months' follow-up than untreated women.

For external validity and to comply with routine general practice, we chose a symptomatic approach as recommended in primary care guidelines. Therefore, we did not wait for culture results before inclusion and randomization, and women with negative results on culture remained in the trial. Symptoms and results of urine tests, including the number of negative urine cultures at inclusion, were comparable with other trials in primary care. A subgroup analysis stratified for urine culture results in the ibuprofen group showed significant differences in both co-primary outcomes: women with negative results showed significantly lower symptom burden, and antibiotic use was significantly more reduced in women with positive culture results. Although this was a subgroup analysis, and hence hypothesis-generating, these findings are noteworthy.

### Fosfomycin for injection (ZTI-01) versus piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection including acute pyelonephritis: ZEUS, a phase 2/3 randomized trial [^114jxCZz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Clinical cure rates associated with E. coli and K. pneumoniae cUTI/AP were high and similar in both treatment groups. Clinical cure rates in patients with severe disease (i.e. met SIRS criteria or bacteremia) were also high and similar between treatment groups.

Microbiologic eradication, as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE-typed), occurred in 70.7% of ZTI-01 patients versus 60.1% of PIP-TAZ patients in the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (m-MITT) analysis, and 75.5% of ZTI-01 patients versus 64.1% of PIP-TAZ patients in the microbiologically evaluable (ME) analysis. Microbiological response rates varied among treatment groups within patients with severe disease; however, clinical cure rates in these subgroups were consistently high across treatment groups.

Among patients with microbiological persistence at the test of cure (TOC), 14 patients (19.5% [8/41] ZTI-01, 9.7% [6/62] PIP-TAZ) exhibited postbaseline growth of the baseline pathogen with a ≥ 4-fold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to the received study drug. All had complicated disease, and 4 patients (3 on ZTI-01, 1 on PIP-TAZ) had recent or ongoing urinary tract instrumentation. Various pathogen species were represented among the isolates with a ≥ 4-fold increase in MIC. Microbiological persistence rates associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high across treatments (62.5% and 55.6%, respectively); however, each of these patients (8 ZTI-01, 9 PIP-TAZ) had explanations for P. aeruginosa persistence, such as functional or anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract (e.g. atonic bladder).

### Resistance profiles of urinary tract infections in general practice — an observational study [^115M7NUz]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

- **Susceptibility testing**: Susceptibility of E. coli, as the main causative agent, was highest against fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin, with low resistance rates of 4.5% and 2.2%, respectively. In 17.5%, E. coli was resistant to trimethoprim (TMP) and in 8.5% to ciprofloxacin. In contrast to E. coli, other typical uropathogens showed higher resistance rates for TMP, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin (50%, 21.7%, and 23.8%).

	- Ciprofloxacin is equally effective against E. coli and other typical uropathogens (8.7% and 8.1%). Further results on susceptibility are presented in detail in Table 2.

	- In a few cases, a urine culture was not tested for all antibiotics requested. This refers mainly to trimethoprim (130/139 samples were tested) and reflects the lack of a standard in antibiotic testing among laboratories.

- **Recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTI)**: Thirty-five patients had experienced a previous urinary tract infection in the last six months. Besides E. coli (29/35), causative pathogens in reinfections were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

	- In reUTI, E. coli showed higher resistance rates against trimethoprim (25%) and ciprofloxacin (17%), while resistance rates for nitrofurantoin (3.4%) and fosfomycin (0%) were very low.

Regarding clinical indications for UDS, 69 patients (54.8%) had lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), 41 (32.8%) had overactive bladder (OAB), 11 (8.9%) had underactive bladder, and 5 (3.5%) had stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The distribution of these diagnoses between the treatment groups is detailed in Table 1. Based on chi-square analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of clinical diagnoses between the fosfomycin and levofloxacin groups (p = 0.068), indicating that randomization was generally adequate in balancing baseline clinical characteristics across both groups.
