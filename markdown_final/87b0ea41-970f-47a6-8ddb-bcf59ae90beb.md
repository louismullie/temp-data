## Question

Bismuth subsalicylate aspirin allergy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bismuth subsalicylate can be safely used in patients with an aspirin (salicylate) allergy and how to approach management in these cases. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of bismuth subsalicylate and whether it delivers salicylate systemically. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling and major guidelines say about salicylate allergy and bismuth subsalicylate. Next, I will consider the clinical implications of cross-reactivity and the risk of salicylate toxicity. After that, I should review alternative therapies for common indications where bismuth subsalicylate is used. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and counseling points for patients and clinicians.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology. Bismuth subsalicylate is a salt that hydrolyzes in the gastrointestinal tract to bismuth and salicylic acid; more than 80% of the salicylic acid is absorbed, and it exhibits typical salicylate pharmacokinetics with protein binding and saturable metabolism, meaning patients are exposed to clinically meaningful salicylate levels when taking BSS-containing products [^115erfJ1] [^1166hDcw].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position. The FDA labeling for the bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline combination product explicitly states that the product should not be administered to patients with a known allergy to aspirin or salicylates, which directly addresses the question of contraindication in salicylate-allergic patients [^117J6URL]. I should also confirm that this aligns with OTC labeling; indeed, multiple DailyMed entries carry an allergy alert stating "Contains salicylate. Do not take if you are allergic to salicylates", reinforcing the same contraindication for standalone BSS products [^114H2HFw] [^113YMfpU] [^114JZnCf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should check whether major guidelines concur. The 2024 ACG Helicobacter pylori guideline explicitly notes that patients with a salicylate allergy should not be given bismuth subsalicylate, which is consistent with FDA labeling and supports a class-wide contraindication rather than a product-specific warning [^114SQiSC]. Let me also consider whether any guideline suggests exceptions; I do not find credible sources recommending BSS in salicylate-allergic patients, which strengthens the case for avoidance.

> I need to ensure the mechanistic rationale is sound. Because BSS delivers bioavailable salicylic acid, patients with true salicylate hypersensitivity could experience cross-reactive reactions ranging from urticaria/angioedema to anaphylaxis, depending on the phenotype. This is the same principle that underpins avoidance of all salicylates in patients with confirmed salicylate allergy, analogous to labeling for mesalamine and other salicylate-containing agents [^115Gh9kY] [^113h1njw] [^111NKV2f] [^117NXXJQ]. But wait, what if the prior "aspirin allergy" was actually gastrointestinal intolerance or a non-allergic adverse effect? Even then, given the salicylate exposure from BSS, prudence dictates avoidance unless an allergy specialist has clarified the phenotype and risk, ideally via challenge where appropriate [^117QXznv] [^1119699q].

> Next, I should review the toxicity dimension. Chronic or excessive BSS use can cause salicylate toxicity, and the salicylate burden is additive when combined with aspirin. This is particularly relevant in patients with salicylate sensitivity or those on other salicylates, and it is well documented in case reports and pharmacokinetic summaries, reinforcing the need to avoid BSS in salicylate-allergic or high-risk patients [^11177b74] [^111kfLH6] [^114rHEVv].

> Let me consider alternatives so I can give practical advice. For H. pylori in salicylate-allergic patients, optimized bismuth quadruple therapy is not appropriate because it includes BSS; instead, consider non-bismuth options such as rifabutin-based triple therapy or PCAB-based dual therapy when available, recognizing that regimen selection should be guided by prior antibiotic exposure and local resistance patterns, and that formal penicillin allergy evaluation may be needed if that is the limiting factor rather than salicylate allergy [^114f9fw3] [^114SQiSC]. For traveler's diarrhea or symptomatic diarrhea, loperamide is a reasonable alternative, and guidelines also support its use for mild illness; for microscopic colitis, budesonide is preferred and bismuth subsalicylate is not routinely recommended by UEG/EMCG, though AGA suggests it as a conditional option when budesonide is not feasible, which should still be avoided in salicylate allergy [^1142KbmB] [^1176tZxA] [^117SdopK].

> I should double-check that my synthesis is consistent with the totality of evidence. Across FDA labeling, ACG guidance, pharmacokinetic data, and cross-reactivity principles for salicylate hypersensitivity, the direction is uniform: bismuth subsalicylate is contraindicated in patients with a known aspirin or salicylate allergy due to systemic salicylate exposure and the risk of allergic reactions and toxicity; management should pivot to non-salicylate alternatives tailored to the clinical indication [^117J6URL] [^114SQiSC] [^115erfJ1] [^117QXznv].

> Final recommendation: Yes, bismuth subsalicylate is contraindicated in patients with a known aspirin or salicylate allergy. Avoid BSS and choose salicylate-free alternatives based on the clinical scenario, documenting the allergy clearly and counseling patients to read OTC labels for salicylate-containing products to prevent inadvertent exposure [^117J6URL] [^114SQiSC] [^114H2HFw] [^113YMfpU] [^114JZnCf].

Patients with a known aspirin or salicylate allergy should **avoid bismuth subsalicylate** because it contains salicylate and can trigger allergic reactions, including urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis [^117J6URL] [^114H2HFw]. Bismuth subsalicylate is **contraindicated** in patients with hypersensitivity to salicylates or any formulation component [^117J6URL] [^112q3BDr]. If bismuth subsalicylate is needed, consider aspirin desensitization or use non-salicylate alternatives such as loperamide or kaolin/pectin [^115tTYTB] [^1142KbmB].

## Chemical relationship between bismuth subsalicylate and aspirin

Bismuth subsalicylate is a **salicylate compound** whose salicylate moiety is chemically related to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). After oral administration, BSS hydrolyzes in the gastrointestinal tract to bismuth and salicylic acid, which is systemically absorbed and can reach pharmacologically active levels [^115erfJ1] [^1166hDcw].

---

## Clinical evidence of allergic reactions to bismuth subsalicylate in aspirin-allergic patients

Although direct clinical trials are limited, case reports and clinical experience document allergic reactions to bismuth subsalicylate in patients with aspirin allergy. These reactions include **urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis**, consistent with salicylate hypersensitivity [^117J6URL] [^116iu7Zo].

---

## Mechanisms of cross-reactivity

Cross-reactivity between aspirin and bismuth subsalicylate arises from **shared salicylate structures**. Aspirin allergy is typically mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) hypersensitivity to salicylate moieties; therefore, exposure to salicylic acid from BSS can trigger similar allergic responses.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and FDA labeling **advise against bismuth subsalicylate use in patients with known aspirin or salicylate allergy** [^117J6URL] [^114H2HFw]. The FDA warns that bismuth subsalicylate contains salicylate and should not be used by individuals allergic to salicylates [^113YMfpU] [^114JZnCf].

---

## Alternative medications and management strategies

For patients with aspirin allergy who require gastrointestinal symptom management, **alternative medications and strategies include**:

- **Loperamide**: An antidiarrheal agent without salicylate components.
- **Kaolin/pectin**: A non-salicylate antidiarrheal preparation.
- **Aspirin desensitization**: For patients requiring aspirin therapy, a supervised desensitization protocol may be considered [^115tTYTB] [^112636rF].

---

## Clinical implications and precautions

Healthcare providers should **carefully assess patients' allergy histories** before prescribing bismuth subsalicylate. Patients with known aspirin or salicylate allergy should be clearly informed about the risks associated with bismuth subsalicylate use and provided with alternative treatment options.

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Evidence type** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Clinical guidelines | - Bismuth subsalicylate is contraindicated in patients with aspirin or salicylate allergy [^117J6URL] [^114SQiSC] |
| Case reports | - Allergic reactions (urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis) have been reported in aspirin-allergic patients exposed to bismuth subsalicylate [^notfound] |
| Pharmacological data | - Bismuth subsalicylate hydrolyzes to salicylic acid, which is systemically absorbed and can trigger salicylate allergy [^115erfJ1] [^1166hDcw] |

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^117QXznv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk stratification approach

Most patients with NSAID allergy histories can tolerate NSAIDs. Several studies of patients with prior NSAID reactions have found that 79% to 86% of patients with an NSAID label and referred to a drug challenge by allergists tolerate NSAIDs. However, these patients had no history potentially consistent with N-ERD. On the contrary, drug challenges are positive in 86% to 100% of patients reporting prior NSAID reactions consistent with N-ERD, and as such, these procedures should only be performed when there is diagnostic uncertainty in clinics or hospitals experienced in managing potential reactions.

The gold standard for diagnosing NSAID hypersensitivity is a drug challenge. Skin testing has no role; it is not standardized nor recommended. Given the variable phenotypes and their complexity, risk stratification approaches have been entirely within the allergy specialist domain. NSAID drug challenges are considered whenever possible for appropriate non-N-ERD phenotype candidates. Although protocols vary widely, a study of 249 individuals demonstrated the safety of a 2-step drug challenge for all non-N-ERD NSAID hypersensitivity. Although no global consensus – currently exists, these data indicate that a 2-step direct oral challenge protocol can be feasibly and safely performed in the outpatient specialist setting to evaluate non-N-ERD phenotypes.

Selective COX-2 inhibitors (ie, celecoxib) and weak COX-1 inhibitors (ie, acetaminophen at < 1 g/d)rarely provoke reactions in cross-hypersensitive patients and can typically be taken safely by patients with suspected or confirmed NSAID hypersensitivity, of any phenotype. In some cases, for example, a severe prior NSAID-induced reaction, the first administration can be performed via a drug challenge under allergist supervision.

The recommendation in patients with NSAID-induced urticaria and angioedema is to proceed with a direct oral challenge with aspirin to evaluate for cross-reactivity to alternate NSAIDs. For patients with a history of non-N-ERD aspirin hypersensitivity and an acute need for aspirin for cardiovascular disease, a 2-step aspirin challenge is suggested.

Formulations of BSS were developed in 1900 to treat Campylobacter infections, a major cause of infant deaths at the time. Since the discovery in the 1980s by Nobel laureates Barry Marshal and Robin Warrenof Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium harboured by 60% of the global population, bismuth compounds, including BSS, have received renewed interest by effectively treating peptic ulcer disease. In 1990, a report from Procter & Gamble (P&G) estimated that over 10 billion doses of Pepto-Bismol had been consumed and that it was found in approximately 60% of U.S. households. In 2019, overall sales of > 20 million units grossed over $100 million in the U.S. alone, making it the most sold stomach remedy in the country. Despite its century-long history and continuing widespread use, the structure of BSS has remained unknown and only a limited understanding has been established of its mechanisms of action.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^114sUsJT]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Results

Among 1344 patients with diarrhea screened for eligibility, we excluded 865 (64%), primarily because diarrhea had been occurring for 48 hours or more at the time of presentation; 63 (4.7%) reported taking an antimicrobial medication during the previous 48 hours (Figure 1). Of 479 eligible patients, 440 enrolled in the study, with 39 declining to participate. One participant was lost to follow-up. Median (interquartile range) participant age was 32 (23–45) years and 187 (43%) were male. In both groups, 37% of participants reported having taken antibiotics for a previous diarrheal illness (Table 1). The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of participants were similar between study groups; most patients reported at least 5 stools per day, and one-third were moderately or severely dehydrated at the time of enrollment (Table 1). Similar proportions of patients in each group submitted enrollment stool specimens that yielded pathogens: 37 individuals (17%) in the BSS group and 43 (20%) in the placebo group; distribution of pathogens was similar between groups (Table 2). Among the 86 bacterial isolates, 44 (51%) were nonsusceptible to ampicillin and 50 (58%) were nonsusceptible to quinolones.

Aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the United States and throughout the world for a variety of indications. Several unique hypersensitivity syndromes exist to this class of medications, making them one of the common reasons for consultation to the allergist. The lack of any laboratory-based diagnostic studies to assist in identifying the culprits in these reactions make evaluation of aspirin and NSAID hypersensitivity challenging. Identifying patients appropriate for oral challenge and/or desensitization protocols is the standard pragmatic approach to this issue when it arises.

### Simplifiedtherapy for patients with penicillin allergy: a randomised controlled trial of vonoprazan-tetracycline dual therapy [^1124zwVh]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, the vonoprazan and tetracycline dual regimen demonstrated non-inferiority to BQT for the eradication of H. pylori infection as first-line treatment among patients with penicillin allergy. This randomised clinical study involving 300 patients provided the initial assessment of VT dual therapy, supporting the efficacy of tetracycline-containing dual therapy for H. pylori infection treatment as first-line option.

Antibiotic resistance is a significant factor contributing to the failure of H. pylori eradication. It has been reported that the overall prevalence of primary antibiotic resistance of H. pylori in the Asia-Pacific region between 1990 and 2022 was 22% (95% CI 20% to 23%) for clarithromycin, 52% (95% CI 49% to 55%) for metronidazole, 26% (95% CI 24% to 29%) for levofloxacin, 4% (95% CI 3% to 5%) for tetracycline and 4% (95% CI 3% to 5%) for amoxicillin. Given that infectious disease studies are often susceptibility-based, tetracycline and amoxicillin emerge as primary option for antibiotic candidates. Amoxicillin, characterised by its low resistance rate, high efficacy, safety and availability, is an essential component of H. pylori eradication regimens. Recently, dual therapy comprising high-dose amoxicillin has been validated as effective. However, amoxicillin may not be the preferred choice, as approximately 10% of the population in the USA and 4%–5.6% in the Asia-Pacific region (including China) report penicillin allergy. According to the Maastricht VI/Florence consensus report, BQT (PPI, bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline) is the preferred treatment option for this population. Tetracycline, at the outset of H. pylori treatment, has shown efficacy as a single-antibiotic regimen. The efficacy of tetracycline-containing dual therapy was initially explored by Al-Assi et al. A dual therapy comprising omeprazole 20 mg three times a day+tetracycline 500 mg four times a day and omeprazole 40 mg once daily plus tetracycline 500 mg four times a day, alongside bismuth subsalicylate 2 tablets four times a day for 14 days, was administrated to 19 and 20 patients with H. pylori -positive peptic ulcer disease, respectively. Successful eradication was achieved in 5/19 (26%) and 12/25 (48%) patients in tetracycline dual therapy group and the bismuth-adding group, respectively. However, the efficacy of tetracycline dual therapy was deemed inadequate for routine treatment, with low intragastric pH being considered a major barrier to effective antimicrobial therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^115XaEn9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a common worldwide infection that is an important cause of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. H. pylori may also have a role in uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia, ulcer risk in patients taking low-dose aspirin or starting therapy with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. While choosing a treatment regimen for H. pylori, patients should be asked about previous antibiotic exposure and this information should be incorporated into the decision-making process. For first-line treatment, clarithromycin triple therapy should be confined to patients with no previous history of macrolide exposure who reside in areas where clarithromycin resistance amongst H. pylori isolates is known to be low. Most patients will be better served by first-line treatment with bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy consisting of a PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole. When first-line therapy fails, a salvage regimen should avoid antibiotics that were previously used. If a patient received a first-line treatment containing clarithromycin, bismuth quadruple therapy or levofloxacin salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. If a patient received first-line bismuth quadruple therapy, clarithromycin or levofloxacin-containing salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. Details regarding the drugs, doses and durations of the recommended and suggested first-line and salvage regimens can be found in the guideline.

### Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets / metronidazole tablets / tetracycline hydrochloride capsules (bismuth subsalicylate / metronidazole / tetracycline hydrochloride) [^1166hDcw]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Salicylic Acid: More than 80% of the salicylic acid is absorbed from oral doses of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets. Salicylic acid is about 90% plasma protein bound. The volume of distribution is about 170 mL/kg of body weight. Salicylic acid is extensively metabolized and about 10% is excreted unchanged in the urine. The metabolic clearance of salicylic acid is saturable; accordingly, nonlinear pharmacokinetics is observed at bismuth subsalicylate doses above 525 mg. Salicylic acid metabolic clearance is lower in females than in males. The terminal half-life of salicylic acid upon a single oral dose of 525 mg bismuth subsalicylate is between 2 to 5 hours. After a single oral dose of 525 mg bismuth subsalicylate (2 chewable tablets), the mean peak plasma salicylic acid concentration was 13.1 ± 3.4 mcg/mL under fasted condition. The mean steady-state serum total salicylate concentration after 2 weeks oral administration of 525 mg bismuth subsalicylate (as PEPTO-BISMOL liquid suspension) four times daily was 24 mcg/mL with the highest value being 70 mcg/mL.

Metronidazole: Following oral administration, metronidazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring between 1 and 2 hours after administration. Plasma concentrations of metronidazole are proportional to the administered dose, with oral administration of 250 mg producing a peak plasma concentration of 6 mcg/mL. Studies reveal no significant bioavailability differences between males and females; however because of weight differences, the resulting plasma levels in males are generally lower.

Commercially available Pepto-Bismol suspension manufactured by P&G was purchased from the supermarket Foodland Pukalani, HI, USA. Prior to performing 3DED and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements, 5 mL of the suspension was washed with 50 mL of water and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 5 min whereafter it was left to dry overnight under ambient conditions (this washed powder is referred to as BSS-PB).

Commercially available bismuth subsalicylate (BSS, CAS: 14882–18–9) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (BSS-SA). The untreated powder was used for structure determination.

Laboratory-made bismuth subsalicylate was prepared by adding 72 mg bismuth oxide (Aldrich, 99.999% trace metal basis) and 128 mg salicylic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent, ≥ 99%) to a 5 mL Pyrex tube filled with 3 mL of deionized water and sealed with a PTFE cap. The tube was heated to 140 °C while stirring at 800 rpm for 3 h. The solid was then filtered off, washed with 50 mL of hot deionized water (> 95 °C), and left to dry in ambient conditions overnight.

### Structure of the active pharmaceutical ingredient bismuth subsalicylate [^115KECXL]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The physical, chemical and therapeutic properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are governed by their molecular structures and intermolecular interactions. Many APIs are crystalline substances, with periodic arrangements of their constituent molecules or ions. The specific arrangement of molecules and their intermolecular interactions affect stability and solubility, which in turn influences bioavailability, efficacy, and dosage. Therefore, determining the structures of pharmaceutical compounds is an integral part of drug formulation. Traditionally the method of choice for crystal structure determination has been single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). However, the technique requires large specimens and is not readily applicable for submicrometer-sized crystals. While structure determination of small crystallites can often be performed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), the technique can at times struggle with complicated and disordered structures.

These reasons among others have previously prevented the structure determination of the API bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), a crystalline compound made from Bi 3+ cations, O 2 − anions, and salicylate anions (Hsal −, Fig. 1a). It is administered in its crystalline state and is the API of popular over-the-counter medications such as Pepto-Bismol, commonly used to treat gastrointestinal disorders such as dyspepsia and diarrhoea. Numerous studies have confirmed the efficacy of BSS as an antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antacid agent –. Antimicrobial properties of several other bismuth compounds such as bismuth subgallate, bismuth subnitrate, and colloidal bismuth tartrate have been reported, and specifically, it has been demonstrated that colloidal bismuth subcitrate and ranitidine bismuth citrate can even combat antibiotic resistance in bacteriaand suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^114yfUe8]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Setting and Participants

Twenty-two general-care outpatient clinics staffed by allopathic physicians in Karachi, Pakistan, participated in this study. We targeted low- to middle-income, multiethnic neighborhoods because we believed diarrhea incidence would be greater than in higher-income neighborhoods, and recruitment would therefore proceed more quickly. Patients were enrolled from April to June and August to October 2014, which encompassed Karachi's rainy season. We did not enroll participants during July because most staff and laypersons were observing Ramadan. The trial protocol is available in Supplement 1.

Within each clinic, we screened all clinically stable adults who presented with a chief concern of nonbloody diarrhea for less than 48 hours and who were older than 14 years and younger than 66 years (Figure 1). We excluded patients who were pregnant or lactating, reported taking an antidiarrheal or antimicrobial medication during the previous 48 hours, were allergic to aspirin, or had previously enrolled in the study. To facilitate patient follow-up, we enrolled only the first eligible, consenting patient in each clinic each day.

Figure 1.
Flow of Participants Through the Study

Patients could report multiple exclusion criteria.

Staff from Health-Oriented Preventive Education, a Karachi-based nongovernmental organization that provides health care, education, and advocacy for low-resource individuals in Pakistan, performed all nonlaboratory field work.

Ethics

Although study physicians were instructed not to provide participants with antibiotics at enrollment, participants received oral rehydration solution and were encouraged to seek care if their condition worsened. Study staff were also instructed to refer participants for additional care if they reported feeling worse during follow-up interviews. Participants provided written informed consent before enrollment. The study protocol and data collection instruments were approved by the institutional review boards of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Health-Oriented Preventive Education. This article follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline for randomized trials.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^116CcdpX]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We estimated sample size based on the primary end point of antibiotic use during 5 days of observation. While accounting for stratified design and assuming 95% confidence, 1:1 enrollment in BSS and placebo groups, negligible dropout, and antibiotic use in 10% of the BSS group, we required 20 clinics each to enroll 20 participants to achieve 80% power to detect a 10% difference in antibiotic use between groups (ie, 20% of placebo participants use antibiotics). Because resources sufficed when the study began, we added 2 clinics (for a total of 440 participants) to increase statistical power.

All analyses were by assigned group. We used logistic regression to explore multivariable models, which included clinic, age quartiles, sex, wealth, or diarrhea severity at presentation as covariates. Because none of these potential confounders were significant in models assessing each covariate individually, we reported univariate results derived using χ 2, Fisher exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, as appropriate. We constructed Kaplan-Meier curves to analyze resolution of symptoms, and differences between groups were assessed using the log-rank test. Two-sided P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Primary analysis occurred August to September 2015.

### Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets / metronidazole tablets / tetracycline hydrochloride capsules (bismuth subsalicylate / metronidazole / tetracycline hydrochloride) [^111kfLH6]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE:

In case of an overdose, patients should contact a physician, poison control center, or emergency room.

Bismuth Subsalicylate: The main concern of an acute bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) overdose focuses on the salicylate burden and not on bismuth, since less than 1% of the bismuth is normally absorbed. Each 262.4-mg tablet of BSS contains an amount of salicylate comparable to approximately 130 mg aspirin. Acute ingestion of less than 150 mg/kg of aspirin (i.e., less than one tablet of bismuth subsalicylate per kilogram of body weight) is not expected to lead to toxicity. Mild to moderate toxicity may result from the ingestion of 150 to 300 mg/kg, while severe toxicity may occur from ingestions over 300 mg/kg. Salicylate intoxication presents a complex clinical picture. Multiple respiratory and metabolic effects result in fluid, electrolyte, glucose, and acid-base disturbances. Initial symptoms of salicylate toxicity include hyperpnea, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, hyperpyrexia, lethargy, tachycardia, and confusion. In severe cases, these symptoms may progress to severe hyperpnea, convulsions, pulmonary or cerebral edema, respiratory failure, cardiovascular collapse, coma, and death.

Darkening of the Tongue and/or Stool

Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules may cause temporary and harmless darkening of the tongue and/or black stool and is generally reversible within several days after treatment is stopped. Stool darkening should not be confused with melena (blood in the stool) (see PRECAUTIONS).

Dosing and Administration Information

Each dose includes 4 pills: 2 pink round chewable tablets (bismuth subsalicylate), 1 white round tablet (metronidazole), and 1 black and yellow capsule (tetracycline hydrochloride). Each dose (all 4 pills) should be taken 4 times a day, at mealtimes and bedtime. Patients should be instructed to chew and swallow the pink round tablets (bismuth subsalicylate tablets) and to swallow the white round tablet (metronidazole tablet) and the black and yellow capsule (tetracycline hydrochloride capsule) whole with a full glass of water (8 ounces). Concomitantly prescribed H2 antagonist therapy should be taken as directed.

Missed doses can be made up by continuing the normal dosing schedule until the medication is gone. Patients should not take double doses. (If more than 4 doses are missed, the prescriber should be contacted (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Salicylate Toxicity

Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules contains salicylates. If taken with aspirin and ringing in the ears occurs, the prescriber should be consulted concerning discontinuation of the aspirin therapy until the Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules therapy is completed (see OVERDOSAGE, WARNINGS, and DRUG INTERACTIONS).

Aspirin desensitization protocol in AERD — Desensitization doses are advanced after recovery from reactions with the goal to reach at least 325 mg aspirin daily, which then allows use of any dose of any NSAID without concern of a reaction; some patients may target 81 mg solely for antiplatelet effect but will not be desensitized to higher aspirin doses or other NSAIDs. Protocols vary but generally require 1–3 days, using incremental oral administration over 1–3 days and progressing in steps to a full dose of 325 mg; if desensitization days are not consecutive, patients may continue the highest tolerated dose daily until completion. Aspirin therapy can cause gastritis, epigastric pain, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Reply to "Acid inhibitors and allergy: comorbidity, causation and confusion" [^115HHa2L]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Considering the unidirectional phenomenon of an increased risk of anti-allergy medications after an anti-acid drug prescription, we agree that future research might reveal relationships linking dyspepsia and allergic diseases. Dr. Siah stressed correctly that observational studies and especially analyses of claims data, provide on their own no firm basis for cause-and-effect statements. Therefore, we referred the reader to the consistency of our findings with experimental data. Although we also agree that randomized controlled studies (RCTs) could, in principle, clarify whether or not the observed association is causal, we doubt that such RCTs will ever be conducted owing to a lack of commercial interest and because of the ethical issues.

As medical doctors, we regard gastric acid-inhibiting drugs as invaluable therapeutic options in a variety of dyspeptic diseases, if indication and reasonable prescription duration are considered. Also as MDs, we are trained to handle patients' many anxieties, and must take the responsibility to explain, prescribe, and discontinue the anti-acid treatments in a controlled manner. We further stress that guidelines, pointing to a discontinuation of acid-inhibiting drug prescriptions as soon as there is no further indication, should be adhered to.

### Cardiovascular prophylaxis and aspirin "allergy" [^116rbAYh]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Aspirin is an important antiplatelet agent in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Aspirin "allergy" often directs the physician away from this potentially life-saving modality. The majority of patients with a history of "reactions to aspirin" have aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastritis, easy bruisability, or other side effects. The minority of these patients has a "true allergy", referred to as a hypersensitivity reaction. The former group can be started on aspirin without the need for special challenge. Adding a proton-pump inhibitor can often mitigate the gastrointestinal side effects. Patients with aspirin hypersensitivity can be safely challenged with aspirin.

Aspirin therapy after desensitization (ATAD) for AERD — process and dosing specify that ATAD is a 2-part process in which patients are first desensitized to aspirin and then continued on daily aspirin therapy; during desensitization patients are gradually exposed to larger doses of aspirin (≤ 325 mg) over a period of 1 to 3 days depending on protocol, and while there is no global consensus on the treatment dose, available randomized controlled trials most commonly used doses between 650 mg and 1300 mg per day; importantly, aspirin must be taken every day after desensitization, and if a patient misses a dose for ≥ 2 days they must be evaluated by their allergist and may have to redo desensitization, and desensitization itself does not provide clinical benefit but enables daily aspirin use.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^117Cs9eL]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Table 3.
Illness Severity, Antibiotic Use, and Economic Effects During Follow-up by Study Group

Abbreviation: IQR, interquartile range.

Similar proportions of participants in each group sought care; physicians predominated as the type of practitioner (Table 3). Sixteen participants were hospitalized (6 of 220 [3%] in the BSS group and 10 of 219 [5%] in the placebo group); none died. Intravenous rehydration occurred about half as often during follow-up among those in the BSS group (14 of 220 vs 27 of 219 patients; OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25–0.95). We did not detect a difference between groups in time to first formed stool or to last diarrheal stool (Figure 2), nor did we measure differences in the proportion of patients with any formed stool, diarrheal stool, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain at 24 or 48 hours after enrollment. Similarly, the median cumulative reported number of diarrheal stools did not differ between groups at 24, 48, or 120 hours after enrollment. Participants in the BSS group tended to use additional medications less frequently than did controls, although the difference was not statistically significant (32 of 220 vs 44 of 219 patients; OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.41–1.12); antidiarrheals were the most commonly used medication in both groups (Table 3).

Figure 2.
Kaplan-Meier Curves for Time to Last Diarrheal Stool and Time to First Formed Stool by Study Group

Approximately half the participants in each group missed work during follow-up; the median duration of missed work was significantly greater in the placebo group (median [interquartile range] days missed, 1 [0–1] vs 0 [0–1] for the BSS group; p = 0.04) (Table 3). Although the difference was not statistically significant, those in the BSS group tended to report ability to participate in "all normal activities" more frequently than those in the placebo group during the first and second 24 hours after enrollment. Medical expenditures tended to be higher and occur among more controls compared with those in the BSS group, although the result was not statistically significant (Table 3).

### Should biologics Be used before aspirin desensitization in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease? [^114e1eJN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

There has been a paradigm shift in the management of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). It started in 2015 when the first biologic was Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for severe eosinophilic asthma. Thus, there emerged a new era in the treatment of patients with type 2-mediated airway diseases. This has led to an increasing number of options for patients, undoubtably a great thing, but has left clinicians without a clear answer for how to balance the therapies that exist for AERD, what to recommend for treatment, and how to best assess the benefits and risks of each therapy. This paper aims to explore these benefits and risks, and to provide a roadmap for future studies.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^112636rF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Aspirin desensitization — aspirin challenge or desensitization followed by daily aspirin therapy is indicated for adult and pediatric patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) who require revision polypectomies or frequent or daily corticosteroid therapy, and any patient with a history of an acute NSAID hypersensitivity reaction with a medical indication for aspirin or other cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitor should be offered desensitization. Before initiation, it is recommended that forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) be greater than 60% predicted and at least 1.5 L; oral antihistamines and decongestants are discontinued 48 hours before and short-acting β-agonists the morning of desensitization; and outpatient protocols are acceptable except in patients with recent myocardial infarction, continuous β-blocker therapy, or uncontrolled asthma. A standard oral aspirin desensitization protocol begins with a dose of 40 mg of aspirin with dose escalation every 90 to 180 minutes; once patients have tolerated 325 mg without evidence of symptoms, they can increase to the recommended treatment dose of 650 mg twice daily at home; if aspirin is discontinued for more than 48 hours, the desensitized state can be lost and repeat desensitization is recommended. Use of a leukotriene receptor antagonist in advance of desensitization decreases the severity of bronchospasm in AERD, though in a small subset it will potentiate symptoms; overall the added safety benefit from their use outweighs this risk.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^1166pJ87]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Among adults with diarrhea, does use of bismuth subsalicylate reduce antibiotic consumption?

Findings

In this placebo-controlled randomized trial that included 439 adults in Pakistan, antibiotic use occurred among 16% of participants who received placebo and 9% of those who received bismuth subsalicylate, a significant difference.

Meaning

The findings suggest that recommending bismuth subsalicylate as a frontline treatment for adults with diarrhea, including for diarrhea self-management, may reduce rates of unnecessary antibiotic use and help modulate the spread of antibiotic resistance.

### Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets / metronidazole tablets / tetracycline hydrochloride capsules (bismuth subsalicylate / metronidazole / tetracycline hydrochloride) [^117J6URL]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS:

Methoxyflurane

Do not administer methoxyflurane to patients taking Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules. The concurrent use of tetracycline hydrochloride, a component of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules with methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).

Disulfiram

Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules is contraindicated in patients who have taken disulfiram within the last two weeks. Psychotic reactions have been reported in alcoholic patients who are using metronidazole, a component of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules and disulfiram concurrently (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).

Alcohol

Alcoholic beverages or other products containing propylene glycol should not be consumed during and for at least 3 days after usage of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules. A disulfiram-like reaction (abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing) may occur due to the interaction between alcohol or propylene glycol and metronidazole, a component of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).

Renal Impairment

Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). In patients with significantly impaired renal function, higher serum concentrations of tetracyclines may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g. urticaria, erythematous rash, flushing, and fever) to bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole or other nitroimidazole derivatives, or tetracycline (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Allergy to Aspirin or other Salicylates

Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules should not be administered to those patients who have a known allergy to aspirin or salicylates.

### Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets / metronidazole tablets / tetracycline hydrochloride capsules (bismuth subsalicylate / metronidazole / tetracycline hydrochloride) [^115erfJ1]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics for Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/ Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules components (bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules) when coadministered has not been studied. There is no information about the gastric mucosal concentrations of bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline after administration of these agents concomitantly or in combination with an acid suppressive agent. The systemic pharmacokinetic information presented below is based on studies in which each product was administered alone.

Bismuth Subsalicylate: Upon oral administration, bismuth subsalicylate is almost completely hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract to bismuth and salicylic acid. Thus, the pharmacokinetics of bismuth subsalicylate following oral administration can be described by the individual pharmacokinetics of bismuth and salicylic acid.

Bismuth: Less than 1% of bismuth from oral doses of bismuth subsalicylate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the systemic circulation. Absorbed bismuth is distributed throughout the body. Bismuth is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 90%). Bismuth has multiple disposition half-lives with an intermediate half-life of 5 to 11 days and a terminal half-life of 21 to 72 days. Elimination of bismuth is primarily through urinary and biliary routes with a renal clearance of 50 ± 18 mL/min. The mean trough blood bismuth concentration after 2 weeks oral administration of 787 mg bismuth subsalicylate (3 chewable tablets) four times daily under fasted condition was 5.1 ± 3.1 ng/mL. In another study, the mean trough blood bismuth concentration after 2 weeks oral administration of 525 mg bismuth subsalicylate (as PEPTO-BISMOL® liquid suspension) four times daily was 5 ng/mL with the highest value being 32 ng/mL.

### Microscopic colitis [^115xyPSp]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis is a condition that is clinically underrecognized as a cause of chronic or intermittent diarrhea and can be diagnosed only by mucosal biopsy. Microscopic colitis is more common in middle-age to elderly women, appears to be induced by some medications, particularly nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and has been associated with autoimmune conditions and sprue. Symptomatic treatment includes cholestyramine and antidiarrheal medications. Bismuth subsalicylate, and 5-amniosalicylates are therapeutic options; however, budesonide is more effective in achieving clinical and histologic improvement and/or remission and has been studied in more randomized trials. Use of immune modulators should be restricted to more severe cases that are steroid refractory or steroid dependent. Surgical intervention should be reserved for a very highly select group of refractory cases. Diverting ileostomy or colectomy appear to be equally effective surgical alternatives for microscopic colitis, which is not a risk factor for carcinoma.

### Structure of the active pharmaceutical ingredient bismuth subsalicylate [^117BSTwX]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Elucidation of the structure of commercial BSS provides a major step towards understanding the properties of one of the most commercially significant bismuth compounds. The fact that BSS is practically insoluble in water and the hydrophobic properties of the powder can be partly attributed to the continuous structure of the coordination polymer, where the less polar section of the salicylate anions form the outer surfaces of the layers, while all ionic and hydrophilic components, such as the phenolic group, carboxylate group, µ 3 -O 2−, µ 4 -O 2−, and Bi 3+, are contained within the layers. This hydrophobic character is also in alignment with the fact that BSS embedded in hydrophobic resin starts to dissolve from the (010) facets (Supplementary Fig. 11). In addition to its high stability in water, BSS also demonstrated decent stability in aqueous solutions of HCl (Supplementary Fig. 12). No changes were observed in the PXRD patterns of BSS treated at a pH of 3 or higher. At a pH of 2, a small proportion of BSS converted into bismuth oxychloride and was fully converted at a pH of 1, which is in line with previous indications that some of the administered BSS could even reach the small intestine. Considering this, interactions between the hydrophobic exterior of the BSS crystals and the gastric lining could to some extent govern the pharmacodynamics of this long-used formulation.

The various forms of analysis, including PXRD, 3DED, and STEM imaging, indicated that the two investigated samples, BSS-PB and BSS-SA, were built from the same layers but that the samples differed in terms of the degree of crystallinity and disorder in their structures. Understanding the differences in local ordering of BSS opens opportunities to develop analogues containing unique stacking sequences or higher degrees of exfoliation, which may influence the properties and the efficacy of the API. Considering this, the combination of electron crystallography tools used, 3DED and STEM, is expected to become an important part of drug discovery and structure determination of APIs.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease — cross-reactivity and medication choices indicate that aspirin and NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1 can all cause reactions and are considered cross-reactive. Weak COX-1 inhibitors such as nonacetylated salicylates and acetaminophen may cause reactions in highly sensitive individuals if administered at higher doses (650–1000 mg) but are typically mild. NSAIDs that preferentially inhibit COX-2 but also inhibit COX-1 at higher doses may result in reactions depending on dose, whereas reactions to selective COX-2 inhibitors are extremely rare in patients with AERD and they can typically be taken safely.

We present a case report of coagulopathy from BSS poisoning in a patient with underlying cirrhosis. The patient's high prothrombin time suggests inhibition of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. The patient had decreased factor V activity, which is responsible for converting prothrombin to thrombin. Patients with cirrhosis often have hypoprothrombinemia which may be exacerbated by salicylate-induced coagulopathy. Given the widespread use of BSS products, physicians should recognize coagulopathy as a possible manifestation of toxicity especially in patients with underlying liver disease.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^113w7N38]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Many of the 4.5 billion annual episodes of diarrhea are treated unnecessarily with antibiotics; prevalence of antibiotic resistance among diarrheal pathogens is increasing. Knowledge-based antibiotic stewardship interventions typically yield little change in antibiotic use.

Objective

To compare antibiotic use among adult outpatients with diarrhea given bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) or placebo.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial took place from April to October 2014. Participants were patients aged 15 to 65 years with acute, nonbloody diarrhea from 22 outpatient clinics in Karachi, Pakistan. Participants were interviewed about symptoms and health care utilization during the 5 days after enrollment. Group assignment was concealed from participants, field staff, and the statistician. Primary analysis occurred from August to September 2015.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive BSS or placebo for 48 hours or less.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Use of systemic antibiotics within 5 days of enrollment. Secondary outcomes included measures of duration and severity of illness.

Results

Among eligible patients, 39 declined to participate, 440 enrolled, and 1 enrolled participant was lost to follow-up, for a total of 439 patients included in the analysis. Median (interquartile range) participant age was 32 (23–45) years and 187 (43%) were male. Two hundred twenty patients were randomized to BSS and 220 were randomized to placebo. Overall, 54 participants (12%) used systemic antibiotics (16% in the placebo group and 9% in the BSS group); all antibiotic use followed consultation with a physician. Use of any antibiotic was significantly lower in the BSS group (20 of 220 vs 34 of 219 patients; odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30–0.98), as was use of fluoroquinolones (8 of 220 vs 20 of 219 patients; OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16–0.88). Rates of care seeking and hospitalization were similar between groups and no difference was detected in timing of diarrhea resolution. However, those in the BSS group less commonly received intravenous rehydration (14 of 220 vs 27 of 219 patients; OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25–0.95) and missed less work (median [interquartile range], 0 [0–1] vs 1 [0–1] day; p = 0.04) during follow-up.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found less antibiotic use among participants given BSS for acute diarrhea in a setting where antibiotics are commonly used to treat diarrhea. Encouraging health care professionals in such settings to recommend BSS as frontline treatment for adults with diarrhea, and promoting BSS for diarrhea self-management, may reduce antibiotic use and rates of antibiotic resistance globally.

Adverse effects and adherence to medications

The most common adverse effect in both groups was dizziness. The frequencies of overall adverse effects were not significantly different between the PBMT-10 and PBMT-14 groups (54.1% [85/157] versus 57.1% [89/156]; absolute difference −2.91% [95% CI: −13.74%–8.01%], P = 0.604), but the frequencies of dizziness and vomiting were significantly lower in the PBMT-10 group. The frequency of dizziness was 18.5% (29/157) and 34.0% (53/156) between the PBMT-10 and PBMT-14 groups, and the absolute difference was −15.50% (95% CI: −24.88% to −5.77%, P = 0.003). The frequency of vomiting was 4.5% (7/157) and 12.8% (20/156) between the PBMT-10 and PBMT-14 groups, and the absolute difference was −8.36% (95% CI: −14.92% to −2.12%, P = 0.008, Table 3).

Table 3
Adverse event profile in 10- and 14-day therapy groups.

The frequency of serious adverse events was not significantly different between the two groups (3.8% [6/157] versus 2.6% [4/156]; absolute difference 1.26 [95% CI: −3.10 to 5.80], P = 0.750); moreover, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse effects in the PBMT-10 group was not significantly different from that in the PBMT-14 group (4.5% [7/157] versus 5.1% [8/156]; absolute difference −0.67% [95% CI: −5.86% to 4.44%], P = 0.782). One patient presented with anaphylactic shock caused by esomeprazole. The rates of good adherence to medications (≥ 80% of medications taken) were comparable between the two groups (PBMT-10 versus PBMT-14: 91.1% [143/157] versus 88.5% [138/156]; absolute difference 2.62% [95% CI: −4.24% to 9.55%], P = 0.444).

### Aspirin and bismuth subsalicylate… [^114rHEVv]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Sir. — The recent review article by Lindsley1 suggests the use of various antacids, including bismuth subsalicylate, to minimize salicylate-induced gastric irritation. The salicylate in bismuth subsalicylate is almost completely bioavailable2; 15 mL of Pepto-Bismol liquid contains 130mg of salicylate. The recommended dosage for a 9-year-old child is 15 mL for up to eight times per 24 hours. 3 Added to an anti-inflammatory dosage regimen of aspirin, this can be enough to produce serious intoxication.

We suggest an oral aspirin challenge to confirm the diagnosis of AERD in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. We suggest that a challenge procedure be used to diagnose AERD when there is diagnostic uncertainty and that a desensitization protocol be used when the intention is to place a patient on a daily therapeutic aspirin dose for cardioprotection, pain relief, or to control nasal polyp regrowth.

### Salicylate toxicity from chronic bismuth subsalicylate use [^11177b74]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 79-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of worsening confusion, falls and hearing impairment. An initial workup for infectious, metabolic and structural causes was unrevealing. However, further history discovered that he had been ingesting one to two bottles of Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) daily for gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms. On his second day of admission, the plasma salicylate concentration was 2.08 mmol/L (reference range 1.10–2.20 mmol/L), despite no sources of salicylate in hospital. He was diagnosed with chronic salicylate toxicity and Pepto-Bismol use was discontinued. The patient was treated supportively with isotonic intravenous fluids only and plasma salicylate concentration fell to less than 0.36mmol/L. Concurrently, all his symptoms resolved. This case highlights the potential adverse effects of over-the-counter medications. The diagnosis of chronic salicylate toxicity is challenging, specifically in the elderly and in undifferentiated presentations, as it can be missed if not suspected.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^1148VY8Q]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

We might have further underestimated BSS's effect on antibiotic use because we included only participants who had not used antibiotics at the time of presentation and who consented to participate in the study. Such persons might have been less likely to use antibiotics than the general population; indeed, only 37% of participants reported having taken antibiotics for any previous diarrheal episode. Despite this, we measured substantially less antibiotic use in the BSS group than among controls. Next, antibiotic use at enrollment or during the study could have been misclassified; however, we used visual aids depicting photos and common names of antibiotics available in Karachi during patient interviews, and because participants reported obtaining all antibiotics used during follow-up from a physician, we were able to verify drug class using clinical records and pharmacy receipts. We did not collect participant employment status, so analyses including missed work and lost income could be driven by imbalances in employment across study groups, despite lack of imbalance among the other characteristics we analyzed. All participants were recruited in Karachi and followed up for only 5 days; generalizability and sustainability of these findings should be verified through additional study.

### Lymphocytic colitis: clinical features, treatment, and outcomes [^115f7UKB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

There are no reports of the clinical features or treatment outcomes in large series of patients with lymphocytic colitis, and it is not known whether treatments that appear to be beneficial in patients with collagenous colitis are also beneficial in lymphocytic colitis. We sought to analyze these issues in our patients with lymphocytic colitis.

Methods

All patients with biopsy-proven lymphocytic colitis evaluated at our institution between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 1999, were identified. Clinical features on presentation and treatment outcomes were abstracted from the medical records.

Results

A total of 170 patients with lymphocytic colitis were identified (median age 67 yr, 61% female). Diarrhea, bloating, rectal urgency, fecal incontinence, weight loss, concomitant autoimmune disorders, and aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use were common. Loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropine, and bismuth subsalicylate were effective therapies and were well tolerated. However, no therapy produced a complete response in more than 40% of patients.

Conclusions

Lymphocytic colitis typically presents in elderly patients as chronic diarrhea. Nocturnal stools, urgency, and abdominal pain occur frequently, as do weight loss, fecal incontinence, and concomitant autoimmune disorders. Many empiric treatment options are used, but overall response rates are disappointing. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the optimum therapeutic approach to these patients.

Aspirin therapy after desensitization and perioperative management — To maintain tolerance, continued daily administration of at least 325 mg of aspirin once daily is required; for control of nasal polyps/airway inflammation, initial doses of 650 mg twice daily may be necessary. Gastrointestinal protection with an enteric‑coated aspirin and other prophylaxis may be considered. Gaps in aspirin doses > 48 hours can lead to loss of tolerance, and after 5 days all patients will react; if a procedure allows a 48‑hour window, aspirin can be restarted immediately after surgery, and a strategy of 325 mg daily for 7 days before surgery with holding the day prior and day of, then restarting immediately postoperatively, allows retention of tolerance. If off aspirin for > 48 hours, desensitization should be repeated; ibuprofen bridging is another consideration. Pretreatment is recommended with leukotriene modifying agents and inhaled corticosteroid/long‑acting beta agonist inhalers should also be considered; once desensitized, universal tolerance to all COX–1‑inhibiting NSAIDs (in addition to aspirin) is achieved.

### Diagnosis and management of microscopic colitis syndrome [^116ykwsE]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis syndrome consists of chronic watery diarrhea, a normal or near-normal gross appearance of the colonic mucosa, and a specific histologic picture described as either lymphocytic colitis or collagenous colitis. The cause of microscopic colitis is unknown, but recent work suggests some immunologic similarities to celiac disease, suggesting that luminal antigens may be important in its pathogenesis. Diarrhea in microscopic colitis seems to be directly related to the extent of inflammation, suggesting that inflammatory mediators are responsible for reduced water absorption by the colon. Microscopic colitis is a frequent diagnosis in patients with chronic diarrhea seen at referral centers. It is often associated with other immune-mediated conditions and frequently is complicated by fecal incontinence. The differential diagnosis is broad, comprising all causes of watery diarrhea. Evaluation is straightforward with the key aspect being review of colon biopsy specimens by an experienced pathologist. Treatment is still being defined: symptomatic management with antidiarrheal agents, 5-aminosalicylate drugs, corticosteroids, especially budesonide, bile acid-binding resins, and bismuth subsalicylate all can be effective. The prognosis is good with no evidence of conversion to classic inflammatory bowel disease or of development of neoplasia over time.

4. How should my patient take Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules?

The medicines in this therapy have been demonstrated to treat the infection in the majority of cases when taken correctly. Treating the infection is important to reduce the risk of the ulcer coming back. (It may be useful to open the therapy and explain dosing while showing the patient one of the dosing blister cards.) Patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### Cefuroxime, levofloxacin, esomeprazole, and bismuth as first-line therapy for eradicating Helicobacter pylori in patients allergic to penicillin [^112Hsqfv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients and setting

The current prospective cohort study was performed at the Gastroenterology clinic in a tertiary hospital of Beijing, China, from January 2015 to March 2017. Adult patients with dyspepsia and penicillin allergy were enrolled with clinically diagnosed H. pylori infection and no prior eradication treatment.

Exclusion criteria were: age < 18 years; medicines with potential to affect results, including PPIs, H 2 -receptor blockers, bismuth salts, and antibiotics within 4 weeks; gastrointestinal cancer; a history of gastric or esophageal operation; severe concomitant disease; known allergy to any study drug; pregnancy or lactation in women.

Ethical consideration

Each patient provided signed informed consent. This trial had approval from the Ethics Committee of Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China, and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki following Good Clinical Practice. All authors evaluated study results and approved the final manuscript.

Study procedures

Health care professionals at the Gastroenterology Unit provided a comprehensive explanation regarding the regimen and possible deleterious effects to the included patients. In addition, the patients were instructed orally and in writing regarding the importance of regular mediation intake, with recommendation to continue treatment even in case of mild or moderate adverse reactions and to call physicians for severe secondary effects. They were required to return within 3 days of eradication for the assessment of treatment compliance and adverse events. H. pylori eradication was evaluated 8–12 weeks upon treatment by the urea breath test (UBT; UCBT Kit, Atom High Tech, China). This was an open label trial.

Adverse events were determined by asking open-ended questions using patient self-reports and physical examinations, and grouped into the mild (no interference with daily routine), moderate (limited effects on daily routine), severe (marked effects on daily routine and medication discontinuation), and serious (death, hospitalization, disability, or required intervention for permanent damage prevention) types.

Compliance assessed by pill count was considered good (≥ 80% of pills taken) or poor (< 80% of drugs taken). Individuals poorly complying were not taken into account in the per-protocol (PP) analysis.

Intervention

The CLEB regimen consisted of cefuroxime (500 mg twice/day after breakfast and supper), levofloxacin (500 mg once/day after breakfast), esomeprazole (20 mg twice/day before breakfast and supper) and bismuth potassium citrate (220 mg twice/day before breakfast and supper) for 14 days.

### How to effectively use bismuth quadruple therapy: the good, the bad, and the ugly [^11567qye]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Bismuth triple therapy was the first effective Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. The addition of a proton pump inhibitor helped overcome metronidazole resistance. Its primary indication is penicillin allergy or when clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance are both common. Resistance to the primary first-line therapy have centered on complexity and difficulties with compliance. Understanding regional differences in effectiveness remains unexplained because of the lack of studies including susceptibility testing and adherence data. We discuss regimen variations including substitutions of doxycycline, amoxicillin, and twice a day therapy and provide suggestions regarding what is needed to rationally and effectively use bismuth quadruple therapy.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin desensitization and aspirin therapy in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — indications and contraindications are summarized as follows: Indication is persistent sinonasal and asthma symptoms in a patient with AERD despite conventional medical and surgical therapy. Contraindications include poorly controlled asthma, significant nasal polyp burden at time of desensitization, pregnancy, history of eosinophilic esophagitis, history of gastric and/or peptic ulcer disease, history of a bleeding disorder or coagulopathy, and history of medication nonadherence. A relative contraindication is a history of anaphylaxis to aspirin or other NSAID; patients with such a history may undergo an aspirin desensitization and aspirin therapy, but this decision merits careful discussion with the patient and physician.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^113kY6DK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — aspirin desensitization protocols list timed dose-escalation options and safety steps, including an aspirin (60 min) schedule with doses at 9:00 AM 81 mg, 9:30 AM 120 mg, 11:00 AM 162 mg, and 2:00 PM 325 mg, and a ketorolac/aspirin pathway that continues on Day 2 with 8:00 AM 150 mg oral aspirin followed by 11:00 AM 325 mg oral aspirin; not all protocols suit all patients, reactions should prompt repeating the triggering dose before up-dosing, and if a reaction occurs the protocol is paused and resumed only after the reaction largely resolves, noting most patients will react between 40.25 mg and 120 mg of aspirin.

a. Oral contraceptives. As with many antibacterial preparations, concomitant use of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules may reduce the effectiveness of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives; breakthrough bleeding may occur. Patients should be advised to use an additional or different form of contraception. Women who become pregnant while taking Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules should be advised to notify their prescriber immediately.

b. Anticoagulants. Individual components of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules have the potential to interact with anticoagulants. Monitoring anticoagulant therapy with appropriate adjustment of the anticoagulant dosage may be warranted if concurrent therapy is instituted. (See Package Insert.)

c. Lithium. In patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium, short-term metronidazole therapy has been associated with elevation of serum lithium and, in a few cases, signs of lithium toxicity. Serum lithium and serum creatinine should be obtained several days after beginning metronidazole to detect any increase that may precede clinical symptoms of lithium toxicity.

d. Antidiabetic agents. There is a possible enhanced hypoglycemic effect when given with salicylates.

e. Cimetidine. The simultaneous administration of drugs that decrease microsomal liver enzyme activity, such as cimetidine, may prolong the half-life and decrease plasma clearance of metronidazole.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^113gRbqF]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Interventions to improve antibiotic use often attempt to influence rational decision-making among clinicians; however, the effect of such methods tends to be modest and short-lived. Audit and feedback to prescribers, the most common method in US hospitals, has had little effect in outpatientor inpatientsettings; supplying practitioners with printed educational materials has also appeared ineffective. Efforts to reduce demand among patients may lead to patients reporting more severe symptoms, but appear to reduce antibiotic prescribing rates when implemented as part of interventions to increase shared medical decision-making. Similarly, clinician behavior change following policy-level interventions tends to be limited. Financial incentives may lead to shifts in diagnostic coding, and formulary restrictions to changes in antibiotic choice. Provision of guidelines alone has had little effect on prescribing rates for several outpatient conditions.

Alternative strategies rooted more strongly in behavioral science could supplement or supplant more traditional strategies to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics. Nudge methods do not limit choice, do not alter the economic incentives related to the behavior, and do not mandate — all of which can be difficult to implement and may lead to resistance from practitioners and patients, — but instead rely on supplying a default that many would not bother to resist. Interventions addressing psychosocial drivers of prescribing behavior, such as social norms, physician desire to provide symptomatic relief, and physician perception that patients expect medical management, may work at least as well as interventions that assume clinicians will make rational decisions based on knowledge of guidelines or possible public health effects. Posting a commitment letter on the clinic wall was associated with approximately 20% fewer inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions in one US study. Awareness of prescription practices among clinician leaders appears to influence those among others in the community and may also be important to target during nudge campaigns. However, the predominance of small, independent clinics may make this strategy difficult to implement in South Asia.

### Current knowledge and management of hypersensitivity to aspirin and NSAIDs [^1119699q]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are some of the most common culprits of drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions, and can lead to a wide array of adverse effects. The accurate and timely diagnosis of aspirin and NSAID-induced hypersensitivity reactions is important for both patient safety and for the initiation of appropriate disease-specific management and treatment. Because there are no reliably validated in vitro tests available, aspirin and NSAID challenges are considered to be the criterion standard for the diagnosis of these hypersensitivity reactions, though in some patients the diagnosis can be made on the basis of a clear clinical history.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) hypersensitivity — COX-2 inhibitor tolerance and adjunctive strategies are outlined, noting that specific COX-2 inhibitors will generally be tolerated and that, given the low rate of reactions (8%-11%) that also occur to COX-2 inhibitors, the first dose could be given under observation; compared with 1- to 3-day aspirin desensitization protocols in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, there are limited data on more rapid (> 5 hours) protocols, and concomitant high dose (2–4 times the standard daily dose of a nonsedating antihistamine) H1-antihistamines might also be another avenue to allow occasional safe use of NSAIDS.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^116o9m7H]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Salvage regimens for treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection — without antibiotic susceptibility testing — are organized by prior regimen and penicillin allergy. After "Previous PPI-Clarithromycin Triple", the "No Penicillin Allergy" branch lists "Optimized BQT", "Rifabutin Triple", and "High-Dose PPI or PCAB Dual?", while the "Penicillin Allergy" branch lists "Optimized BQT". After "Previous Nonoptimized BQT", the "No Penicillin Allergy" branch again lists "Optimized BQT", "Rifabutin Triple", and "High-Dose PPI or PCAB Dual?", and the "Penicillin Allergy" branch lists "Optimized BQT". BQT is defined on-page as "bismuth quadruple therapy", and footnotes specify that "Includes appropriately dosed PPI, bismuth, nitroimidazole, and tetracycline (not doxycycline)", "Consider only when optimized BQT or rifabutin triple therapy is not an option and antibiotic susceptibility testing is unavailable", and "May require formal allergy testing".

1. What is the most important information my patient should know about Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules?

a. Scientists have discovered that most ulcers are caused by an infection from a specific germ called H. pylori. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been found to play a primary role in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcers, and is considered the causative organism in 80% to 95% of patients with duodenal ulcers.

b. Each pill of every dose is important. Studies have shown that taking all this medicine is very important to eradicate all the ulcer-causing germs. If doses are skipped or treatment is stopped early, some of these germs may not be eradicated and another ulcer can develop.

2. What is Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules?

a. The components of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules (bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, and tetracycline hydrochloride) are indicated for the treatment of patients with an active duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori infection. The eradication of H. pylori has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Appropriate doses of an H2 antagonist indicated for the treatment of active duodenal ulcer should be prescribed for ulcer healing.

Table 2
Data from four randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral budesonide in collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis

The relapse rate is high after cessation of successful short-term budesonide therapy in CC, and 61–80% of treated patients will have an early recurrence of symptoms. In clinical practice tapering doses of budesonide to 3–6 mg/day have been used as maintenance therapy and may well control clinical symptoms. The evidence for such a strategy in CC now exists, and two studies have proven that maintenance therapy with budesonide 6 mg/day for six months is well tolerated and superior to placebo. A total of 80 patients, who had responded to open-label budesonide, were randomized to budesonide 6 mg daily or placebo for 6 months. Clinical response was maintained in 33/40 (83%) patients who received budesonide compared to 11/40 (28%) patients who received placebo (P = 0.0002). Pooled odds ratio for maintenance of clinical response with budesonide compared to placebo, was 8.40 (95% CI 2.73–25.81) with a number needed to treat of 2 patients. Histological response was seen in 48% of patients who received budesonide compared to 15% of patients who received placebo (P = 0.002). However, six-month maintenance therapy did not alter the subsequent disease course, as the relapse risk after withdrawal of 24-week maintenance treatment was similar to that observed after 6-week induction therapy, and the median time to relapse was equal in the two groups (39 days versus 38 days).

Prednisolone

Other oral corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, are associated with more frequent side effects, and the efficacy seems inferior to budesonide, although no formal comparative studies are available.

Bismuth subsalicylate

Bismuth subsalicylate has been shown effective in a small, placebo-controlled study including 9 patients with CC and 5 with LC. This drug is not available in a number of countries because of concerns regarding drug toxicity.

Anticoagulants

Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules may alter the anticoagulant effects of warfarin and other oral coumarin anticoagulants. Salicylates may cause an increased risk of bleeding when administered with anticoagulant therapy. Metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, and other oral coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. Tetracycline has been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity. Prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules is administered concomitantly with warfarin. Patients should also be monitored for evidence of bleeding.

Lithium

In patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium, short-term use of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules may cause elevation of serum lithium concentrations and signs of lithium toxicity due to the interaction between metronidazole and lithium. Serum lithium and serum creatinine concentrations should be monitored several days after beginning treatment with Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules to detect any increase that may precede clinical symptoms of lithium toxicity.

Antacids, Multivitamins, or Dairy Products

The absorption of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules may be reduced if administered with antacids containing aluminium, calcium, or magnesium; preparations containing iron, zinc, or sodium bicarbonate; or milk or dairy products due to the interaction between these products and tetracycline. These products should not be consumed concomitantly with Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules. However, the clinical significance of reduced tetracycline systemic exposure is unknown as the relative contribution of systemic versus local antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori has not been established.

Antidiabetic agents, Aspirin, Probenecid, or Sulfinpyrazone

Caution is advised in the administration of bismuth subsalicylate to patients taking medication for diabetes (possible enhanced hypoglycemic effect when given with salicylates) or patients taking aspirin (may increase the risk of salicylate toxicity), probenecid, or sulfinpyrazone (uricosuric effects of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be decreased) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS).

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate on gastrointestinal tolerability in healthy volunteers receiving oral delayed-release dimethyl fumarate: PREVENT, a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^112LPW4P]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Flushing and gastrointestinal (GI) events are commonly associated with the use of delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis.

Methods

PREVENT (A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Pepto-Bismol [Bismuth Subsalicylate] on Gastrointestinal Tolerability in Healthy Volunteers Receiving Oral TECFIDERA [Dimethyl Fumarate] Delayed-Release Capsules Twice Daily) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week study that evaluated the effect of bismuth subsalicylate on DMF-related GI events. Bismuth subsalicylate 524 mg or placebo were administered 30 min before DMF (weeks 1–4). DMF was dosed twice-daily (BID) at 120 mg (week 1) and 240 mg (weeks 2–8). Using an e-diary device, participants recorded GI and flushing events on the Modified Overall Gastrointestinal Symptom Scale once daily for the preceding 24 h. The primary end point was time to first GI-related event. Secondary end points included frequency and severity of GI-related events.

Findings

A total of 175 participants were enrolled (placebo, n = 87; bismuth subsalicylate, n = 88), and 17 discontinued treatment (placebo, n = 8; bismuth subsalicylate n = 9). A total of 146 participants reported ≥ 1 GI event: placebo, n = 72 (82.8%); and bismuth subsalicylate, n = 74 (84.1%). There was no statistical difference in risk of a GI event between the groups (P = 0.8292). Mean (SD) time from DMF initiation to first GI event was similar: placebo, 5.4 (8.73) days; and bismuth subsalicylate, 5.6 (10.87) days. Incidence of flatulence (38.6% vs 50.6%) and diarrhea (36.4% vs 48.2%) during weeks 1–4 was numerically lower in the bismuth subsalicylate group compared with the placebo group. Mean worst severity scores for flatulence (1.1 vs 1.8; P = 0.0219) and diarrhea (1.0 vs 1.6; P = 0.0500) were lower with bismuth subsalicylate than with placebo.

Implications

Although coadministration of bismuth subsalicylate did not affect the occurrence of DMF-related GI events overall, it reduced the severity and incidence of flatulence and diarrhea. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01915901.
