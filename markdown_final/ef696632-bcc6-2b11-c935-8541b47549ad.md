## Question

Florida is starting a promotion where every car that arrives gets one orange per passenger. A family of 4 arrives and gets their oranges. They had planned to stop for a snack later where they would spend $15 in total, but now that they have the oranges they don't have to buy them at the stop. When they get to the stop they see that the oranges would've cost $1.5 each. What percentage of the money they planned to spend did they save instead?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what percentage of the money the family planned to spend they saved by receiving free oranges instead of buying them at the stop. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total planned spending and the per-unit cost of oranges. Then, I should calculate the total value of the oranges received. Next, I will determine the actual savings by comparing the value received to what they would have spent. Finally, I will compute the percentage savings relative to the original planned expenditure and double-check the math to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the key inputs: the family planned to spend $15 total at the snack stop, there are 4 passengers, and each orange would have cost $1.50 if purchased, so the total value of the oranges received is 4 × $1.50 = $6.00. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 4 times 1.5 is indeed 6, so the oranges are worth $6.00 at the stop's price.

> Next, I should calculate the actual savings. Because they no longer need to buy the oranges, the savings equal the market value of the oranges they received, which is $6.00. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not conflating savings with spending; yes, the $6.00 represents the amount they avoid spending, so that is the correct savings figure.

> Now, I will compute the percentage savings relative to the originally planned $15.00. The formula is (savings ÷ planned spending) × 100, so ($6.00 ÷ $15.00) × 100 = 0.40 × 100 = 40%. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 6 divided by 15 might be 30%, but that's not right; 6 divided by 15 is 0.4, which equals 40%, so the correct percentage saved is 40%.

> Final answer: The family saved 40% of the money they had planned to spend at the snack stop by receiving the free oranges instead of purchasing them there.

---

The family saved **40%** of their planned snack spending. Here's how: they received 4 free oranges worth $1.50 each, totaling $6.00 in avoided cost, against a planned $15.00 snack budget. The percentage saved is ($6.00 ÷ $15.00) × 100 = **40%**.

---

## Calculation of savings

- **Number of oranges received**: 4 (one per passenger).
- **Cost per orange at the stop**: $1.50.
- **Total value of oranges received**: 4 × $1.50 = $6.00.
- **Planned snack spending**: $15.00.
- **Percentage saved**: ($6.00 ÷ $15.00) × 100 = 40%.

---

## Conclusion

By receiving the free oranges, the family avoided spending $6.00, which equals **40% of their planned $15.00 snack budget**.

Conclusion

While we have been able to move the discussion in the field from comparing ' apples and oranges ' to maybe comparing ' green apples and red apples ', there is still a need to build consensus around definitions and methodology for costing maternal health services in LMICs. Indeed, as evidenced in our review, with rigorous adjustments made to cost data, there are some patterns emerging and a lot of shared learning on what can be done to increase cost savings and improve efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery in LMICs. As the global community moves forward with planning for and implementing service delivery in the SDG era, in addition to increased call for transparency, consensus around costing methodology is important to improve comparability and increase opportunities for learning and evidence-based resource allocation across countries.

Number of trial sites

The average number of trial sites was significantly higher in medication trials (M = 35.96, SD = 25.16) compared with psychotherapy studies (M = 3.04, SD = 3.13) (t (27.51) = 6.89, p ≤ 0.001). Of those studies with data available, 26 of 28 (93%) medication trials were multisite compared with 24 of 45 (54%) psychotherapy studies.

Comparing the nature and intensity of control conditions in psychotherapy trials

Active conditions featured significantly more sessions compared with control conditions (see table 2). Sessions in active conditions were longer and more frequent, resulting in significantly more intervention hours overall. Notably, many control conditions were very poorly described and their intensity could not be quantified, resulting in missing data. We performed a sensitivity analysis where we excluded trials using waitlist controls; with the exception of the number of sessions, differences between active and control arms were no longer statistically significant though remained substantial (see online supplemental table S9).

### Dietary and economic effects of eliminating shortfall in fruit intake on nutrient intakes and diet cost [^612dfee0]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary intakes of fruit by US children fall far short of national recommendations. The Choose MyPlate recommends consuming between 1.0 to 2.5 cups of fruit per day, depending on age, gender, and physical activity. By contrast, the estimated mean daily intakes for fruit (including 100% fruit juice) for 4–18y olds are about 1 cup per day, though older children consume less. For reference, 1.0 cup of fruit corresponds to a small apple (106 g), large banana (136 g), 32 seedless grapes (160 g), large orange (184 g), 8 large strawberries (166 g) or 1 cup of fruit juice (248 g or 8 fluid ounces). Numerous interventions, in pre-school, school, and family settings have been developed to address the shortfall and fruit consumption and to improve the quality of children's diets, though fruit consumption remains well below recommended levels. Consuming adequate amounts of fruit is important in ensuring nutrient adequacy, particularly for vitamin C, potassium, and dietary fiber, and may also reduce the risk of weight gain due to their low energy density. Furthermore, fruit consumption in childhood predicts fruit consumption in adulthood, which may reduce the risk of some chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease.

Approximately, 40% of total fruit consumed by children comes from 100% fruit juice. The consumption of 100% fruit juice, in observational studies, has been found to be associated with an increased risk of childhood obesity, and some prospective studies among adults have observed that juice consumption is associated with an increased risk of diabetes. One argument is that sugar consumption in the absence of dietary fiber is associated with excess weight gain, liver injury and the metabolic syndrome. To this end, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends 100% fruit juice be limited to 4–6 fl oz for children aged 1–6y and 8–12 fl oz for children 7–18y. The American Heart Association recommends no more than 4–6 fl oz of fruit juice per day and the new food package for the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program reduced 100% juice allowances by half.

### Dietary and economic effects of eliminating shortfall in fruit intake on nutrient intakes and diet cost [^068b3829]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Rather than selecting arbitrary whole fruits and fruit juices for modeling, a composite whole fruit and fruit juice was created based on a weighted estimate using their relative frequency of consumption. For whole fruits, all fresh, canned, frozen and dried fruit that were not part of mixed dishes and consumed by children 4–18y were flagged. For fruit juices, all 100% fruit juices were flagged. The number of times each item was reported was used to derive a weight for the composite fruit (e.g. fresh apples were consumed 426 times and had a weight of 0.223). The most important whole fruits were apples (weight = 0.223), bananas (0.145), oranges (0.097), grapes (0.095), and strawberries (0.067). While canned, frozen and dried fruit are lower-cost fruit sources, they were infrequently consumed (e.g. their collective weight was 0.12). The fruit juices most heavily weighted in the composite fruit juice were orange juice without calcium (weight = 0.270), orange juice with calcium (0.196), apple juice (0.191), fruit juice blends (0.153), and grape juice (0.051).

### Effects of socioeconomic position and clinical risk factors on spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth [^dd0fc343]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Annual after-tax family income for each woman (in the year of delivery) was based on the T1 Family Files and adjusted for family size. The latter calculation was carried out by dividing the total family income by the weighted number of family members. Weights were based on a standard formula (the oldest adult in the family received a weight of 1, other members 16 years or older and the first child in a single parent family received a weight of 0.4, and children under 16 years received a weight of 0.3). Family income was also adjusted for inflation (expressed in 1988 Canadian dollars) and categorized to yield five approximately equal groups. The quintile with the lowest family income was then further subdivided (in order to obtain a potentially more vulnerable group) and this resulted in a total of six family income categories (< $4,430, $4,430–$6,529, $6,530–$11,914, $11,915–$17,584, $17,585–$24,949, and ≥ $24,950). Contribution to a retirement savings plan (RSP, a tax-deductible investment) in the year of delivery was also examined as a second measure of socioeconomic position. This measure was used as an indicator of behavior related to tax-planning and long-term saving and was expected to reflect a dimension of socioeconomic status that was distinct from family income.

The determinants of BPCR actions with and without male partner involvement

Table 3 provides descriptive information about the number and percentage of women who conducted BPCR, either with or without their male partner. Of the four elements of birth preparedness planning, saving money was the most common, with close to 70% of the women reporting that their partner was involved in saving money with them. Fewer than 60% of women reported that their male partners were involved during their last pregnancy in any of the other three BPCR actions examined: arranging transport, deciding on a birth companion, or choosing the delivery site.

### Transportation costs impede sustained adherence and access to HAART in a clinic population in southwestern Uganda: a qualitative study [^a5d87df9]. AIDS and Behavior (2010). Low credibility.

I plan that as the month begins I have to first earn 16,000 shillings for transport to the clinic to pick up the medicine… I always have a store, and every time I am selling, I am always planning for the month that's coming. I always make sure to save enough… You cannot really be able to determine how much money you will earn in a day and therefore how much will be saved per day, but I always try to save 500 shillings per day when the circumstances allow it.

Many respondents talked about borrowing transportation money from family, friends, and social clubs or organizations as one way they managed to access funds for clinic visits and other expenses. And those with assets reported that they sometimes had to sell their assets in order to afford transport costs, among other expenses. A 44-year-old widower with four children explained: "I just sold a piece of my plantation to my brother and was using that money for transport here, and to pay for credit, and take care of some home basics."

### End-of-life care in black and white: race matters for medical care of dying patients and their families [^aafae0c2]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the end-of-life medical care experienced by African-American and white decedents and their families.

Design

Cross-sectional, retrospective survey with weighted results based on a two-stage probability sampling design.

Setting

Hospitals, nursing homes, and home-based medical services across the United States.

Participants

Surrogates (N = 1,447; primarily family members) for decedents from 22 states.

Measurements

Validated end-of-life care outcomes concerning symptom management, decision-making, informing and supporting families, individualized care, coordination, service utilization, and financial impact.

Results

Family members of African-American decedents were less likely than those of white decedents to rate the care received as excellent or very good (odds ratio (OR) = 0.4). They were more likely to report absent (OR = 2.4) or problematic (OR = 1.9) physician communication, concerns with being informed (OR = 2.5), and concerns with family support (OR = 2.6). Family members of African Americans were less likely than those of whites to report that the decedent had treatment wishes (OR = 0.3) or written advance care planning documents (OR = 0.4). These differences persist when limiting the sample to respondents whose expectations for life-sustaining treatments matched treatments received. Family members of African-American decedents also were more likely to report financial hardship due to savings depletion (OR = 2.1) or difficulty paying for care (OR = 2.0) and that family/friends (OR = 2.0) or home health workers (OR = 1.9) provided home care.

Conclusion

This national study brings evidence that racial disparities persist into end-of-life care, particularly regarding communication and family needs. Results also suggest different home care patterns and levels of financial impact.

### Policy framework for covering preventive services without cost sharing: saving lives and saving money? [^cd689aca]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The US Affordable Care Act mandates that private insurers cover a list of preventive services without cost sharing. The list is determined by 4 expert committees that evaluate the overall health effect of preventive services. We analyzed the process by which the expert committees develop their recommendations. Each committee uses different criteria to evaluate preventive services and none of the committees consider cost systematically. We propose that the existing committees adopt consistent evidence review methodologies and expand the scope of preventive services reviewed and that a separate advisory committee be established to integrate economic considerations into the final selection of free preventive services. The comprehensive framework and associated criteria are intended to help policy makers in the future develop a more evidence-based, consistent, and ethically sound approach.

### The patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS): can we finally compare apples to oranges? [^400ce8f5]. Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Legacy patient-reported outcome mea`sures lack standardization, resulting in difficulty comparing the results of diverse clinical outcome studies: "You can't compare apples to oranges". To address this concern, the National Institutes of Health initiated the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to assess common dimensions of a wide range of diseases. PROMIS uses computer adaptive testing: A fluid questionnaire chooses subsequent questions based on the responses to previous questions to efficiently characterize outcomes using only 4 to 6 questions. This greatly reduces survey fatigue. Research correlating PROMIS to legacy measures is of value. For now, some questions may require more information than PROMIS can provide, in which case legacy measures could be preferred. In the future, developing and adding a utility score to PROMIS could assess "value" and allow decision analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses for diverse health interventions. In the end, PROMIS may allow us to compare apples to oranges.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of hospital infection control response to an epidemic respiratory virus threat [^a0bcce77]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Figure 4
Sensitivity analysis for case-fatality rate (black line), % exposure reduction (red line), and secondary attack rate (blue line). Exponential graphs show poor cost-effectiveness at extremes of low case-fatality rate and low transmissibility (high % exposure reduction and low secondary attack rate).

To determine the impact of hospital size on our model, we modeled our simulation on the nation's other tertiary hospital with 1,500 beds using their actual cost records. The model estimates that 10 expected deaths in the outbreak would be reduced to 1 death under Green Alert and none in Yellow and Orange Alerts. The incremental cost/death averted is $32,000, $1.9 million, and $5.4 million when moving from Green to Yellow to Orange, respectively. Although the cost ranking is consistent with that predicted by base-case simulation, the actual incremental cost index is much higher, reflecting the higher cost for activating alert status in a bigger hospital.

### The role of peer victimization in the physical activity and screen time of adolescents: a cross-sectional study [^dc38502d]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Because adolescents are not necessarily aware of their household income and the education levels of their parents, weekly spending money and future education plans were used as indicators of personal economic status. Adolescents whose parents have attained a higher education tend to have a higher disposable income in terms of weekly allowance and job income, and weekly spending money has been shown to be positively associated with vigorous exercise and watching TV among adolescents. Research in Norway found that plans for higher education were highly stable across adolescence, and the participants' educational plans tended to correspond well with their parents education. Weekly spending money was assessed with the question "About how much money do you usually get each week to spend on yourself or to save?", and included money from allowances and jobs like babysitting and delivering papers. To be consistent with other COMPASS studies, and in order to retain as many cases as possible, this variable was collapsed into "zero", "$1–20", "$21–100", " > $100", and "don't know". Future education plans was assessed with the question "What is the highest level of education you think you will get?" with six response options including completed high school or less; college/trade/vocational certificate; university bachelor's degree; university master's/PhD/law school/medical school/teachers' college degree; and I don't know.

Economic Outcomes

Compared with SARS-CoV-2‒negative workers who had ILI, SARS-CoV-2‒positive workers had greater self-reported lost income (median US $127.10 vs. $0; p < 0.01), and combined (healthcare, transportation, lost wages) total cost (US $147.90 vs. US $12.70; p < 0.01) at day 7 (reported over the preceding 2 weeks) (Figure 5). Workers infected with SARS-CoV-2 also had more days of work absence (p < 0.01); most (81.8%) had > 5 days of work absence. Household expenditures on fruits/vegetables were higher at day 7 for SARS-CoV-2‒positive workers vs. SARS-CoV-2‒negative workers who had ILI (US $19.50 vs. US $13.00; p < 0.01). Differences for all other household expenditures between SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and test-negative workers were not statistically significant.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^00cf701b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness threshold for U.S. clinical guidelines — the writing committee "recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines," with the threshold to be "periodically reexamined," "not be adjusted annually for inflation," and "revised every 10 years (or sooner…)." Supporting estimates include a 2024 Personal Consumption Expenditure update that "suggests a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY," a welfare economics approach indicating willingness to pay tied to income ("per capita disposable income of $60 300… approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY"), and a population-level framework using World Bank data estimating "$95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY," translating to "$112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY" after GDP growth; while "no single method… can be considered the 'gold standard,'" these three approaches "produced similar results."

### Effect of escalating financial incentive rewards on maintenance of weight loss: a randomized clinical trial [^93c989a0]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Identifying effective strategies for treating obesity is a public health priority.

Objective

To test an escalating lottery-based incentive tied to daily self-weighing for weight loss maintenance.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This 2-phase, 2-arm randomized clinical trial enrolled participants aged 30 to 80 years with an initial body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30.0 to 45.0 who lost at least 5 kg during 4 to 6 months in a national online weight management program. Study investigators and outcomes assessors were blinded to participant groups. Data were collected and analyzed from May 23, 2016, through November 13, 2017, based on intention to treat.

Interventions

All participants were advised to weigh themselves daily, with a goal of 6 or more days per week, and received text messaging feedback on their performance. Incentive group participants were eligible for a lottery-based incentive worth an expected value of $3.98 in week 1 that escalated by $0.43 each week they achieved their self-weighing goal during months 1 to 6 (phase 1), followed by no incentives during months 7 to 12 (phase 2).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was weight change at the end of phase 1. Secondary outcomes included weight change at the end of phase 2 and changes in self-reported physical activity and eating behaviors.

Results

A total of 258 participants (128 in the incentive group and 130 in the control group) had a mean (SD) age of 48.0 (10.5) years and mean (SD) body mass index of 32.1 (3.9); 225 (87.2%) were women; 235 (91.1%) were white; and 102 (39.5%) had an annual income of at least $100 000. Weight measurement was transmitted by 250 participants (96.9%) at 6 months and 227 (88.0%) at 12 months. The percentage of weeks that incentive and control participants achieved a mean self-weighing of at least 6 times was 85.3% vs 75.8%, respectively (P = 0.002) in phase 1 and 37.7% vs 50.2%, respectively (P = 0.009) in phase 2. Mean weight changes at the end of phase 1 were -1.1 (95% CI, -2.1 to -0.1) kg in the incentive group and -1.9 (95% CI, -2.9 to -0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.7 (95% CI, -0.7 to 2.2) kg (P = 0.30 for comparison). At the end of phase 2, mean weight changes were 0.2 (95% CI, -1.2 to 1.7) kg in the incentive group and -0.6 (95% CI, -2.0 to 0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.8 (95% CI, -1.2 to 2.8) kg (P = 0.41 for comparison).

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with an active control condition of weekly messages, escalating lottery-based incentives transiently increased rates of self-weighing but did not significantly enhance weight loss maintenance.

Trial Registration

### Health and economic effects of introducing single-dose or two-dose human papillomavirus vaccination in India [^386bcece]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Sensitivity analyses

Valuing costs in $IUSD instead of US$ resulted in ICERs more favourable towards vaccination (online supplemental figure B.13–B.17). In the cost sensitivity analyses, we found that a 6% discount rate would substantially increase the ICER from US$406 in the base-case scenario to US$2513 per DALY averted (figure 5). Decreasing the treatment costs by 50%, or increasing implementation or delivery costs by 50%, resulted in an increase in the ICER to US$684 or 596 per DALY averted, respectively. When we assumed that vaccine price would drop at a rate of 2% per year, the ICER would decrease to US$127 per DALY averted.

Taking uncertainty in model parameters and cost variables into account via probabilistic analysis, we estimated that single-dose HPV vaccination had approximately 77% probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of 30% of the Indian GDP per capita. Only 1% of the sampled ICERs were above the WHO threshold. By contrast, in 13% of the draws, single-dose vaccination was cost saving (figure 6, online supplemental figure B.12 for INR results).

Every point above this line is a point where the intervention was not cost-effective.

### Health technology assessment of new retinal treatments; the need to capture healthcare capacity issues [^255c44c9]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

In order to better demonstrate this issue, we have broadly conceptualised these alternative perspectives in a simple hypothetical example presented in Fig. 1. In the first panel of the Figure (Fig. 1A), we demonstrate a standard, budget-constrained approach under which the orange shaded area represents the number of avoided injections due to the use of a new treatment with lower treatment frequency than standard of care. In this approach one would attach costs to both the current and new treatments and the reduced number of injections associated with the new treatment would be captured when calculating the difference in costs between the treatments (net cost). By combining this with data on patients' outcomes under both treatments one would determine the relative or incremental value of the new treatment. In the second panel (Fig. 1B) we demonstrate an approach which includes a capacity perspective, where the orange shaded area again represents the number of avoided injections due to the use of a new treatment and where the blue shaded area represents the number of required injections that might be foregone with standard of care due to a capacity ceiling being reached. The orange shaded area would again be captured in the calculation of net costs but in this case the blue shaded area would be captured as a difference in patient outcomes and resultant impact on longer term healthcare and societal costs. That is, using randomised trial and/or real-world data one can translate the foregone injections into service disruptions and a resultant increase in vision loss. Service disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic have provided an ideal opportunity for the generation of evidence of this nature, with several studies demonstrating greater visions loss among nAMD, DME and RVO patients who experience delays than those who did not. Notably, Greenlee et al. found that among nAMD patients who experienced treatment lapses of ≥ 3 months the deficits in visual acuity did not improve following resumption of treatment. As noted above, these poorer outcomes are likely to have substantial impact on the quality of life of patients and their management is likely to lead to increased future costs to the healthcare system and society as whole. As such, it would appear that more durable treatments are likely be undervalued if capacity constraints are not accurately reflected in economic evaluations.

### Effect of financial incentives and default options on food choices of adults with low income in online retail settings: a randomized clinical trial [^b4fa42df]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Despite recent growth in online redemption of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, no previous work has tested the impact of economic and behavioral economic strategies on food purchasing behaviors in an online grocery retail setting among adults with low income.

Objective

To examine the extent to which financial incentives and default shopping cart options influence fruit and vegetable purchases.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial used an experimental online grocery store for adults who currently or have ever received SNAP benefits. From October 7 to December 2, 2021, participants were instructed to shop for a week's worth of groceries for their household, with a budget tailored to household size; no payment was taken.

Interventions

Random assignment to 1 of 4 conditions: no intervention, 50% discount on eligible fruits and vegetables, prefilled shopping carts with tailored fruit and vegetable items (ie, default options), or a combination of the discount and default options.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the percentage of nondiscounted dollars spent on eligible fruit and vegetables per basket.

Results

Of 2744 participants, mean (SD) age was 46.7 (16.0) years, and 1447 (52.7%) identified as women. A total of 1842 participants (67.1%) reported currently receiving SNAP benefits and 1492 (54.4%) reported shopping online for groceries in the previous 12 months. Participants spent a mean (SD) 20.5% (23.5%) of total dollars on eligible fruits and vegetables. Compared with no intervention, those in the discount condition spent 4.7% (98.3% CI, 1.7%-7.7%) of more total dollars on eligible fruits and vegetables; those in the default condition, 7.8% (98.3% CI, 4.8%-10.7%) more; and those in the combination condition, 13.0% (98.3% CI, 10.0%-16.0%) more (P < .001 for all). There was no difference between the discount and the default conditions (P = 0.06), but the effect in the combination condition was significantly larger than both discount and default conditions (P < .001). Default shopping cart items were purchased by 679 participants (93.4%) in the default condition and 655 (95.5%) in the combination condition, whereas 297 (45.8%) in the control and 361 (52.9%) in the discount conditions purchased those items (P < .001). No variation was observed by age, sex, or race and ethnicity, and results were similar when those who reported never shopping online for groceries were excluded.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, financial incentives for fruits and vegetables and default options, especially in combination, led to meaningful increases in online fruit and vegetable purchases among adults with low income.

### Financing transformative health systems towards achievement of the health sustainable development goals: a model for projected resource needs in 67 low-income and middle-income countries [^c272e023]. The Lancet: Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

The ambitious development agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires substantial investments across several sectors, including for SDG 3 (healthy lives and wellbeing). No estimates of the additional resources needed to strengthen comprehensive health service delivery towards the attainment of SDG 3 and universal health coverage in low-income and middle-income countries have been published.

Methods

We developed a framework for health systems strengthening, within which population-level and individual-level health service coverage is gradually scaled up over time. We developed projections for 67 low-income and middle-income countries from 2016 to 2030, representing 95% of the total population in low-income and middle-income countries. We considered four service delivery platforms, and modelled two scenarios with differing levels of ambition: a progress scenario, in which countries' advancement towards global targets is constrained by their health system's assumed absorptive capacity, and an ambitious scenario, in which most countries attain the global targets. We estimated the associated costs and health effects, including reduced prevalence of illness, lives saved, and increases in life expectancy. We projected available funding by country and year, taking into account economic growth and anticipated allocation towards the health sector, to allow for an analysis of affordability and financial sustainability.

Findings

We estimate that an additional $274 billion spending on health is needed per year by 2030 to make progress towards the SDG 3 targets (progress scenario), whereas US$371 billion would be needed to reach health system targets in the ambitious scenario — the equivalent of an additional $41 (range 15–102) or $58 (22–167) per person, respectively, by the final years of scale-up. In the ambitious scenario, total health-care spending would increase to a population-weighted mean of $271 per person (range 74–984) across country contexts, and the share of gross domestic product spent on health would increase to a mean of 7·5% (2·1–20·5). Around 75% of costs are for health systems, with health workforce and infrastructure (including medical equipment) as the main cost drivers. Despite projected increases in health spending, a financing gap of $20–54 billion per year is projected. Should funds be made available and used as planned, the ambitious scenario would save 97 million lives and significantly increase life expectancy by 3·1–8·4 years, depending on the country profile.

Interpretation

All countries will need to strengthen investments in health systems to expand service provision in order to reach SDG 3 health targets, but even the poorest can reach some level of universality. In view of anticipated resource constraints, each country will need to prioritise equitably, plan strategically, and cost realistically its own path towards SDG 3 and universal health coverage.

### Return on investment: medical savings of an employer-sponsored digital intensive lifestyle intervention, weight loss [^954858dc]. Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The study was reviewed and exempted by the UnitedHealth Group Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the exemption was received on the basis of criteria outlined in Title 45, Part 46.101 of the Code of Federal Regulations. This retrospective, quasiexperimental study focused on calculating the total medical expenditures, inclusive of medical conditions covered under health plan benefits and insurer and study participant responsibility, relative to the cost of the ILI (i.e. the ROI). A difference‐in‐differences (DID) design compared preintervention and postintervention medical expenditures for participants who enrolled and participated in the program for at least one session with participants who enrolled in the program but did not participate (for even one session).

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of hospital infection control response to an epidemic respiratory virus threat [^fa254262]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

In our model, we have shown that cost-effectiveness ratio is dependent on the interplay between exposure rate, transmissibility (secondary attack rate), case-fatality rate, and risk of transmission from atypical cases. Infectious diseases with high fatality rates and transmission from atypical cases (such as SARS) will need the full benefit of PPE to reduce mortality rates. This finding is reflected in Orange Alert having a better cost-effectiveness ratio than Yellow Alert. Mild diseases with low fatality rates, such as pandemic (H1N1) 2009, and low incidence of atypical or subclinical infectious cases have the best cost-effectiveness ratio at Green Alert provided surveillance measures are able to identify infected patients and isolate them early. The cost-effectiveness ratio increases exponentially after that due to the much higher costs incurred. However, although Yellow Alert comes at a heavier price tag, it effectively averts any deaths. Activating Orange Alert increases cost with minimal benefit in mortality rate reduction. In reality, our model suggests that parallel efforts in contact tracing and voluntary quarantine may further reduce the exposure rate and break the chain of transmission.

Our base model took into account only direct costs associated with each alert status. In real situations, indirect costs such as lost revenues from cancellation of elective surgeries to free up hospital resources, decreased elective admissions and outpatient attendances, administrative costs associated with senior staff meetings, and lost clinical teaching time, add up to more than the direct costs and would magnify the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio further. In fact, if direct and indirect costs were included in the modeling, the incremental cost/death averted ratio of moving from Yellow Alert to Orange in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 increased to a staggering $8–$81 million for both hospitals. Although these indirect costs are not part of the infection control process per se, surge capacity response plans to ensure that the healthcare system has the reserve capacity to react to a full-blown community outbreak are critical to all pandemic plans and contribute serious costs to the hospital.

### Financial literacy in orthopaedic surgery residents: a COERG survey [^8af4186c]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

We found significant difference in test results based on existing credit card debt, retirement savings status, and childhood annual household income. Fewer than 15% of our respondents reported credit card debt. However, those that carried credit card debt had lower quiz score results. Credit card debt can be situational, but it may also represent unhealthy financial practices. This finding suggests a link between unhealthy financial practices (credit card debt) and lower financial knowledge. The opposite pattern was also found. Those who grew up in higher income families and with parents of higher education status displayed higher financial literacy. This finding correlates with previous literature, as studies have shown that early exposure to healthy financial practice and education leads to healthy fiscal practice and improved financial security.

Orthopaedic residents with retirement savings scored significantly higher on the financial literacy quiz than those who had not begun saving for retirement, suggesting that those engaged in their financial situation with an active role in planning for the future display greater financial literacy. Interestingly, most orthopaedic residents practice healthy spending habits while in residency, as over two-thirds reported spending less than their income in a given year. Over 75% reported no difficulty covering monthly expenses, and almost 85% have an emergency fund with an ability to come up with $2,000 in a given month, suggesting that respondents demonstrate self-awareness about spending habits and can save money while in residency. However, less than half of respondents have begun saving for retirement, which may suggest that many residents may be deferring the planning of their financial futures until their training is completed. These are valuable years for establishing future savings, as time is one of the most useful tools for tax-free growth vehicles (like Roth IRAs) that have the potential for compounding growth over decades. As educational institutions, it would seem logical to provide the necessary resources and knowledge to engage residents in planning their financial futures. Furthermore, given the link between student debt and burnout, teaching residents to positively contribute to their financial health may quell the symptoms of burnout as it relates to financial stressors.

### Resource allocation strategies to increase the efficiency and sustainability of gavi's health system strengthening grants [^636f01d7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Questionnaires

We visited a sample of health areas, districts, and facilities and collected data on Gavi HSS grant implementation using questionnaires (Q) developed based on HSS activities. The Gavi HSS grant proposes different activities for the central, regional, district and health facility levels (Tables, Supplemental Digital Content 1 and 2;). Qs were developed to assess and verify the implementation of all activities at each of the 4 levels during the field visits. Stakeholders at the central, regional and district levels interviewed through the KII technique were the same as those interviewed using these standardized Qs. Table 1 represents study participants by category and method of data collection.

Data collection was completed face-to-face during June–July 2015, and September–October 2015 in Chad and Cameroon, respectively. Collected data were transferred electronically to a secure server. Verbal consent was obtained at the beginning of each interview and both studies were deemed exempt from institutional review board approval. Data from KIIs were analyzed through recursive abstraction.

Quantitative Methods

Financial Analysis

We analyzed HSS grant disbursements by comparing budgets to expenditures. Each Gavi HSS grant proposal includes an original budget for funds expenditure over the duration of the program. During each funding year, the country submits a planned budget for the upcoming year within the Annual Progress Report. This planned budget can include variations of < 15% from the originally proposed budget, as well as details of the expenditures that occurred during the last year. A financial analysis (FA) was conducted to compare proposed expenditures in the HSS grant proposal budget, planned expenditures in the Gavi HSS annual progress reports and actual expenditures. This allowed us to assess adherence to the expenditures in proposed and approved budgets. – For each category of expenditures, we calculated percent deviation from the proposed budget and summed all changes.

Root-cause Analysis

Data generated from all quantitative and qualitative methods were triangulated through a root-cause analysis, a particularly useful approach in the study of complex interventions like HSS. – We investigated the chain of events and situations that increased the effort and time required to implement the HSS program, decreased the value of the funds spent and hindered the sustainability of the implemented activities and gains achieved.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^4f494f4f]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Contemporary debates about drug pricing feature several widely held misconceptions, including the relationship between incentives and innovation, the proportion of total healthcare spending on pharmaceuticals, and whether the economic evaluation of a medicine can be influenced by things other than clinical efficacy.

Main Body

All citizens should have access to timely, equitable, and cost-effective care covered by public funds, private insurance, or a combination of both. Better managing the collective burden of diseases borne by today's and future generations depends in part on developing better technologies, including better medicines. As in any innovative industry, the expectation of adequate financial returns incentivizes innovators and their investors to develop new medicines. Estimating expected returns requires that they forecast revenues, based on the future price trajectory and volume of use over time. How market participants decide what price to set or accept can be complicated, and some observers and stakeholders want to confirm whether the net prices society pays for novel medicines, whether as a reward for past innovation or an incentive for future innovation, are commensurate with those medicines' incremental value. But we must also ask "value to whom?"; medicines not only bring immediate clinical benefits to patients treated today, but also can provide a broad spectrum of short- and long-term benefits to patients, their families, and society. Spending across all facets of healthcare has grown over the last 25 years, but both inpatient and outpatient spending has outpaced drug spending growth even as our drug armamentarium is constantly improving with safer and more effective medicines. In large part, this is because, unlike hospitals, drugs typically go generic, thus making room in our budgets for new and better ones, even as they often keep patients out of hospitals, driving further savings.

Conclusion

A thorough evaluation of drug spending and value can help to promote a better allocation of healthcare resources for both the healthy and the sick, both of whom must pay for healthcare. Taking a holistic approach to assessing drug value makes it clear that a branded drug's value to a patient is often only a small fraction of the drug's total value to society. Societal value merits consideration when determining whether and how to make a medicine affordable and accessible to patients: a drug that is worth its price to society should not be rendered inaccessible to ill patients by imposing high out-of-pocket costs or restricting coverage based on narrow health technology assessments (HTAs). Furthermore, recognizing the total societal cost of un- or undertreated conditions is crucial to gaining a thorough understanding of what guides the biomedical innovation ecosystem to create value for society. It would be unwise to discourage the development of new solutions without first appreciating the cost of leaving the problems unsolved.

### Triple return on investment: the cost and impact of 13 interventions that could prevent stillbirths and save the lives of mothers and babies in South Africa [^3ccfbd39]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Costs and cost-effectiveness

The baseline cost in 2014 for the 13 interventions was estimated at US$330 million (about US$6.2 per capita). This includes US$290 million for stillbirth specific interventions and US$35 million for maternal and newborn health interventions. If these interventions were scaled to full coverage, with the default family planning scale up of 70%, the total cost of these interventions would be US$380 million (US$7 per capita) in 2030. When the CPR is increased to 75% and 80%, the total costs in 2030 reduce to US$300 million (US$5.7 per capita) and US$230 million (US$4.3 per capita), respectively.

Table 5 presents the additional costs, effects and cost-effectiveness of interventions for stillbirths and maternal and newborn health with default family planning scale up. All of the interventions are highly cost effective (ICERs below US$7 500). Among the interventions for stillbirths, hypertensive disease case management has the lowest ICER (US$1) while diabetes case management has the highest (US$746). Neonatal resuscitation has the lowest ICER (US$2) among the interventions with specific impact for mothers and newborns. The most additional resources are required for labor and delivery management, at approximately US$20 million.

### Effects of public financing of essential maternal and child health interventions across wealth quintiles in Nigeria: an extended cost-effectiveness analysis [^c3f6fde7]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Table 5
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from public financing of 18 maternal, newborn, and child health interventions in Nigeria, disaggregated by income quintile (2019–30)

Sensitivity analysis found that when the total fertility rate increased by 10%, the national estimates of deaths averted and private expenditure averted increased by around 9·6% and when total fertility rate decreased by 10% estimates of deaths averted and private expenditure averted decreased by around 9·6%, with little variation across quintiles. ICERs would remain almost the same (appendix p 24). If we assume that all quintiles have the national average total fertility rate, the total number of deaths averted would decrease by 5·1% and private expenditure by 4·5%, with substantial variation among the different quintiles and the ICER would increase by 0·6% (appendix p 24). Sensitivity analysis of discount rates found that if a 3% discount was applied, the private expenditure averted and the ICER would increase by 30·9% with little variation across quintiles. The ICER for discount rates at 3%, 5% and 10% would be $3071, $3645, and $5573 per life-year saved, respectively (appendix p 25). Sensitivity analysis of scale-up costs found that if scale-up cost increased or decreased by 10%, it would lead to about 8·3% increase or decrease in ICER, respectively, while total lives saved and private expenditure averted would remain stable (appendix p 26). If scale-up rate was 4% per year, 15·1% fewer deaths would be averted and there would be a 15·6% decrease in private expenditure averted. By contrast, if scale-up rate was 6% per year, the total number of deaths averted would increase by 19·3% and private expenditure averted would increase by 16·5% (appendix p 27).

### Use of health savings accounts among US adults enrolled in high-deductible health plans [^ed69cb85]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Savings Among HDHP Enrollees Who Had an HSA

Of those with an HSA who did contribute money into their account in the last 12 months, the most frequent level of contribution was $2000 or more (46.7% [95% CI, 41.2%-52.2%]). For most individuals who contributed to their HSA (59.4% [95% CI, 54.5%-64.2%]), the HSA was the only place they saved for health care (Figure 3). Another 21.4% (95% CI, 17.6%-25.8%) of those who put money into their HSA used another vehicle to save for health care (eg, a flexible spending account or bank account) in addition to their HSA.

### Economic analysis of health care interventions [^359e59a1]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

According to US government statistics, health care expenditures approached $2 trillion in 2005 or $6,697/person, with spending expected to exceed $4.1 trillion by 2016 (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/). Total Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spending (including Medicaid, State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and Medicare) was $660.7 million in 2005. Despite the decline in the growth rate of health care spending growth over the past 4 years, health care spending increased 6.9% from 2004 to 2005 and was 16% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2005 and forecasted to be 19.6% of the GDP by 2016. Although the percentage of GDP may not concern providers of health care products or services, it has an affect on the rest of the economy. Spending on health care by employers or patients increases the cost of the products produced, making goods produced here in the United States less attractive to world markets in the age of globalization in addition to leaving less money for patients to spend on other goods and services or save.

### Dietary and economic effects of eliminating shortfall in fruit intake on nutrient intakes and diet cost [^294efe98]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The results of modeling to meet the total fruit shortfall among all children (n = 2,647) and children with a shortfall in fruit consumption (n = 1,781) are shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. Data are presented for all children and by age group. Among all children and those with a shortfall in fruit intake, the average shortfall was 0.75 (95% CI 0.71, 0.80) and 1.09 servings (95% CI 1.06, 1.12), respectively. First, meeting total fruit guidelines by whole fruit (WF) alone or a combination of fruit juice and whole fruit (FJ + WF) would increase total energy intakes by no more than 6% or less than 100 kcal/d, with the WF + FJ model resulting in greater increases in total energy than the WF model. In the FJ + WF model, vitamin C, dietary fiber, calcium and potassium increased by +61% (+48 mg/d), +4.7% (+0.7 g/d), +7.9% (+85 mg/d), and +11.7% (264 mg/d) respectively. In the WF model vitamin C, dietary fiber, calcium and potassium increased by +29% (23 mg/d), +16% (+2.2 g/d), +1.3% (+14 mg/d), and +9.0% (+203 mg/d), respectively. When comparing the impacts of the two models to each other, the FJ + WF model resulted in significant increases in vitamin C (+25.1% [95% CI 22.2, 27.9], comparing WF + FJ to the FJ model), and modest increases in calcium (6.5% [95% CI 5.9, 7.1) and potassium (2.5% [95% CI 2.3, 2.7]), while the WF model resulted in 9.5% (95% CI 8.7, 10.3) lower dietary fiber. The FJ + WF model resulted in a 5.2% (95% CI 4.7, 5.7%) increase in diet costs, while the WF model resulted in a 9.9% increase (95% CI 9.0, 10.8%). Comparing the two models to each other, the WF + FJ model resulted in a 4.3% (95% CI 3.9, 4.6) decrease in diet cost when compared to the WF model. In general, results were similar across age groups (shown in Table 2) and when stratified by race/ethnicity and family income (data not shown).

### Financial incentive strategies for maintenance of weight loss: results from an internet-based randomized controlled trial [^596b3659]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Participants were considered at goal each day their transmitted weight was equal to or less than their goal weight for that week. Participants in the direct payment condition were eligible to receive US$2.80 each day their transmitted weight was at goal. For example, a participant who chose a weekly goal of −0.5 lb a week and succeeded in achieving their goal weight each day for 12 weeks would earn US$2.80 for 7 days a week for 12 weeks for a total of US$235. Participants in the lottery condition were eligible for a chance to win a daily prize each day their transmitted weight was at goal. Eligible lottery participants had an 18 in 100 chance of winning US$10 and 1 in 100 chance of winning US$100 for an expected value of US$2.80 per day. For example, a participant who chose a weekly goal of −0.5 lb a week and remained at goal weight each day for 12 weeks might win the small lottery 14 times and the large lottery once for a total of US$240. If a participant's lottery number was chosen but the participant did not transmit a weight or weight was above goal that day, a text message was sent indicating that the participant would have won the lottery if requirements had been met, an approach designed to induce anticipated regret and increase motivation. The monetary amount of US$2.80 per day was based on prior research demonstrating efficacy for weight loss.

In both incentive conditions, participants received their winnings via check every 3 months. The amount participants actually received depended on their in-person weight measurement at 3 and 6 months, respectively, relative to their goals. In other words, a participant 100% of the way toward the goal received the full winnings, but a participant 50% toward the goal received 50% of the winnings. For the direct arm example participant above who chose the −0.5 lb goal for 12 weeks, the expected weight loss would be 6 lbs; if the participant's in-person weight at the 3-month time point was only down 4 lbs, the participant would receive 4/6ths or 75% x US$135 = US$101.25. All participants were allowed to keep the scales and were compensated up to US$160 for participation in the study (US$30 for the visit at 3 and 9 months; US$50 for the visit at 6 and 12 months).

### Assessing the impacts of COVID-19 vaccination programme's timing and speed on health benefits, cost-effectiveness, and relative affordability in 27 African countries [^c5946480]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Model parameterisation and vaccine roll-out scenarios setup. (a) Observed vaccine uptake among African Union member states. Each line represents a country, and its colour indicates the roll-out rate levels (orange - slow; red - medium; blue - fast). (b) Vaccine supply trajectories of 36 vaccine roll-out scenarios (12 programmes starting date × 3 roll-out rates) and the population level vaccine coverage levels they realise

Vaccine roll-out rate was defined as the number of doses administered per million population-day. In this study, we varied this parameter along three levels: 275, 826, and 2066 doses/million population-day (hereafter 'slow', 'medium', and 'fast', respectively). These levels were derived from observed vaccine roll-out trajectories using a univariable linear model (cumulative doses per million population-day ~ date) and represent the median vaccine roll-out rates by tertile observed among African Union members.

The vaccine roll-out scenarios combining these two parameters (n = 12 start dates × 3 roll-out rates) are visualised in Fig. 1 b (age-specific example presented in Additional File 1: Fig. S1). We capped the maximum population-level vaccine coverage at 70%, consistent with the target set by the WHO and the Africa CDC. Assuming a two-dose schedule for COVID-19 vaccines, a country with a population size of n will receive a maximum of 1.4n doses of vaccines, likely via early and fast roll-out scenarios.

Older adults (60 + years of age) were prioritised in the vaccine roll-out process based on international guidelines and common practices observed in the region. In the transmission model, older adults were also characterised by higher susceptibility, higher percentages of infection showing symptoms, and high percentages of infections progressing to severe, critical, and fatal outcomes.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^b48bf60b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Research considerations for screening for pregnancy intention in diabetes — study designs and priority outcomes — are specified: "Direct evidence from pragmatic RCTs is needed to evaluate the benefit of the intervention of a screening question in individuals with diabetes who could become pregnant. Implementation studies are also needed." Suggested evaluations include changes in rates of "1) contraception prescription or referral to a family planning clinic, 2) referral for PCC, 3) unplanned pregnancy, 4) HbA1c at first prenatal visit, and 5) congenital malformations," and assessing whether paired screening questions increase contraception use and decrease HbA1c at the first prenatal visit. Further priorities include "comparing the outcomes of interest and associated costs/savings" across automated reminder/communication approaches, testing "different models of screening (eg, annually)" and "ideal healthcare settings (eg, primary care, urgent care)," and "Addressing the knowledge gap of endocrinologists and primary care clinicians regarding safe and effective contraceptive prescribing."

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of hospital infection control response to an epidemic respiratory virus threat [^5e15f0c7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Epidemic simulation. A) Base case simulation assuming no protection over 30 days (n = 7,500). B) Number of deaths for pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Spanish influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with different levels of alert status.

Figure 3
Incremental cost/death for 3 viruses with different alert status. Incremental cost to avert 1 additional death moving through ascending levels of alert status. Cost-effectiveness increases exponentially for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 while maintaining an almost linear fashion for both Spanish influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The incremental cost/death averted ratio is lower for Alert Orange compared to Alert Yellow for SARS.

Simulation for Spanish influenza showed a decreased number of deaths from 31 at Green Alert to 6 at Yellow Alert and 3 at Orange Alert (Figure 2, panel B). This finding translated to $50,000 per death averted moving from Green to Yellow and $153,000 per death averted moving from Yellow Alert to Orange. For SARS, on the other hand, the incremental cost of moving from Green Alert to Yellow is $120,000 per death averted; this drops to $75,000 when moving from Yellow to Orange. This finding is mainly due to the high (10%) case-fatality rate and the relatively higher percentage of atypical patients who are missed and not isolated, a lesson learned from the actual SARS experience (Figure 3).

Sensitivity analysis showed that the factors that impacted the cost-effectiveness ratio most are case-fatality rate, patient exposure rate, and secondary attack rate (Figure 4). In the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 scenario, the case fatality-rate ranging from 0.1% (seasonal influenza) to 10% (SARS) results in the cost per death averted moving from infinity (no death) to $35,000 per death averted (Orange Alert). Similarly, changing the exposure rate from 1.5 persons/day (10% PPE failure rate, Orange Alert) to 30 persons/day (0% reduction) per infected patient changed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from $2.5 million per death averted to $23,000. If pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had a higher 50% transmission rate, Orange Alert would become the most cost-effective strategy. The other variables had an impact on cost per case prevented but did not impact the incremental cost per death averted ratio.

### Measuring diet cost at the individual level: a comparison of three methods [^b7659941]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Methods 2 and 3, which applied a standard database of supermarket prices, have parallels in nutritional epidemiology, where estimates of energy and nutrient intakes for individuals are derived from common nutrient composition tables. For example, the vitamin C content of fresh, raw apples consumed by participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys is set at 4.6 mg per 100 g edible portion, regardless of the vitamin C content of the apples that were actually consumed. The addition of a price variable was analogous to the inclusion of new nutrient-based variables in the FFQ nutrient database.

All three estimates of diet cost were positively and monotonically associated with household income, consistent with past studies on incomes and household food expenditures. Diet cost estimates based on expenditures (Method 1) were not only the highest but also showed the largest differences across income strata. It is likely that diet costs estimated using a standard prices database (Methods 2 and 3) underestimate the true differences in purchasing power across income groups.

The current economic news is bad. Expenditure on health care is under scrutiny in every country and with predictions of another economic crash comes pressure on the funding of health care systems - systems that, according to the World Health Organizationare meant to deliver quality service to all people, when and where they need them.

At the same time, new products - pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tests, new technologies - continue to be developed and launched. Health care systems are under pressure to pay for all of the potential hope that these provide, sometimes with good reason, sometimes without. This is where cost-effectiveness analysis comes in.

### Dietary and economic effects of eliminating shortfall in fruit intake on nutrient intakes and diet cost [^fa26955e]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Beyond economic constraints, there are additional challenges in increasing whole fruit consumption among children. One factor that might drive a preference for fruit juice over whole fruit includes the ease of storage, preparation and portioning, which may be particularly important in institutional settings. Spoilage and wastage due to over-ripening of fresh fruit is also a challenge. According to USDA estimates, 25% of fresh fruit at the consumer level is lost due to over-ripening or spoilage, compared to 11% for processed fruits (which includes fruit juice along with canned and frozen fruit). Furthermore, fruit juices may be more convenient for parents and caregivers who have time constraints and may look for easy and quick options. Beyond individual-level barriers, there is some evidence that individuals residing in more deprived neighborhoods may have limited access to fresh fruits at local stores, which may influence fresh/whole fruit consumption. In addition, while access to whole/fresh fruit in stores may vary by neighborhood characteristic and type of store, fruit juice is generally available.

This study had a number of limitations. First, the consequences of adding whole fruit and fruit juice to diets of children to remove any shortfall in fruit consumption fails to measure the actual dietary behavior of children/adolescents. As such, our findings represent an estimate of the potential dietary and economic impact of adding fruit juice/whole fruit to the diets of children/adolescents. As a related issue, this model often included small amounts of juice (e.g. 1–2 fluid ounces), which would be difficult to consume in a real-world setting, where most children likely consume juice from larger cups or packages. A second limitation is that our models did not explore other potential substitution scenarios that may improve diet quality for children/adolescents. For example, replacing snacks foods or desserts with whole fruit would further reduce total energy intake, increase nutrient density and fruit consumption, while reducing consumption of added sugars, sodium or solid fats. Determining the foods to replace with fruit is a subjective exercise, and may fail to capture probable dietary behaviors. In addition, this analysis did not evaluate the nutritional or economic consequences of altering other components of the diet, such as increasing vegetable or whole grain consumption. Third, the monetary cost of adding whole fruit and fruit juice to the diets of children is based on a single, nationally representative database of prices that does not account for seasonal or regional variations in food prices, or difference in prices between stores and restaurants.

### The Lancet Nigeria commission: investing in health and the future of the nation [^be5431d4]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Table 5
Estimated programme and health system strengthening costs 2021–30 extrapolated from the National Health Strategic Development Plan 2 (NSHDP2) (2018–22)

Increasing health expenditure as outlined in table 5 only constitutes approximately 2·5 times the current $11·85 (16·3%) public spending of total health expenditure per capita of $72·7 in 2019. The true costs required, however, are likely to be much higher than these costs extrapolated from the National Health Strategic Development Plan 2 (NSHDP2; 2018–22).

For example, given experience with the COVID-19 pandemic, far more than $0·01 per capita per year is likely to be needed for adequate provision for the programme area of public health emergencies, preparedness, and response. Similarly, for neglected tropical diseases to be addressed (figure 5), far more than $0·06 per capita per year expenditure is required. Investment in health promotion and social determinants of health also needs increasing from $0·07 per capita per year to several dollars per capita at least, especially considering such funding would reap many times the amount in benefits (table 4). It is also important to note that total health expenditure per capita has been as high as $108 in 2014, even though health coverage and outcomes are poor, which is likely to be related to the high proportion derived from out-of-pocket expenditure. Therefore, it would be prudent for the government to at least double annual health expenditure per capita to $168 or perhaps even triple it to $252, while dramatically increasing the proportion that is public expenditure (or pooled funding) and reducing out-of-pocket expenditure, as has been attempted in India and Ethiopia (panel 8, table 6). These increases would entail investments of ₦157 trillion to double annual health expenditure or ₦236 trillion to triple annual health expenditure for the whole of the 2021–30 period, or 10–15% of total GDP over the decade (2020 GDP for Nigeria was estimated at ₦152 trillion). Nigerian Governments must recognise this as an investment in a prosperous nation rather than a cost. Given the size and importance of this investment, it must also be accompanied by measures that promote efficiency and effectiveness throughout the system, while prioritising interventions that give the most value (ie, health) for money. To illustrate the value of efficient spending on health, panel 9 and figure 8, show how investments in maternal, neonatal and child health can save millions of lives in Nigeria over the next decade. The estimated $10·5 per capita per year is slightly more than that estimated for maternal and reproductive health ($5–6) and child health ($1–3) combined from the NHSDP2 aggressive scale-up scenario (table 5).

### Unlocking global carbon reduction potential by embracing low-carbon lifestyles [^39b0e1b1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Modelling indirect rebound effects

In our model, adopting low-carbon lifestyles can lead to money savings, which consumers would re-spend. This phenomenon, known as the rebound effect, involves reallocating saved money into final consumption, potentially leading to increased upstream carbon emissions throughout the supply chain. Our study focuses on indirect rebound effects, where saved money is redirected into other goods and services. Direct rebound effects, involving increased consumption of the same fuel products due to energy efficiency gains, are considered unlikely in the context of low-carbon lifestyle changes. Thus, the increased household consumption due to re-spending behaviour from money savings can be calculated by Eq. (14):

Afterward, we calculated offsetting reductions through re-spendings using the increased household final demand vector, as Eq. (15).

Actual carbon savings after re-spendings can be given by. Therefore, the rebound effect is expressed as a percentage of offsetting carbon emissions to the expected carbon savings, as Eq. (16):

Modelling alternative re-spending scenarios

To assess the potential size of rebound effects resulting from lifestyle changes, we developed three alternative re-spending/rebound scenarios (SC1-SC3), drawing inspiration from studies.

SC1 assumed that all saved money is re-spent on products whose expenditures remain unaffected by low-carbon lifestyle changes. For example, cutting down on air travel could reduce spending on aviation travel items like plane tickets, while expenses on other non-aviation travel items and other goods remain unchanged. The saved money from reduced airfare would then be redirected towards spending on these non-aviation travel items and other goods.

This scenario is grounded in the idea that individuals might channel their remaining savings into goods and services that are not influenced by interventions. In line with the approaches of Druckman et al.and Grabs et al. SC2 is designed to redirect all saved money towards the six least carbon-intensive items across six consumption categories. SC3 focuses on channelling the saved money specifically into the least carbon-intensive products among all expenditure items. Here, we used embodied carbon intensity in the baseline (i.e.) as our focus covers all upstream emissions. It's important to note that while the outcomes of SC2 and SC3 may not precisely reflect real-world scenarios, they serve as valuable tools for understanding the potential lower bounds of rebound effects.

Accepting risk — the first acceleration point investment.

Accelerating the timeline introduces risks for stakeholders, including funders, researchers, and grantees:

- There was risk to the funder from investing in a duplication of the primary (post-pilot) study that had not yet been initiated in Papua New Guinea, without any data other than from the small pilot study. This investment in Cote d'Ivoire could be a waste of resources if the study results from the pilot were not replicated in the planned RCT in Papua New Guinea; however, it would take a year to get to the first data on the primary end point and waiting for that data before acting would potentially waste development time. By waiting, they also would have missed the opportunity to build on the planned study in Cote d'Ivoire, which would save months compared with having to plan the study de novo.
- The researchers in Cote d'Ivoire carried the risk of adding an arm to an existing study and having to reobtain institutional review board approvals, which could delay the timelines of the original Cote d'Ivoire studies that had been in the planning process for over a year.
- Another substantial risk was to the grantee — the DOLF Project — which had to trust that the reallocated resources would be replaced such that the original studies and objectives would not be compromised. Despite the assurances of the project officer of pursuing the resources and ensuring that funding would be available, no funding commitment can be made until a funder receives a formal grant request, compares it across priorities at the time of submission, and makes a funding decision for award.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Budget impact in economic evaluations — Budget impact refers to the effect of adopting the intervention on total health care expenditures, accounting for both increased spending due to intervention-related costs and downstream savings from improved health in the treated population, and high-quality evaluations typically report changes in intervention-related costs, the cost of cardiovascular care (for example, savings from averted major adverse cardiovascular events), and the cost of noncardiovascular care (for example, increased spending due to prolonged survival). The budget impact is directly proportional to the number of eligible patients who receive the intervention, with studies typically reporting the projected effect on health care spending if all eligible patients were to receive the drug, and because budget impact may inform strategies for adoption at a population level, this information may be included in the supporting text accompanying the economic value statement where available.

### Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review [^23d0d9ba]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2013). Low credibility.

Economic evaluations

Where budgets are constrained there is an unavoidable opportunity cost of undertaking any policy, as funds spent on one intervention will limit the funds available for other interventions. The aim of economic evaluation is to assist policy makers to identify interventions/policies which represent good value for money. The value for money associated with a new intervention is determined by comparing the additional costs required and additional outcomes achieved, with the status quo or current intervention. Where an intervention/policy provides greater outcomes at lower costs, it is said to 'dominate' the current intervention/policy and a decision about adopting the new intervention/policy is straightforward. However, where an intervention/policy provides greater outcomes at greater cost, a decision must be made about whether to spend these additional resources to achieve these additional outcomes. Where outcomes of different interventions/policies are valued using common metrics (see table 1), the value for money associated with them can be directly compared to indicate where these outcomes can be achieved at the lowest price. These interventions represent the best value for money compared with the alternatives available and, where resources are scarce, could be considered 'economically worthwhile'.

### Acute effect of orange chromatic environment on perceived health status, pain, and vital signs during chemotherapy treatment [^b7ebcd44]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The study is aimed at assessing the acute effect of orange color and natural light exposure on cancer patients during chemotherapy sessions. Warmer environments and rooms receiving more sunlight hours were expected to impact vital signs, quality of life, and pain symptoms.

Methods

We used a single-group repeated-measures clinical trial design. For the purpose of the study, chemotherapy rooms were modified based on two experimental factors: color (white vs. orange) and sunlight orientation (south vs. north). On four consecutive sessions, cancer patients were randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: orange-north, orange-south, white-north, and white-south. They received chemotherapy per standard of care. The following outcomes were assessed: blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, and European Quality of Life Five-Dimension Five-Level Scale Questionnaire (EUROQOL-5D-5L) including the visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS).

Results

Statistically significant beneficial effect of orange color room in self-rated health was found (p = 0.036, d = 0.28). Small differences in other parameters (body temperature, d = 0.34; diastolic blood pressure, d = 0.37; systolic blood pressure, d = 0.28) did not reach statistical significance. No differences were found based on room orientation.

Conclusions

Compared with a cool-color design, a warm-color living environment could have a positive effect on patients' well-being during chemotherapy sessions. Although the clinical effect size on perceived health status and vital signs could be considered small, the cost-effectiveness analysis would support the use of the proposed configurations. More research is still needed.

Persons Who Received Third Dose of MMR Vaccine versus Those Who Received 2 Doses

None of the 28 family members who received a third dose of MMR vaccine as PEP became infected with mumps virus in contrast with 4 (5.2%) of the 77 who had previously received 2 doses but did not receive PEP (Table 3). The difference in secondary attack rates between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.57). Two of the 2-dose case-patients were male; the sex-specific attack rates were 6.9% for male and 4.3% for female patients (p = 0.62). The median age of those receiving a third dose was 8 years (range 5–20 years) and also 8 years (range 4–20 years) among those eligible who did not. The median number of years since the last MMR dose (before the PEP dose) was 10 years (range 2–39 years) among those who received a third dose, compared with 11 years (range 0–39 years) among those eligible who did not (p = 0.47).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds — framework and updates explain that the 2014 ACC/AHA statement provided per–capita GDP–based thresholds such that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1-3x per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. The World Health Organization's program suggested that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective, whereas costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective; however, experts have argued this approach lacks theoretical justification, and World Health Organization experts now also advise against the use of per capita GDP-based cost effectiveness thresholds and instead suggest considering cost-effectiveness information alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicriterion decision process. The writing committee reviewed alternative approaches, including relying on US-based studies; for example, a health opportunity cost analysis estimated that at 2019 prices, for every $1000000 increase in health care expenditures 1860 persons were projected to become uninsured with 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars, and in the probabilistic analysis 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

Domain 8: Ethical and legal aspects of care — Guideline 8.4 treatment and ongoing decision-making states that, within the limits of applicable laws and standards, person-centered goals form the basis for the plan of care and decisions related to providing, forgoing, and discontinuing treatments. The patient's plan of care reflects ethical principles and the assessment of treatment preferences and is accurately documented to reflect the patient's previously stated goals in terms of providing, forgoing, and discontinuing care. The IDT ensures that existing treatments align with the patient's goals and the standard practices of care, and the team actively works to prevent medically non-beneficial care. When a family member or surrogate decision-maker seeks to override the patient's documented treatment decisions, the patient's preferences are reviewed, and ethics consultation is sought if needed, and failure to honor patient preferences is considered an ethical concern and is addressed by the IDT. Children receive open and honest, developmentally appropriate information about their serious illness and treatment options and are given the opportunity to participate in decision-making according to their wishes, age, and developmental capacity, and when the child's wishes differ from those of the adult decision-maker, staff is available to assist the child and family work towards a resolution, prioritizing fidelity to the patient. When parents or legal decision-makers express a strong preference for non-disclosure of a poor prognosis to a seriously ill child or adolescent, the IDT assesses family motivations and values regarding truth-telling practices and preferences; while it is sometimes ethically permissible to defer to family values regarding nondisclosure of prognosis, clinicians work collaboratively with the family to meet the child or adolescent's individual needs while respecting the parent or decision-makers' expectations and boundaries. All treatments provided are directed at the relief of suffering, in accordance with the doctrine of double effect, and the IDT educates the patient and family regarding the cost of care and financial burdens associated with treatment options. In cases where the wishes of the patient or surrogate conflict with the clinicians caring for the patient, processes are in place to honor clinician conscientious objection in a manner that ensures patients are never abandoned and continue to receive quality, safe care, and when treatments are forgone or discontinued, the IDT ensures appropriate symptom control at all times, as aligned with the ethical principle of nonmaleficence.

### Cost-effectiveness of advanced hybrid closed loop therapy compared to standard insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes in pregnancy: an economic evaluation of the CRISTAL trial [^2486fb81]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 5
Multivariate sensitivity analysis on the MiniMed™ 780G cost in euros (€) and the number of hospitalisation days in the SoC group.

The figure illustrates how changes to the MiniMed™ 780G cost in euros (x-axis) and the hospitalisation days in the SoC group (y-axis) affect the estimated cost difference. The orange area represents the combinations of the MiniMed™ 780G cost and hospitalisation days where SoC is the cost-saving choice, while the blue area indicates combinations where AHCL therapy is cost-saving. The intersection between the areas represents the combinations where the costs of AHCL and SoC are equal. At the observed average number of hospitalisation days in the SoC group (11.5 days) and the current cost of the MiniMed™ 780G (€5,096 on the Belgian market), AHCL therapy is more economical since this combination falls in the blue area, as indicated by the white circle. Given the current MiniMed™ 780G cost of €5,096, the threshold number of hospitalisation days is approximately 8.4 days. If the hospitalisation duration falls below this value, SoC becomes the cost-saving strategy, as indicated by the dark circle, which lies on the threshold. All combinations of fewer than 8.4 days fall below the dark circle and within the orange area.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^a5dd53ff]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

5.5 Recommendation

We suggest that clinicians advocate that policymakers provide incentives to ensure that retailers can offer affordable, high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables to all (2 ⊕○○○).

5.5 Evidence

For the poor, food expense represents an important item in a family's budget (Ref. pp 193–221). At least one study showed that a diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein costs more than a diet based on refined grains, added sugars, and fats. But a diet richer in fruits and vegetables can reduce caloric intake and lead to weight control. There are fewer conveniently located supermarkets in poorer neighborhoods but many "convenience stores" selling calorie-dense foods. Urban stores tend to stock fewer of the healthier foods and have less of a variety of foods. Even if supermarket availability were to improve, prices are still lower in the poorer neighborhoods for the higher fat, calorie-dense foods. Some policies (including the federal government farm subsidy program) have encouraged production of high-fructose corn syrup and other commodities used extensively in processed foods. Even when restaurants advertise and make healthy food items available, consumer habits may continue to prefer burgers, fries, and other high-calorie, high-fat items.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^63fa1003]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds for cardiovascular cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — The 2014 ACC/AHA cost-value methodology statement provided thresholds to identify high-, intermediate-, and low-value care based on U.S. per capita gross domestic product, and the writing committee determined that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1–3× per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. WHO-origin GDP benchmarks suggested an intervention that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective and that costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective, but critics note they "set such a low bar for cost effectiveness that very few interventions with evidence of efficacy can be ruled out"; WHO experts now also advise against per capita GDP-based thresholds and suggest considering cost-effectiveness alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicomponent decision process. Reflecting these concerns, the writing committee reviewed alternative approaches to incorporating CEA results into guidelines, including relying on US-based studies for identifying a cost-effectiveness threshold or thresholds for cardiovascular CEAs, and Vanness et al used a health opportunity cost approach estimating that for every $1 000 000 increase in health care expenditures, 1869 persons become uninsured, resulting in 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars; in the probabilistic analysis, 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of hospital infection control response to an epidemic respiratory virus threat [^1a85bc47]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The outbreak of influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 prompted many countries in Asia, previously strongly affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), to respond with stringent measures, particularly in preventing outbreaks in hospitals. We studied actual direct costs and cost-effectiveness of different response measures from a hospital perspective in tertiary hospitals in Singapore by simulating outbreaks of SARS, pandemic (H1N1) 2009, and 1918 Spanish influenza. Protection measures targeting only infected patients yielded lowest incremental cost/death averted of 23,000 (US dollars) for pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Enforced protection in high-risk areas (Yellow Alert) and full protection throughout the hospital (Orange Alert) averted deaths but came at an incremental cost of up to $2.5 million/death averted. SARS and Spanish influenza favored more stringent measures. High case-fatality rates, virulence, and high proportion of atypical manifestations impacted cost-effectiveness the most. A calibrated approach in accordance with viral characteristics and community risks may help refine responses to future epidemics.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: uses and pitfalls [^ff53a0ec]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is a formal method of comparing alternative medical interventions with regard to their resource utilization (costs) and outcomes (effectiveness). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is an informative measure generated from such an analysis and represents the ratio of the difference in cost between two medical interventions to the difference in outcomes between the two interventions. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio summarizes the additional cost per unit of health benefit gained in switching from one medical intervention to another. Although incremental cost-effectiveness ratios have limitations, when used in the proper context, these ratios serve as one of the important tools needed to help guide decisions about allocating scarce resources across competing medical programmes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — future and societal costs specifies that cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) from a health care sector perspective should "also capture all future costs," including "total health care sector costs during the added years of life" and "health care costs unrelated to the disease of interest," and that CEAs from a societal perspective "should also include non–health care consumption costs during the added years of life." For a societal perspective, analyses "should include illness- or treatment-related productivity losses resulting from decreased participation in formal and informal labor markets or change in household production, the value of the patient's time spent seeking care as well as any caregiver time, and when relevant, any costs borne by other sectors of the economy, such as education or criminal justice"; when elements cannot be measured, "an impact inventory can be used to discuss the limitations," and "a modified societal perspective may include some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but exclude costs, such as education, from other sectors of the economy."

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — miscellaneous considerations: "Rare disease drugs and gene therapies should be evaluated using the standard cost-effectiveness threshold ($120 000 per QALY gained) but with heightened consideration of contextual factors around health equity and access to care," and "one or more recommendations should highlight the need for clinicians to discuss out-of-pocket costs with patients at the time of initiation of a new therapy and at regular intervals thereafter," aiming to identify financial strain and preempt cost-related nonadherence.

### Effect of a prize-linked savings intervention on savings and healthy behaviors among men in Kenya: a randomized clinical trial [^0cf8b2a4]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

As access to banking services and financial inclusion increases in SSA, there is growing potential to examine whether savings-led interventions can encourage men to save money and thereby divert spending away from alcohol and transactional sex. A recent cross-sectional studyin Uganda found that men and women who saved money were less likely to have problematic alcohol use and engage in risky sexual behavior, suggesting that providing income-earning men with opportunities to save money may be one way to reduce risky behaviors. However, few studies have examined this possibility using experimental designs.

Prize-linked savings accounts are an increasingly popular way to promote savings and have been offered by credit unions, employers, and banks in several countries. They offer savers random, lottery-like rewards as interest income. Unlike traditional interest, which tends to be small, prize-linked savings accounts include a low probability of earning large amounts of interest income. The probability of winning prizes is usually determined by the amount of new deposits made in a given period, meaning that individuals' chances of winning a prize increase as they save more. Offering prize-linked savings has been shown to lead to take-up of savings accounts and to modestly increase savings in the United States, South Africa, and Mexico. Evidence from the United States also demonstrates that having a prize-linked savings account displaces gambling, suggesting that it may fulfill a desire for risk taking that could apply to other risk behaviors. Therefore, prize-linked savings opportunities may be particularly appealing for men who engage in risky behaviors. However, to our knowledge, no studies to date have examined the effect of offering prize-linked savings accounts on health behaviors of high-risk men. Responding to the vital need for interventions that target men's health behaviors in SSA, we conducted a randomized clinical trial to explore the potential for a prize-linked savings intervention to increase men's savings and decrease their spending on alcohol, gambling, and transactional sex.

### Pricing health behavior interventions to promote adoption: lessons from the marketing and business literature [^7be01f08]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The relatively high cost of delivering many public health interventions limits their potential for broad public impact by reducing their likelihood of adoption and maintenance over time. Practitioners identify cost as the primary factor for which interventions they select to implement, but researchers rarely disseminate cost information or consider its importance when developing new interventions. A new approach is proposed whereby intervention developers assess what individuals and agencies adopting their interventions are willing to pay and then design interventions that are responsive to this price range. The ultimate goal is to develop effective and affordable interventions, called lean interventions, which are widely adopted and have greater public health impact.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Appropriate scope and caveats for cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs): The intention of CEAs is not to directly influence patient-level decision-making; instead, systematically applying CEAs at the health system level can promote efficient resource use and improve population health outcomes and would ideally be performed across the entire set of options rather than evaluating each intervention in a silo. CEAs can inform the prices of new health technologies entering the market, improving the affordability of and access to novel diagnostic and treatment strategies. Resource allocation is a complex process that, beyond efficiency, depends on political priorities, scalability and affordability of the proposed intervention, and its impact on health equity; this is particularly important in cardiovascular disease given that 1 in 3 US adults received care for a cardiovascular risk factor or condition in 2020. To improve health care efficiency, CEAs have to be updated over the intervention's life cycle and policymakers have to be willing to defund less-efficient programs; adding programs that are "cost-effective" without removing those that are no longer cost-effective continues to drive up health care spending without optimizing efficiency. This statement uses the term CEA for analytic frameworks with effectiveness outcomes that reflect patient or community preferences over health states (eg, quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]).

### Triple return on investment: the cost and impact of 13 interventions that could prevent stillbirths and save the lives of mothers and babies in South Africa [^7018cca0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The time of labor, birth and the first days of life are the most vulnerable period for mothers and children. Despite significant global advocacy, there is insufficient understanding of the investment required to save additional lives. In particular, stillbirths have been neglected. Over 20 000 stillbirths are recorded annually in South Africa, many of which could be averted. This analysis examines available South Africa specific stillbirth data and evaluates the impact and cost-effectiveness of 13 interventions acknowledged to prevent stillbirths and maternal and newborn mortality.

Methods

Multiple data sources were reviewed to evaluate changes in stillbirth rates since 2000. The intervention analysis used the Lives Saved tool (LiST) and the Family Planning module (FamPlan) in Spectrum. LiST was used to determine the number of stillbirths and maternal and neonatal deaths that could be averted by scaling up the interventions to full coverage (99%) in 2030. The impact of family planning was assessed by increasing FamPlan's default 70% coverage of modern contraception to 75% and 80% coverage. Total and incremental costs were determined in the LiST costing module. Cost-effectiveness measured incremental cost effectiveness ratios per potential life years gained.

Results

Significant variability exists in national stillbirth data. Using the international stillbirth definition, the SBR was 17.6 per 1 000 births in 2013. Full coverage of the 13 interventions in 2030 could reduce the SBR by 30% to 12.4 per 1 000 births, leading to an MMR of 132 per 100 000 and an NMR of 7 per 1 000 live births. Increased family planning coverage reduces the number of deaths significantly. The full intervention package, with 80% family planning coverage in 2030, would require US$420 million (US$7.8 per capita) annually, which is less than baseline costs of US$550 million (US$10.2 per capita). All interventions were highly cost-effective.

Conclusion

This is the first analysis in South Africa to assess the impact of scaling up interventions to avert stillbirths. Improved coverage of 13 interventions that are already recommended could significantly impact the rates of stillbirth and maternal and neonatal mortality. Family planning should also be prioritized to reduce mortality and overall costs.

### Environmental interventions to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and their effects on health [^83d2a0a1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Secondary outcomes: intervention costs, alternative beverage selection, and target group perceptions

Hendy 2011 reports that the intervention was "relatively low in cost at two U.S. dollars per child per month of application." Siegel 2016b and Emerson 2017 report that the intervention was low‐cost (no quantitative data reported).

Hendy 2011 reports that the number of meals with healthy beverages (defined as skim milk, 1% or 2% low‐fat white milk, 100% fruit juice, and water) selected by children increased by 3.46 a week in the intervention group, and by 0.52 a week in the control group during a three‐month intervention phase (P = 0.000; the number of meals served per week was six). Siegel 2016b reports that plain fat‐free milk purchases increased by 0.09 servings/day (P < 0.001) during the follow‐up period. Emerson 2017 reports that plain milk selection increased from 0.10 servings/day to 0.26 servings/day (P < 0.001) during a 13‐month follow‐up period, from which we calculated an increase by 0.16 servings/day.

Regarding target group and stakeholder perceptions, Hendy 2011 reports that "[t]he program has received high acceptability ratings from children and parents in past research, with a mean rating of 2.9 on a three‐point scale for children, and a mean rating of 4.4 on a five‐point scale for parents (.), and the present study documented a mean rating of 3.8 on a five‐point scale for school staff."

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — scope and caveats emphasize that the intention of CEAs is not to directly influence patient-level decision-making, and systematically applying CEAs at the level of the health system can promote efficient use of resources and improve population health outcomes; they would ideally be performed across the entire set of options available to generate health, rather than evaluating each intervention in a silo, which can be challenging in the United States given the fragmented nature of our health care system. CEAs can inform the prices of new health technologies entering the market, thus improving the affordability of and access to novel diagnostic and treatment strategies, while resource allocation is a complex process based on several considerations in addition to the efficient use of resources, including political priorities, scalability and affordability of the proposed intervention, and its impact on health equity; these considerations are particularly important for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease given the large number of individuals affected — 1 in 3 US adults received care for a cardiovascular risk factor or condition in 2020 — and the substantial economic burden of cardiovascular disease. CEAs have to be updated over the intervention's life cycle as more cost and effectiveness data become available, and policymakers have to be willing to defund less-efficient programs already in place, because adding more programs and interventions that are "cost-effective" without removing interventions that are no longer cost-effective continues to drive up health care spending without optimizing efficiency.

### Obesity prevention interventions and implications for energy balance in the United States and Mexico: a systematic review of the evidence and meta-analysis [^f3f4ad09]. Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

We identified 5,977 citations and obtained 1,565 publications. We identified 99 unique studies and 338 systematic reviews meeting the inclusion criteria. The literature flow diagram is in Supporting Information Figure S2, and we include a list of the included systematic reviews (Supporting Information Table S4).

We identified a large number of systematic reviews. Figure 1 shows the distribution of topics addressed in published reviews, and they are described in Supporting Information Table S5.

The 99 primary research studies reporting on energy consumption and/or expenditure are documented in a detailed evidence table in Supporting Information Table S6. The table is stratified by obesity prevention approach and provides a comprehensive overview. The results across studies are summarized in the Table 1, which documents the presence and absence of evidence for all intervention categories of interest, the number of studies per intervention, the study design the results are based on, and the summary across studies. The following provides a synthesis for the different obesity prevention strategies across the identified evidence. Citations and review or study details are documented in Supporting Information Table S6.

Table 1
Summary of findings

Food labeling

We identified 69 systematic reviews in which the scope of the review included food‐labeling initiatives. Six of these exclusively addressed food labeling such as calorie labeling in restaurants. The reviews reported on a variety of acceptability outcomes and obesity measures.

We did not identify any individual study that met inclusion criteria and reported on daily energy consumed or expended with food‐labeling initiatives.

Financial incentives

We identified 68 systematic reviews in which the scope of the review included financial incentives. Of these, six exclusively targeted financial incentives.

Our literature searches in databases and reference mining of the systematic reviews identified one relevant study that reported on daily energy consumed.

Energy consumed

The study evaluated whether incentivizing the purchase of fruits and vegetables and prohibiting the purchase of less nutritious food in a food‐benefit program improves the nutritional quality of participants' diets. The study reported reduced intake of energy (−96 kcal per day; SE, 59.9), but the difference between the intervention and control group was not statistically significant (SMD, 0.10; 95% CI: −0.24 to 0.44; one RCT) 10. The quality of the evidence was downgraded because the result is based on a single study and the consistency across studies could not be assessed.

None of the identified studies reported on children alone.

Energy expended

None of the identified studies reported on energy expended.

### Interventions for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children aged five years and under… [^5c0ecf29]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Insufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables in childhood increases the risk of future chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and associated adverse events of interventions designed to increase the consumption of fruit, vegetables or both amongst children aged five years and under.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and Embase to identify eligible trials on 25 September 2017. We searched Proquest Dissertations and Theses and two clinical trial registers in November 2017. We reviewed reference lists of included trials and handsearched three international nutrition journals. We contacted authors of included studies to identify further potentially relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials, including cluster-randomised controlled trials and cross-over trials, of any intervention primarily targeting consumption of fruit, vegetables or both among children aged five years and under, and incorporating a dietary or biochemical assessment of fruit or vegetable consumption. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of identified papers; a third review author resolved disagreements.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risks of bias of included studies; a third review author resolved disagreements. Due to unexplained heterogeneity, we used random-effects models in meta-analyses for the primary review outcomes where we identified sufficient trials. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) to account for the heterogeneity of fruit and vegetable consumption measures. We conducted assessments of risks of bias and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE approach) using Cochrane procedures.

Main Results

We included 55 trials with 154 trial arms and 11,108 participants. Thirty-three trials examined the impact of child-feeding practices (e.g. repeated food exposure) in increasing child vegetable intake. Thirteen trials examined the impact of parent nutrition education in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. Eight studies examined the impact of multicomponent interventions (e.g. parent nutrition education and preschool policy changes) in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. One study examined the effect of a nutrition intervention delivered to children in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. We judged 14 of the 55 included trials as free from high risks of bias across all domains; performance, detection and attrition bias were the most common domains judged at high risk of bias for the remaining studies. Meta-analysis of trials examining child-feeding practices versus no intervention revealed a positive effect on child vegetable consumption (SMD 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.61; n = 1509; 11 studies; very low-quality evidence), equivalent to a mean difference of 4.03 g of vegetables. There were no short-term differences in child consumption of fruit and vegetables in meta-analyses of trials examining parent nutrition education versus no intervention (SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.28; n = 3023; 10 studies; very low-quality evidence) or multicomponent interventions versus no intervention (SMD 0.28, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.63; n = 1861; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence). Insufficient data were available to assess long-term effectiveness, cost effectiveness and unintended adverse consequences of interventions. Studies reported receiving governmental or charitable funds, except for three studies reporting industry funding.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite identifying 55 eligible trials of various intervention approaches, the evidence for how to increase children's fruit and vegetable consumption remains sparse. There was very low-quality evidence that child-feeding practice interventions are effective in increasing vegetable consumption in children aged five years and younger, however the effect size was very small and long-term follow-up is required. There was very low-quality evidence that parent nutrition education and multicomponent interventions are not effective in increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children aged five years and younger. All findings should be considered with caution, given most included trials could not be combined in meta-analyses. Given the very low-quality evidence, future research will very likely change estimates and conclusions. Such research should adopt more rigorous methods to advance the field. This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.

### Taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes [^9dc83428]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Global prevalence of overweight and obesity are alarming. For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products.

Objectives

To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction. Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screening. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax - the so-called 'Hungarian public health product tax' - on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine. The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.07 to -0.01; very low-certainty evidence). The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes. The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar. No studies reported on the primary outcomes of consumption of unprocessed sugar, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups. We could not perform meta-analyses or pool study results.

Authors' Conclusions

There was very limited evidence and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Despite the reported reduction in consumption of taxed sugar-added foods, we are uncertain whether taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods has an effect on reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Further robustly conducted studies are required to draw concrete conclusions on the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.

Cost-effectiveness plane (Figure 1) — when a new intervention produces less health and lower costs compared with the comparator, it may be considered cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is greater than the cost-effectiveness threshold; however, this situation does not arise often because patients, clinicians, and health systems rarely accept worse health outcomes even if it reduces spending, and the figure includes labels "Intervention is cost-saving ("dominant") or always acceptable" and "Intervention is inferior ("dominated") or never acceptable".

Clinical decisions must be made, often under circumstances of uncertainty and limited resources. Decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis are methodologic tools that allow for quantitative analysis and the optimization of decision-making. These methods can be useful for decisions regarding individual patient evaluation and treatment options or in formulating healthcare policy. We overview the methodology of expected value decision analysis and of cost-effectiveness analysis, including cost-identification, cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, and cost-utility analyses. Examples are provided of these methods and a user's guide to cost-effectiveness analysis is outlined.

### Gender differences in the relationship between financial capability and health in later life: evidence from Hong Kong [^c3f4ecf2]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

Financial Capability and Health

Empirical studies examining financial capability have focused on the impacts of financial literacy and behavior on financial outcomes. A large body of literature supports the positive association between financial literacy (e.g. numeracy, computation, or knowledge) and behavior (e.g. money management, responsible spending, saving, borrowing, and planning behaviors) and financial well-being and financial satisfaction. These findings are largely supported by reviews and meta-analyses.

However, limited research has explored how financial capability affects physical or mental health. For example, examined how financial and health literacy affect health-promoting behaviors and health status among older Americans. They found that financial literacy was negatively associated with lower levels of mobility disabilities, limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, depressive symptoms, and loneliness. Similarly, found a negative association between financial literacy and anxiety among Americans aged 40 and older. Research also shows that financial behavior predicts mental health outcomes. For instance, report that those with higher financial capability — conceptualized as saving and money management behaviors — show lower psychological distress (measured by The 12-Item General Health Questionnaire [GHQ-12]).found an association between financial health, conceptualized as spending, saving, borrowing, and planning, and self-rated health and depressive symptoms. Lastly, examined financial capability, measured as a single latent factor, including financial literacy, access, and behavior, and found that financial capability predicts general health status 4 years later.

Overall, the evidence shows that financial capability is a social determinant of health that can be addressed and intervened. However, several research gaps exist. First, empirical studies generally lack theoretical discussion on the conceptual link between financial capability and health. Second, previous studies conceptualize financial capability more as individual knowledge and behavior than the combination of individual ability and structural opportunity. There is one exception:measured all aspects of financial capability with one latent construct, but such an approach is unable to find the most effective malleable intervention lever. Finally, the mechanisms and pathways between financial capability and health, especially the moderating role of gender, have not been extensively explored.

### Economic evaluation of exercise or cognitive and social enrichment activities for improved cognition after stroke [^148bbef7]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

In the base case analysis, the exercise intervention was costlier and more effective than the balance and tone intervention at the end of the 6-month intervention, with an ICER of CAD −$8823 (US −$6352.56) per mean change in ADAS-Cog-Plus score.

Figure 1 A shows that for the exercise group compared with the balance and tone group, approximately 49% of 5000 bootstrapped cycles fell in the northwest quadrant at the end of the intervention. Since negative ADAS-Cog-Plus scores indicate healthy cognitive functioning, the intervention was costlier and more effective at the end. The proportion of bootstrapped cycles within the cost-effective region implies a degree of uncertainty regarding the effects of exercise on both costs and health benefits. Figure 1 B shows that for exercise vs balance and tone interventions, the probability of ICER acceptance for willingness-to-pay values between CAD $15 000 and $60 000 (US $10 800-$43 200) was approximately 40% at the end of the intervention.

Cost-effectiveness analysis perspectives — Table 1 delineates cost components and examples by perspective (Health Care Sector, "Modified Societal," Full Societal). Components and examples include health care costs paid by third-party payers (drug/device costs, hospital services, physician services, home care services, allied health), costs paid out-of-pocket by patients (drug copayment/coinsurance and user fees), patient-time costs (time spent seeking care), unpaid caregiver-time costs (time spent in caregiving), and productivity losses (formal/informal labor earnings lost, cost of unpaid lost productivity due to illness, cost of uncompensated household production). Broader sectors listed include social services, housing, legal or criminal justice, education, and environmental. Footnotes instruct that analysts should attempt to capture all relevant costs from a societal perspective and describe a "modified" societal perspective that includes some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but excludes costs from other sectors of the economy.

### Costs of hand hygiene for all in household settings: estimating the price tag for the 46 least developed countries [^58966e48]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Different cost categories change in relative importance over time, as the intervention is scaled up over 10 years (figure 3). Capital costs, specifically the initial promotion and HWF, are consistent over the years as each of the 10 cohorts receives the initial intervention — the slight annual decrease is due to discounting. Total recurrent costs increase every year, which is due to new cohorts receiving top-up promotion and spending on soap and water. Overall, capital costs comprise 37% of the 10-year total and recurrent costs 63%, recalling that top-up promotion is a recurrent cost (table 1). In the alternative scenario where one-to-one promotion was excluded from the intervention, total cost decreased to US$ 11.0 billion (95% CI 10.0 to 12.2) and promotion cost to US$3.0 billion (95% CI 2.7 to 3.5), or US$0.25 annually per head of LDC population — figures in online supplemental material D.

Figure 3
Distribution of costs over the 10-year time horizon, for the 46 least developed countries.

Considering the first of the additional results, the annual cost of soap and water enabling households with a 'limited' service to reach 'basic' would be US$1.4 billion, of which 86% is for soap. Second, if all households in LDCs were targeted with hygiene promotion instead of only those with no HWF, the promotion cost almost quadruples to US$20.5 billion (from US$5.7 billion) including one-to-one activities, and to US$10.4 billion excluding them (from US$3.0 billion). These amounts are not included in the headline totals.

In deterministic sensitivity analysis, the scenario which saw the biggest difference in total cost was when the promotion price was varied according to its 95% CI. This saw total cost fall to US$10.5 billion or rise to US$16.8 billion (figure 4). Incorporating assumptions about economies of scale saw total cost falling to US$10.5 billion (figure 4). In this scenario, the prices of promotion, HWFs and soap experience annual decreases starting with 10% in year 2 then in 2% decrements (8% in year 3, etc). All scenarios are described in online supplemental material D, as are results for sensitivity analysis for promotion costs only.

Sensitivity analysis

Because our analysis projects outcomes into the future using estimates for several key data points, sensitivity analyses were carried out to test the effects of varying key parameters on the base model findings. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. For the univariate analysis, key parameters were adjusted by 20% and the low and high estimates were plugged into the model individually while holding all other parameters constant at base model levels to determine the extent to which they impacted the results. For the probabilistic analysis, random values were drawn from selected probability distributions (online supplemental table S2.16), as a Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 iterations of 1000 patients. The distributions were chosen either based on the literature, or when sources could not be found, so that the bounds of the 95% CI were 20% away from the mean.

### Estimating total spending by source of funding on routine and supplementary immunisation activities in low-income and middle-income countries, 2000–17: a financial modelling study [^38d4f81d]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Childhood immunisation is one of the most cost-effective health interventions. However, despite its known value, global access to vaccines remains far from complete. Although supply-side constraints lead to inadequate vaccine coverage in many health systems, there is no comprehensive analysis of the funding for immunisation. We aimed to fill this gap by generating estimates of funding for immunisation disaggregated by the source of funding and the type of activities in order to highlight the funding landscape for immunisation and inform policy making.

Methods

For this financial modelling study, we estimated annual spending on immunisations for 135 low-income and middle-income countries (as determined by the World Bank) from 2000 to 2017, with a focus on government, donor, and out-of-pocket spending, and disaggregated spending for vaccines and delivery costs, and routine schedules and supplementary campaigns. To generate these estimates, we extracted data from National Health Accounts, the WHO-UNICEF Joint Reporting Forms, comprehensive multi-year plans, databases from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's 2019 development assistance for health database. We estimated total spending on immunisation by aggregating the government, donor, prepaid private, and household spending estimates.

Findings

Between 2000 and 2017, funding for immunisation totalled US$112·4 billion (95% uncertainty interval 108·5–118·5). Aggregated across all low-income and middle-income countries, government spending consistently remained the largest source of funding, providing between 60·0% (57·7–61·9) and 79·3% (73·8–81·4) of total immunisation spending each year (corresponding to between $2·5 billion [2·3–2·8] and $6·4 billion [6·0–7·0] each year). Across income groups, immunisation spending per surviving infant was similar in low-income and lower-middle-income countries and territories, with average spending of $40 (38–42) in low-income countries and $42 (39–46) in lower-middle-income countries, in 2017. In low-income countries and territories, development assistance made up the largest share of total immunisation spending (69·4% [64·6–72·0]; $630·2 million) in 2017. Across the 135 countries, we observed higher vaccine coverage and increased government spending on immunisation over time, although in some countries, predominantly in Latin America and the Caribbean and in sub-Saharan Africa, vaccine coverage decreased over time, while spending increased.

Interpretation

These estimates highlight the progress over the past two decades in increasing spending on immunisation. However, many challenges still remain and will require dedication and commitment to ensure that the progress made in the previous decade is sustained and advanced in the next decade for the Immunization Agenda 2030.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

ACC/AHA cost–value methodology — construction and reporting of economic value statements emphasize standardized terminology, reporting, and thresholds: "Guidelines should use the 'Economic Value Statement' instead of the previously used term 'Value Statement' to clarify that cost effectiveness is only 1 component of value," and "the economic value statement should immediately follow the clinical recommendation for the intervention," with each statement to "consist of the class of recommendation, level of certainty, and recommendation." Reporting specifies "Results should be reported as ICER per QALY gained," and cost-effectiveness is defined as "Interventions are considered to be cost-effective at a threshold of $120 000 per QALY gained." The recommendation "should include the population, intervention, comparator, cost of the intervention, and ICER with % of simulations below the accepted threshold, if available," and "Key findings from deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses should be reported in the supporting text." The supporting text "should summarize the high-quality CEAs that were used to generate the economic value statement" and include "Point estimates of the ICER and the proportion of simulations that were cost-effective at a specified threshold." Special considerations include that "Rare disease drugs and gene therapies should be evaluated using the standard cost-effectiveness threshold ($120 000 per QALY gained)" and "One or more recommendations should highlight the need for clinicians to discuss out-of-pocket costs with patients at the time of initiation of a new therapy and at regular intervals thereafter."
