## Question

Causes of decerebrate posture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of decerebrate posture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuroanatomy and pathophysiology that define decerebrate rigidity. Then, I should categorize etiologies by mechanism, including structural brainstem injury, metabolic-toxic encephalopathies, seizure-related phenomena, and autonomic dysregulation syndromes. Next, I will verify special contexts like hepatic encephalopathy, immune effector cell neurotoxicity, and neonatal conditions. Finally, I will integrate prognostic implications and a practical diagnostic approach, making sure I double-check where the evidence is strong versus uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the core definition and mechanism. Decerebrate posture is pathologic extensor posturing with rigid extension of the arms and legs, internal rotation, and opisthotonus, classically reflecting loss of cortical and subcortical inhibitory control over brainstem motor centers, with facilitation of vestibulospinal and reticulospinal pathways that drive extensor tone. Clinically, it signals severe brainstem or diencephalic injury and is a marker of poor prognosis in many settings [^ded22e62] [^4720a431].

> I will now examine structural brainstem lesions, starting with midbrain involvement. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence here. A prospective MRI study in traumatic brain injury found that midbrain lesions, particularly when isolated from pontine involvement, correlated strongly with decerebrate rigidity, whereas combined midbrain–pontine lesions did not show the same association, supporting a midbrain localization for the extensor phenotype in that context [^7c9f3482]. Hold on, I should also consider upward transtentorial herniation from posterior fossa mass effect, which compresses the midbrain and produces coma with decerebrate posturing and characteristic pupillary evolution, reinforcing the midbrain mechanism in herniation syndromes [^aefeea19].

> Next, I should review pontine and medullary contributions. Let me consider the classic literature and contemporary case series. Historical clinical-pathologic correlations describe rostrocaudal deterioration with decerebrate posturing emerging as brainstem compression advances, and case reports document extensor posturing with discrete pontine tegmental lesions, occasionally with preserved consciousness, highlighting that the motor pattern can be dissociated from arousal in select brainstem injuries [^ded22e62] [^fce0eba0]. But wait, what if the lesion is more diffuse? Diffuse axonal injury and severe traumatic brain injury frequently produce decerebrate posturing and are associated with dysautonomia and prolonged coma, aligning with widespread disconnection of cortical–subcortical–brainstem motor control circuits [^d28d48f7].

> I need to check metabolic and toxic encephalopathies that can mimic or produce decerebrate posturing. Hepatic encephalopathy is a notable example. Case reports describe reversible decerebrate rigidity in hepatic encephalopathy, including after TIPS, with resolution following ammonia-lowering therapy, indicating that metabolic derangements can transiently produce brainstem motor release phenomena without fixed structural injury [^b6f24dc9]. I should confirm that this is framed as rare but real, and not overgeneralize from case-level evidence [^b6f24dc9].

> Let me consider seizure-related brainstem posturing. Ictal and postictal symmetric tonic extension resembling decerebration is well described and correlates with seizure severity markers such as postictal generalized EEG suppression and prolonged hypoxemia. This brainstem semiology is a recognized risk phenotype for SUDEP and reflects seizure propagation to subcortical arousal and respiratory networks rather than a structural brainstem lesion per se [^7b964690] [^fd68f921]. Hold on, I should verify that these movements are typically accompanied by impaired consciousness and autonomic changes, which they are in prospective cohorts [^7b964690].

> I should confirm autonomic dysregulation syndromes after brain injury. Paroxysmal autonomic instability with dystonia (PAID) presents with episodic hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and extensor posturing. The pathophysiology involves loss of cortical and subcortical inhibition over diencephalic and brainstem autonomic and motor centers, with spinal reflex hyperexcitability, and the episodes are often triggered by noxious stimuli or discomfort, distinguishing them from persistent decerebrate rigidity [^4720a431] [^d28d48f7]. Let me reconsider the diagnostic criteria: exclusion of seizures and a robust response to opioids or other autonomic modulators support the diagnosis in the right clinical context [^4720a431].

> Next, I should review special contexts. Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity (ICANS) can produce grade 4 neurologic toxicity with diffuse cerebral edema and decerebrate or decorticate posturing as part of a constellation including depressed consciousness and cranial nerve VI palsy, reflecting cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation and edema rather than a focal structural lesion [^93d4a3d7] [^00744fae]. I need to ensure I cite the consensus grading that explicitly includes decerebrate posturing in severe ICANS, which it does [^93d4a3d7].

> I will now examine neonatal and pediatric considerations. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in neonates is graded by severity, with decerebrate posturing signaling severe encephalopathy and correlating with abnormal background on amplitude-integrated EEG, which carries prognostic implications for neurodevelopmental outcomes [^d5fc5651]. Let me verify that this is a standard grading approach in neonatology, which it is in the cited study [^d5fc5651].

> But wait, what about medication-induced movement disorders that can mimic decerebration? Acute dystonic reactions, including drug-induced extensor posturing, can occur in the ICU and may be mistaken for decerebrate rigidity. Careful review of medication exposure and response to anticholinergics helps distinguish these entities from structural brainstem injury [^de7d965f]. I should double-check that haloperidol and antiemetics like ondansetron are recognized triggers, which they are in case literature, albeit with low-level evidence [^de7d965f] [^5e183229].

> Next, I should review prognostic implications and when decerebrate posturing is reversible. Historically, decerebrate posturing after TBI signaled poor outcome, but I need to ensure I do not overstate this as a rule. Indeed, modern series show that some patients with decerebrate posturing recover, particularly when the underlying cause is treatable — such as acute hydrocephalus, cerebellar mass effect with brainstem compression, or metabolic encephalopathy — underscoring the need for aggressive neurosurgical and critical care evaluation rather than premature prognostication [^e0f6646f]. Hold on, I should verify that decompressive interventions and ventriculostomy have led to improvement even in patients with fixed pupils and extensor posturing, which is documented in retrospective series and guideline discussions [^e0f6646f].

> I need to ensure a practical diagnostic approach is clear. In any patient with decerebrate posturing, I should confirm the presence of extensor rigidity, assess brainstem reflexes and respiratory patterns, obtain urgent neuroimaging to evaluate for herniation, midbrain or pontine lesions, diffuse axonal injury, or mass effect, and screen for metabolic derangements and toxic exposures. Concurrent EEG is warranted if seizure is suspected, and continuous monitoring is essential to detect evolution of herniation or autonomic storms [^c45e2935] [^7c9f3482] [^562c6e41]. Let me verify that guidelines emphasize early recognition of herniation signs, including decerebrate posturing, to trigger temporizing measures such as controlled hyperventilation and osmotherapy while definitive therapy is arranged, which they do [^685c11ef].

> In summary, decerebrate posture arises when cortical and subcortical inhibitory control over brainstem motor and autonomic centers is lost, producing extensor rigidity. The most robust human data implicate midbrain involvement in traumatic brain injury, but pontine and medullary lesions, diffuse axonal injury, metabolic encephalopathies such as hepatic encephalopathy, seizure-related brainstem semiology, and autonomic dysregulation syndromes are all recognized causes. Importantly, decerebrate posturing is a dire but nonspecific sign that mandates urgent evaluation for reversible causes and should not be used in isolation for prognostication [^7c9f3482] [^b6f24dc9] [^7b964690] [^4720a431] [^e0f6646f].

Decerebrate posture is caused by **severe brainstem injury** (midbrain or pons) from trauma, stroke, hypoxia, or metabolic insults, leading to loss of cortical inhibition and unchecked extensor motor tone [^7c9f3482] [^ded22e62]. It can also occur with **supratentorial mass effect** causing downward herniation that compresses the brainstem [^aefeea19] [^deeddb04]. Less commonly, it is seen in hepatic encephalopathy, severe metabolic derangements, or seizure-related brainstem dysfunction [^b6f24dc9] [^7b964690]. The posture reflects damage to descending inhibitory pathways and is a marker of poor prognosis, often indicating imminent herniation or irreversible brainstem injury [^685c11ef] [^e0f6646f].

---

## Anatomical and physiological basis

Decerebrate posture reflects **loss of cortical inhibition** over brainstem motor centers, especially the vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts, producing extensor tone. The key structures include:

- **Midbrain**: Lesions here disrupt cortical inhibition, causing extensor rigidity [^7c9f3482].
- **Pons**: Pontine lesions can also cause decerebrate rigidity, sometimes with preserved consciousness [^fce0eba0].
- **Descending motor pathways**: Damage to corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts removes inhibitory control, leading to extensor tone.

## Common causes of decerebrate posture

| **Category** | **Specific causes** |
|-|-|
| Traumatic brain injury (TBI) | - Severe TBI with diffuse axonal injury <br/> - Brainstem contusions <br/> - Subdural/epidural hematomas causing mass effect and herniation [^7c9f3482] [^d28d48f7] |
| Cerebrovascular accidents (stroke) | - Midbrain or pontine infarction/hemorrhage <br/> - Basilar artery occlusion <br/> - Large supratentorial infarcts with herniation [^7c9f3482] [^aefeea19] |
| Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy | - Cardiac arrest <br/> - Severe respiratory failure <br/> - Near-drowning causing diffuse cortical and brainstem injury [^d5fc5651] |
| Metabolic disturbances | - Hepatic encephalopathy <br/> - Severe hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia <br/> - Electrolyte imbalances (e.g. severe hyponatremia) [^b6f24dc9] [^83704825] |
| Seizure-related brainstem dysfunction | - Generalized convulsive seizures with brainstem involvement <br/> - Postictal brainstem suppression [^7b964690] [^fd68f921] |
| Infectious diseases | - Meningitis/encephalitis affecting the brainstem <br/> - Chandipura virus encephalitis [^feb15c31] |

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** underlie decerebrate posture:

- **Loss of cortical inhibition**: Cortical damage removes inhibitory control over brainstem motor centers, causing unchecked extensor tone [^4720a431].
- **Brainstem compression**: Supratentorial mass effect or herniation compresses the midbrain/pontine reticular formation, disrupting inhibitory pathways [^aefeea19].
- **Metabolic derangements**: Ammonia, glucose, or electrolyte disturbances impair neuronal function and disinhibit brainstem motor circuits [^notfound].
- **Seizure-related brainstem dysfunction**: Ictal or postictal suppression of cortical control can transiently produce decerebrate posturing [^7b964690].

---

## Clinical significance and prognosis

Decerebrate posture is a **poor prognostic sign** indicating severe brainstem injury or imminent herniation. It is associated with high mortality and severe neurological disability, though outcomes vary with etiology and timeliness of intervention [^e0f6646f]. Early recognition and aggressive management — including ICP control, surgical decompression, and supportive care — are critical to improving outcomes [^685c11ef].

---

## Differentiation from decorticate posture

Decerebrate posture (extensor) results from **brainstem lesions** and is associated with worse prognosis, whereas decorticate posture (flexor) results from **cortical or subcortical lesions** and carries a relatively better prognosis [^ded22e62].

---

Decerebrate posture arises from **severe brainstem injury** or loss of cortical inhibition, most often due to trauma, stroke, hypoxia, or metabolic insults. It signals grave neurological injury and mandates urgent evaluation and management to prevent irreversible harm [^7c9f3482] [^685c11ef].

### Reversible hepatic decerebration: a case report and review of the literature [^b6f24dc9]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a syndrome of neuropsychiatric dysfunction caused by portosystemic venous shunting with or without the presence of intrinsic liver disease. Clinical presentations are variable ranging from an abnormal sleep pattern to somnolence and deep coma. Decerebrate and decorticate posturing, have been rarely reported with hepatic encephalopathy. We report a case of a 59-year-old-man with a history of Child-Pugh B liver disease secondary to chronic alcoholism who was admitted because of coma. He had a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt 3 months prior to his presentation. He was found to have decerebrating posture. He was treated for hepatic encephalopathy with complete recovery and resolution of the neurologic findings. The physician should be aware that decerebration and decortication posture can occur with hepatic encephalopathy and can be reversible.

### MR findings of decerebrate rigidity with preservation of consciousness [^fce0eba0]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

We describe a case of decerebrate rigidity, with preservation of consciousness, caused by a discrete pontine tegmentum lesion identified on MR imaging. Lesions within a certain brain stem region are responsible for decerebrate rigidity in animal studies, but there has been a lack of MR imaging evidence in humans. This report also implies that a discrete lesion was responsible for the decerebrate rigidity, while consciousness was preserved.

### Clinical observations in acute neurology: a historical explanation of the present [^ded22e62]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Other classic clinical signs require scrutiny. First, clinicians noted extensor rigidity with head retraction in comatose patients, most notably with cerebral hemorrhage extending into the ventricles. (Sir Charles Sherrington, a Nobel laureate in medicine and physiology, described decerebrate rigidity in transected animal experiments, which others confirmed).

Walsche hypothesized that midbrain lesions, lesions of the forebrain or ventricular hemorrhages hindered activity of the midbrain centers. He noted, "yet the lesion does not end here and in almost all of them, there is clear evidence of a progressive and ultimate fatal interference with the function of the vital medullary centers." Decerebrate posturing, after traumatic brain injury, was an acknowledged sign of poor prognosis. Its localizing value in humans is less understood; it is observed in midbrain lesions or lesions involving injury to both hemispheres without brainstem injury or displacement. Moreover, worsening to flaccidity or change to withdrawal or decorticate responses does not clearly correlate with outcome. Both decorticate (pathologic flexion) and decerebrate (pathologic extension) responses indicate severe structural injury. Many patients have a decorticate response on one side and a decerebrate response on the other, or even alternating in the acute stage. Often the "worst" response correlates with the hemispheric lesion. The responses must be different manifestations of a similar lesion rather than being precisely localisable.

The previous century witnessed impressive transformations in understanding the mechanisms of coma, the role of increased intracranial pressure, patterns of brain tissue shift, and clinical correlates. But our understanding of brain herniation remained incomplete. Some explanations were one‐dimensional, focused on pathology, and extrapolated from slow‐growing brain tumors. Nonetheless, clinicians accepted the familiar refrains of "herniation" such as fixed pupils, posturing, agonal breathing patterns, and rostrocaudal deterioration. Some signs resonate because they offer an explanation where no definitive one exists. Admittedly, no recent comprehensive study has unravelled the enigma of how and when brain tissue shift damages the thalamus and upper brainstem, and observing the comatose patient at the bedside shows that clinical deterioration rarely follows characteristic patterns.

C. M. Fisher's detailed paper, 'Neurologic Examination of the Comatose Patient,' revealed remarkable understanding of the variable presentation of impaired consciousness. Fisher emphasized ocular signs in a comatose patient as "the most important of the entire examination". After seeing 10 cases with clinical‐pathological correlation, Fisher described ocular bobbing ('an "intermittent down and up" conjugate movement of the eyes'), which he correlated with pontine pathology. Other novel ocular signs included "wrong‐way eyes", pontine miosis, ocular agitation, doll's eyes, eye closure and blinking, and reflex blepharospasm. Famed for his diligence, Fisher highlighted two findings regarding the depth of coma: eyelid tone and the length of time the eyes remain open after the examiner opens them. New motor observations included bilateral decerebrate posturing resulting from acute lesions involving the supratentorial motor system. Other observations include ventral midbrain syndrome (decerebrate posture with full extraocular movements and fixed pupils in tentorial brainstem compression), ptosis with mass supratentorial lesions, relative silence of cerebellar pressure cone, the 1½ syndrome, and adventitious movements.

### Paroxysmal autonomic instability with dystonia after brain injury… [^4720a431]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

The pathophysiology of PAID can be best explained by dysfunction of autonomic centers in the diencephalon or their connections to cortical, subcortical, and brainstem loci that mediate autonomic function. Bullard2 suggested a release phenomenon in which loss of cortical and subcortical control of vegetative functions occurs, including regulation of blood pressure and temperature. Rigidity and decerebrate posturing are seen experimentally and clinically with lesions in the midbrain, blocking normal inhibitory signals to pontine and vestibular nuclei. 7 This allows these nuclei to become tonically active, transmitting facilitatory signals to the spinal cord control circuits. Spinal reflexes become hyperexcitable, evoked by sensory input signals that are usually below the threshold for excitation of a motor response.

Although some heterogeneity in manifestations has been noted, there is a sufficient degree of uniformity to justify viewing these cases as a syndrome. The cases have in common autonomic dysregulation and rigidity due to dystonia. The PAID syndrome has been reported in children and adults. Traumatic and hypoxic brain injury account for most cases, but some were due to tumors, intracranial hemorrhage, or hydrocephalus. It is most likely to be encountered after processes that produce diffuse axonal or brainstem injury. Abnormal calcium regulation appears to be the basic underlying defect resulting in tonic muscle contraction with production of excessive heat, resulting in a rise in body temperature to as high as 44°C. Skeletal muscle rigidity can be local or diffuse, and is often first observed in the masseter muscles, extremities, and chest.

Damaged muscles release large amounts of tissue thromboplastin, leading to coagulopathy, and myoglobin, leading to myoglobinuria and acute tubular necrosis. Autonomic dysreflexia occurs in individuals with spinal cord injury at the level of T6 through T8 or above. Any noxious stimulus below this level, such as a distended bladder, may initiate reflexive sympathetic activity resulting in life-threatening hypertension uncontrolled by feedback parasympathetic activity. 47 Other manifestations of AD include headache, flushing and sweating of the face and upper torso, and apprehension. Removing the inciting stimulus relieves AD. Patients with spinal cord injury may have brain injuries as well, predisposing them to sympathetic dysregulation at the spinal cord and brain levels.

### Biological and pathogenic blueprint of chandipura virus [^feb15c31]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chandipura virus (CHPV) is a single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus of the family Rhabdoviridae. CHPV is transmitted mainly through infected sandflies. CHPV paediatric encephalitis reported in 2003–2004 in central and south-western parts of India had a case fatality rate of ∼70%. CHPV infection leads to high-grade fever, vomiting, altered sensorium, generalised convulsions, decerebrate posture and coma. Neuroinflammation is the hallmark of CHPV infection and has a pronounced effect on cerebral and brainstem regions. Currently, there are no vaccines or treatments available for CHPV infection. Although previous studies have provided insights into the virus's pathology and host-pathogen interactions, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying CHPV pathogenesis are poorly understood. Understanding molecular pathogenesis is crucial for developing efficacious therapies and preventive measures. The review summarises CHPV epidemiology, transmission, genome structure, replication, pathogenesis and the latest antiviral therapies and vaccine developments.

### Hypotension due to interaction between lisinopril and tizanidine [^2d2abeae]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case in which significant hypotension occurred after initiation of tizanidine in a patient using the antihypertensive agent lisinopril.

Case Summary

A 48-year-old woman was admitted due to cerebral hemorrhage at the midbrain and pons, with extension to the fourth ventricle. Consciousness disturbance (Glasgow coma scale 4) with a decerebrate posture improved 5 days after stroke onset. As the BP was fairly high, antihypertensive agents, including lisinopril, were initiated. Three weeks later, the decerebrate rigidity and high BP remained, and tizanidine was initiated to see whether the decrease in muscle tone could facilitate hypertension control and motor recovery. However, the BP dropped dramatically within 2 hours after the first dose of tizanidine. The tizanidine and all of the antihypertensive medications were withdrawn. Tizanidine was used again after her BP had stabilized, but did not produce similar problems.

Discussion

A similar event was reported in 2000. The reaction in our patient appeared after tizanidine initiation and improved after both lisinopril and tizanidine were discontinued. According to the Naranjo probability scale, this was classified as a possible drug interaction. This kind of reaction is seldom mentioned as occurring during co-administration with tizanidine. With its characteristics, tizanidine has the potential to compromise hemodynamic stability during concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use.

Conclusions

Based upon the literature review, the hypotension in this patient was possibly due to the interaction between tizanidine and lisinopril.

### Calming the storm: dysautonomia for the pediatrician [^ec98fefc]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2017). Low credibility.

Dysautonomia is a potentially life-threatening syndrome seen in many different types of brain injuries. It involves paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity and typically includes a constellation of symptoms, including: tachycardia, tachypnea, hyperthermia, hypertension, diaphoresis, hypertonia, and/or decerebrate or decorticate posturing. It is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion. A multimodal treatment approach is necessary including environmental modifications along with pharmacotherapy. Early management can help prevent comorbidities including secondary brain injury while also improving patient outcomes. This discussion serves as an overview of dysautonomia with a focus on management in the pediatric population including an example of a clinical algorithm and a review of the commonly used medications.

### Reduced stroke volume and brain Perfusion drive postural hyperventilation in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^01956be3]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

In situ animal experimental protocol

The rats were deeply anesthetized only at the onset of the experiment protocol (absent response to noxious tail or hind paw pinch) with 5% isoflurane in air. While under a deep surgical anesthetic plane, rats were bathed in ice-chilled physiological saline solution (115 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO 4, 24 mM NaHCO 3, 1.25 mM NaH 2 PO 4, 2 mM CaCl 2, 10 mM D-glucose, and 12 mM sucrose), spinally transected below the diaphragm near the thoracic-lumbar junction, and decerebrated at the midbrain (ie, the midcollicular level). Rats were then carefully eviscerated with preservation of the phrenic and greater splanchnic nerves before being transferred to an artificial perfusion rig. Once decerebrated, anesthesia is no longer necessary, and the preparation is considered unanesthetized during the subsequently described experimental protocol.

The descending aorta was perfused with physiological saline solution equilibrated with 40 torr CO 2 and balance O 2. The preparation was first perfused with cool (∼15 °C) perfusate and then gradually warmed until the preparation reached 32 to 33 °C. Mean arterial pressure was measured using a dual-lumen cannula and gradually raised to 90 mm Hg with a servo-controlled rotary pump.

To determine whether the brain can modulate respiratory and sympathetic nerve activity during acute changes in perfusion (ie, flow and pressure) independent of peripheral chemo- and baroreceptor input, 2 groups of animals were tested, those with intact and bilateral denervated carotid sinus and common vagus nerves. In both groups, after a 10-minute baseline at constant temperature and pressure, the servo-controlled pump speed was randomized to either decrease pressure to about 60 mm Hg or increase pressure to about 120 mm Hg. Each pressure challenge lasted 30 to 60 seconds. Baseline respiratory and sympathetic nerve activity parameters in preparations with intact and denervated peripheral chemoreceptor and baroreceptor afferents were not different (Supplemental Table 6).

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^4bcdcdc8]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Monitoring

Because treatment modification has not prevented CE and with the strong evidence that early administration of mannitol prevents brain damage and death from this complication, Muir et al. developed a model for early detection. Diagnostic criteria were abnormal motor or verbal response to pain; decorticate or decerebrate posture; cranial nerve palsy (especially III, IV, VI); and abnormal neurogenic respiratory pattern (eg, grunting, tachypnea, Cheyne-Stokes, apneustic). Major criteria were altered mentation/fluctuating level of consciousness; sustained heart rate deceleration (decline more than 20 per minute) not attributable to improved intravascular volume or sleep state; and age-inappropriate incontinence. Minor criteria were vomiting following initial treatment and its cessation, if present at admission; headache (recurrent and more severe than on admission); lethargy or not easily aroused from sleep; diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg; and age < 5 years. The system allowed 92% sensitivity and 96% specificity for the recognition of CE early enough for intervention, using one diagnostic criterion, two major criteria, or one major plus two minor criteria. This means that five youngsters will be treated for CE to prevent brain damage or death in one patient, a reasonable proposition considering the alternative of waiting for more stringent criteria to be met.

### Reduced stroke volume and brain Perfusion drive postural hyperventilation in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^ecd6622c]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

The perfused working heart–brain stem preparation

To investigate the influence of brain perfusion pressure on ventilatory and sympathetic control, we used a an iteration of semi-intact preparation of the rat neurovascular system (the working heart–brain stem preparation). The working heart–brain stem preparation is an established research tool designed to assess the neural mechanisms regulating the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and their coupling in health and disease. In this reduced in situ model, there is no heart, lungs, abdominal viscera, or input from other brain areas (ie, decerebrate), and the brain stem is perfused with artificial blood by a peristaltic pump. This semi-intact model was chosen because: 1) the preparation is eviscerated and exsanguinated, which allows us to assess the effects of brain perfusion on respiratory and sympathetic nerve activity independent of humoral, blood-borne factors, and visceral afferents; 2) respiratory and autonomic nerve activity can be monitored in the absence of peripheral respiratory chemosensory and baroreceptors feedback; 3) the perfusate composition, gases, flow rate, and pressure are under precise experimental control; and 4) the use of a decerebrate preparation eliminates the need for anesthesia, which in turn eliminates its influence on cardiovascular hemodynamic status.

Animals

For the working heart–brain stem preparation, prepubescent male Sprague-Dawley rats (4–6 weeks of age, weight 80–150 g) were used. Male rats were used because they are larger at younger, prepubescent ages, which allows higher flow rates and better perfusion pressure control. Data from preparations lacking rhythmic eupneic phrenic bursts (n = 1) or in which phrenic or sympathetic nerve recordings were lost before protocol completion (n = 4) were excluded. Data presented were obtained from 10 complete preparations.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^685c11ef]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Adequate ventilation is desirable, but there is a tendency for rescue personnel to hyperventilate patients during initial resuscitation. The effect of hyperventilation on bleeding and outcome in patients with severe trauma without TBI is not known. There are several potential mechanisms by which the adverse effects of hyperventilation and hypocapnia could be mediated, including increased vasoconstriction with decreased cerebral blood flow and impaired tissue perfusion. In the setting of absolute or relative hypovolaemia, an excessive rate of positive pressure ventilation may further compromise venous return and produce hypotension and even cardiovascular collapse. A target PaCO 2 should be 5.0–5.5 kPa (35–40 mmHg).

The only situation in which hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia may be desirable is in the context of imminent cerebral herniation, wherein the decrease in cerebral blood flow produced by acute hypocapnia causes a decrease in intracranial pressure. This should be considered only for short periods of time until other measures are effective and in selected cases of imminent brain herniation. The presence of signs such as unilateral or bilateral pupillary dilation or decerebrate posturing are indicators for an extreme risk of imminent death or irreversible brain damage. Given the extreme risk of death if no measures are undertaken, the risk–benefit balance seems favourable; however, it is important to normalise PaCO 2 as soon as feasible.

Ventilation with low tidal volume (around 6 mL/kg) is now recommended in all patients treated with mechanical ventilation, including during surgery.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^ef858192]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The effect of hyperventilation on bleeding and outcome in patients with severe trauma without TBI is not known. There are several potential mechanisms by which the adverse effects of hyperventilation and hypocapnia could be mediated, including increased vasoconstriction with decreased cerebral blood flow and impaired tissue perfusion. Cerebral tissue lactic acidosis has been shown to occur almost immediately after induction of hypocapnia in children and adults with TBI and haemorrhagic shock. In addition, an even modest level of hypocapnia [< 27 mmHg (3.6 kPa)] may result in neuronal depolarisation with glutamate release and extension of the primary injury via apoptosis. In the setting of absolute or relative hypovolaemia, an excessive rate of positive-pressure ventilation may further compromise venous return and produce hypotension and even cardiovascular collapse.

The only situation in which hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia may play a potential role is imminent cerebral herniation. The decrease in cerebral blood flow produced by acute hypocapnia during hyperventilation causes a decrease in intracranial pressure that can be used for short periods of time and in selected cases such as imminent brain herniation. The presence of signs such as unilateral or bilateral pupillary dilation or decerebrate posturing are indicators for an extreme risk of imminent death or irreversible brain damage. Hyperventilation may be used under these circumstances to try to gain time until other measures are effective. There are no clinical studies that evaluate this practice, however, there is a clear physiological rationale. Given the extreme risk of death if no measures are undertaken, the risk–benefit balance seems favourable, however it is important to normalise PaCO 2 as soon as feasible.

Ventilation with low tidal volume (6 ml/kg) is recommended in patients with or at risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In patients with normal lung function, the data is more controversial, but there is increasing evidence to support the idea that the injurious effect of high tidal volume may be initiated very early. Randomised studies demonstrate that short-term ventilation (< 5 h) with high tidal volume (12 ml/kg) without positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may promote pulmonary inflammation and alveolar coagulation in patients with normal lung function. Although more studies are needed, the early use of protective ventilation with low tidal volume and moderate PEEP is recommended, particularly in bleeding trauma patients, who are all at risk of ARDS.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^02d57473]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

While adequate ventilation can affect the outcome of severe trauma patients, there is a tendency for rescue personnel to hyperventilate patients during initial resuscitation. Hyperventilated trauma patients appear to have increased mortality when compared with non-hyperventilated patients. Target PaCO 2 should be 5.0–5.5 kPa (35–40 mmHg).

The effect of hyperventilation on bleeding and outcome in patients with severe trauma without TBI is not known. There are several potential mechanisms by which the adverse effects of hyperventilation and hypocapnia could be mediated, including increased vasoconstriction with decreased cerebral blood flow and impaired tissue perfusion. Cerebral tissue lactic acidosis has been shown to occur almost immediately after induction of hypocapnia in children and adults with TBI and haemorrhagic shock. In addition, even a modest level of hypocapnia [< 27 mmHg (3.6 kPa)] may result in neuronal depolarisation with glutamate release and exacerbation of the primary injury via apoptosis. In the setting of absolute or relative hypovolaemia, an excessive rate of positive pressure ventilation may further compromise venous return and produce hypotension and even cardiovascular collapse.

The only situation in which hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia may play a potential role is imminent cerebral herniation. The decrease in cerebral blood flow produced by acute hypocapnia during hyperventilation causes a decrease in intracranial pressure that can be used for short periods of time and in selected cases such as imminent brain herniation. The presence of signs such as unilateral or bilateral pupillary dilation or decerebrate posturing are indicators for an extreme risk of imminent death or irreversible brain damage. Hyperventilation may be used under these circumstances to try to gain time until other measures are effective. There are no clinical studies that evaluate this practice; however, there is a clear physiological rationale. Given the extreme risk of death if no measures are undertaken, the risk–benefit balance seems favourable; however, it is important to normalise PaCO 2 as soon as feasible.

### Anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of the pedunculopontine nucleus [^a33b31da]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

The pedunculopontine nucleus is composed of cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurones and is located in the caudal pontomesencephalic tegmentum. Evidence suggests that the nucleus plays a role in the production and control of movement. The nucleus has dense interconnections with the basal ganglia, as well as with other areas of the brain associated with motor control. Electrical stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus in the decerebrate cat or rat produces organized locomotor movements. Physiological studies show that the pedunculopontine nucleus modulates its activity in response to locomotion, as well as voluntary arm and eye movements. Degeneration of the pedunculopontine nucleus is seen in post-mortem brains in humans with Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonian syndromes. In animal models of Parkinson's disease, metabolic changes are seen in the pedunculopontine nucleus, and chemical inhibition or mechanical disruption of the nucleus can produce an akinetic state in animals and man. In this paper we review the literature in support of the suggestion that some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are caused by dysfunction of the pedunculopontine nucleus. In accordance with this view, direct stimulation of the nucleus can ameliorate some symptoms of the disease, as demonstrated in both experimental animals and man.

### Clinical observations in acute neurology: a historical explanation of the present [^deeddb04]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fisher also questioned the extrapolation of animal studies to humans. These included Sherrington's cat experiments, the concept of uncal herniation (midbrain involvement rather than herniating tissue compressing the oculomotor nerve), and even tendon reflexes in coma ("not of great value in assessing the state of the nervous system").

Earlier, McNealy and Plum's published observations of clinical deterioration and elucidation of two brain‐herniation syndromes and offered the first description of the clinical course of a deteriorating patient with expanding mass effect. The clinical patterns of rostrocaudal deterioration, which correlated to structures involved and mass location, provided generations of neurologists with a framework to pursue at the bedside. Displacements were grouped into either central or uncal syndrome. Central syndrome comprised diencephalon, mesencephalon, and pontine involvement successively, and the uncal syndrome, due to its encroaching on the oculomotor nerve, started with a fixed, dilated pupil followed by mesencephalon and pons involvement in a similar caudal direction. McNealy and Plum emphasized changes in pupils, eye movements and position, worsening motor responses to abnormal posturing (decerebrate or decorticate), and changes in respiratory patterns (Cheyne‐Stokes, central hyperventilation, and ataxic and apneustic breathing). Despite being based on a small number of closely observed patients, it became the last word on the subject.

### Decerebrate posturing following traumatic brain injury: MRI findings and their diagnostic value [^7c9f3482]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine the pathomorphological and clinical background to decerebrate posturing in humans following serious traumatic brain injury.

Materials and Methods

One hundred and twenty patients who had been unconscious for more than 24 h underwent diagnostic MRI within 8 days after trauma. The presence of decerebrate rigidity as the clinical parameter was correlated to MRI findings, such as traumatic lesions in defined brain areas. Significance was presumed as p < 0.05.

Results

On the day of MRI 43 (36%) patients exhibited decerebrate posturing: 19 (23%) cases were unilateral and 24 (77%) bilateral. There was a significant correlation between midbrain lesions and the presence of rigidity. If a midbrain lesion was found in the absence of pontine lesions, decerebrate rigidity could be concluded (p < 0.05). There was no significant correlation to the rigidity in the case of midbrain lesions accompanied by pontine lesions, and no correlation to the rigidity could be detected for other regions of the brain. Both the occurrence of decerebrate posturing and the detection of brainstem lesions at MRI correlated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale. The combination of both parameters improved the probability of predicting the outcome.

Conclusion

The rate of decerebrate posturing increases significantly in the presence of midbrain lesions. The presence of pontine lesions appears to be of secondary importance. The chances of predicting the Glasgow Outcome Scale are improved by the combination of clinical information (decerebrate posturing) and radiological parameters (type of brainstem lesion).

### Reduced stroke volume and brain Perfusion drive postural hyperventilation in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^04caf0e5]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Reduced brain perfusion increases sympathorespiratory nerve activity in an in situ preparation

To test whether changes in brain perfusion modulate respiratory and sympathetic nerve activity independent of peripheral chemoreceptor and baroreceptor input, we used a rotary pump system to manipulate perfusion pressure in an arterially perfused in situ preparation with bilateral denervation of carotid sinus and common vagus nerves (n = 5) (Figure 4A). Perfusion pressure was randomly increased and decreased (Figure 4B, top), while phrenic (Figure 4B, middle) and splanchnic (Figure 4B, bottom) nerve activities were continuously recorded. Here, we observed that a reduction in brain perfusion pressure increased respiratory (Figure 4C) and sympathetic (Figure 4D) nerve activity relative to baseline. When perfusion pressure was raised, respiratory nerve activity decreased relative to baseline (Figure 4C), whereas sympathetic nerve activity was not significantly changed (Figure 4D).

(A) The decerebrate rat preparation is perfused via the cannulated descending aorta. Spontaneous phrenic nerve (respiratory efferent) and greater splanchnic nerve (sympathetic efferent) activity are recorded in parallel with perfusion pressure changes. (B) Perfusion pressure was randomly increased and decreased (top) in preparations with denervated (top left) (n = 5) and intact (top right) (n = 5) peripheral chemoreceptor and baroreceptor afferents while phrenic (middle) and splanchnic (bottom) nerve activity was continuously measured. (C) Respiratory nerve activity and (D) sympathetic nerve activity were both reflexively inhibited and activated in response to high and low perfusion pressure, respectively. This pattern was observed in both denervated and intact rats. ✱ p< 0.05, ✱✱ p< 0.01, and ✱✱✱ p< 0.001 represent values significantly different from the normalized baseline of 1.0. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Respiratory and sympathetic nerve activity during pressure challenges in intact vs denervated animals were compared using a 2-factor mixed-effects model, Bonferroni post hoc analysis.

ASTCT ICANS consensus grading for children defines grade-specific criteria across neurotoxicity domains. ICE score (age ≥ 12 years) thresholds are 7–9 for grade 1, 3–6 for grade 2, 0–2 for grade 3, and 0 (patient is unarousable) for grade 4, while CAPD score (age < 12 years) uses 1–8 for grade 1, 1–8 for grade 2, ≥ 9 for grade 3, and "Unable to perform CAPD" for grade 4. Depressed level of consciousness progresses from "Awakens spontaneously" (grade 1) to "Awakens to voice" (grade 2), "Awakens only to tactile stimulus" (grade 3), and "Unarousable or requires vigorous or repetitive tactile stimuli to arouse" (grade 4). For seizures, the table lists N/A for the first two grade columns, grade 3 as "Any clinical seizure focal or generalized that resolves rapidly or non-convulsive seizures on EEG that resolve with intervention," and grade 4 as "Life-threatening prolonged seizure (> 5min), repetitive clinical or electrical seizures without return to baseline in between." Motor weakness is N/A for the first three grades, with grade 4 including "Deep focal motor weakness such as hemiparesis or paraparesis." Elevated ICP/cerebral edema is N/A for the first two grades, with grade 3 "Focal/local edema on neuroimaging" and grade 4 "Diffuse cerebral edema on neuroimaging; decerebrate or decorticate posturing, cranial nerve VI palsy, papilledema, or Cushing's triad." ICANS grade is determined by the most severe event not attributable to any other cause and should consider baseline ICE or CAPD scores; a patient with an ICE score of 0 may be classified as grade 3 ICANS if awake with global aphasia, but may be grade 4 if unarousable.

### Clinical observations in acute neurology: a historical explanation of the present [^e0f6646f]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Looking back at other developments, we must ask how new knowledge influenced decisions, especially concerns about the appropriateness of major neurosurgical procedures, and documentation of success versus failure. Neurosurgeons could randomly decide whether certain preoperative presentations warranted emergency surgery. Development of extensor posturing was traditionally associated with futility. Decerebrate posturing had prognostic import, especially when associated with supratentorial space‐taking lesions (i.e. hemorrhage, abscess, or tumor). However, these dicta changed, and except with loss of brainstem reflexes, neurosurgical intervention often proceeds in patients with a supratentorial mass. Other clinical conditions, such as cerebellar swelling, brainstem compression, or acute hydrocephalus, when treated immediately, can restore pontomesencephalic brainstem reflexes. Although studies in the preoperative prediction of neurologic examination remain scarce, motor responses, pupil reflexes and size, and eye position became less critical in neurosurgical decision making when better‐than‐expected recoveries resulted. Patients with acute ventricular enlargement, fixed pupils, and extensor posturing can improve rapidly after ventriculostomy placement. Patients with large acute cerebellar lesions pressing on the brainstem can awaken after lesion evacuation. Since the 1960s, clinical signs of coma were used to predict awakening and outcome. It remains a formidable assignment but must be done regularly. Neurologists understandably struggle.

Specialized "units" proliferated in Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States, and elsewhere, each representing different expertise. Surgical recovery units became surgical intensive care units (ICUs); patients with treatable cardiac arrhythmias after myocardial infarction or requiring complex hemodynamic support led to coronary care units. Patients with multi‐organ trauma ended up in trauma ICUs, coordinated by trauma surgeons and, later, surgical intensivists. Similarly, hospitals opened burns units. Neurosurgeon Walter Dandy opened one of the first neuroscience ICUs at Johns Hopkins University in 1932, by refurbishing a ward to admit his sickest postoperative neurosurgical patients. Twenty years later, the Mayo Clinic opened the first newly built, combined neurosciences ICU at Saint Mary's Hospital and admitted neurologic and neurosurgical patients (Figure 4). Pandemics, particularly the 1950s polio pandemics, promoted specialized respiratory units in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

### Transient ischaemic attacks: mimics and chameleons [^8992de07]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Chameleons

Limb-shaking TIAs

Rhythmic, involuntary jerky limb movements can occur in haemodynamic TIAs, which may thus be mistaken for focal motor seizures. The presence of limb shaking is a well-established sign of hemisphere hypoperfusion, due to severe carotid or middle cerebral artery disease. The episodes tend to be brief (< 5 min), recurrent and avoid the face. They can be precipitated by activities that may reduce cerebral blood flow (such as postural change, coughing and exercise). Previously reported cases do not exhibit the Jacksonian march typical of focal motor seizures, the other main differential for this presentation. MRI, including DWI sequences, can help in showing a classical 'borderzone' pattern of established or recent ischaemia, especially if symptoms are prolonged or recurrent (figure 4).

Figure 4
Imaging from a patient who presented with recurrent attacks of rhythmic jerking of the left arm, related to changing from a sitting to standing position. (A) MR angiogram showing critical right middle cerebral artery stenosis. (B) Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI showing high signals in the right hemisphere white matter in a 'borderzone' distribution.

TIAs with altered conscious level or other brainstem symptoms

Loss of consciousness is not characteristic of a TIA. However, transient ischaemia of the thalami or brainstem can very rarely cause such symptoms. We have very occasionally seen patients who give a classical history of transient quadriparesis with intact cognition suggesting a 'locked-in' TIA due to brainstem ischaemia.

Spontaneous limb movements or posturing due to brainstem ischaemia

Occasionally, rhythmic movements of the limbs can accompany acute brainstem ischaemia. These movements may be seizure-like rhythmic jerking, sometimes with prolonged tonic muscle contractions. The movements may be intermittent, and easily confused with a seizure. It is vitally important clinically to recognise the possibility of brainstem ischaemia in such cases, as they may be a warning of impending brainstem infarction from basilar thrombosis. The pathophysiology of these movements is not well understood: they may represent a 'release phenomenon' resembling 'decerebrate' posturing, or disturbance of function of the reticular formation.

ASTCT ICANS consensus grading for adults — Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is graded across domains, with ICE (Effector Cell-Associated Encephalopathy) score ranges of "7–9" (grade 1), "3–6" (grade 2), "0–2" (grade 3), and "0 (patient is unarousable)" (grade 4). Depressed consciousness progresses from "Awakens spontaneously" to "Awakens to voice," "Awakens only to tactile stimulus," and then "Patient is unarousable or requires vigorous or repetitive tactile stimuli to arouse; stupor or coma." Seizure criteria advance from "Any clinical seizure… or non-convulsive seizures on EEG… resolve with intervention" to "Life-threatening prolonged seizure (> 5min), repetitive clinical or electrical seizures without return to baseline in between." Motor findings for grade 4 include "Deep focal motor weakness such as hemiparesis or paraplegia," and cerebral edema escalates from "Focal/local edema on neuroimaging" to "Diffuse cerebral edema on neuroimaging, decerebrate or decorticate posturing, cranial nerve VI palsy, papilledema, or Cushing's triad." ICANS grade "is determined by the most severe event not attributable to any other cause," with the note that "a patient with an ICE score of 0 may be classified as grade 3 ICANS if awake with global aphasia" but "may be classified as grade 4 ICANS if unarousable." Tremors/myoclonus "may be graded according to CTCAE V5.0, but they do not influence ICANS grading," and "Intracranial hemorrhage… is excluded from ICANS grading."

### The underappreciated but potentially lethal role of brainstem dysfunction in epilepsy [^fd68f921]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

The investigators found that brainstem posturing (decerebrate, decorticate, hemi-decerebrate), which was present in two-thirds of seizures, was significantly associated with the presence and duration of PGES. The longest episodes of PGES were seen in seizures with ictal decerebration, and the shortest episodes were observed during events associated with hemi-decerebration, but no clear differences in PGES patterns were noted between seizures occurring during wakefulness versus sleep. Also, the duration of tonic posturing was associated with hypoxemia duration and SpO 2 recovery, and postictal posturing was also associated with longer hypoxemia and SpO 2 recovery, as well as a markedly increased risk of post-convulsive central apnea. Prior work by the authors demonstrated that post-convulsive central apnea may represent an important biomarker of SUDEP. Based on the presently highlighted results, the authors conclude that brainstem semiology is related to seizure severity markers such as PGES and peri-ictal breathing dysfunction, with a clear relationship between semiologic severity and these measures of neurologic and respiratory compromise.

Overall, the findings of Vilella and colleagues provide a compelling suggestion that brainstem posturing during and following generalized seizures is associated with clinical factors that may increase SUDEP risk. The authors acknowledge that a limitation of the study is that these conclusions can only be indirectly presumed. SUDEP outcomes were not included in this patient population, and tonic posturing is not a direct indication of brainstem influence of seizure activity. Nevertheless, the case for brainstem involvement in epilepsy and its potential relationship to SUDEP has been supported by various human and animal studies.

In rodent models of temporal lobe epilepsy, limbic seizure activity has been shown to spread to subcortical arousal centers, including brainstem serotonergic nuclei, which may contribute to suppression of neocortical activity and behavior. Also, human neuroimaging studies have demonstrated brainstem atrophy and network disruption in focal epilepsy patients which may affect both caudal respiratory centers and rostral arousal networks. It is possible that SUDEP involves not only seizure-induced hypoventilation, potentially influenced by the spread of seizure spread from amygdala to the brainstem, but also a subsequent failure of normal arousability from hypercapnia, which requires the brainstem ascending reticular activating system. Continued mechanistic studies in animal models and neuroimaging investigations of human patients focusing on the potential contributions of brainstem dysfunction to SUDEP will be critical moving forward.

We present a pediatric case of acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA 2.0 infection. A previously healthy girl presented with ataxia and diplopia three weeks after the COVID-19 confirmation from a nasopharyngeal swab. Acute and symmetrical motor weakness and drowsiness ensued within the following 3 days. She then became spastic tetraplegic. MRI revealed multifocal lesions in the cerebral white matter, basal ganglia, and brainstem, with hemorrhagic changes confirmed with T1-hyperintensity and hypointensity on susceptibility-weighted images. Peripheral areas of decreased diffusion, increased blood flow, and rim contrast enhancement were noted in the majority of lesions. She was treated with a combination of intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Neurological deterioration ensued with coma, ataxic respiratory pattern and decerebrate posture. Repeated MRI performed on day 31 revealed progression of abnormalities, hemorrhages and brain herniation. Despite the administration of plasma exchange, she died two months after admission.

### Medication-induced acute dystonic reaction: the challenge of diagnosing movement disorders in the intensive care unit [^de7d965f]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 62-year-old man presented with left middle cerebral artery stroke. 1h postadministration of tissue plasminogen activator, he received a total of 4mg of haloperidol for combativeness. He developed partial complex status epilepticus, requiring benzodiazepines, phenytoin, propofol and intubation. 5h later, he developed recurrent stereotyped tonic movements involving arching of the back, extension of the arms and contraction of opposing muscle groups. Repeat CT scan of the head showed evolving insular infarct. Differential diagnoses for these movements included tonic/clonic seizures, extensor (decerebrate) posturing from haemorrhagic conversion, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or dystonic reaction. Given the lack of response to antiseizure medications, the recent administration of haloperidol, and the prompt resolution of movements following diphenhydramine administration, an acute dystonic reaction was considered. This atypical case of a critically ill patient with stroke highlights the fact that these patients may have multiple abnormal movements requiring careful analysis to guide diagnosis-specific management.

### When apnea turns terminal: when, how, why? [^5b3b1a06]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

There is an interesting link between ictally driven apnea and postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES). In humans, the occurrence and duration of PGES has been linked to tonic decerebrate posturing. In turn, postictal tonic decerebrate posturing was found to be associated with the presence of PCCA and prolonged hypoxemia, which represent suspected SUDEP biomarkers. Wenker et al therefore evaluated PGES in the Scn8a model. However, they did not find difference in the PGES magnitude between the fatal and non-fatal tonic seizures. Nevertheless, PGES duration was not evaluated and the relevance of this EEG marker for SUDEP risk in this model remains uncertain.

Current work by Wenker et al contributes towards further understanding of mechanisms underlying the ictally generated respiratory failure leading up to SUDEP. However, several important questions remain; (1) What mechanisms underlie lethal seizure and terminal apnea? For example, we know that ictally activated brainstem spreading depolarization can lead to apnea and resultant cardio-respiratory collapse. Scn8a deficiency can cause wide spread transcriptional alterationsand their role in SUDEP risk remains to be elucidated. And the Kv1.1 model indicates that recurrent seizures may cause structural changes in cardiorespiratory networksas also observed on imaging of SUDEP cases.(2) Are there additional mechanical barriers in lethal vs non-lethal apnea? Experimental evidence indicates that in some cases, ictally driven and brain stem mediated reflex laryngospasm produces severe, prolonged obstructive apnea, causing respiratory arrest. Additional studies across diverse SUDEP models will be informative.(3) Are there therapeutic interventions that might modulate the risk of respiratory arrest? In DBA1 mouse, respiratory arrest and mortality were preventable in a dose dependent manner with the modulation of serotonergic pathways, It remains to be seen whether this approach will be more broadly effective.

### A parabrachial hub for need-state control of enduring pain [^38a85f06]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Deconstructing the various aspects of pain has been a challenge for centuries. The idea that pain is a global brain and body state rather than a transient sensory experience has become widely accepted. Identifying, describing and quantifying this state, especially in preclinical models, is an important step in developing treatments for pain. Assessing pain state, however, requires going beyond traditional behavioural measures, as pain states persist when animals are not actively engaged in coping behaviours. For example, unbiased computational assessments of posture or facial expressions have recently been used to infer emotional states including the negative affect associated with pain. Here we find evidence for two additional indices of pain state — neurophysiological signatures of longer lasting pain states and behavioural modelling based on control theory. These methods can also ultimately be used to test how pain states are affected by physiological, environmental or therapeutic interventions.

Using neural activity recordings and modelling, we show that persistent pain states lead to sustained activity selectively in Y1R neurons of the lPBN. Prolonged pain in the absence of an external noxious stimulus is likely to reflect changes in peripheral systems and central neural networks that relay information to the brain. As the PBN is a key brain site to which spinal nociceptive pathways project, the Y1R neurons are positioned to serve as a sensor for persistent pain. We find the Y1R neurons are both spatiallyand molecularly, distributed across previously identified PBN regions and neuron populations. The Y1 receptor is expressed in roughly 20% of the functional and molecular subclasses of neurons that have previously been identified to modulate specific pain behaviours in response to noxious stimuli or different types of injury, (Supplementary Table 4). Thus, Y1R neurons in the PBN are positioned to sample various inputs and influence outputs of many PBN neuron types. This ensemble appears to be less important for signalling the acute responses to specific injuries or transient noxious stimuli but rather serves as a sentinel for ongoing affective changes and coping behaviours that occur following injury.

### ASTCT consensus grading for cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity associated with immune effector cells [^e1bf308e]. Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

ASTCT ICANS grading for children — domain thresholds and definitions state that ICANS grade is determined by the most severe event not attributable to another cause, incorporating ICE/CAPD scores, level of consciousness, seizures, motor findings, and raised intracranial pressure (ICP)/cerebral edema. ICE score grading lists grade 1: 7–9, grade 2: 3–6, grade 3: 0–2, and grade 4: 0 (patient is unarousable and unable to perform ICE). For CAPD, grade 1: 1–8, grade 2: 1–8, grade 3: ≥ 9, and grade 4: unable to perform CAPD. Depressed level of consciousness is graded as grade 1: awakens spontaneously, grade 2: awakens to voice, grade 3: awakens only to tactile stimulus, and grade 4: unarousable or requires vigorous or repetitive tactile stimuli to arouse; stupor or coma. Seizures are graded with grade 3 defined as any clinical seizure that resolves rapidly or nonconvulsive seizures on EEG that resolve with intervention, and grade 4 as life-threatening prolonged seizure (> 5 min) or repetitive clinical or electrical seizures without return to baseline in between. Motor weakness is grade 4 when deep focal motor weakness occurs, such as hemiparesis or paraparesis. Elevated ICP/cerebral edema is grade 4 when there is decerebrate or decorticate posturing, cranial nerve VI palsy, papilledema, Cushing's triad, or signs of diffuse cerebral edema on neuroimaging.

1979. 00500460052006.
- Seven cases of upward transtentorial herniation occurred. In each patient, coma with reactive, miotic pupils, asymmetrical or absent caloric responses, and decerebrate posture indicated brain-stem compression. In this setting, the development of unequal, then midposition, fixed pupils signaled midbrain failure from upward herniation. Vertebral angiography showed upward displacement of the superior cerebellar arteries. Results of autopsy confirmed the existence of grooving of the vermis by the tentorial margins and, in one case, of anterior displacement and distortion of the midbrain. In five of 45 reported cases of upward herniation, the conditions were diagnosed antemortem. Instances of cerebellar hematoma and tumor predominated.

In at least seven patients, performance of ventriculography may have precipitated herniation. Clinical details were provided in only nine patients and did not separate upward herniation from brain-stem compression. Cerebellar ischemic infarct found in one of our patients is a rarely reported cause of upward herniation. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Gaza: providing emergency care under fire [^a7d38668]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The number of tragic stories is exponential, such as a single survivor from a whole wider family group and innumerable patients who, on a normal day, would attend the hospital and survive to go home but who die because we do not have the capacity to care for them.

A couple of weeks ago, one of our colleagues from the critical care unit was walking on the street to buy some milk for his children and he was caught in an airstrike. He attended our Emergency Department with a traumatic pneumothorax and multiple limb fractures. We were able to save his life, but he is now unable to walk. We sadly lost a dental colleague who was killed, again, simply walking in the street.

We look very much to the international community and humanitarian organisations to bear witness to this immense human suffering. We especially welcome the support of emergency medicine societies across the world who will understand the magnitude of what we are facing. Outwith the utter devastation, if we can survive this war, the skills and knowledge we have gained will prove useful to our colleagues. We are seeing devastating injuries, many of which we may have read about in textbooks and expected to see once or twice in a career and yet we are facing them dozens of times over. These include the so-called high acuity, low occurrence (HALO) procedures like emergency caesarean section and clamshell thoracotomy. In our day-to-day practice HALO now seems like a misnomer.

We have extensive experience of performing intubations and chest drains with the patient on the ground when there is often no bed. We are learning that the text-book approach may not be the most effective when faced with the reality of needing to perform many procedures. Even our experience of Glasgow Coma Score as an outcome predictor in the paediatric group has been repeatedly challenged. We have found many cases where a child has decerebrate or decorticate posturing and a normal CT head scan, who might seem to be in an unsurvivable state, but if ventilated and oxygenated they can make a full recovery. These cases are likely to have been pulled from beneath the rubble and subject to dust inhalation/suffocation leading to hypoxia and therefore abnormal posturing, rather than being primarily victims of a head injury.

### Holmes tremor: application of modern neuroimaging techniques [^363f9865]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Holmes tremor has a characteristic rest, intention, and postural component. The syndrome arises as a consequence of a lesion in the upper brainstem and cerebral peduncles, which, it is postulated, interrupts the cerebello-rubrothalamic pathway. Ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and bradykinesia are associated features. We present a case of Holmes tremor secondary to a midbrain cavernoma. Modern neuroimaging techniques in this case confirm that a combination of damage to the cerebello-rubrothalamic pathway and the nigrostriatal pathway is required for the full Holmes tremor syndrome to occur.

### Stroke and death due to spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^4947c99b]. Neurocritical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension has become a well-recognized cause of headaches and a wide variety of other manifestations have been reported. Recently, several patients with asymptomatic spontaneous intracranial hypotension were reported. I now report two patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension who developed multiple arterial strokes associated with death in one patient, illustrating the spectrum of disease severity in spontaneous intracranial hypotension.

Methods

Medical records and radiologic imaging of the two patients were reviewed.

Results

Case 1. A 45-year-old man presented with an orthostatic headache. Neurologic examination was normal. MRI showed bilateral subdural fluid collections, brain sagging, and pachymeningeal enhancement. At lumbar puncture, the opening pressure was too low to record. He underwent two epidural blood patches with transient improvement of symptoms. His headaches progressed and a CT-myelogram showed a lower cervical CSF leak. Subsequently, periodic lethargy and confusion was noted and he then rapidly deteriorated. Examination showed coma (GCS: 4 [E1, M2, V1]), a fixed and dilated right pupil, and decerebrate posturing. Bilateral craniotomies were performed for the evacuation of chronic subdural hematomas. Immediate postoperative CT showed bilateral posterior cerebral artery infarcts and a recurrent right subdural hematoma, requiring re-evacuation. Postoperative examination was consistent with brain death and support was withdrawn. Case 2. A 42-year-old man presented with a non-positional headache. Neurologic examination was normal. CT showed bilateral acute on chronic subdural hematomas and effacement of the basilar cisterns. MRI showed brain sagging, bilateral subdural hematomas, and pachymeningeal enhancement. Bilateral craniotomies were performed and subdural hematomas were evacuated. Postoperatively, the patient became progressively lethargic (GCS: 8 [E2, M4, V2]) and variable degrees of pupillary asymmetry and quadriparesis were noted. MRI now also showed multiple areas of restricted diffusion in the pons and midbrain, consistent with multiple infarcts. CT showed worsening subdural fluid collections with midline shift and increased effacement of the basilar cisterns. Repeat bilateral craniotomies were performed for evacuation of the subdural fluid collections. Neurologic examination was then noted to be fluctuating but clearly improved when lying flat (GCS: 10T [E4, M6, VT]). CT-myelography demonstrated an extensive cervico-thoracic CSF leak. An epidural blood patch was performed. The patient made a good, but incomplete, recovery with residual quadriparesis and dysphagia.

Conclusions

Arterial cerebral infarcts are rare, but potentially life-threatening complications of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. The strokes are due to downward displacement of the brain and can be precipitated by craniotomy for evacuation of associated subdural hematomas.

### Cerebral causes and consequences of parkinsonian resting tremor: a tale of two circuits? [^d9230576]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Post-mortem studies

Patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease have milder cell loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (particularly in the lateral portion) and in the locus coeruleus than patients with non-tremor Parkinson's disease. This suggests that patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease have less dopaminergic (and possibly also less nor-adrenergic) dysfunction than non-tremor patients. This could explain some of the clinical advantages that are associated with tremor. On the other hand, patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease have considerably more cell loss in the retrorubral area of the midbrain, as assessed in a post-mortem study comparing six patients with tremulous Parkinson's disease to five patients with non-tremor Parkinson's disease. The small sample size in this study warrants caution although confirmatory evidence came from animal work. In non-human primates, the retrorubral area contains ∼10% of the mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, compared with 76% in the substantia nigra pars compacta and 14% in the ventral tegmental area. Injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) destroys these dopaminergic neurons, but with marked differences between species. Clinically, rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkeys develop infrequent and brief episodes of high-frequency tremor, whereas vervet (African green) monkeys frequently have prolonged episodes of low-frequency resting tremor. Both species develop akinesia, rigidity and severe postural instability. Thus, vervet monkeys resemble the tremulous Parkinson's disease subtype, while rhesus monkeys resemble the non-tremor Parkinson's disease subtype. There are no studies directly comparing the spatial topography of MPTP-induced neural damage between these species, but in vervet monkeys, the retrorubral area (A8) is preferentially damaged, while in rhesus monkeys, the substantia nigra pars compacta (A9) is more affected. Although circumstantial, these observations lend further support to the idea that tremor is related to — and possibly caused by — dopaminergic cell loss in the retrorubral area. The retrorubral area could produce tremor via its dopaminergic projections to, among other regions, the subthalamic region and the pallidum. Accordingly, a study in parkinsonian vervet monkeys found that tremor severity correlated exclusively with dopaminergic fibres in the external globus pallidus. Similarly, a post-mortem study in patients with Parkinson's disease showed that clinical tremor severity was correlated exclusively with concentrations of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid in the pallidum. Taken together, these data suggest that tremor might result from pallidal dysfunction, triggered by a specific loss of dopaminergic projections from the retrorubral area. Note that not all findings consistently point in this direction: a recent post-mortem study showed higher dopamine levels in the ventral internal globus pallidus of patients with tremor-dominant than non-tremor Parkinson's disease. However, only few data points were measured (a single hemisphere of two tremor-dominant patients), which limit the interpretation of these results. New imaging techniques may confirm the role of the retrorubral area in tremor in vivo, for example by measuring N -acetyl-aspartate (a marker of neuronal viability) in the retrorubral area with magnetic resonance spectroscopy or by measuring connectivity between the retrorubral area and the basal ganglia using diffusion tensor imaging and functional MRI.

### Don't throw in the towel! A case of reversible coma [^4e21f6e5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

A young woman with pre-eclampsia became unresponsive shortly after delivery. Examination revealed extensive brain stem dysfunction with absent pupillary light reflexes and decerebrate posturing. Computed tomography showed hypodensity throughout the brain stem, and it was initially thought that she had suffered catastrophic brain stem infarction. However, magnetic resonance diffusion imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient mapping showed that she had brain stem vasogenic oedema (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, PRES), rather than cytotoxic oedema. With antihypertensive and supportive treatment, she recovered rapidly, and had no abnormalities on repeat imaging.

We report a case of neonatal withdrawal syndrome after in utero exposure to paroxetine 20 mg/day. The infant's symptoms, such as poor neonatal adaptation, respiratory distress, decerebrate posturing, irritability and tremors, commenced soon after birth and persisted for 5 days. All neonates exposed to antidepressants, particularly serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), during the last trimester should be followed-up closely for adverse symptoms.

### A case of successful treatment of a patient with hyperglycemia of 2700 mg / dL [^83704825]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

A 34-year-old man with obesity who was an avid consumer of soft drinks was found in a coma after complaining of a poor physical condition for a few days. On arrival, he had hyperglycemia of 2700 mg/dL, coma, shock, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, acute pancreatitis, liver dysfunction, and systemic mycosis. The rapid infusion of a large volume of isotonic saline, insulin, antibiotics, and ulinastatin was performed, and mechanical ventilation was applied. The treatment was complicated by transient hypernatremia resulting from osmostasis, which gradually decreased. He demonstrated transient decerebrate posturing upon stimulation; however, he became conscious within a week of admission, and his associated diseases also improved. After correcting his hyperglycemia, the patient was discharged on foot. We report our case of a patient with hyperglycemia of 2700 mg/dL, which was the highest value reported in the English literature. During the correction of the hyperglycemia, transient hypernatremia occurred to prevent abrupt decrease in osmolality, which thus resulted in cell swelling.

### ASTCT consensus grading for cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity associated with immune effector cells [^337604ec]. Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

ASTCT ICANS consensus grading for adults — grading is determined by the most severe domain finding and domain-specific criteria are defined. Depressed level of consciousness: grade 1 awakens spontaneously, grade 2 awakens to voice, grade 3 awakens only to tactile stimulus, and grade 4 patient is unarousable or requires vigorous or repetitive tactile stimuli to arouse with stupor or coma. Seizures: grade 3 includes any clinical seizure (focal or generalized) that resolves rapidly or nonconvulsive seizures on EEG that resolve with intervention, and grade 4 includes life-threatening prolonged seizure (> 5 min) or repetitive clinical or electrical seizures without return to baseline in between; the text clarifies that a single clinical or subclinical electrographic seizure of any type is grade 3 and that prolonged or repetitive clinical or subclinical electrographic seizures without a return to baseline in between are grade 4. Motor findings contributing to grade 4 are deep focal motor weakness such as hemiparesis or paraparesis. Elevated ICP/cerebral edema: grade 3 is focal/local edema on neuroimaging and grade 4 is diffuse cerebral edema on neuroimaging; decerebrate or decorticate posturing; or cranial nerve VI palsy; or papilledema; or Cushing's triad. Notes specify that ICANS grade is determined by the most severe event, that a patient with an ICE score of 0 may be classified as grade 3 ICANS if awake with global aphasia or grade 4 ICANS if unarousable, and that tremor/myoclonus and intracranial hemorrhage are excluded from ICANS grading and may be graded by CTCAE v5.0.

### Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis: results of the Canadian paediatric surveillance program and review of the literature [^7e6e3a15]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Within one month of her presentation she had deteriorated to the point where there were periods of time when she appeared not to be aware of her surroundings and was ataxic to the point where she needed to be fully supported when walking. She had only occasional words and continuing myoclonia. She was treated with intravenous ribavirin 100 mg/kg/day as a q 6 h regimen and ribavirin levels were measured both in the plasma and CSF. It was felt that the levels obtained in the CSF were not adequate to inhibit viral replication, and therefore, it was decided to give intraventricular ribavirin using an Ommaya reservoir. The dose was gradually increased over ten days from 1 mg/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day. This treatment did not produce any reversal in her clinical symptoms and signs and was discontinued.

At the time of her last visit, age 13 years, the major issues were that she was sleeping through most of the day, being awake for a total of 4–6 hours per day in periods of half to one hour. Her seizures had continued to be a major problem but had improved significantly on a small dose of topiramate. Clinical examination revealed no interaction and evidence of a severe spastic quadriparesis. There was evidence of decerebrate posturing.

### Activating an anterior nucleus gigantocellularis subpopulation triggers emergence from pharmacologically-induced coma in rodents [^ec27f3eb]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Classic studies in the1940s postulated that the brainstem reticular activating system (RAS) contributes to both corticaland behavioral arousalvia both ascending projections to mesencephalon, diencephalon, and hypothalamus, and descending pathways to the spinal cord. Indeed, damage to RAS can cause coma or brain death, Multiple RAS nuclei are critical,– to regulate arousal and sleep systems, as they modulate global cortical activity via afferents to the thalamus and/or upper brainstem nuclei. Selective damage, even if bilateral, rarely results in permanent unconsciousness –, indicating that no single pathway is absolutely necessary for arousal. These findings imply redundant arousal pathways in the brain are not functionally interchangeable. Important differences among their actions are well-documented, and suggest that coordination of multiple pathways is needed to achieve a maximal state of arousal. However, the specific pathways participating in such coordination remain poorly understood.

Neurons within the nucleus gigantocellularis (NGC) exert control on multiple structures along the axis. They contain a large number of collaterals which enables thorough communication with successive levels of the neuroaxis. Neurons located in the anterior NGC project to arousal-modulating areas in the telencephalon, diencephalon, midbrain, and rhomboencephalon –. Moreover, features of their somas serve as an integrative device. Neurons within the nucleus gigantocellularis integrate a broad range of sensory and autonomic inputs. Lastly, increased activity in this area correlates with changes in cortical activity, posture, and enhanced electromyography upon arousal from sleep and waking movement in intact cats and rodents. Thus, NGC processes the critical features to promote arousal.

Here, we identify the anterior border of nucleus gigantocellularis (aNGC) as an area within the medullary RAS capable of emerging rodents from pharmacologic-induced coma by coordinating various neurophysiological routes for arousal. Activation of aNGC neurons elicits cortical, autonomic, and behavioral arousal from a vastly low brain activity state. Moreover, aNGC stimulation triggers activation of noradrenergic (locus coeruleus), glutamatergic (parabrachial nucleus), ventral and dorsal pathways, as well as brain structures involved in purposeful movements. Lastly, firing rate changes in aNGC neurons precedes cortical activation and onset of movement when rodents spontaneously emerge from anesthesia. Thus, these results reveal a previously unidentified pathway that utilizes activation of aNGC originating in the medullary reticular formation to restore arousal in rodents.

### Abnormal postural reflexes in a patient with pontine ischaemia [^936fbe0c]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

The control of body posture is a complex activity that needs a very close relationship between different structures, such as the vestibular system, and the muscle and joint receptors of the neck. Damage of even one of these structures can lead to abnormal postural reflexes. We describe a case of a woman with a left pontine ischaemia who developed a 'dystonic' extensor posture of the left limbs while turned on the right side. This clinical picture differs from previous reports on the subject, and may relate to ischaemic damage of a pontine structure involved in posture control, or of adjacent neural connections to be yet identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature. Clinical examples of an altered interplay between vestibular and neck receptors are rare.

### Alternating hemidystonia following traumatic brain injury as an unusual presentation of paroxysmal autonomic instability with dystonia syndrome [^3265ca2a]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 20-year-old man presented to the neurotrauma intensive care unit following blunt head injury. MRI revealed subarachnoid haemorrhage and multiple intraparenchymal haemorrhages suggesting severe brain injury. During recovery, the patient displayed intermittent episodes of alternating hemibody spasms with decerebrate/decorticate dystonic posturing. Episodes presented with autonomic dysregulation including hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tachypnoea, tachycardia and hypertension. Concern for seizure activity prompted simultaneous video monitoring and EEG testing. Results were without epileptiform activity suggesting against seizure as cause for alternating hemibody spasms. Paroxysmal autonomic instability with dystonia (PAID) was considered despite the unusual presentation. Intravenous hydromorphone was used for treatment, which relieved symptoms of autonomic dysregulation and dystonic posturing. PAID syndrome was diagnosed based on presentation with intermittent episodes of dystonia, autonomic dysregulation, absence of epileptiform activity and rapid response to opioid treatment. This case illustrates the clinical variability of this uncommon syndrome because alternating hemidystonia as main manifestation has not been previously described.

### The emerging postural instability phenotype in idiopathic parkinson disease [^54a91f1b]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical features we identify in this work are consistent with specific pathophysiology of gait dysfunction in PD. We found the following features appear to be associated with more rapid progression of gait dysfunction: (1) lightheadedness on standing, (2) self-perceived speech difficulties, (3) difficulties standing/rising and (4) postural changes. While gait and posture factor prominently in the ePI phenotype, the characteristics are heterogeneous. One point in common among all of the characteristics defined by the ePIRS is that the symptoms all represent signs associated with abnormalities in distributed brainstem networks. For example, changes in standing/arising, and postural changes could be related to alterations in the substantia nigra and mesencephalic gait center. Lightheadedness on standing is consistent with abnormalities in adrenergic and noradrenergic outflow, suggesting either a peripheral or central (brainstem) lesion in noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons. Self-perceived changes in speech could be an early cognitive finding, but also a lesion in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (one of the first regions impacted by Lewy bodies in PD in Braak's formulation), or more distributed brainstem pathology. In all cases, the common thread may be a more aggressive progression of synucleinopathy in the brainstem. The association of these apparently diffusely distributed brainstem-related symptoms with more rapid cognitive deterioration suggests a more aggressive overall disease process.

### Dysautonomia after severe traumatic brain injury [^d28d48f7]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Dysautonomia after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is characterized by episodes of increased heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, blood pressure, muscle tone, decorticate or decerebrate posturing, and profuse sweating. This study addresses the incidence of dysautonomia after severe TBI, the clinical variables that are associated with dysautonomia, and the functional outcome of patients with dysautonomia.

Methods

A historic cohort study in patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≤ 8 on admission].

Results

Seventy-six of 119 patients survived and were eligible for follow-up. The incidence of dysautonomia was 11.8%. Episodes of dysautonomia were prevalent during a mean period of 20.1 days (range 3–68) and were often initiated by discomfort. Patients with dysautonomia showed significant longer periods of coma (24.78 vs. 7.99 days) and mechanical ventilation (22.67 vs. 7.21 days). Dysautonomia was associated with diffuse axonal injury (DAI) [relative risk (RR) 20.83, CI 4.92–83.33] and the development of spasticity (RR 16.94, CI 3.96–71.42). Patients with dysautonomia experienced more secondary complications. They tended to have poorer outcome.

Conclusions

Dysautonomia occurs in approximately 10% of patients surviving severe TBI and is associated with DAI and the development of spasticity at follow-up. The initiation of dysautonomia by discomfort supports the Excitatory: Inhibitory Ratio model as pathophysiological mechanism.

### Dystonic reaction associated with ondansetron administration in a patient with normal pressure hydrocephalus [^5e183229]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

A 77-year-old female with normal pressure hydrocephalus underwent urgent revision of the abdominal component of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Upon emergence from an uneventful general anesthetic, the patient exhibited cogwheel rigidity with decerebrate posturing and a markedly irregular respiratory rate. This prohibited extubation and prompted an unplanned intensive care unit admission. Ondansetron was the only medication administered that had previously been associated with dystonic reactions. In a previous procedure, the patient had been given ondansetron without a similar reaction. This presentation may have been provoked by existing pathology such as her underlying normal pressure hydrocephalus and small increases in intracranial pressure.

Barbiturates

There is minimal evidence for the use of barbiturates in aSAH. Woodcock et al. report on the use of pentobarbitol bolus and infusion in the setting of raised ICP in a small (n = 15) mixed cohort of patients with acute brain injury (27% SAH). They document significant decreases in ICP for 5 of the 15 patients but validity is limited by the severity of neurological injury (all 15 patients had decerebrate or decorticate posturing, 12 patients exhibited 3rd cranial nerve palsies), the low proportion of patients with aSAH and the significant changes in clinical management practices in the 42 years since publication. Schmittner et al. did include a barbiturate medication in their sedation protocols; however, this was not a variable of investigation, so it is not possible to draw meaningful conclusions regarding its use.

EEG during abnormal motor posturing

Twelve children exhibited abnormal motor posturing during monitoring. Seven had decerebrate posturing, three decorticate posturing, and two opisthotonus as well as decerebrate and decorticate posturing. In seven children, there were accompanying EEG background changes characterised by high amplitude (300–500 mV) slow waves (1–3 Hz) during the episodes of posturing. In one child with decerebrate posturing, EEG epileptiform activity was observed during an episode of abnormal posturing.

### Infantile lhermitte-duclos disease treated successfully with rapamycin [^feb8ed32]. Journal of Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Lhermitte-Duclos disease is a rare hamartomatous tumor of the cerebellum resulting from a mutation in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene: it has been reported in fewer than 10 infants. Rapamycin treatment has not yet been described in Lhermitte-Duclos disease. The infant underwent shunt placement shortly after birth for aqueductal stenosis. Her clinical progression included failure to thrive, seizures, episodes of decerebrate posturing, loss of respiratory drive, and pituitary insufficiency from mass effect. The characteristic "tiger stripe" sign on imaging prompted diagnosis. Rapamycin therapy was initiated at 18 months. Within 5 months, our patient has become responsive to her surroundings and had return of spontaneous breathing. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals lack of brainstem compression or distortion of pituitary stalk. Rapamycin should be considered in cases of Lhermitte-Duclos disease where surgical removal may not be an option, as in our case where the cerebellum was entirely involved.

### Preventing acute asthmatic symptoms by targeting a neuronal mechanism involving carotid body lysophosphatidic acid receptors [^572537e3]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Dual perfused preparation

Sprague–Dawley rats (80–150 g) were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane via inhalation. Then, rats were cooled in ≤ 4 °C physiological saline whilst maintaining isoflurane anesthesia. Once respiratory movement began to subside, the rat was decerebrated at midcollicular level, transected above the renal arteries and skinned. All tissue rostral to the decerebration and all remaining cortex dorsal to the colliculi were removed. Transection and decerebration were performed in ≤ 4 °C physiological saline containing 115 mM NaCl, 24 mM NaHCO 3, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2, 1 mM MgSO 4, 1.25 mM NaH 2 PO 4, 10 mM glucose, and 12 mM sucrose, equilibrated with 95% O 2, 5% CO 2. Once dissection was complete, the preparation was placed in a supine position in a specially designed plexiglass chamber and secured with ear bars. The descending aorta was cannulated with a double-lumen catheter. One lumen of the catheter was connected to a peristaltic pump (Gilson Minipuls 3) and used to perfuse the descending aorta in a retrograde direction with perfusate at room temperature (20 °C) and equilibrated with 40 Torr PCO 2 in O 2 (central perfusion). The other lumen was attached to a pressure transducer and used to monitor perfusion pressure. After the cannulation procedure, the speed of the peristaltic pump was increased to elevate perfusion pressure to 90 mmHg over the first few minutes with use of a custom-built computer-controlled feedback system (built by R. J. A. W. written in VEE). The common carotid arteries were tied off above the clavicles and cannulated caudal to the carotid bifurcation. A separate peristaltic pump with two channels was used to perfuse the common carotid arteries at 18.5 mL min −1 in order to maintain a perfusion pressure of ~90 mmHg. Up to this point in the dissection, central and peripheral perfusions were from the same tonometer. Independent perfusion of central (descending aorta) and peripheral (carotid arteries) circuits was then initiated by pulling fresh media from two different reservoirs of a custom-built tonometer. This custom-built system was designed to accommodate a common return while preventing mixing of perfusate once equilibration was achieved in the two reservoirs. Between the reservoir and the preparation, central and peripheral perfusate passed through a heat exchanger, bubble trapper, and 25 µm filter. After the initiation of independent perfusion, the central perfusate was equilibrated with 40 Torr PCO 2 in O 2, and the peripheral perfusate was equilibrated with 35 Torr PCO 2 and 100 Torr PO 2 in N 2. Of note, the decerebration transects the circle of Willis therefore preventing any arterial mixing of perfusates. Once stabilized and distinct breath-like movement was detected, the phrenic nerve was dissected free and attached to a suction electrode. The vagus nerves were dissected free and transected at the level of the clavicle, well below the nodose and vagal ganglia, and the right proximal vagus (descending from brainstem) was attached to a suction electrode. Neurograms were amplified (10,000x Phrenic, 20,000x Vagus; Differential AC Amplifier Model 1700, A-M Systems Inc. Carlsborg, WA, USA), filtered (low cut-off, 300 Hz, high cut-off, 5 kHz), rectified and integrated (200-ms time constant, CWE moving averager, Ardmore, PA) and computer archived (Digidata 1322 A and Axoscope 9.0, Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices, Union City, CA, USA) at a sampling rate of 5 kHz, and analyzed off-line with custom software written in VEE (R.J. A.W.). Once carotid body activity was assessed with a hypoxic bout (50 Torr O 2, 40 Torr CO 2) normoxic conditions were re-established; any preparation which failed to demonstrate a hypoxic response was discarded. Upon recovery from hypoxia, the brainstem was made hypocapnic, in order to render the preparation apneic. Once apnea was achieved, LPA (18:1, 5 µM) was delivered into the line supplying the carotid body without recirculation. Ten minutes were given to record the presence or absence of a response, upon which normoxia was re-established to demonstrate the viability of the preparation. This experiment was completed in n = 6 carotid body intact and n = 6 carotid body denervated preparations. Variables were normalized to the initial normoxic condition. The difference between LPA and hypocapnic conditions was calculated for phrenic (nVT — neural tidal volume (amplitude, normalized units), fR — frequency (bursts min −1), nVE (neural minute ventilation, fRxnVT — normalized units) and vagal total activity (normalized units) and used for statistical analysis. Differences between intact and denervated preparations were compared with Mann Whitney Rank Test (fR, nVT, and nVE) or Student's unpaired two-sided t test (Vagus).

### Ictal symmetric tonic extension posturing and postictal generalized EEG suppression arising from sleep in children with epilepsy [^e0909880]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The identification of a biomarker for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has the potential to save lives. Generalized convulsive seizures and postictal generalized suppression on electroencephalography (EEG) most often precede sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and are potential biomarkers. We identify the EEG and seizure characteristics associated with postictal generalized EEG suppression in children with epilepsy.

Methods

Video EEGs were reviewed for seizure type, duration and semiology, and electrographic features. To identify predictors of postictal generalized EEG suppression, we identified 40 children with generalized convulsive seizures from a group of 399 patients who experienced an electroclinical seizure during video-EEG. Seventy-seven generalized convulsive seizures with and without postictal generalized EEG suppression were anayzed.

Results

Age of seizure onset was older in 19 children with postictal generalized EEG suppression (mean 6.8 years old, 95% CI [4.7–8.9]) than in 21 without postictal generalized EEG suppression (3.0 years old, [1.1–4.1], P = 0.041). Postictal generalized EEG suppression occurred significantly more often from sleep than awake (point of estimate 16.67; 95% CI [0.97–32.36], P < 0.038). Shorter duration of the clonic phase (-0.76; [-1.338, -0.133], P = 0.018) was significantly associated with postictal generalized EEG suppression. Ictal symmetric tonic extension posturing significantly increased the odds of postictal generalized EEG suppression (42.94; [18.77, 67.12], P = 0.001). All 15 generalized convulsive seizures with a terminal burst-suppression pattern were followed by postictal generalized EEG suppression in contrast to 19 of 62 generalized convulsive seizures without burst-suppression (15.32, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Ictal decerebrate-like symmetric tonic extension posturing with shorter clonic phase and a terminal burst-suppression pattern identify malignant generalized convulsive seizures, associated with postictal generalized EEG suppression and a potentially increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.

### Early clinical signs in neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy predict an abnormal amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram at age 6 hours [^d5fc5651]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Neurological assessment

A clinical assessment was performed after initial stabilization. A Thompson score was determined, and the encephalopathy was graded as mild, moderate or severe according to MSEG: encephalopathy was defined as the presence of one or more abnormal signs in at least three of the following six categories; level of consciousness, spontaneous activity, posture, tone, primitive reflexes (suck or Moro), and autonomic nervous system (pupils, heart rate, or respiration). The grades were defined as follows:

Mild: hyperalert, normal tone and activity, exaggerated moro, normal autonomic function;

Moderate: lethargic, decreased activity, distil flexion, hypotonia, weak primitive reflexes, constricted pupils, bradycardia or periodic breathing;

Severe: stupor/coma, decerebrate posture, absent spontaneous activity, flaccid, absent primitive reflexes, non-reactive pupils or apnoea.

The grade with the most corresponding signs was assigned but if signs were equally distributed, the grade was based on the level of consciousness. Infants with seizures were graded as "moderate" unless severe signs predominated. These assessments were performed at 1 hour (in those presenting early enough), 3–5, 6, and 24 hours after birth and were continued daily until the tenth day or discharge, whichever occurred first. The assessments were performed by the attending pediatric residents or specialists who had received training in performing the Thompson score. After the clinical assessment, an aEEG was obtained on all infants and continuously recorded on a BrainZ BRM2 monitor (BrainZ Instruments Ltd, Auckland, NZ). The recording was continued until the single channel bi-parietal trace remained normal for 24 hours, or until 96 hours, or until the death of the infant, whichever occurred first. In addition to the biparietal aEEG, the BrainZ monitor records the bilateral raw EEG and bilateral aEEG between parietal and central electrodes. Two neonatologists (MC and NJR) with experience in aEEG interpretation and who were blind to the neurological assessments, reviewed the recordings offline. The assessors provided consensus opinion on the category of the bi-parietal background aEEG trace and the presence of seizures at age 3, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours.

Approximately 92% of cases of cerebral palsy are traced to the perinatal period. 3 Risk factors include preterm birth, perinatal infection, intrauterine growth restriction, use of preterm antibiotics before rupture of membranes, acidosis or asphyxia, and multiple gestation, any of which can lead to brain injury. 4, 5 Fewer than 10% of cases are attributable to intrapartum hypoxia. 6 Cerebral palsy occurs at an older age in about 8% of patients, often from head injury or infection. 3 Despite identification of risk factors, 80% of cases have no clear cause and are considered idiopathic.
7. Clinical Features The clinical features of cerebral palsy are varied and encompass a broad range of abnormalities.

They are predominantly disorders of movement but also include a spectrum of abnormalities such as poor balance and sensory deficits. 1, 10 A number of comorbidities that are not part of the core definition of cerebral palsy also occur, most commonly pain, intellectual disability, inability to walk, hip displacement, inability to speak, epilepsy, incontinence, and behavioral or sleep disorders. 11 These clinical findings occur outside of the expected age-based developmental stages. Other studies have shown additional clinical findings such as hearing loss, blindness, and progression of scoliosis due to muscle spasm. 10, 11. IMPROVING MOVEMENT AND BALANCE Formal physical and occupational therapies have been the cornerstones of treatment for movement and balance problems in children and adults with cerebral palsy.

There are many different modalities and approaches to therapy, including stretching; massage; strengthening, weight-bearing, and balance exercises; electrical stimulation; treadmill use; and endurance training. OSTEOPOROSIS Osteoporosis is common in patients with cerebral palsy, likely a result of poor growth and nutrition, non–weight bearing status, limited exposure to sunlight, late-onset puberty, and use of anticonvulsants. It is estimated that 80% to 90% of children with cerebral palsy have low bone density and are at increased risk of fractures, most commonly in the femur.

### Association of peri-ictal brainstem posturing with seizure severity and breathing compromise in patients with generalized convulsive seizures [^7b964690]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyze the association between peri-ictal brainstem posturing semiologies with postictal generalized electroencephalographic suppression (PGES) and breathing dysfunction in generalized convulsive seizures (GCS).

Methods

In this prospective, multicenter analysis of GCS, ictal brainstem semiology was classified as (1) decerebration (bilateral symmetric tonic arm extension), (2) decortication (bilateral symmetric tonic arm flexion only), (3) hemi-decerebration (unilateral tonic arm extension with contralateral flexion) and (4) absence of ictal tonic phase. Postictal posturing was also assessed. Respiration was monitored with thoracoabdominal belts, video, and pulse oximetry.

Results

Two hundred ninety-five seizures (180 patients) were analyzed. Ictal decerebration was observed in 122 of 295 (41.4%), decortication in 47 of 295 (15.9%), and hemi-decerebration in 28 of 295 (9.5%) seizures. Tonic phase was absent in 98 of 295 (33.2%) seizures. Postictal posturing occurred in 18 of 295 (6.1%) seizures. PGES risk increased with ictal decerebration (odds ratio [OR] 14.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.18–35.39, p < 0.001), decortication (OR 11.26, 95% CI 2.96–42.93, p < 0.001), or hemi-decerebration (OR 48.56, 95% CI 6.07–388.78, p < 0.001). Ictal decerebration was associated with longer PGES (p = 0.011). Postictal posturing was associated with postconvulsive central apnea (PCCA) (p = 0.004), longer hypoxemia (p < 0.001), and Spo 2 recovery (p = 0.035).

Conclusions

Ictal brainstem semiology is associated with increased PGES risk. Ictal decerebration is associated with longer PGES. Postictal posturing is associated with a 6-fold increased risk of PCCA, longer hypoxemia, and Spo 2 recovery. Peri-ictal brainstem posturing may be a surrogate biomarker for GCS severity identifiable without in-hospital monitoring.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class III evidence that peri-ictal brainstem posturing is associated with the GCS with more prolonged PGES and more severe breathing dysfunction.

### Cortical lesions causing loss of consciousness are anticorrelated with the dorsal brainstem [^9f16f508]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

An interesting question is exactly which nuclei or cell types in the dorsal brainstem are likely to mediate lesion induced LOC. Answering this question in a definitive way is beyond the spatial resolution of imaging techniques such as fMRI, and is likely to benefit from ongoing work in animal models (Cho et al. 2017; Grandjean et al. 2019). This region of dorsal brainstem is composed of many different nuclei and neuronal subpopulations (Magoun, 1952; Verstegen, Vanderhorst, Gray, Zeidel, & Geerling, 2017; Wang & Morales, 2009). Some nuclei, like the locus coeruleus and parabrachial nucleus, primarily express excitatory neurotransmitters, promote arousal, and align well with the location of coma‐causing brainstem lesions (Fischer et al. 2016; Fuller et al. 2011; Magoun, 1952). Other neurons in this same area may actually suppress arousal or promote sleep, including interdigitating GABA and glycinergic neurons (Verstegen et al. 2017, Wang & Morales, 2009), as well as serotonergic neurons within the dorsal raphe (Denoyer, Sallanon, Kitahama, Aubert, & Jouvet, 1989; Sakai, 2011). This latter finding may be particularly relevant to the current results, as the peak connection associated with LOC overlapped the dorsal raphe.

### Central pathophysiology and brain network changes related to camptocormia in Parkinson's disease [^07965b68]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

For the main motor output from the primary motor area of the postural muscles, the cortico‐muscular coherence values were not only significantly stronger for PD patients without camptocormia but even stronger for HCs. The lack of involvement of the brainstem as an important central processing hubonly in camptocormia patients does not only show a deficit in the central network but may also indicate that the output from the postural motor network relies more on the (pre)motor cortex, whereas in PD patients without camptocormia postural control through subcortical output is more common and also indicated by the coherence between the BG source and postural muscles, which were stronger in PD patients without camptocormia than in camptocormia patients and HCs.

How could these changes be related to the vast evidence of myopathic changes in postural muscles in camptocormia patients,? As this myopathy is typically limited to the paravertebral muscles that keep up the erect posture, it has been argued that it could be a secondary phenomenon. The postulated compensatory increase in cortical drive to the paravertebral postural muscles shown here may be the starting point for a vicious circle finally leading to a secondary myopathy, initially compensating for the deficit in controlling an upright posture but putting too much strain on the paravertebral muscles, which then contributes to the damage of paravertebral muscle tissue we see in advanced camptocormia.

### Vertebral artery dissection masquerading as concussion in an adolescent [^429a0f50]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Educate providers about the clinical presentation and consequences of delaying diagnosis of traumatic vertebral artery dissection with thromboembolic ischemic strokes in the pediatric population. Vertebral artery dissection is often difficult to diagnose and can be a potentially devastating cause of ischemic stroke.

Methods

Review of the chart, peer review/discussion, and imaging interpretation.

Results

A 16-year-old boy was admitted with confusion after a head and neck trauma was sustained while wrestling. (Glasgow Coma Scale = 15, NIHSS = 0). Investigations including computed tomography (CT) head and cervical spine were normal. He then developed severe nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headaches and was admitted for symptoms of concussion. Ten hours later, patient declined (hypertensive and unresponsive) and was noted to have decerebrate posturing. After emergent intubation, he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. Repeat CT head showed an acute left cerebellar infarct with associated cerebellar edema resulting in effacement of the fourth ventricle/basilar cisterns and acute hydrocephalus. The CT angiography and magnetic resonance imaging of brain confirmed arterial dissection and near occlusion of the left vertebral artery at the C2 level. Extensive infarct was seen in the left cerebellum, brainstem, and right cerebellum. During a prolonged hospital stay, the family opted to continue care, and he was transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility because of limited brainstem activity, being nonverbal, and not demonstrating purposeful spontaneous movements.

Conclusions

Detailed history and thorough neurological examination in conjunction with appropriate imaging are necessary to distinguish between brainstem/cerebellar ischemia from vertebral artery dissection and concussion.

### Central pathophysiology and brain network changes related to camptocormia in Parkinson's disease [^5ca44732]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Such a gradual emergence of camptocormia in PD with sequential pathophysiological mechanisms could explain why dopaminergic agents can be effective against camptocormiain some patients possibly before the emergence of irreversible muscle damage. Our present finding of in‐part compensatory changes in the central motor network related to the affected paravertebral muscles and being specific to camptocormia patients may be one explanation for the efficacy of network modulation by DBS. It likely indicates that the postulated vicious cycle of a compensatory increase in postural motor network output and muscle damage is still active and can be interrupted. However, intervention with DBS can possibly be effective only before the effector organ of the PVL muscles is irreversibly damaged by a too long‐lasting abnormal trunk posture.

Within the central postural motor network, the cortical–subcortical connections were reduced in the camptocormia patients compared to the PD patients without camptocormia. Thus, in contrast to the possibly compensatory increase in the cortical drive to the postural muscles, the information flow between the different levels of the central network appears to be decreased in camptocormia, also reflected by the lack of brainstem involvement in camptocormia patients. This could suggest additional computational deficits in the central motor network of camptocormia patients possibly impeding central compensatory strategies and shifting compensation to the output level in the shape of an increased drive to the postural muscles. Due to the vast connections between the cerebellum, BG, and cortical regions, both receiving input from and transmitting output to the various cortical areas in learning and control processes, these interactions are likely to play a crucial role also in postural control.

### Health supervision for people with achondroplasia [^5066ed3e]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Achondroplasia — anticipatory guidance on severe complications and spine care emphasizes early detection and posture management: Unexpected infant death occurs in 2% to 5% of all infants with achondroplasia if aggressive, early assessments are not pursued to detect central apnea resulting from compression of the brainstem and arteries at the level of the foramen magnum, and restrictive pulmonary disease occurs in less than 5% of children with achondroplasia who are younger than 3 years; living at high elevation may exacerbate pulmonary complications and obstructive pulmonary disease is much more common and warrants systematic assessment. Most infants with achondroplasia develop thoracolumbar kyphosis and more severe kyphosis is associated with unsupported sitting before there is adequate trunk muscle strength and tone; back support should be provided during bottle and/or breastfeeding, unsupported sitting and devices that cause curved sitting or "C sitting," such as "umbrella-style" strollers and soft canvas seats, should be avoided during the first year of life, and care with a pediatric orthopedist should be established to monitor the spine. The common complication of spinal stenosis rarely occurs in childhood but manifests in older individuals with numbness, weakness, and altered deep tendon reflexes.

### Abnormal intra-aural pressure waves associated with death in African children with acute nontraumatic coma [^c190c8dd]. Pediatric Research (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

The study was carried out at the pediatric high dependency unit of Kilifi District Hospital on the rural coast of Kenya. The study was approved by the Kenya Medical Research Institute Ethics Review Committee (SSC 1249) and was conducted between November 2007 and September 2009. We made observations on children aged between 6 mo and 13 y presenting in coma (Blantyre Coma Score (BCS) ≤ 2, persisting for more than 30 min after correction of hypoglycemia or treatment of a seizure). To determine values in awake children, we evaluated children (aged 2–13 y) presenting at the Kilifi District Hospital OPD for consideration for recruitment into a study on moderate malnutrition but found not to be eligible because they were well-nourished. We excluded children who had abnormal middle ear function as determined by tympanometry and those with signs and symptoms of neurological illnesses. Separate data from some of the children recruited into this study have previously been published. We recorded clinical signs consistent with herniation of the brain through the tentorium or the foramen magnum (pupil size and reaction to light, oculo-vestibular reflexes, decorticate or decerebrate posturing, respiratory pattern abnormalities) on admission and at 4 hourly intervals until the child regained consciousness or died. FK, who was blinded to the TMD data, determined whether there was clinical evidence of cerebral herniation. We excluded children known to have sickle cell disease, epilepsy, or developmental delay, considering the possibility of pre-existent altered ICP dynamics and the likely difficulty in distinguishing the role of these comorbid conditions in the course of the encephalopathy, and determining new neurological sequelae as an outcome.

### Convulsive-like movements in brainstem stroke… [^2bbca5d8]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Diffusion-weighted image sequence demonstrating marked signal changes in the basis pontis and tegmentum. Background Involuntary convulsive-like movements sometimes occur in patients with brainstem strokes. These movements vary in nature, frequency, and trigger, including fasciculation-like, shivering, jerky, tonic-clonic, and intermittent shaking movements. Some are interpreted as decerebrate postures or seizures. It is important to recognize this type of motor phenomenon since it may be a diagnostic clue for early diagnosis and treatment of brainstem strokes. We describe a patient with brainstem ischemia and convulsive-like movements and review the literature. A 72-year-old man presented with impaired consciousness and "seizures. " He was eating when he suddenly developed weakness on his left side and fell down. His wife observed tonic postures in the 4 limbs while the patient was on the floor.

Two days before admission, he reported dizziness and the persistence of visual images even when his eyes were closed. He had a history of arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He had no history of migraine, seizures, or stroke. These episodes consisted of sudden, stereotypical, brief clonic contractions of the proximal and distal upper extremities. These movements repeated in paroxysms at irregular intervals regardless of the position of his arms. They were different from the classic decerebrate posture or myoclonus. During the movements, there was no change in the level of consciousness. No movements were detected in the face or lower limbs. The role of the brainstem in the generation of tonic convulsions was studied more than 4 decades ago; however, the subject is still controversial.

8 Experimental evidence in rat and cat models showed that stimulation of the reticular formation of the midbrain, pons, or medulla results in tonic seizures with absence of discharges in the cortex or at the site of the stimulus. 9, 10 Kreindler et al, 9 Bergman et al, 11 and others12, 13 showed that brainstem stimulation induced tonic or clonic movements depending on the magnitude of the stimulating current. Halsey and Downie16 described 3 patients with "decerebration rigidity" with spared consciousness. One of these patients was a 34-year-old woman who presented with occipital headache and vertigo. Her family observed 3 "severe shaking episodes" with urinary incontinence. Angiography showed proximal basilar artery stenosis.

### Cerebral causes and consequences of parkinsonian resting tremor: a tale of two circuits? [^f4334adc]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Why does tremor indicate a benign Parkinson's disease subtype?

We have reviewed and discussed several clinical and pathophysiological differences between tremor-dominant and non-tremor Parkinson's disease subtypes. We suggest that pallidal dopamine depletion is related to tremor, while other pathophysiological markers could explain a more benign disease course. First, there is converging evidence from post-mortem and nuclear imaging studies that patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease have relatively benign nigrostriatal degeneration. This may explain why other features of Parkinson's disease also take a more benign course in tremor-dominant patients. Second, there is post-mortem evidence that patients with non-tremor Parkinson's disease have more cortical lesions than patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease, and this may explain the worse cognitive dysfunction of patients with non-tremor Parkinson's disease. Appearance of such cortical lesions with advancing disease may also explain why tremor can diminish or even disappear after several years in some patients, because the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit now becomes damaged. Finally, resting tremor may emerge as a collateral effect of cerebral mechanisms that compensate for pathophysiological changes producing akinesia. Voluntary movement arises in phase with the tremor, suggesting that the tremor may facilitate the ability to initiate movement in the face of akinesia. This possibility finds support in the fact that — in MPTP primate models of Parkinson's disease — tremor usually appears several days after akinesia and rigidity, i.e. its appearance coincides with the time when compensatory mechanisms are presumably being activated. This does not yet prove any causal relationship, but one possibility is that such compensatory changes — for example in the motor cortex and cerebellum — may render these regions more susceptible to pathological influences (tremor triggers) from the basal ganglia. For example, a study that used transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses to probe the excitability of the primary motor cortex showed that, when tested at rest, the slope of the input–output relationship between stimulus intensity and response size is steeper in patients with Parkinson's disease than in controls. Although this could be the result of a primary basal ganglia deficit (loss of normal inhibition), it could also reflect an attempt to cortically compensate for the slow recruitment of commands to move, by making it easier to recruit activity from a resting state. Similarly, increased activity of the cerebellum during movements has been observed frequently in Parkinson's disease — perhaps to compensate for dysfunction of dopamine-dependent circuits. The increased cerebellar activity may sensitize the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit to perturbing influences from the basal ganglia, resulting in tremor. This suggests that a combination of basal ganglia pathology (i.e. pallidal dopamine depletion) and compensation in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit leads to tremor, explaining why tremor and a benign disease course are seen in the same patients.

### The influence of concordant complex posture and loading rate on motion segment failure: a mechanical and microstructural investigation [^20f6d77d]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design

Microstructural investigation of compression-induced herniation of a lumbar disc held in a concordant complex posture.

Objective

To explore the significance of loading rate in a highly asymmetric concordant posture, comparing the mechanisms of failure to an earlier study using a nonconcordant complex posture.

Summary Of Background Data

A recent study with a nonconcordant complex posture (turning in the opposite direction to that which the load is applied) demonstrated the vulnerability of the disc to loading that is borne by one set of oblique-counter oblique fiber sets in the alternating lamellae of the annulus, and aggravated by an elevated loading rate. Given the strain rate-dependent properties of the disc it might be expected that the outcome differs if the posture is reversed.

Methods

Forty-one motion segments from ovine 16 spines were split into two cohorts; adopting the previously employed low rate (40mm/min) and surprise rate (400mm/min) of loading. Both groups of damaged discs were then analyzed microstructurally.

Results

With the lower rate loading the concordant posture significantly reduced the load required to cause disc failure than earlier described for nonconcordant posture (6.9 vs. 8.4kN), with more direct tears and alternate lamella damage extending to the anterior disc. Contrary to this result, with a surprise rate, the load at failure was significantly increased with the concordant posture (8.08 vs. 6.96kN), although remaining significantly less than that from a simple flexed posture (9.6kN). Analysis of the damage modes and postures suggest facet engagement plays a significant role.

Conclusion

This study confirms that adding shear to the posture lowers the load at failure, and causes alternate lamella rupture. Load at failure in a complex posture is not determined by loading rate alone. Rather, the strain rate-dependent properties of the disc influence which elements of the system are brought into play.

### Do some people with a prolonged disorder of consciousness experience pain? A clinically focused narrative review and synthesis [^c0fc28a0]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Prolonged disorders of consciousness

In 2020, the Royal College of Physicians working party on managing people with a prolonged disorder of consciousness defined it as: ' any disorder of consciousness that has continued for at least four weeks following sudden onset brain injury'. It includes coma and the vegetative and minimally conscious states. Most patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness have progressive neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease or dementia. Cumulative co-morbidities accrued over a while may also result in a prolonged disorder of consciousness. This article refers to all those people with prolonged disordered consciousness resulting from all these conditions.

Brains from patients who had a prolonged disorder of consciousness show widespread cortical damage, diffuse axonal injury after trauma and extensive nerve cell body loss after metabolic injury, combined with damage to the dorsomedial and ventral posterior thalamic nuclei. Thus, pain networks in the cortex are inevitably extensively disrupted, and it is unlikely that any cognitive analysis or moderation of lower brain networks will be undertaken.

Midbrain and brainstem structures are more resistant to damage. Less extensive damage will not disrupt lower networks because networks are intrinsically resilient and resist degradation unless the loss is severe.

Therefore, lower brain networks are probably still functioning in people with prolonged disorders of consciousness. The nature of the output and how the loss of cortical modulation of their function affects it are unknown, but they may increase arousal and produce non-specific non-willed behaviours. These aversive behavioural and autonomic reactions are retained as basic outputs arising from nociceptive stimuli.

Many factors are likely to lead to pain in people with a prolonged disorder of consciousness:
Nursing and care procedures, such as moving and handling people, stretching muscles to facilitate personal care, tracheal suctioning, complex mouth care, bowel management and replacing urethral catheters.
Muscle immobility and increased muscle tone, maintaining posture and positioning for long periods
Blood tests and injections for spasticity and salivary management
Other unpredictable phenomena such as hypersensitivity to touch, muscle spasms, local infections, skin pressure ulcers, hiccups and coughing.

### Concussive convulsions: emergency department assessment and management of a frequently misunderstood entity [^fa0caaaf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Immediate concussive convulsions are an unusual but dramatic sequela to head injuries. Previously believed to be an epileptic phenomenon, they are now thought to be a brief traumatic functional decerebration that results from loss of cortical inhibition. With concussive convulsions generally occurring within seconds of head impact and lasting up to several minutes, patients are initially in a tonic phase, followed by a clonic convulsion. A postictal phase is generally brief if it occurs at all with these episodes. Patients with isolated concussive convulsions have no evidence of structural brain injury as assessed with neuroimaging studies or physical examination. Neuropsychological testing often demonstrates transient cortical dysfunction consistent with the concussive episode. The long-term outcome for patients with isolated concussive convulsion is universally good, with no long-term neurologic sequelae and no increased incidence of early or late posttraumatic epilepsy. Emergency department management should focus on evaluation of the associated concussive injury. The concussive convulsion requires no specific therapy, and antiepileptic medication is not indicated.

### Can pure thalamic strokes lead to severe impairment of Arousal? [^4cff7680]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This study aimed to investigate the role of the thalamus in maintaining human consciousness by testing whether thalamic lesions alone are sufficient to cause severe impairment of arousal, as questioned by Hindman et al. Our results support their observations, demonstrating that thalamic strokes without extension into the brainstem are not sufficient to cause severe impairment of arousal. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of the thalamus in consciousness and provide valuable information for neurocritical care. In addition, our results suggest critical involvement of upper brainstem regions, intersected by lesions leading to severe impairment of arousal but not by any of the control lesions, in maintaining arousal.

The thalamus has been thought to play an important role in human consciousness, acting as the main relay point between the brainstem and cortex. Thalamic infarcts may lead to disorders of consciousness, but coma or stupor seems to be relatively rare, and it has not been clear if thalamic lesions alone are sufficient to cause severe impairment of arousal. Together with the previous findings, our results instead support a critical role for the brainstem reticular formation, including the pedunculopontine nucleus, ventral tegmental area, and likely most importantly, axons ascending through the central midbrain, for sustaining human wakefulness. This view is also supported by an earlier study investigating brainstem lesions, showing that injury to a small region in the pontine tegmentum is associated with coma. In addition, our results show that lesions causing long‐term severe loss of consciousness also overlapped in the substantia nigra, which dopaminergic projections may have a role for promoting wakefulness, although dopamine or any other individual neurotransmitters do not seem to be necessary for maintaining arousal. As noted before, in practically all prior reported cases of coma caused by thalamic lesions, the lesions likely extended into the brainstem.

### Midbrain lesion-induced disconjugate gaze: a unifying circuit mechanism of ocular alignment? [^d7722744]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Disconjugate eye movements are essential for depth perception in frontal-eyed species, but their underlying neural substrates are largely unknown. Lesions in the midbrain can cause disconjugate eye movements. While vertically disconjugate eye movements have been linked to defective visuo-vestibular integration, the pathophysiology and neuroanatomy of horizontally disconjugate eye movements remains elusive.

Methods

A patient with a solitary focal midbrain lesion was examined using detailed clinical ocular motor assessments, binocular videooculography and diffusion-weighted MRI, which was co-registered to a high-resolution cytoarchitectonic MR-atlas.

Results

The patient exhibited both vertically and horizontally disconjugate eye alignment and nystagmus. Binocular videooculography showed a strong correlation of vertical and horizontal oscillations during fixation but not in darkness. Oscillation intensities and waveforms were modulated by fixation, illumination, and gaze position, suggesting shared visual- and vestibular-related mechanisms. The lesion was mapped to a functionally ill-defined area of the dorsal midbrain, adjacent to the posterior commissure and sparing nuclei with known roles in vertical gaze control.

Conclusion

A circumscribed region in the dorsal midbrain appears to be a key node for disconjugate eye movements in both vertical and horizontal planes. Lesioning this area produces a unique ocular motor syndrome mirroring hallmarks of developmental strabismus and nystagmus. Further circuit-level studies could offer pivotal insights into shared pathomechanisms of acquired and developmental disorders affecting eye alignment.

The pupils in brainstem-dead patients are classically fixed and dilated. We present a case of a brainstem-dead patient whose pupils displayed persistent asynchronous pupillary constriction and dilatation independent of external physical stimuli. Central causes for the phenomenon were excluded leaving an unexplained peripheral cause as the most likely explanation. Early recognition of this phenomenon prevents delay in the diagnosis of brainstem death, lessening to some extent the distress for the family, and facilitating earlier organ donation and allowing the better use of resources.

### Motor neurons generate pose-targeted movements via proprioceptive sculpting [^e889fd48]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Motor neurons are the final common pathway 1 through which the brain controls movement of the body, forming the basic elements from which all movement is composed. Yet how a single motor neuron contributes to control during natural movement remains unclear. Here we anatomically and functionally characterize the individual roles of the motor neurons that control head movement in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Counterintuitively, we find that activity in a single motor neuron rotates the head in different directions, depending on the starting posture of the head, such that the head converges towards a pose determined by the identity of the stimulated motor neuron. A feedback model predicts that this convergent behaviour results from motor neuron drive interacting with proprioceptive feedback. We identify and genetically 2 suppress a single class of proprioceptive neuron 3 that changes the motor neuron-induced convergence as predicted by the feedback model. These data suggest a framework for how the brain controls movements: instead of directly generating movement in a given direction by activating a fixed set of motor neurons, the brain controls movements by adding bias to a continuing proprioceptive-motor loop.

Unfortunately, the patient passed away after the decision to discontinue treatment

Among the six children with acute necrotizing encephalopathy, one died of multiple organ failure, two died after their parents gave up treatment and were extubated, and the other three survived, but all left severe disabilities. Five of the six children had convulsions when they were admitted to the hospital, and the manifestation was grand mal seizures. All six children had severe disturbance of consciousness, and the Glasgow coma score was less than five. All six children had a fever, and five cases had body temperatures over 39 °C. Four of the six children required mechanical ventilation. There were circulatory disorders in two patients (Table 5).

### Brainstem dysfunction in critically ill patients [^c45e2935]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Brainstem syndromes and assessment

Brainstem pathology should be considered in cases of (a) sensory or motor deficits combined with cranial nerve palsy, (b) impairment of consciousness, (c) dysautonomia, or (d) neurological respiratory failure.

Brainstem motor and sensory deficits and cranial nerve palsy

The pyramidal and extrapyramidal tracts connect the upper motor neurons and the extrapyramidal nuclei with the lower motor neurons located in either the brainstem or the spinal cord. While the former controls voluntary movement, the latter is involved in reflexes, motion, complex movements, and postural control (Tables 1 and 2). Upper motor neuron damage can lead to symptoms, ranging from hemiparesis to the locked-in syndrome, which is typically characterized by intact awareness, quadriplegia, anarthria, and absence of eye movements except for preserved vertical gaze. It usually results from bilateral pontine white matter lesions. Characteristic clinical features of brainstem lesions include ipsilateral cranial nerve palsies or cerebellar signs combined with contralateral motor deficits. Brainstem lesions may present with abnormal movements, such as hemichorea, hemiballism, dystonia, tremor, asterixis, pseudo-athetosis, and non-epileptic myoclonus (Table 2). Bilateral motor corticobulbar tract lesion may present with swallowing impairment, dysphagia, dysphonia, velo-pharyngo-laryngeal impairments, uncontrollable crying/laughing episodes, and emotional lability (i.e. pseudobulbar affect; Table 2). A brainstem lesion of the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway and the spinothalamic tract results in a contralateral proprioceptive/touch and temperature/pain deficit, respectively.

### Long-distance descending spinal neurons ensure quadrupedal locomotor stability [^3cd5839c]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

Locomotion is an essential animal behavior used for translocation. The spinal cord acts as key executing center, but how it coordinates many body parts located across distance remains poorly understood. Here we employed mouse genetic and viral approaches to reveal organizational principles of long-projecting spinal circuits and their role in quadrupedal locomotion. Using neurotransmitter identity, developmental origin, and projection patterns as criteria, we uncover that spinal segments controlling forelimbs and hindlimbs are bidirectionally connected by symmetrically organized direct synaptic pathways that encompass multiple genetically tractable neuronal subpopulations. We demonstrate that selective ablation of descending spinal neurons linking cervical to lumbar segments impairs coherent locomotion, by reducing postural stability and speed during exploratory locomotion, as well as perturbing interlimb coordination during reinforced high-speed stepping. Together, our results implicate a highly organized long-distance projection system of spinal origin in the control of postural body stabilization and reliability during quadrupedal locomotion.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^d538d950]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) — occupational risk factors show that exposure to hand forces between 2.1 and 4 on the Borg CR10 scale increased CTS risk 60%, and ratings greater than 4 increased risk 117%, with linear increases between 2.6 and 30 repetitions per minute; there was no association with total hand repetition, vibration, or wrist flexed/extended posture greater than 30°, and time in extreme postures averaged 5.6% (flexion) and 0.6% (extension). Across level II evidence, forceful exertions had RRs ranging between 1.14 and 19.57, the highest hazard ratio (HR) occurred when exertions exceeded 60% of work time, vibration was a risk factor with OR 2.02 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.90) and 2.74 (95% CI: 1.13, 6.65), and extreme wrist flexion/extension results conflicted. Meta-analyses reported that nonneutral wrist posture had RR = 2.01 (95% CI: 1.65, 2.43) and that self-reported wrist postures had higher risk than observed postures (RR = 2.95 versus 1.44); another meta-analysis found strongest associations for vibratory tools (OR = 5.4; 95% CI: 3.14, 9.31), hand force (OR = 4.23; 95% CI: 1.53, 11.68), and repetition (OR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.73, 2.94).

### Lateropulsion, pushing and verticality perception in hemisphere stroke: a causal relationship? [^99c25d0c]. Brain (2008). Low credibility.

The relationships between perception of verticality by different sensory modalities, lateropulsion and pushing behaviour and lesion location were investigated in 86 patients with a first stroke. Participants sat restrained in a drum-like framework facing along the axis of rotation. They gave estimates of their subjective postural vertical by signalling the point of feeling upright during slow drum rotation which tilted them rightwards-leftwards. The subjective visual vertical was indicated by setting a line to upright on a computer screen. The haptic vertical was assessed in darkness by manually setting a rod to the upright. Normal estimates ranged from -2.5 degrees to 2.5 degrees for visual vertical and postural vertical, and from -4.5 degrees to 4.5 degrees for haptic vertical. Of six patients with brainstem stroke and ipsilesional lateropulsion only one had an abnormal ipsilesional postural vertical tilt (6 degrees); six had an ipsilesional visual vertical tilt (13 ± .4 degrees); two had ipsilesional haptic vertical tilts of 6 degrees. In 80 patients with a hemisphere stroke (35 with contralesional lateropulsion including 6 'pushers'), 34 had an abnormal contralesional postural vertical tilt (average -8.5 ± 4.7 degrees), 44 had contralesional visual vertical tilts (average -7 ± 3.2 degrees) and 26 patients had contralesional haptic vertical tilts (-7.8 ± 2.8 degrees); none had ipsilesional haptic vertical or postural vertical tilts. Twenty-one (26%) showed no tilt of any modality, 41 (52%) one or two abnormal modality(ies) and 18 (22%) a transmodal contralesional tilt (i.e. PV + VV + HV). Postural vertical was more tilted in right than in left hemisphere strokes and specifically biased by damage to neural circuits centred around the primary somatosensory cortex and thalamus. This shows that thalamo-parietal projections have a functional role in the processing of the somaesthetic graviceptive information. Tilts of the postural vertical were more closely related to postural disorders than tilts of the visual vertical. All patients with a transmodal tilt showed a severe lateropulsion and 17/18 a right hemisphere stroke. This indicates that the right hemisphere plays a key role in the elaboration of an internal model of verticality, and in the control of body orientation with respect to gravity. Patients with a 'pushing' behaviour showed a transmodal tilt of verticality perception and a severe postural vertical tilt. We suggest that pushing is a postural behaviour that leads patients to align their erect posture with an erroneous reference of verticality.

### Impact of proprioceptive cervical dizziness in chronic neck pain syndromes on gait and stance during active head-turn challenges [^242f99de]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical dizziness (CD) — reality or fiction — is the subject of a long-standing interdisciplinary debate. Supporters believe it to be one of the most common causes of dizziness with vertigo, disorientation, and disequilibrium confirmed by a range of signs and symptoms. Their opponents reject the diagnosis because of the lack of a reliable clinical test to distinguish it from other pathological forms of episodic dizziness. The Bárány Society Classification OverSight Committee takes the view "that the evidence supporting a mechanistic link between an illusory sensation of self-motion (i.e. vertigo — spinning or otherwise) and neck pathology and/or symptoms of neck pain — either by affecting the cervical vertebrae, soft tissue structures or cervical nerve roots — is lacking". On the other hand, it is commonly acknowledged that cooperative interactions between proprioceptive neck afferents and head-mounted vestibular and visual systems cues control the coordination of eye, head, and body movements in space. They transform registered rotations and translations they sense relative to the direction of motion (i.e. postural orientation) and fine-tune the body's center of gravity (i.e. static and dynamic stability). This implies that stimulation or functional distortions of these structures could produce CD. In fact, unilateral local anesthesia of the upper dorsal cervical roots has been shown to induce ataxia and nystagmus in animals and ataxia without nystagmus in humans (Table 1; for review see). This table listing a number of various experimental animal and human studies on different species we considered as relevant since the controversial articles on cervical vertigo often use one or several results for their discussions of hypothetical pathophysiology.

Table 1
Ataxia, disequilibrium, and nystagmus in experimental cervical vertigo

Clinically one would expect CD — if it exists in non-specific neck pain syndromes — would preferably manifest with head rotations. In a first observational study, a small number of the patients studied with acute neck pain and mainly unilateral constraints of head rotation spontaneously complained about spells of dizziness or vertigo elicited by head movements. The descriptions of their complaints were very similar: (1) apparent surround motions or short body perturbations for a fraction of a second with postural unsteadiness; (2) attacks evoked only by rapid, not by slow head rotations, when standing or during locomotion; (3) attacks subsided spontaneously along with the recovery from the neck pain. This syndrome was referred to as head motion-induced spells of cervical vertigo in patients with acute neck pain.

### A differential diagnosis in postural headache: herniation of a giant posterior fossa arachnoid cyst [^d3763b02]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The causes of postural headache are usually associated with low intracranial pressure. However, there are still rare causes of posture-related headaches that are not associated with low intracraninal pressure and caused by pathologic processes. Herein, we report a patient with giant posterior fossaarachnoid cyst herniating below the level of foramen magnum presenting with postural headache, which has not been described previously in the literature. Emergency physicians should be aware that posterior fossa arachnoid cysts should be considered one of the differential diagnoses in patients with postural headache.

Recommendation 2 rationale — diagnostic accuracy in individuals with severe DoC is challenged by inconsistent behaviors, fluctuating arousal, and underlying impairments; clinician reliance on nonstandardized procedures contributes to diagnostic error, which "consistently hovers around 40%," and diagnostic error includes misdiagnosing the locked-in syndrome for vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS).

Cervical vertigo and orthostatic hypotension — provocation patterns that help differentiate from BPPV: Cervical vertigo has been described as vertigo arising in conjunction with degenerative cervical spine disease and may produce similar symptoms to BPPV due to proprioceptive abnormalities from cervical spine dysfunction. Symptoms of cervical vertigo may be triggered by rotation of the head relative to the body while in an upright posture, whereas orthostatic (postural) hypotension may produce episodic dizziness or vertigo provoked by moving from the supine or sitting to the upright position, in distinction to the positional changes of BPPV.

### Effectiveness of chin-down posture to prevent tracheal aspiration in dysphagia secondary to acquired brain injury. A videofluoroscopy study [^75035116]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The chin-down posture is generally recommended in patients with neurogenic dysphagia to prevent tracheal aspiration; however, its effectiveness has not been demonstrated.

Aim

To videofluoroscopically (VDF) assess the effectiveness of chin-down posture to prevent aspiration in patients with neurogenic dysphagia secondary to acquired brain injury.

Methods

Randomized, alternating, cross-over study (with and without the chin-down posture) in 47 patients with a VDF diagnosis of aspiration [31 stroke, 16 traumatic brain injury (TBI)] and 25 controls without aspiration (14 stroke, 11 TBI).

Key Results

During the chin-down posture, 55% of patients avoided aspiration (40% preswallow aspiration and 60% aspiration during swallow). The percentage was similar in both etiologies (58% stroke and 50% TBI). Fifty-one percent of patients had silent aspiration; of these, 48% persisted with aspiration while in the chin-down posture. A statistically significant relationship was found between the existence of pharyngeal residue, cricopharyngeal dysfunction, pharyngeal delay time and bolus volume with the persistence of aspiration. The chin-down posture did not change swallow biomechanics in patients without aspiration.

Conclusions & Inferences

Only half the patients with acquired brain injury avoided aspiration during cervical flexion; 48% of silent aspirators continued to aspire during the maneuver. Several videofluoroscopic parameters were related to inefficiency of the maneuver. Therefore, the indication for chin-down posture should be evaluated by videofluoroscopic examination.

### High-level gait and balance disorders in the elderly: a midbrain disease? [^0ec0bdaf]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The severity of 'axial' hypokinetic-rigid signs, freezing of gait, falls, and postural instability were significantly correlated to the lateral and posterior displacements of the CP during the APAs (Table 2). The freezing of gait score was also significantly related to the step width, the gait score to the step width and the maximum AP-CG velocity, and the postural stability score to the braking index (Table 2). The severity of 'appendicular' hypokinetic-rigid signs was only related to the maximum AP-CG velocity (Table 2).

The N-mesencephalon surface area was significantly negatively correlated with the falls and postural stability score, the lateral and posterior displacements of the CP during the APAs, the braking index, and double-stance duration (Table 2, Fig. 3 a). The severity of DWML was significantly correlated with the severity of freezing of gait and 'appendicular' hypokinetic-rigid signs and with the maximum AP-CG velocity (Table 2; Fig. 3 b). The severity of DWML also tended to be related to the FAB score (Table 2; Fig. 3 b).

The graphs represent the relationship between a the N-mesencephalon surface area and the braking index (blue circles) and the falls score (blue triangles), b deep white matter lesions and 'appendicular' hypokinetic-rigid signs (green circles) and the frontal assessment battery score (green triangles)

Multiple step-wise regression analysis showed that the severity of falls was dependent upon the N-mesencephalon surface area, whereas the severity of 'appendicular' hypokinetic-rigid signs was dependent upon the severity of DWML (Table 2).

### Proceedings of the second curing coma campaign NIH symposium: challenging the future of research for coma and disorders of consciousness [^9ea0b58a]. Neurocritical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The CCC launched the biology of coma WG tasked with determining the state of the science in DoC. The WG was divided into four subgroups whose remits were to (1) account for DoC heterogeneity to refine endotypes, (2) characterize DoC mechanisms by multiple spatial–temporal scales, (3) move Curing Coma science toward individualized prognostic tools, and (4) develop systemic frameworks to optimize therapeutic trials. Details related to recommendations from each of the subgroups were published separately.

Understanding DoC involves discerning its critical components that include key anatomical sites, systems and connections, characteristics of transmitted information, the neurochemical substrates and the biology that drives human consciousness. The current understanding of DoC along these five categories were discussed:
There are specific sites critical for consciousness, but the absence of activation of these sites on functional imaging of patients with DoC (e.g. under propofol anesthesia) does not reliably correlate with absent function. Rostral brainstem, midline thalamic nuclei, and anterior insula have emerged as possible key sites critical for consciousness. Yet, it is unclear whether all of these sites, in isolation, are both necessary and sufficient.
There are systems and connections that subserve consciousness. However, consciousness is likely a function of individual traits (strength of baseline internodal connectivity) and disease states (i.e. severity of injury or degree of sedation), which should be considered while assessing perception and motor responses in patients with MCS and cognitive motor dissociation (CMD). Some important pathways relevant in DoC include the midline thalamocortical connectivity, the default mode network (DMN) (the neuronal network of cortical regions that are active at rest), brainstem arousal pathways, and the basal mesocircuit.
There are important characteristics of information transmitted by the systems and connections that subserve consciousness. There is a complex assignment of neural resources for task performance. Studies of neural correlates of consciousness demonstrate anticorrelations (negative correlations) between DMN and task-positive network in DoC. These anticorrelations serve as biomarkers of efficient resource allocation and indicate that the content of information processed is relevant for transmission. Consciousness demonstrates the global neuronal integration with the ability to rapidly swap states and occupy functional states or brain configurations outside the constraints of anatomical connectivity.
What are the neurochemical substrates that modulate this process? Brainstem arousal systems are important, with diverse roles and neurochemical signatures matched to function. Cortical interneurons are targets of neurochemical modulation, and the understanding of this interaction may provide therapeutic opportunities.
What do we know about biology that drives human consciousness? We know that there are genetic accompaniments to brain structures and systems associated with human evolution.

### Dystonia associated with pontomesencephalic lesions [^773e27e6]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Secondary dystonia is well known subsequent to lesions of the basal ganglia or the thalamus. There is evidence that brainstem lesions may also be associated with dystonia, but little is known about pathoanatomical correlations. Here, we report on a series of four patients with acquired dystonia following brainstem lesions. There were no basal ganglia or thalamic lesions. Three patients suffered tegmental pontomesencephalic hemorrhage and one patient diffuse axonal injury secondary to severe craniocerebral trauma. Dystonia developed with a delay of 1 to 14 months, at a mean delay of 6 months. The patients' mean age at onset was 33 years (range 4–56 years). All patients presented with hemidystonia combined with cervical dystonia, and two patients had craniofacial dystonia in addition. Three patients had postural or kinetic tremors. Dystonia was persistent in three patients, and improved gradually in one. There was little response to medical treatment. One patient with hemidystonia combined with cervical dystonia improved after thalamotomy. Overall, the phenomenology of secondary dystonia due to pontomesencephalic lesions is similar to that caused by basal ganglia or thalamic lesions. Structures involved include the pontomesencephalic tegmentum and the superior cerebellar peduncles. Such lesions are often associated with fatal outcome. While delayed occurrence of severe brainstem dystonia appears to be rare, it is possible that mild manifestations of dystonia might be ignored or not be emphasized in the presence of other disabling deficits.

### Activating an anterior nucleus gigantocellularis subpopulation triggers emergence from pharmacologically-induced coma in rodents [^ab8b8440]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Here, we identify an area within the medullary RAS in animals that can facilitate emergence from coma and arousal by recruiting and stimulating multiple neurophysiological routes. This area lies at the anterior border of the nucleus gigantocellularis (aNGC). Activating aNGC neurons elicits cortical, autonomic, and behavioral arousal from a vastly low brain activity state. aNGC stimulation also triggers activation of noradrenergic (locus coeruleus), glutamatergic (parabrachial nucleus), ventral and dorsal pathways, as well as brain structures involved in directed and voluntary movements. We show that firing rate of aNGC neurons precedes cortical activation and onset of movement prior to spontaneous emergence from anesthesia in rodents. Thus, activation of aNGC originating in the medullary reticular formation can restore cortical arousal, responses to external stimuli and motor behavior in rodents.

Disorders of consciousness — therapeutic interventions identify that two Class I therapeutic studies and one Class III study were found; amantadine at 4 mg/kg twice daily was possibly associated with faster improvement in severe traumatic brain injury over 4 weeks of treatment and appears safe; there is insufficient evidence to support or refute continuation of benefit once amantadine is discontinued; and in VS/UWS of mixed etiologies, conventional tilt table treatment is probably superior to tilt table treatment with an integrated stepping device for improving level of arousal.

Defining Endotypes/Phenotypes

Background

Current prognostication models for brain injury that focus only on motor response and overt evidence of cognition provide limited ability to predict outcomes, with the best models having only 70–80% discrimination. Treatments for acute brain injury based on phenotype classification are also greatly limited, with harmful, uncertain, or inconsistent outcomes in clinical trials. Furthermore, most clinical trials have not successfully translated preclinical evidence of efficacy into successful therapies for humans. Thus, 60–85% of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) conducted in the setting of acute brain injury have produced inconclusive results.

The limitations in accuracy of prognostication and efficacy of therapy point to the larger issue of human biological heterogeneity. Converging research demonstrates the limitations of phenotype-driven detection, diagnosis, classification, treatment selection, and prognosis for patients with severe brain injury and DoC. These approaches may lump biologically heterogeneous patients into a single phenotypic category. Successfully addressing the goal of restoring consciousness and promoting meaningful recovery requires precisely characterizing states of vigilance that distinguish the underlying etiology or pathophysiologic mechanisms affecting consciousness and/or responsiveness. By describing, defining, and classifying DoC in a manner that is more closely aligned with biological mechanisms, we can design more effective RCTs and increase the likelihood of discovering therapies that promote recovery from coma.

### Postural control in patients with lumbar disc herniation in the early postoperative period [^e9b8701c]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic spinal disc disease leads to disorders in postural movement coordination. An incorrect asymmetrical movement pattern for the lower limbs loading impairs proprioception and deteriorates postural stability, particularly when the vision is occluded. The standard surgical treatment improves biomechanical conditions in the lumbar spine, reduces pain, yet does it reduce the stability deficit in the upright position? An answer to the latter question would help work out targeted therapy to improve postural stability. We hypothesized that the standard surgical treatment would improve postural stability reflected by decreased sway variability accounting for better use of proprioceptive inputs postoperatively. Thirty-nine patients with lumbar disc herniation participated in the study. Their postural sway was recorded in anterior/posterior and medial/lateral planes with their eyes open or closed (EC) before and after surgery. The variability, range, mean velocity of the recorded time series and the area of the ellipse enclosed by the statokinesiogram were used as measures of postural stability. Preoperatively, EC condition resulted in an increased variability and mean velocity of postural sway, while postoperatively it caused an increase in sway mean velocity and sway area only with no effect on sway variability and range. The comparison of the balance before and after the surgery in the EC condition showed significant decrease in all parameters. In the early postoperative period, the patients recover the ability to control their postural sway in EC within normal limits, however, at the expense of significantly increased frequency of corrective torques. It is probably a transient short-term strategy needed to compensate for the recovery phase when the normal weighting factors for all afferents are being reestablished. We propose that this transient postoperative period may be the best timing of therapeutic intervention targeted at facilitating and reinforcing the acquisition of correct motor patterns.
