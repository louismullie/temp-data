## Question

For DM patients do you still put them on ACE/ARBS for kidney protection if they are taking Empagliflozin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether patients with diabetes mellitus who are already taking empagliflozin should still be prescribed an ACE inhibitor or ARB for kidney protection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence for ACEi/ARB renoprotection in diabetic kidney disease. Then, I should verify the magnitude and consistency of SGLT2 inhibitor benefits, especially empagliflozin, and whether those benefits depend on background RAAS blockade. Next, I will review contemporary guideline positions on combination therapy. After that, I need to check mechanistic complementarity and safety considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with monitoring advice and exceptions, making sure I anchor each point to high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the foundational role of ACEi/ARB therapy in diabetic kidney disease. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show that ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce progression of diabetic kidney disease, including reductions in doubling of creatinine and progression to kidney failure, with the clearest benefits in patients with albuminuria, and guidelines have long recommended titrating to maximally tolerated doses in appropriate patients [^71a6da10] [^2cc4d80a] [^65fb095e].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of SGLT2 inhibitor benefits and whether they obviate the need for RAAS blockade. Large, dedicated kidney outcome trials and meta-analyses demonstrate that SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin, reduce kidney disease progression by roughly 30–40% across a range of eGFR and albuminuria, and critically, these benefits are consistent whether or not patients are already on ACEi/ARB at baseline, indicating independent and additive effects rather than substitution [^449e841f] [^c26a7eb0] [^8a67e05a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm what contemporary guidelines say about combination therapy. KDIGO 2024 and ADA/KDIGO consensus explicitly recommend using ACEi/ARB at the highest tolerated dose and adding an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit in patients with T2D and CKD, reflecting complementary mechanisms and additive outcomes; the UK Kidney Association likewise issues a Grade 1A recommendation to ensure clinically appropriate RAS blockade alongside SGLT2 inhibition [^65fb095e] [^e469d3b1] [^de73c1fb].

> I need to check mechanistic complementarity to ensure this isn't just statistical noise. RAAS blockade reduces intraglomerular pressure via efferent arteriolar effects, while SGLT2 inhibition restores tubuloglomerular feedback and reduces hyperfiltration; together they target both hemodynamic axes, and exploratory human studies suggest SGLT2i may modulate the RAS toward a beneficial Ang-(1–7) axis, supporting biological plausibility for synergy [^0560de53] [^7c58efbe].

> But wait, what about safety and monitoring when combining these agents. I should confirm that the initial eGFR dip with SGLT2i is expected and that hyperkalemia risk with ACEi/ARB is manageable. Guidelines advise checking serum creatinine/eGFR and potassium within 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose changes, anticipating a modest, reversible eGFR fall with SGLT2i, and using strategies to mitigate hyperkalemia if it emerges, which is consistent with trial safety profiles showing no excess AKI and low discontinuation rates with combination therapy [^8fc7e204] [^449e841f] [^537f1668].

> Let me consider exceptions so I don't overgeneralize. If a patient has contraindications to ACEi/ARB such as bilateral renal artery stenosis, prior angioedema, or recurrent hyperkalemia despite optimization, then RAAS blockade should be avoided; conversely, if eGFR is below labeled thresholds for SGLT2i or there is a history of DKA, SGLT2i may be deferred, though empagliflozin has supportive data down to eGFR 20 in EMPA-KIDNEY and labeling reflects this expanded use in CKD [^449e841f] [^c26a7eb0].

> I should double-check the practical bottom line. Yes, patients with diabetes who are already on empagliflozin should still be prescribed an ACE inhibitor or ARB if they have albuminuria and no contraindications, because the combination provides additive kidney protection beyond either alone, and this is a consistent, high-strength recommendation across major guidelines; if the patient is already on an ACEi/ARB, continue and titrate to the maximally tolerated dose, and if not on one, initiate and titrate while monitoring kidney function and potassium [^65fb095e] [^e469d3b1] [^de73c1fb].

---

In patients with diabetes who are already taking empagliflozin, **ACE inhibitors or ARBs should still be prescribed** for kidney protection if they have albuminuria or CKD, because empagliflozin and RAAS blockade have **complementary mechanisms** and provide additive renoprotection [^0560de53] [^7e5bb670]. Current guidelines recommend using both agents together when indicated, with ACEi/ARB titrated to the maximally tolerated dose and empagliflozin continued down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m² [^65fb095e] [^e469d3b1] [^c26a7eb0]. Monitor for hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury after initiation or dose changes, and avoid dual RAAS blockade (ACEi plus ARB) [^8fc7e204] [^de73c1fb].

## Mechanisms of renal protection: empagliflozin vs. ACE inhibitors/ARBs

Empagliflozin provides renoprotection through **hemodynamic and non-hemodynamic effects**, including restoration of tubuloglomerular feedback, reduction of intraglomerular pressure, and attenuation of albuminuria [^6a59c1d9] [^014cef13]. ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce intraglomerular pressure by blocking angiotensin II, thereby decreasing proteinuria and slowing CKD progression [^2cc4d80a]. These **distinct mechanisms** suggest complementary and additive effects when used together [^0560de53].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting combination therapy

Several large randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrate that combining empagliflozin with ACE inhibitors or ARBs provides **additive renal benefits** compared with either therapy alone:

- **EMPA-REG OUTCOME**: Empagliflozin reduced the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy by 39% and the composite renal outcome by 46%, with benefits consistent in patients on background ACEi/ARB therapy (80.7% of participants) [^1c7eb0c5] [^489f0cae].

- **CREDENCE**: Canagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney failure, doubling of serum creatinine, or renal/cardiovascular death by 30% in patients with diabetic kidney disease, all of whom were on maximally tolerated ACEi/ARB therapy [^3ed86a85].

- **EMPA-KIDNEY**: Empagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death by 28% in patients with CKD, including those with and without diabetes, with 85% on ACEi/ARB at baseline [^449e841f] [^dcfb5004].

- **Meta-analyses**: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of kidney failure, ESRD, and renal death by approximately 30–40%, with consistent benefits across subgroups, including patients on ACEi/ARB therapy [^7c1e415e] [^8068821d].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines consistently recommend **combination therapy** with empagliflozin and ACE inhibitors or ARBs for patients with diabetes and CKD or albuminuria:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| KDIGO 2024 | - Initiate ACEi or ARB at the highest tolerated dose <br/> - Add SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or canagliflozin) if eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² for additive kidney and cardiovascular benefits [^65fb095e] [^e469d3b1] |
| ADA 2025 | - Use ACEi or ARB for patients with albuminuria <br/> - Add SGLT2 inhibitor for additional kidney and cardiovascular protection [^notfound] |
| AACE 2022 | - RAAS blockade with ACEi or ARB for albuminuria <br/> - Add SGLT2 inhibitor for additional kidney and cardiovascular benefits [^c55f0230] |

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

While combination therapy is generally safe, clinicians should monitor for **hyperkalemia** and acute kidney injury, particularly after initiating or adjusting therapy. Empagliflozin may cause a transient initial decline in eGFR, which is usually reversible and not associated with increased acute kidney injury risk [^449e841f] [^c26a7eb0]. Avoid dual RAAS blockade (ACEi plus ARB) due to increased risks of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury [^73f449c2].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient selection

Combination therapy is **especially beneficial** in the following scenarios:

- **Albuminuria**: Patients with persistent albuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g) despite ACEi/ARB therapy [^c55f0230].

- **Progressive CKD**: Patients with declining eGFR or advancing CKD stages [^449e841f].

- **High cardiovascular risk**: Patients with established cardiovascular disease or heart failure [^4a469fc9].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Patients with diabetes who are already taking empagliflozin should still be prescribed **ACE inhibitors or ARBs** for kidney protection if they have albuminuria or CKD. The combination provides additive renoprotective effects through complementary mechanisms, and current guidelines endorse this approach. Clinicians should monitor for hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury, and avoid dual RAAS blockade.

### Study details | Comparison between the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitor… [^bda3fa1f]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system has been identified as the cornerstone in the management of DKD for decades. Recently, more evidence supports the use of Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of DKD. They were associated with slower progression of renal disease and lower rates of clinically relevant kidney events. Those studies confirmed the SGLT2i efficacy in kidney protection and showed that their addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers will be more effective than using ACEi or ARBS alone. It is unclear whether SGLT2i is used as a first-line instead of ACEi or ARB, and to what extent it will be effective in managing DKD compared to the proven effect of ACEi/ARBs alone. This study provides a unique opportunity to address this gap in the literature.

The aim of this study is to compare, head to head, the renal performance of ACEi versus SGLT2 in diabetic patients who have evidence of deteriorating renal function evidenced by either the reduction of e GFR or increased UACR. Scientific hypotheses: Null hypothesis: after one year, the mean change of the e GFR in the enalapril group
- Mean change of the e GFR in the empagliflozin group ≥ 5 ml/min/1. 73m2. Results from this study will add to the current literature examining whether the use of SGLT2i, as a first-line or if ACEi is contraindicated or intolerable, is non-inferior to ACEi in preserving kidney function in DKD patients. Superiority could also be declared if present. Further studies with a longer period of time will be required for comparing the long-term effect of both medications on kidneys. The reasons beyond the choice of Empagliflozin in this trial were based on many factors.

the results of trial proved its efficacy in delaying the deterioration of kidney function and its availability in the local market. Moreover, it has a good safety profile in comparison to Canagliflozin. Drug: Empagliflozin 25 MG Drug: Enalapril Maleate 20 mg

ACEi or ARB

For the previous decades, ACEi and ARBs have been the mainstay of therapy for slowing the progression of proteinuric kidney disease. Numerous trials aggregated in meta-analysis have shown that both ACEi and ARBs reduce eGFR decline and progression to ESKD in both diabetic and non-diabetic proteinuric kidney disease (A3 or uPCR > 650 mg/g, uACR > 300 mg/g). These medications should generally be titrated to their maximally tolerated doses.

Patients with diabetes and moderate albuminuria (A2 or uACR 30–300 mg/g) benefit from maximally tolerated ACEi or ARB given trial data exhibiting decreased development of increasing albuminuria to A3. For non-diabetic patients with moderate albuminuria, less data exists for benefit of ACEi or ARBs, but patients still likely derive benefit from albuminuria reduction with these agents. ACEi and ARBs do not to have the same eGFR preservation in patients with non-proteinuric kidney disease, and thus are not recommended for this subgroup.

SGLT2i

SGLT2is initially started as glucose lowering agents for T2DM but were subsequently shown to have significant cardiovascular and kidney protection in large high quality RCTs. In a meta-analysis, SGLT2is even have kidney protective effects for diabetic patients without albuminuria. Thus, for patients with diabetes and evidence of CKD (eGFR > 20), SGLT2is are strongly recommended after addition of maximally tolerated ACEi or ARB.

For patients with non-diabetic kidney disease, SGLT2is were assessed in two large kidney outcome RCTs, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY. For non-diabetic patients with A3, SGLT2i exhibited similar kidney, cardiovascular, and mortality benefits as previous trials in patients with diabetes. Evidence for those with moderate-to-no albuminuria is limited to modest GFR decline attenuation, though does not appear to have significant benefit on the primary outcomes. Overall, for patients with non-diabetic kidney disease (eGFR > 20) and albuminuria, SGLT2i are also strongly recommended after addition of maximally tolerated ACEi or ARB.

Evidence From Phase II/III Trials

Early evidence that SGLT2i provided renal protection was seen in phase II and phase III trials. In a phase III trial comparing empagliflozin and glimepiride, preservation of renal function was reported with empagliflozin (25 mg once daily, n = 769) from baseline to week 104 compared with glimepiride (1–4 mg once daily, n = 780) as an add-on to metformin. The adjusted mean difference in eGFR (baseline to week 104) for empagliflozin versus glimepiride was 3.3 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (95% CI 2.0–4.7, p < 0.0001). A post-hoc analysis of data pooled from two phase III clinical trials in patients having hypertension and T2DM, receiving stable doses of ACE-Is or ARBs and having microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria at baseline showed that dapagliflozin was associated with greater 12-week reductions in albuminuria compared with placebo.

A phase III study of empagliflozin as an add-on treatment in people with T2DM and stage 2 and 3 CKD demonstrated that empagliflozin reduces albuminuria. In a phase III study in individuals with T2DM already on metformin, canagliflozin slowed the decline in kidney function compared with glimepiride, independent of the glycemic benefits. In addition, canagliflozin significantly decreased albuminuria; the effects of canagliflozin on ACR were consistent irrespective of baseline RAAS blockade.

The reduction in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure was also striking, with subgroup analysis showing consistent results in patients with or without heart failure at baseline. Patients with diabetes and heart failure have a particularly poor prognosis; thus, while the results seen with empagliflozin are still to be confirmed by independent studies, they are very promising. Even in patients without diabetes, heart failure is a challenging condition to treat, and it has been reported that empagliflozin will be studied in patients with heart failure, both with and without T2DM.

During the trial, renal outcomes were also studied. Patients in the pooled empagliflozin groups had a significantly lower risk of renal disease progression as related to various predefined endpoints, including incident or worsening nephropathy, defined as progression to macroalbuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g), which occurred in 12.7% of the empagliflozin group versus 18.8% of the placebo group (HR 0.61; 95% CI: 0.53–0.70; P < 0.001). The empagliflozin group also had a significantly lower risk of starting renal replacement therapy, which was recorded in 1.0% of the empagliflozin group versus 2.1% of the placebo group (HR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21–0.97; P = 0.04). Empagliflozin appeared to have no effect on the risk of developing albuminuria in patients with normal albumin levels at baseline (HR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.87–1.04; P = 0.25), although the risk of progression to macroalbuminuria in the overall group was significantly reduced (HR 0.62; 95% CI: 0.54–0.72; P < 0.001). Empagliflozin also appeared to protect renal function as measured by eGFR — after an initial dip in eGFR during the first few weeks of treatment, eGFR stabilized in the empagliflozin group and in fact returned to baseline values after stopping treatment. Because eGFR in the placebo group declined over time, following the natural progression expected, there were significant differences between the empagliflozin and placebo groups by the study end. It is worth remembering that these renal effects of empagliflozin were seen in addition to standard of care: most patients in the trial were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (80.7% at baseline). When looking at adverse events, events that were consistent with acute renal failure, including acute kidney injury, and hyperkalemia were reported in a lower proportion of the empagliflozin group than the placebo group.

### SGLT2i for evidence-based cardiorenal protection in diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease: a comprehensive review by EURECA-M and ERBP working groups of ERA [^0c697abd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health issue affecting an estimated 850 million people globally. The leading causes of CKD is diabetes and hypertension, which together account for > 50% of patients with end-stage kidney disease. Progressive CKD leads to the requirement for kidney replacement therapy with transplantation or dialysis. In addition, CKD, is a risk factor for premature cardiovascular disease, particularly from structural heart disease and heart failure (HF). Until 2015, the mainstay of treatment to slow progression of both diabetic and many non-diabetic kidney diseases was blood pressure control and renin-angiotensin system inhibition; however, neither angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) nor angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduced cardiovascular events and mortality in major trials in CKD. The emergence of cardiovascular and renal benefits observed with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) from clinical trials of their use as anti-hyperglycaemic agents has led to a revolution in cardiorenal protection for patients with diabetes. Subsequent clinical trials, notably DAPA-HF, EMPEROR, CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY have demonstrated their benefits in reducing risk of HF and progression to kidney failure in patients with HF and/or CKD. The cardiorenal benefits-on a relative scale-appear similar in patients with or without diabetes. Specialty societies' guidelines are continually adapting as trial data emerges to support increasingly wide use of SGLT2i. This consensus paper from EURECA-m and ERBP highlights the latest evidence and summarizes the guidelines for use of SGLT2i for cardiorenal protection focusing on benefits observed relevant to people with CKD.

### Analysis from the EMPA-REG OUTCOMEtrial indicates empagliflozin may assist in preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes irrespective of medications that alter intrarenal hemodynamics [^8a67e05a]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular (CV) disease, empagliflozin (EMPA) decreased progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), likely via a reduction in intraglomerular pressure. Due to prevalent comorbidities, such as hypertension and albuminuria, patients often receive other agents that alter intrarenal hemodynamics, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi/ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be used by some individuals. In this exploratory, non-prespecified analysis, we investigated whether the kidney benefits of EMPA are altered in individuals already using the medications in these categories. In the BI 10773 (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME ®) trial, 7020 patients were essentially equally randomized to EMPA 10 mg, 25 mg or placebo added to their standard care. Differences in risk of incident or worsening nephropathy for pooled EMPA vs placebo across subgroups by baseline background medications (to which patients were not randomized) were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Risk reductions in incident or worsening nephropathy with EMPA were consistent across medication subgroups, with no heterogeneity of treatment effect. As a representative example, the risk for acute renal failure was overall slightly increased in patients using ACEi/ARBs in all groups (placebo, EMPA 10 mg or EMPA 25 mg) but incidence rates were numerically lower in those assigned to EMPA. Similar patterns were observed for other medications included in this analysis. Thus, EMPA may assist to prevent CKD progression in patients with T2DM with CV disease, irrespective of common background medications that alter intrarenal hemodynamics, and without increasing acute renal adverse events.

Effectiveness of SGLT2i in Ameliorating Albuminuria

In the EMPA-REG CVOT trial, 80.7% of the patients were taking ACE-Is or ARBs at baseline and had controlled blood pressure. Incident or worsening nephropathy was reduced by 39% in the empagliflozin arm compared to placebo, with the renal effects of empagliflozin evident even in patients on RAAS blockers. This finding supports the potential use of empagliflozin in combination with RAAS blockers in people with T2DM and CKD. In accordance with an exploratory analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, patients treated with empagliflozin were more likely to experience a sustained improvement from microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.22–1.67, p < 0.0001) or from macroalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or normoalbuminuria (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.40–2.37, p < 0.0001) and less likely to experience a sustained deterioration from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.95, p = 0.0077). Moreover, the decrease in urine ACR was evident since week 12 of the treatment. In the dapagliflozin phase II/III trial, overall, 17.8, 18.9, and 7.0% of patients improved to normoalbuminuria status in the dapagliflozin 10 mg and 5 mg groups and placebo group, respectively. Similarly, in a pooled analysis of phase III dapagliflozin trials, greater 12-week reductions in albuminuria (− 33.2%, 95% CI − 45.4 to − 18.2) compared with placebo was evident. The reduction in albuminuria was also present after adjusting for age, sex, changes in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, body weight, and eGFR, i.e. − 23.5% (95% CI − 37.6 to − 6.3). A meta-analysis of 47 RCTs of SGLT2i in 22,843 people with T2DM having CKD reported a significant reduction in urine ACR (weighted mean difference − 107.35 mg/g, 95% CI − 192.53 to − 22.18). These results support the use of SGLT2i in people with T2DM and CKD, irrespective of the patients' albuminuria status at baseline and even in patients with normoalbuminuria to prevent progression to micro- or macroalbuminuria. Canagliflozin prevented the progression of albuminuria by 27% (HR 0.73; CI 0.67–0.79) and induced regression of albuminuria more frequently in the trial participants (HR 1.70; 95% CI 1.51–1.91). Table 1 shows the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin reduced the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy by 39%, and the composite kidney outcome of doubling of serum creatinine, initiation of renal replacement therapy or death due to kidney disease by 46% versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established cardiovascular disease. Studies have also suggested that empagliflozin reduces the risk of adverse kidney outcomes across a wide range of kidney disease stages in patients with T2D and cardiovascular disease, and also in those with heart failure and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) irrespective of the presence of T2D. More recently, the CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce kidney disease progression in patients with CKD. DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY included a substantial proportion of patients without T2D and reported consistent benefits regardless of presence of diabetes. This finding is supported by a meta-analysis of SGLT2 inhibitor studies. However, the underlying mechanisms of these highly impactful effects remain incompletely understood.

### Empagliflozin and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease [^176c3d08]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Urinary glucose excretion with empagliflozin decreases with declining renal function, resulting in less potency for glucose lowering in patients with kidney disease. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.

Methods

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2 at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. We analyzed cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in patients with prevalent kidney disease (defined as eGFR < 60 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2 and/or urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g) at baseline. Additional analyses were performed in subgroups by baseline eGFR (< 45, 45- < 60, 60- < 90, ≥ 90 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2) and baseline urine albumin-creatinine ratio (> 300, 30- ≤ 300, < 30 mg/g).

Results

Of 7020 patients treated, 2250 patients had prevalent kidney disease at baseline, of whom 67% had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for > 10 years, 58% were receiving insulin, and 84% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 29% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.98), the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99), the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 39% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.87), and the risk of all-cause hospitalization by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.92). Effects of empagliflozin on these outcomes were consistent across categories of eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio at baseline and across the 2 doses studied. The adverse event profile of empagliflozin in patients with eGFR < 60 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2 was consistent with the overall trial population.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality in vulnerable patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.

Evidence- and Guideline-Based Use of SGLT2i Agents and Other Treatments

ACEi and ARB treatments are recommended for their renoprotective attributes. These medicines should be considered for those with increased risk of renal and CV disease (with hypertension and/or microalbuminuria), where appropriate, and in accordance with NICE and local prescribing guidelines. Although, as mentioned previously, clinicians should keep in mind the residual risk for people with T2DM and monitor regularly for disease progression.

The ADA/EASD guidelines already reflect the growing evidence base for SGT2i medicines in the treatment of people with T2DM who may be at risk of DKD, and the latest KDIGO guidelines are aligned with these recommendations. ESC/EASD guidelines also recognise the value of the CREDENCE data in demonstrating the renoprotective effects of canagliflozin. The prescribing landscape is beginning to change; canagliflozin has been granted a change of licence by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to include use in those with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. This is in recognition of the renal outcomes demonstrated in SGLT2i CVOTs, the CREDENCE study and CVD-REAL 3. Currently, canagliflozin has the most direct evidence for renal benefit in patients with DKD. CREDENCE was the first published SGLT2i study specifically examining renal outcomes in a high-risk population, providing confirmatory and robust data on the effects of canagliflozin on patient-relevant renal end points. There was no signal for adverse effects of amputation or fracture, which had been seen in the CANVAS trial. Studies on other SGLT2i therapies are ongoing, with data expected in the coming years (e.g. DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY studies). These studies will assess whether the renal effects observed in the CREDENCE study are a consistent class effect across this group of therapies.

Overall, genital mycotic infections are the most frequent side effect observed with SGLT2i. The incidence of UTI in patients treated with SGLT2i is similar to that seen in all people with T2DM. Hypoglycemia can occur when a SGLT2i is used as an add-on to other agents causing hypoglycemia, such as insulin or sulfonylureas. Volume depletion and hypotension are rare and can be minimized by adjusting diuretic and antihypertensive treatment in patients at risk. The incidences of AKI, amputation (largely feet and toes), and fractures are rare and can be prevented by careful monitoring and avoiding use in high-risk patients.

Ongoing SGLT2i Trials Assessing Renal Outcomes

Multiple trials assessing the renal benefits of SGLT2i are ongoing. The RACELINES trial will assess the clinical effects and mechanism of monotherapy and combination therapy of the SGLT2i empagliflozin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor linagliptin on renal physiology and biomarkers in metformin-treated T2DM patients. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial will compare the renal effect of a SGLT2i and a sulfonylurea. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial will evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on kidney disease progression or CV death in people without T2DM. Despite optimal treatment with RAAS inhibitors, many patients with non-diabetic kidney disease show progressive kidney function loss, which is associated with high residual proteinuria. The recently completed DIAMOND study was conducted to assess the renoprotective effects of dapagliflozin in non-diabetic patients with proteinuria. The DAPA-CKD trial, evaluating the efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with CKD stages 2–4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with and without T2D, will be stopped early due to overwhelming efficacy. The treatment paradigm for CKD, for people with and without T2DM, may change after the release of the ongoing trial results over the next few years. These trials are listed in Table 4 with their primary outcome measures.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 UPDATE [^de73c1fb]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

These clinical practice guidelines pertain to use of SGLT-2 inhibition in people with CKD. The standard of care in many forms of CKD is the use of RAS blockers, with clear evidence of benefit in diabetic nephropathy. All CREDENCE participants were on stable maximally tolerated RAS blockade, as were 97% of DAPA-CKD participants and 85% of participants in EMPA-KIDNEY. We therefore provide a grade 1A Recommendation to prescribe RAS blockade and ensure clinically appropriate dosing alongside any SGLT-2 inhibitor use. Note that it has been suggested that, mechanistically, SGLT-2 inhibition may have the potential to activate RAS. However the large trials in people with type 2 DM at high atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk have been combined in meta- analysis and have raised a hypothesis that the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors on kidney disease progression could extend to people with type 2 DM not on RAS blockade. The lack of heterogeneity of effect of empagliflozin on the primary composite outcome stratified by use of RAS inhibition in EMPA-KIDNEY lends further support to this hypothesis.

Note that we recommend single agent RAS blockade, as combination therapy (i.e. dual blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] plus angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) has been found to increase the risk of serious hyperkalaemia or acute kidney injury, and has not been shown to importantly slow CKD progression.
3 We suggest following NICE guidelines on use of uACR for screening of albuminuria (NICE NG203). We recognise that more pragmatic approaches to identifying risk of kidney disease progression may be necessary whilst local access to uACR measurement is improved (Grade 2C).

Combinations with SGLT2is

The key phase 3 clinical trials of SGLT2is in CKD, DAPA-CKD, CREDENCE, and EMPA-KIDNEY, help to inform on the use of certain treatment combinations as most patients were treated with one of these types of drugs also received a RAAS inhibitor (ACEi or ARB) at baseline. Key data from the SGLT2i trials in CKD are summarized in Table 2. Each of these trials demonstrated the benefit of combination therapy, whereby combination of an SGLT2i and a RAAS inhibitor reduced the risk of progression or death from CV (or kidney) causes, CV events, and risk of kidney failure compared with RAAS inhibitor/standard of care alone.

The mechanisms involved in the cardiorenal protective effects of SGLT2is in CKD are complex and are not fulling understood but probably include the class effect of decreasing blood pressure, increasing tubuloglomerular feedback, and decreasing plasma volume. The combination of an SGLT2i plus a RAAS inhibitor in CKD is complementary, as RAAS blockade reduces renal injury by reducing high angiotensin II levels, and SGLT2i restores tubuloglomerular balance by blocking glucose reabsorption that helps to reduce intraglomerular pressure and hyperfiltration, thus reducing albuminuria and hypertension. However, SGLT2is are commonly underprescribed for patients who may benefit from their use, such as those at increased risk of cardiorenal disease, suggesting that the introduction of specific SGLT2i combinations may be challenging in clinical practice. Studies of SGLT2i plus ns-MRA combinations are ongoing or have recently completed (Table 3).

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease — renal outcome benefits of SGLT‑2 inhibitors are supported by two large systematic reviews showing reduction versus placebo by 38% (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.56–0.70), with results consistent across subgroups by baseline ASCVD, albuminuria, HF, T2DM, and CKD; in included trials the majority (> 80%) used ACEi or ARB at baseline, and across cardiovascular outcomes trials most patients (74% or more) had an eGFR of at least 60 mL/min/173m2 and 7–11% had macroalbuminuria; in individual RCTs canagliflozin reduced ESRD or renal mortality in pooled CANVAS and CREDENCE (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.54–0.75), dapagliflozin reduced a primary composite in DAPA-CKD [eGFR 25–75 mL/min/1.73m2; UACR 200–5000 mg/g] (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.51–0.72), and empagliflozin reduced a similar composite in EMPA-KIDNEY (eGFR 20–45 mL/min/1.73m2 or eGFR 45–90 with UACR ≥ 200) (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.64–0.82), whereas no statistically significant benefit was seen with ertugliflozin, collectively indicating that select SGLT‑2 inhibitors improve renal outcomes in patients with T2DM, with and without CKD.

At baseline, 85% of patients were treated with ACE inhibitor or ARB, 64% with statins, and 34% with antiplatelet agents.

JARDIANCE was superior to placebo in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint of sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, progression to end-stage kidney disease, or CV or renal death. The treatment effect reflected a reduction in a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, progression to end-stage kidney disease, and CV death. There were few renal deaths during the trial. JARDIANCE also reduced the risk of first and recurrent hospitalization (see Table 18 and Figure 13); information collected on the reason for hospitalization was insufficient to further characterize the benefit.

Figure 13	Time to First Occurrence of the Primary Composite Endpoint, Sustained ≥ 40% eGFR Decline, Sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m, ESKD or Renal Death, or CV Death

The results of the primary composite endpoint were generally consistent across the pre-specified subgroups examined, including eGFR categories, underlying cause of kidney disease, diabetes status, or background use of RAS inhibitors (see Figure 14). The treatment benefit with JARDIANCE on the primary composite endpoint was not evident in patients with very low levels of albuminuria, however there were few events in these patients.

### Guidelines adherence in the prevention and management of chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus on the background of recent European recommendations-a registry-based analysis [^35866d02]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Early detection and treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with diabetes may prevent or delay the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), as well as subsequent morbidity and mortality. The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) of the National Kidney Foundation has recommended the use of estimating equations for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) on the basis of serum creatinine determinations and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) since 2011.

Screening recommendations are essentially unaltered since 2011. The 2019 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend that patients with chronic kidney disease undergo annual spot UACR, serum creatinine and estimated GFR (eGFR) evaluations (recommendation class I, level of evidence A) along with a number of specific recommendations for the treatment of affected patients. Particular attention must be given to tight glucose and blood pressure control: It is recommended to target an HbA1c < 7.0% (or < 53 mmol/mol) to decrease microvascular complications (recommendation class I, level of evidence A). Blood pressure should be lowered to 130 mmHg systolic blood pressure (SBP) or lower (but not < 120 mmHg), while a SBP between 130 and 139 mmHg is recommended for patients > 65 years (recommendation class I, level of evidence A). Diabetic patients with hypertension should be treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-blocking agents (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi]/angiotensin receptor blocker [ARBs]) especially when microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria/proteinuria, or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is present (recommendation class I, level of evidence A). Treatment with sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors ([SGLT-2i] empagliflozin, canagliflozin, or dapagliflozin) is advised in patients with an eGFR 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2) (recommendation class I, level of evidence B) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist ([GLP-1Ras] liraglutide, semaglutide) in patients if eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 (recommendation class IIa, level of evidence B).

3.1 Study identification and selection

Figure 1 shows the study selection process. The search of relevant databases and manual scanning of reference lists of relevant studies identified 161 potentially relevant citations. After the initial screening of titles and abstracts, 19 articles remained for full text evaluation. Following detailed evaluation, 10 articles were excluded because (i) population was not relevant (n = 7); (ii) duplicate studies (n = 2); and (iii) treatment comparison not relevant (n = 1). The remaining nine articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review.,

FIGURE 1
Selection of studies included in the meta‐analysis

3.2 Study characteristics and risk of bias

The nine articles comprised eight studies, of which one was based on a pooled individual patient data (IPD) analysis of 13 trials (Table 1). No RCT specifically investigated the combination of SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors compared with SGLT2‐Is alone. All eligible studies were based on trials that had investigated the effects of SGLT2 inhibition compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and reported subgroup results for those treated with or without RAAS‐Is at baseline. Of the 34,551 total participants, 23,109 involved the comparison of SGLT2‐I vs placebo with RAAS inhibition at baseline and 11,442 involved the comparison of SGLT2‐I vs placebo without RAAS inhibition at baseline. In addition to diabetes, patients had other comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic CVD or heart failure. Patients had been diagnosed with T2DM and were being managed on standard treatment therapies including ACE‐Is/ARBs, diuretics or calcium channel blockers before inclusion into the trials. All included studies were double‐blinded RCTs. All the studies were conducted in multiple countries. The type of SGLT2‐Is used included dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin and sotagliflozin. The majority of trials recruited patients who were at least 18 years old. The average age of participants ranged from 60 to 69 years. The treatment duration ranged from 12 weeks to 6.6 years. Using the Cochrane Collaboration tool, all trials demonstrated low risk of bias in the areas of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel and incomplete outcome data. Only one trial demonstrated unclear risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and the majority an unclear risk of bias in the areas of selective reporting and other bias (Appendix 3).

USE OF ADDITIONAL DRUGS THAT OFFER NEPHROPROTECTION AND CARDIOPROTECTION IN CKD

In addition to BP control at the targets and with the agents described above, the 2023 ESH Guidelines included for the first time a considerably detailed discussion and highlighted that progression of CKD and risk of CV events and mortality can be reduced in CKD patients by two novel drug classes that also have some BP-lowering effects, although they are not approved as antihypertensive agents.

The 2023 ESH guidelines discuss that early clinical studies in patients with T2DM with the oral antihyperglycemic class of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), suggested that these agents can offer office BP reductions of around 3–5/1–2 mmHg, that were later confirmed with ABPM studies. Of interest, larger reductions were described in patients with CKD G4 (around 7 mmHg for SBP). The main mechanism is a mild natriuretic/diuretic effect occurring possibly from both inhibition of proximal sodium reabsorption and osmotic diuresis. These agents were also shown to reduce urine ACR by 25%–40%, depending on the baseline albuminuria levels, as well as plasma uric acid, which is also important in CKD patients. The Guidelines refer to the fact that CV outcome trials with SGLT2is in patients with T2DM (which included also large proportions of patients with CKD), showed large and homogeneous reductions of around 40% in composite kidney endpoints. The document also analyzes the results of the kidney outcome trials investigating SGLT2is on diabetic and non-diabetic CKD on top of standard therapy including an ACEi or an ARB on maximum tolerated doses, i.e. the CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation), DAPA-CKD (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease) and EMPA-KIDNEY (The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection With Empagliflozin) studies, to conclude that all three trials were prematurely terminated due to benefit and showed significant reductions compared with placebo on composite kidney outcomes and individual endpoints such as doubling of SCr and progression to ESKD. In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, the reduction in the composite kidney outcome was evident in patients across the whole range of eGFR and most striking in patients with severely increased albuminuria. The chronic rate of eGFR loss was lower with empagliflozin in all urine ACR subgroups. A mild eGFR drop may also be present during the first weeks of treatment, but managed as in the case of RAS blockers. The mild BP reduction is suggested as a contributor to the nephroprotective effect of SGLT2is. It is highlighted that in CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD, SGLT2is were also able to reduce the risk of some CV events and in DAPA-CKD the risk of mortality in patients with CKD, something that was not previously evident with RAS blockade or any other drug treatment in this population.

4 GUIDELINE‐RECOMMENDED STANDARD OF CARE FOR CKD IN PATIENTS WITH T2D

The American Diabetes Association and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines (both published in 2020) recommend a multifactorial risk‐reduction strategy for patients with T2D and CKD to delay decline in kidney function and reduce the risk of CV complications. Evidence from the multicentre Nephropathy in Diabetes type 2 (NID‐2) study has shown that simultaneous management of CV risk factors by implementing an intensified multifactorial treatment approach has early and long‐lasting benefits in reducing the risk of major CV events and all‐cause mortality in patients with DKD. Current kidney‐protective recommendations include reduction of BP and optimization of glycaemic control. Recommended treatments for reducing BP in patients with T2D and CKD are angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The KDIGO guidelines also indicate that ACEis/ARBs may be considered in normotensive patients with T2D and CKD. Both drug classes have also been shown to reduce, but not completely prevent, worsening kidney function. Importantly, combinations of ACEis plus ARBs should not be used, as combinations of RAS inhibitors have not shown renal protection and have been associated with acute kidney injury or hyperkalaemia. The guidelines also recommend the use of glucose‐lowering drugs such as SGLT2is (canagliflozin and dapagliflozin) and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs; liraglutide and semaglutide) to slow the progression of kidney disease.SGLT2is and GLP‐1 RAs have also shown benefits on reduced CV risk, particularly for heart failure (HF) in the case of SGLT2is and atherosclerotic CV disease in the case of GLP‐1 RAs. Updated guidelines now state clinicians should consider an SGLT2i in patients with T2D and CV disease or CKD (estimated [e]GFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and particularly > 300 mg/g albuminuria), irrespective of HbA1c levels, to reduce the risk of kidney disease progression, CV events, or both, or the use of a GLP‐1 RA in patients with T2D and CVD, to reduce the risk of CV events, progression of albuminuria, or both.

T2D is a well-established risk factor for development and progression of CKD. KDIGO recommends categorization of risk by likelihood of progression to ESKD. Compared to placebo, empagliflozin decreases likelihood of worsening (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62–0.78) and increases likelihood of improvement (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30–1.86) in KDIGO risk category.

Currently, the recommended approach to slow the progression of DKD is management of underlying risk factors, including hypertension, hypoxemia, hyperglycemia, albuminuria, and increased adiposity, along with refraining from smoking and following a low-protein diet. Beyond this, people have few treatment options, and little progress has been made in this area over the past two decades, which has left a substantial proportion of people with DKD at high risk for progression to renal failure, cardiovascular morbidity, and cardiovascular mortality.

Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are recommended for the management of hypertension and heart failure. Evidence from clinical trials in people with T2DM suggested that RAAS inhibitors may provide renal benefits in this population; however, only two ARBs (losartan and irbesartan) and no ACE inhibitors are approved for the prevention of kidney function decline in people with T2DM and albuminuria (> 300 mg/g). Additionally, RAAS inhibitors have been associated with safety risks such as hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. Considering the current state of treatment for DKD, new medications capable of preventing or delaying the progression of this disease are needed.

Recent studies have investigated the potential renal benefits associated with sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which were first developed and approved for the management of hyperglycemia in people with T2DM. Unlike other classes of antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs), SGLT2 inhibitors work independently of insulin by lowering the renal threshold for glucose excretion (RT G) in people with T2DM, thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE) and leading to a mild osmotic diuresis and a net caloric loss that contribute to improvements in glycemic control, weight loss, and blood pressure reduction. SGLT2 inhibition has also been associated with renal hemodynamic changes, such as attenuation of renal hyperfiltration and normalization of tubuloglomerular feedback, which may contribute to renal benefits (Fig. 2).

### Albuminuria and serum tumor necrosis factor receptor levels in patients with type 2 diabetes on SGLT2 inhibitors: a prospective study [^1ff77839]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The general goal of diabetes treatment is to reduce mortality and maintain a quality of life comparable to that of healthy individuals; therefore, it is essential to prevent the onset and progression of diabetic complications. Adverse renal events are the most common and serious complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Micro- or macroalbuminuria is present in approximately 25% of people with T2DM. The development of albuminuria marks the progression of renal damage and predicts the cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM. Therefore, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease (CKD) endorse regular evaluation and reduction of albuminuria in patients with T2DM. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce the progression of albuminuria and even induce regression of microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria. However, residual risk remains, with approximately 30% of patients with T2DM and the presence of microalbuminuria progressing to macroalbuminuria despite the currently recommended treatment protocols.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (SGLT2i), which were originally designed as hypoglycemic agents for treating T2DM, have increasingly shown renal and cardiovascular protective properties in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Although the underlying mechanisms that provide renal benefits are still poorly understood, in recent post hoc analyses from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (BI10773 [Empagliflozin]) Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial, it was suggested that short-term reduction in albuminuria had a statistically significant association with a decreased risk of long-term renal function decline. Additionally, early changes in albuminuria after treatment with SGLT2i were independently associated with long-term kidney and cardiovascular outcomes.

Several basic studies have shown that SGLT2i ameliorates albuminuria by attenuating glomerular hyperfiltration. One possible mechanism could be suppressing the induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) for kidney protection in T2D — An SGLT2i with proven kidney protection is recommended for people with T2D who have an eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2; in those with HF, empagliflozin can be used with an eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and if eGFR drops below this level on treatment, the SGLT2i does not have to be stopped unless kidney replacement therapy is required. Recognized side effects are not greater at lower eGFR, initial reports of higher rates of lower extremity amputation with canagliflozin have not been substantiated, SGLT2is tend to lower serum potassium, and the risk of AKI is actually reduced by 25% with SGLT2i use in persons with T2D.

Treatment of CKD associated with T2D

CKD associated with T2D is a complex disease with multifactorial pathophysiology. In addition to lifestyle management, CKD may be treated with a range of drugs with differing MOAs and clinical effects.

Drug classes indicated for use in CKD and T2D in the United States include renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, SGLT2is, and finerenone, and for the treatment of T2D with high CV risk, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). Figure 1 provides an overview of the primary MOAs of RAAS inhibitors, SGLT2is, GLP-1 RAs, and finerenone in CKD associated with T2D. The two main RAAS inhibitor subclasses are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been long established as blood pressure-lowering medications. Three SGLT2is — dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin — are approved for the reduction in kidney disease progression and CV death. Three GLP-1 RAs — liraglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide — are approved for use in patients with T2D and established CV disease, and a fourth is under FDA review. Recent results from the placebo-controlled phase 3 FLOW trial showed that semaglutide treatment significantly reduced the risk of clinically important kidney outcomes and death from CV causes in patients with CKD associated with T2D (Table 2), thus, representing a potential additional future treatment option for patients with CKD associated with T2D. Finerenone is currently the only FDA-approved ns-MRA for the reduction in kidney disease progression and CV death in patients with T2D. Finerenone is also being investigated in a phase 3 placebo-controlled study in non-diabetic CKD (FIND-CKD) (Table 3). Two further drug classes are being investigated for their potential use in CKD and diabetes. These are the aldosterone synthase inhibitor BI 690517, which has just completed phase 2 evaluation and was tested in combination with a RAAS inhibitor and a SGLT2i (empagliflozin), and is now planned for phase 3 testing in the same target patient population, and the endothelin receptor antagonist atrasentan, which is being evaluated for potential application in CKD and diabetes.

### Design considerations for future renoprotection trials in the era of multiple therapies for chronic kidney disease [^e927591a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Within the last 5–10 years, nephrology has benefited from more large-scale, placebo-controlled randomized control trials (RCTs), leading to major pharmacological advancements that have been practice changing. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) can be added to clinically appropriate renin–angiotensin system inhibition (RASi) to provide cardiorenal protection in those with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, renoprotection RCTs with broad eligibility criteria have also improved treatment options for CKD patients without diabetes and guidelines now recommend SGLT2i to lower cardiorenal risk across a range of primary kidney diagnoses.

As an example of the scale of recent data, a collaborative meta-analysis of SGLT2i trials included approximately 90 000 participants from 13 large double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs, including 4 dedicated CKD trials of nearly 26 000 patients (20 931 with diabetes and 4967 without diabetes). Many patients from the non-CKD RCTs of SGLT2i included patients with decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The totality of the evidence found a central role for SGLT2i in the treatment of CKD as well as reducing risk of serious acute kidney injury, irrespective of diabetes status or primary kidney diagnosis. Initial SGLT2i trials in CKD populations prioritized the study of patients with proteinuric diabetic kidney disease. However, the most recent trials (DAPA-CKD [Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease] and EMPA-KIDNEY [The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection With Empagliflozin]) included a broader range of patients with lower eGFR, with EMPA-KIDNEY providing new information in patients with low levels of albuminuria.

Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources and search strategy

We registered this systematic review and meta‐analysis in the PROSPERO prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42021251601). It was conducted using a predefined protocol and in accordance with PRISMA guidelines (Appendix 1). MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library electronic databases were searched from 2012 (being the year of approval of the first SGLT2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin) in the European Union) to 08 May 2021 with no restriction on language. The computer‐based searches combined terms related to the intervention (eg SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin and ertugliflozin), comparator (eg RAAS inhibitor, ACE‐I), ARB, DRI) and population (eg type 2 diabetes) in humans. A RCT design search filter was employed. Details on the search strategy are provided in Appendix 2. Titles and abstracts of all initially identified citations were initially screened by one author (SS) to assess their suitability for potential inclusion, followed by the acquisition of full texts for detailed evaluation. Full‐text evaluation was independently conducted by two authors (SS and SKK). The reference lists of key studies and review articles were manually scanned for additional studies.

2.2 Study selection and eligibility criteria

Randomized controlled, open or blinded trials that assessed the effects of the combination of SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors compared with SGLT2 inhibitors in adults with type 2 diabetes and reported on renal or cardiovascular outcomes or adverse events were eligible. Randomized controlled trials that had also compared SGLT2‐I treatment with a placebo or standard care and reported outcomes according to whether patients were receiving RAAS‐Is or not at baseline were considered. We excluded the following: (i) studies that specifically enrolled only patients with known renal insufficiency or established renal parenchymal disease without diabetes mellitus and (ii) studies that recruited patients with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, history of hereditary glucose‐galactose malabsorption, primary renal glucosuria or renal disease that required treatment with immunosuppressive agents.

9 THE FUTURE ROLE OF‐2 INHIBITORS IN

Until recently, only ACEi or ARB therapy had been shown to improve outcomes in DKD. The CREDENCE study has confirmed the independent renoprotective effects of SGLT‐2 inhibitors in patients with DKD. The DAPA‐CKD trial has further established the beneficial renal effects of SGLT‐2 inhibitors in patients with CKD with or without T2D. Of note, renal outcomes were the primary endpoint in both the CREDENCE and DAPA‐CKD trials, and the beneficial effects of canagliflozin and dapagliflozin were additive to those of ACEis or ARBs. Most SGLT‐2 inhibitors are now approved for use in T2D patients with moderate (stage 3A) renal impairment (eGFR 45‐60 mL/min/1.73 m 2). The mechanism of renoprotection of SGLT‐2 inhibitors appears to be independent of its blood glucose‐lowering effects as the same renal benefits are also observed in patients with non‐diabetic kidney disease. The results from the ongoing EMPA‐KIDNEY (NCT03594110) trial will further establish the role of SGLT‐2 inhibitors in delaying the progression of renal disease in patients with both DKD and non‐diabetic kidney disease.

In addition, as with other therapeutic intervention trials, there is an under‐representation of the Asian population in most of the completed and ongoing large randomized controlled trials that evaluate the efficacy and safety of SGLT‐2 inhibitors. Studies in Asian populations have mainly included patients from China, Japan and Korea, thus there is a lack of data from the South Asian region, which accounts for a large proportion of the global diabetes population. Hence, there is a need for more studies on the Asian population with DKD, ideally with a pragmatic or innovative design, considering the limited resources in the region.

### Multimodal efforts to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^5e56c770]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2023). Medium credibility.

In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), slowing kidney disease progression is an important therapeutic goal. Many patients with T2DM and CKD also have cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis), which include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), are drugs with known antihypertensive effects as well as CV and kidney protective effects in patients with CKD. Studies have shown that adding a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to ACEI or ARB therapy has additive benefits in terms of kidney and CV protection in patients with CKD (with/without T2DM). For patients with CKD associated with T2DM who have persistent albuminuria despite taking the maximum tolerated dose of a RAASi, adding a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (finerenone) has demonstrated CV and kidney benefits in clinical trials. In this article, we review the use of ACEIs and ARBs for their kidney and CV protective effects when used alone or in combination with a drug with a different mechanism of action. From reviewing the available evidence, it seems clear that a multimodal drug effort is needed to achieve maximum kidney and CV protective effects for patients with CKD associated with T2DM.

Renoprotective Medicines

Agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) pathway (ACEi and ARB drugs) have demonstrated renoprotective effects in people with T2DM. These medicines are recommended by NICE for slowing the progression of DKD and are included in the current QOF (DM006, 3 points). The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group has also drafted guidelines for the management of CKD in people with diabetes (due to be published in September 2020). KDIGO recommends titration to the maximally tolerated dose of ACEi and ARB treatments for people with T2DM and increased ACR (ACR > 3 mg/mmol). Many individuals with T2DM may already be taking ACEi or ARB medicines for hypertension. Monitoring for eGFR reduction and hyperkalaemia is required when initiating or increasing the dose of RAAS antagonists. These drugs have been shown to reduce the relative risk of renal events by 20%; however, a residual risk remains for people with T2DM. The Steno-2 trial showed the benefit of intensive multifactorial treatment approaches (e.g. lifestyle changes, glycaemic control, RAAS inhibitors) on CV and renal outcomes in people with T2DM and severely increased ACR. It should be noted that, despite multiple interventions, 25% of those treated intensively went on to develop kidney disease, suggesting that there is scope for improvement in this area of T2DM management.

Published evidence from large-scale randomised trials and real-world studies supports the use of SGLT2i treatments in reducing the overall rate of kidney function decline and adverse renal risk among those with T2DM. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus on the management of hyperglycaemia in T2DM (Fig. 2), the new KDIGO guideline and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/EASD guideline each recommend the use of SGLT2i treatments for people with T2DM and eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (G3a/G3b, Fig. 1), where the approved licence indication allows. These recommendations are based on subgroup analyses from SGLT2i cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) as well as more recent data from the CREDENCE trial (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation), the first published study to assess the effects of an SGLT2i agent on renal outcomes in patients with T2DM and CKD.

### How do SGLT2 inhibitors protect the kidney? A mediation analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^dff69f65]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our finding that the most important mediators of the kidney benefits observed with empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial were hematocrit and hemoglobin is in line with mediation analyses on cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalization outcomes with empagliflozin. The predominance of these markers of erythropoiesis and oxygenation as mediator of the empagliflozin kidney benefits, particularly when assessed in a time-dependent manner, may suggest an erythropoietic mechanism of action, leading to alleviation of hypoxia in the kidneys. Other factors that register as moderate mediators include uric acid, SBP and FFA. However, further studies are required to validate the underlying mechanisms suggested by the findings of this study.

Recommendations for Optimal Use of SGLT2 Inhibitors

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors reduce the risk of progression to DKD and renal death by approximately 40–50% in people with T2DM who are at risk of CV events and are on ACE-Is and ARBs. Thus, SGLT2i have emerged as the new drugs that must be included in the armamentarium for the management for people with T2DM having CVD or mild-to-moderate DKD to curb morbidity and mortality. The recommendations for optimal use of SGLT2i, generated on the basis of evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses, is summarized below.

### Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes: implications for managing glycaemic control, cardiovascular and renal risk [^2474d27a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

This review examines the current literature relating to diabetes related kidney disease (DKD) and the optimal management of cardio-renal risk. DKD develops in approximately 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mainstay of therapy is to reduce the progression of DKD by optimising hyperglycaemia, blood pressure, lipids and lifestyle. Evidence supports the role for renin-angiotensin system blockade in limiting the progression of DKD. Recent data from diabetes related cardiovascular outcome trials and renal specific trials have provided a novel insight on the additional benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in reducing the progression of DKD as well as cardiovascular risk. Lessons have been learnt from CREDENCE and there are expectations that DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY will further support the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in relation to DKD. As a consequence, international guidelines have been updated to reflect the positive benefits. In addition, novel steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists offer a potential role in future years. The review examines the current evidence and future approach to optimising outcomes for renal protection in patients with diabetes.

Results

Baseline characteristics

A detailed participant flow-chart and the overall baseline characteristics of the EMBLEM trial have been reported elsewhere. Briefly, of the 117 patients randomized, 105 patients (64.8 ± 10.4 years old; women 33 [31.4%]; HbA1c 7.2 ± 0.8%; diabetes duration 13.3 ± 11.1 years) were included in the full analysis set (empagliflozin group n = 52, placebo group n = 53). Overall, 69 (65.7%), 18 (17.1%), and 79 (75.2%) patients were taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme or angiotensin receptor blocker, diuretic, and statin therapy, respectively. The majority of patients (69.5%) were taking a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. Twenty-four patients (22.9%) were taking one type of glucose-lowering medication, while 67 patients (63.8%) were taking ≥ 2 types of these medications.

At baseline, a total of 53 (50.5%) patients were receiving metformin therapy, with 25 (48.1%) in the empagliflozin group and 28 (52.8%) in the placebo group. As shown in Table 1, the baseline characteristics were almost similar between the randomization groups, irrespective of the use of metformin at baseline.

### Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes mellitus: cardiovascular and kidney effects, potential mechanisms, and clinical applications [^6a59c1d9]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, are now widely approved antihyperglycemic therapies. Because of their unique glycosuric mechanism, SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce weight. Perhaps more important are the osmotic diuretic and natriuretic effects contributing to plasma volume contraction, and decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 4 to 6 and 1 to 2 mmHg, respectively, which may underlie cardiovascular and kidney benefits. SGLT2 inhibition also is associated with an acute, dose-dependent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate by ≈5 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2) and ≈30% to 40% reduction in albuminuria. These effects mirror preclinical observations suggesting that proximal tubular natriuresis activates renal tubuloglomerular feedback through increased macula densa sodium and chloride delivery, leading to afferent vasoconstriction. On the basis of reduced glomerular filtration, glycosuric and weight loss effects are attenuated in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2)). In contrast, blood pressure lowering, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuric effects are preserved, and perhaps exaggerated in chronic kidney disease. With regard to long-term clinical outcomes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease randomly assigned to empagliflozin versus placebo reported a 14% reduction in the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and > 30% reductions in cardiovascular mortality, overall mortality, and heart failure hospitalizations associated with empagliflozin, even though, by design, the hemoglobin A1c difference between the randomized groups was marginal. Aside from an increased risk of mycotic genital infections, empagliflozin-treated patients had fewer serious adverse events, including a lower risk of acute kidney injury. In light of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results, some diabetes clinical practice guidelines now recommend that SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit be prioritized in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not achieved glycemic targets and who have prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. With additional cardiorenal protection trials underway, sodium-related physiological effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical correlates of natriuresis, such as the impact on blood pressure, heart failure, kidney protection, and mortality, will be a major management focus.

Ongoing CV and Renal Studies in T2DM

DECLARE-TIMI 58

In line with the current focus on CV outcomes, the ongoing Dapagliflozin Effect on CardiovascuLAR Events (DECLARE-TIMI 58) trial has been designed to examine dapagliflozin treatment in a high-risk T2DM population. This multicentre RCT will examine treatment outcomes in 17,160 people with T2DM and CVD or multiple risk factors for CVD (e.g. dyslipidaemia, hypertension). Dapagliflozin (10 mg) treatment will be compared against placebo in participants receiving standard T2DM care.

The time to first event for the co-primary endpoint of 3P-MACE (CV death, nonfatal MI or nonfatal ischaemic stroke) and composite of time to CV death or HHF will be assessed.

Secondary composite outcomes will comprise time to first event of the renal endpoint: confirmed sustained ≥ 40% decrease in eGFR (to eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2) and/or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and/or renal or CV death. Time to all-cause mortality will also be assessed.

CREDENCE

Although EMPA-REG and the CANVAS Program have examined some exploratory renal endpoints, the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial is the first dedicated prospective renal RCT concerning SGLT2i treatment in T2DM. This study is important for the SGLT2i class of medicines, as people with T2DM and kidney disease are at increased risk of CV events.

CREDENCE is a multicentre RCT comparing canagliflozin (100 mg) with placebo in people with T2DM and diabetic nephropathy who are receiving standard care, including the maximum tolerated daily dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).

CREDENCE will assess the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in preventing clinically important kidney and CV outcomes. The primary composite endpoint is time to ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or CV death.

Secondary endpoints include a composite of CV death and congestive heart failure (CHF) hospitalisation; a renal composite endpoint of ESKD and a doubling of serum creatinine; CV death and all-cause mortality; a CV composite of 3P-MACE, CHF hospitalisation and unstable angina hospitalisation. The study is expected to enrol approximately 4400 people with T2DM.

### Benefits and harms of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-I) and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAAS-I) versus SGLT2-is alone in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^444846cb]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors play different roles at different sites in the kidney, and it has been suggested that their combination might exert synergistic effects on the kidney. The vasodilatation effect of RAAS‐Is and natriuretic effect of SGLT2‐Is can also complement each other to reduce systemic oxidative stress and inflammation, which can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. Several clinical studies have indicated that the combination of SGLT2‐Is with ACEIs/ARBs was associated with greater cardio‐ and reno‐protection and improvement in glycaemic measures, blood pressure and body weight and was well tolerated. It may appear that our findings are at odds with the existing evidence, but this is likely because our evaluation which was mainly based on study level subgroup analyses, precluded a head‐to‐head comparison between the combination therapy (SGLT2 plus RAAS inhibitors) and SGLT2‐I. Furthermore, our analysis was limited by the few studies available for pooling. Nevertheless, our findings do suggest that the combination of SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors may be similar in efficacy and safety if not superior to SGLT2‐Is alone.

### Comparison between the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy… [^3d09ffc5]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system has been identified as the cornerstone in the management of DKD for decades. Recently, more evidence supports the use of Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of DKD. They were associated with slower progression of renal disease and lower rates of clinically relevant kidney events. Those studies confirmed the SGLT2i efficacy in kidney protection and showed that their addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers will be more effective than using ACEi or ARBS alone. It is unclear whether SGLT2i is used as a first-line instead of ACEi or ARB, and to what extent it will be effective in managing DKD compared to the proven effect of ACEi/ARBs alone. This study provides a unique opportunity to address this gap in the literature.

The aim of this study is to compare, head to head, the renal performance of ACEi versus SGLT2 in diabetic patients who have evidence of deteriorating renal function evidenced by either the reduction of e GFR or increased UACR. Scientific hypotheses: Null hypothesis: after one year, the mean change of the e GFR in the enalapril group
- Mean change of the e GFR in the empagliflozin group ≥ 5 ml/min/1. 73m2. Results from this study will add to the current literature examining whether the use of SGLT2i, as a first-line or if ACEi is contraindicated or intolerable, is non-inferior to ACEi in preserving kidney function in DKD patients. Superiority could also be declared if present. Further studies with a longer period of time will be required for comparing the long-term effect of both medications on kidneys. The reasons beyond the choice of Empagliflozin in this trial were based on many factors.

the results of trial proved its efficacy in delaying the deterioration of kidney function and its availability in the local market. Moreover, it has a good safety profile in comparison to Canagliflozin. Drug: Empagliflozin 25 MG Drug: Enalapril Maleate 20 mg

### Benefits and harms of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-I) and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAAS-I) versus SGLT2-is alone in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^013926cf]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Sodium‐glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2‐Is) (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin and ertugliflozin) are the latest therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. They increase excretion of glucose in the urine by inhibiting glucose reabsorption. Their use is associated with reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, systolic blood pressure (SBP), albuminuria and weight loss. There is substantial evidence that SGLT2‐Is reduce the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in those at high risk, the need for heart failure hospitalization and the progression of kidney impairment.SGLT2‐Is alone do not cause hypoglycaemia and exert beneficial effects without having significant adverse effects. Their main common side effect is genital mycotic infections.SLGT2‐Is are less effective for glucose control in patients with moderate‐to‐severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate, GFR 30–60 ml/min/1.73 m 2)and are not recommended in many guidelines for glycaemic control in people with estimated GFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. For several decades, renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors (RAAS‐Is) (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE‐Is), angiotensin‐II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and more recently direct renin inhibitors (DRIs)) have been employed to reduce the rate of progression of diabetes nephropathy in people with type 2 diabetes. Substantial evidence also suggests that RAAS‐Is reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors each independently reduce the risk of cardiovascular and kidney complications associated with type 2 diabetes and they appear to have synergistic effects when used as combination therapy. Hence, it will be clinically relevant to know the effectiveness of combining SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors versus SGLT2‐Is alone. Though a number of landmark trials comparing SGLT2‐Is with placebo have reported outcomes among subgroups of patients with or without RAAS inhibition, no previous systematic review has synthesized the existing evidence. In this context, using a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we aimed to evaluate whether the combination of SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors has a superior efficacy and safety profile than SGLT2‐Is alone in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### How do SGLT2 inhibitors protect the kidney? A mediation analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^052068cf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated kidney benefits in clinical trials across a broad range of patients with cardio-renal-metabolic diseases.
In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin reduced the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy by 39%, and the risk of a composite kidney outcome by 46%, compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.
Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying the kidney benefits seen with SGLT2 inhibitors remain undetermined.

This study adds:

In this post hoc mediation analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, changes in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels were the strongest mediators of the empagliflozin treatment kidney benefit.

Potential impact:

These findings complement previous analyses on the reduction in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure seen with empagliflozin, showing that markers of plasma volume and/or red blood cell mass appear to mediate to a large degree the cardio-kidney organ protection in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.
The predominance of hematocrit and hemoglobin as mediators of empagliflozin's kidney benefits may suggest an erythropoietic mechanism of action, potentially linked to the alleviation of organ hypoxia.
Further studies are required to validate the underlying mechanisms suggested by the findings of this study.

### Real-time use of SGLT2i verified in pre-dialysis: the RSVP cross-sectional study [^855af72a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an irreversible health condition that affects approximately 1 in 10 Canadians. As the Canadian population continues to age, its prevalence is bound to increase along with its numerous comorbidities and health care burden. Until recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were the only pharmacological intervention recommended to slow the decline of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) independent of blood pressure control, albeit in patients with diabetes or those with proteinuria. Nonetheless, eGFR will continue to decline with pharmacotherapy, and not all patients are candidates for ACEi or ARBs.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have increasingly become standard of care to slow the progression of CKD. In 2019, the Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial demonstrated a reduction in composite outcome of kidney failure, doubling of serum creatinine, or kidney or cardiovascular (CV)-related death irrespective of HbA1c improvement in patients with diabetes with proteinuria. In 2020, the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in CKD (DAPA-CKD) trial would increase the eligibility to non-diabetic patients with CKD and proteinuria with an eGFR down to 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Finally in 2022, the Empagliflozin in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (EMPA-KIDNEY) trial proved that patients with an eGFR down to 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2, regardless of proteinuria, could also be prescribed an SGLT2i to lower the risk of progression of kidney disease and reduce CV-related death.

Baseline Disease Characteristics and Demographics

EMPA-KIDNEY included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 2,936) and patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 3,673). The mean age of the study population was 63 years (range: 18 to 94 years) and 67% were male. Approximately 58% of the study population were White, 36% Asian, and 4% Black or African American. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 37 mL/min/1.73 m2, 21% of patients had an eGFR equal to or above 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 44% had an eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. The median UACR was 329 mg/g, 20% of patients had a UACR < 30 mg/g, 28% had a UACR 30 to ≤ 300 mg/g, and 52% had a UACR > 300 mg/g. The most common etiologies of CKD were diabetic nephropathy/diabetic kidney disease (31%), glomerular disease (25%), hypertensive/renovascular disease (22%) and other/unknown (22%). At baseline, 85% of patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), 64% with statins, and 34% with antiplatelet agents.

### Empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^449e841f]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study EMPA-KIDNEY was published by EMPA-KIDNEY Collaborative Group and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the trial question was: what is the role of empagliflozin in patients with CKD? In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the population was: 6609 patients (2192 female, 4417 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with CKD with an eGFR ≥ 20 and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or ≥ 45 and < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200. The key exclusion criteria were polycystic kidney disease; receipt of kidney transplant. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the interventions were: n = 3304 empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg/day) n = 3305 placebo (matching placebo). In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes (13.1% vs. 16.9%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82). In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in hospitalization for HF or death from cardiovascular causes (4% vs. 4.6%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.07) Significant decrease in the incidence of hospitalization for any cause (24.8 events /100 py vs. 29.2 events /100 py; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95) No significant difference in death from any cause (4.5% vs. 5.1%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.08). In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the conclusion was: in patients with CKD with an eGFR ≥ 20 and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or ≥ 45 and < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200, empagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

SGLT‐2i have been hypothesized to result in RAS modulation by affecting the tubuloglomerular feedbackand it has been suggested that the renoprotective mechanism(s) of SGLT‐2i may be driven by altered intrarenal haemodynamics similar to those of ACEi. We have previously shown that addition of an ACEi to the SGLT‐2 blockade results in a distinct increase of Ang‐(1‐7) in an experimental setting. We thus hypothesized that the selective inhibition of SGLT‐2 in addition to existing RAS blockade might exert similar synergistic effects in humans by modulating the RAS metabolism towards upregulation of the alternative RAS axis and its main effector, Ang‐(1‐7). Therefore, we studied the influence of empagliflozin on top of standard ACEi treatment on the molecular dynamics of the RAS at the systemic level in patients with albuminuric kidney disease, with and without diabetes.

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CKD

Approximately 850 million patients in the world have chronic kidney disease (CKD), with ∼4 million receiving kidney replacement therapy. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the foremost cause of CKD globally. In 2015, there were ∼415 million people living with diabetes mellitus with the prevalence predicted to rise to 642 million by 2040, largely driven by an ageing population and lifestyle factors. DKD develops in ∼40% of patients with diabetes mellitus and the incidence is increasing with the growing prevalence of diabetes. Until recently the mainstay of renal protection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and proteinuric CKD has been the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) based on the Reduction of Endpoints with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) and the Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) with both studies published > 20 years ago. Similarly, RASi was the mainstay of treatment for hypertensive kidney disease, the second most common cause of CKD, based mainly of the results of the African American Study on Kidney Disease. However, the residual renal risk remained very high. Furthermore, in all outcome trials in DKD, the use of RASi was not associated with reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality.

Cardiovascular events and mortality increase exponentially with decreasing glomerular filtration rate or increasing albuminuria independent of age, sex, and other risk factors. Furthermore, as kidney function decreases, there is a shift from predominantly atherosclerotic/thrombo-embolic/vasculo-occlusive cardiovascular diseases to a proportionally increasing incidence of heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death. In a large United States study (1998–2006) of 15762 patients aged > 20 years, the 10-year cumulative cardiovascular mortality for patients without neither diabetes or CKD, with diabetes and no CKD, and with CKD and no diabetes was 3.4%, 6.7%, and 9.9% respectively. However, for patients with both diabetes and CKD the 10-year cumulative mortality was a staggering 19.6%. Until 2015, although several novel agents had emerged for managing hyperglycaemia in T2DM, limited progress had been made in reducing the incidence of kidney failure due to diabetes. The emergence of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) as a beneficial evidence-based therapy for improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes potentially revolutionizes therapy in this group of patients. This position paper integrates the current evidence base for therapy with SGLT2i with professional societies guidelines for their use.

### Combination therapy with kidney protective therapies: optimizing the benefits? [^7e5bb670]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent advances in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have led to the development of several new agents that are kidney protective, particularly in people with diabetes. These agents include sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2 inhibitors), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). This review summarizes the available data regarding the effects of using these therapies in combination.

Recent Findings

There is convincing evidence that SGLT-2 inhibitors and MRAs individually improve kidney function and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in people with CKD, especially diabetic CKD. There is some evidence that GLP-1RAs may be beneficial, but further studies are needed. The available data support an additive kidney and cardiovascular benefit using combination therapy with SGLT-2 inhibitors and MRAs, and possibly with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs, but more long-term data are needed. The currently available data suggest that combining these agents would likely be beneficial and may be an appropriate long-term strategy.

Summary

Several new agents are useful in slowing the progress of CKD. Further research to identify which combinations of agents work best together and which combinations are most effective for people with different characteristics, in order to personalize treatment and improve outcomes for people with CKD, should be a priority.

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: a consensus statement [^78fc3514]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs in approximately 20–40% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with DKD have a higher risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and antihyperglycemic drugs form the mainstay of DKD management and aim to restrict progression to more severe stages of DKD. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) control hyperglycemia by blocking renal glucose reabsorption in addition to preventing inflammation, thereby improving endothelial function and reducing oxidative stress; consequently, this class of prescription medicines is emerging as an important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME, DECLARE TIMI 58, and CANVAS trials demonstrated the renoprotective effects of SGLT2i, such as restricting decline in glomerular filtration rate, in the progression of albuminuria, and in death due to renal causes. The renoprotection provided by SGLT2i was further confirmed in the CREDENCE study, which showed a 30% reduction in progression of chronic kidney disease, and in the DELIGHT study, which demonstrated a reduction in albuminuria with dapagliflozin compared with placebo (-21.0%, confidence interval [CI]-34.1 to-5.2, p = 0.011). Furthermore, a meta-analysis demonstrated a reduced risk of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease (relative risk 0.67; 95% CI 0.52–0.86; p = 0.0019) and a 45% risk reduction in worsening of renal function, end-stage renal disease, or renal death (hazard ratio 0.55, CI 0.48–0.64, p < 0.0001) with SGLT2i, irrespective of baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate. Thus, there is emerging evidence that SGLT2i may be used to curb the mortality and improve the quality of life in patients with DKD. However, clinicians need to effectively select candidates for SGLT2i therapy. In this consensus statement, we have qualitatively synthesized evidence demonstrating the renal effects of SGLT2i and proposed recommendations for optimal use of SGLT2i to effectively manage and delay progression of DKD.

### The role of dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors in management of cardiovascular disease in diabetes; focus on linagliptin [^95eac414]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Linagliptin combination with an SGLT2 inhibitor

The first line therapy for management of glycemia for T2DM throughout the world is metformin; however, over time, the effectiveness of metformin monotherapy in achieving target HbA1c diminishes in a majority of patients. This lack of adequate glycemic control necessitates the use of combinations of one or more additional anti-hyperglycemia agents to achieve target HbA1c. However, interest in the need for combination therapy as an initial treatment strategy is also increasing. Recent studies indicate that DPP-4 inhibitors, including linagliptin, could potentially complement the effects of other CV protective agents such as metformin, angiotensin type 2 receptor blockers (ARB), statins, and SGLT2 inhibitors. Importantly, there is little evidence of undesirable drug interactions between linagliptin and metformin, ARBs, statins and SGLT2 inhibitors. The increased risk of angioedema with combination DPP-4 and ACE inhibitor therapy is one potential limitation, however, this issue may be managed by consideration of replacing an ACE inhibitor with an ARB.

Recent studies have shown that combination therapy of DPP-4 and SGLT2 inhibitors, either as an initial combination or stepwise addition, results in improvement in glycemic control. In contrast to other DPP-4 inhibitors, linagliptin does not require dose adjustment in patients with renal insufficiency given that it is not excreted by the kidneys. Indeed, the evidence so far indicates that once daily single pill combination of linagliptin and the SGLT-2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, results in clinically meaningful and sustained reductions in HbA1c, fasting glucose, body weight and blood pressure. Other combinations of SGLT2 and DPP-4 inhibitors seem similarly promising. The underlying mechanisms for these beneficial effects appears to be the convergence of complementary signaling pathways and physiological effects (e.g. reduced glucotoxicity, weight loss and BP reduction for SGLT2 inhibitor and reduced glucose-dependent glucagon secretion and anti-inflammatory effects for DPP-4 inhibitor) for beneficial effects on CV health or suppression of microvascular complications.

### ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy can prevent diabetic kidney disease… [^de04399a]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL QUESTION Do angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers reduce progression to end-stage kidney disease in patients with diabetic kidney disease. EVIDENCE-BASED ANSWER Use of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy reduces progression to end-stage kidney disease in patients with diabetic kidney disease. 1 Neither ACE inhibitor nor ARB therapy has been associated with reduced all-cause or cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo in patients with diabetic nephropathy. PRACTICE POINTERS Family physicians routinely treat patients with diabetes and kidney disease.

Diabetic kidney disease, or diabetic nephropathy, is defined by the presence of persistent albuminuria on two separate occasions at least 3 months apart in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes, with or without a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate. 1, 2 Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease globally and is highly associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes. 2 End-stage kidney disease is defined as requiring kidney replacement therapy or kidney transplantation. 3 As a precursor to overt diabetic nephropathy, microalbuminuria is presented in this review as an important early indicator and clinical outcome pertinent to diabetic kidney disease.

Type 2 diabetes — Table 5 opportunities to initiate SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated cardiovascular or renal benefit: Suggested initiation scenarios include in a patient with T2D and ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA); at the time of diagnosis of clinical ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA), DKD, and/or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor) in a patient with T2D on a regimen without these agents; at the time of diagnosis of T2D in a patient with clinical ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA), DKD, and/or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor); at hospital discharge with close outpatient follow-up after admission for ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA) or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor) events; in a patient with T2D and diabetic kidney disease (SGLT2 inhibitor, alternatively GLP-1RA for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2); and in patients determined to be at high risk of ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA) or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor). At the time of hospital discharge or in the outpatient setting, increased vigilance regarding hypoglycemia surveillance is warranted, especially in background insulin, sulfonylurea, or glinide therapy, and clinicians should use judgment when initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor if renal function is impaired or an ACE inhibitor/ARB will be started or up-titrated.

### Design and baseline characteristics of the finerenone, in addition to standard of care, on the progression of kidney disease in patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease (FIND-CKD) randomized trial [^50c49c5b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Nearly all participants were using an ACEI or ARB, reflecting the high quality of care of our population. SGLT2 inhibitors are a drug class of particular interest because of their benefits in kidney outcomes. During the recruitment period of our trial, clinical practice guidelines were updated and now recommend SGLT2 inhibitors in addition to an ACEI or ARB to slow CKD progression. In total, 17% of the cohort was using an SGLT2 inhibitor for > 4 weeks prior to enrolment in our trial. This number reflects the current ongoing approval and reimbursement process across different regions and dapagliflozin being the only SGLT2 inhibitor with proven kidney benefits in patients with CKD during recruitment. Patients using SGLT2 inhibitors had similar eGFR and UACR levels compared with those not using SGLT2 inhibitors, indicating that they remain at a high risk of progressive kidney function loss and need additional therapies. Previous post hoc analyses from the finerenone phase 3 programme have suggested that finerenone is similarly effective in patients using and not using SGLT2 inhibitors. The FIND-CKD trial will extend these findings to patients without diabetes and CKD. Although these analyses are of interest, they do not answer the question if combined initiation of these two therapies will reduce albuminuria or eGFR decline to a greater extent than monotherapy. The ongoing CONFIDENCE trial (NCT05254002) is designed to prospectively assess the albuminuria-lowering effects of monotherapy with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, finerenone and their combination in 807 adults with T2D and CKD. Diuretics were also used in 18% of patients, a percentage that is much lower compared with other recent CKD progression clinical trials. This may also reflect the high proportion of Asian patients where diuretics are less frequently used compared with other regions. In addition, the exclusion of patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with a class 1A indication for steroidal MRAs and differences in mean eGFR may both account for the lower use of diuretics in FIND-CKD compared with DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY.

### Cardiovascular protection with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in chronic kidney disease: a milestone achieved [^b71627bd]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease are intimately linked. They share major risk factors, including age, hypertension, and diabetes, and common pathogenetic mechanisms. Furthermore, reduced renal function and kidney injury documented with albuminuria are independent risk factors for cardiovascular events and mortality. In major renal outcome trials and subsequent meta-analyses in patients with CKD, ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and ARBs (angiotensin II receptor blockers) were shown to effectively retard CKD progression but not to significantly reduce cardiovascular events or mortality. Thus, a high residual risk for cardiovascular disease progression under standard-of-care treatment is still present for patients with CKD. In contrast to the above, several outcome trials with SGLT-2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2) inhibitors and MRAs (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) clearly suggest that these agents, apart from nephroprotection, offer important cardioprotection in this population. This article discusses existing evidence on the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors and MRAs on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD that open new roads in cardiovascular protection of this heavily burdened population.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in diabetes — advise persons with CKD in DM about optimal glycemic control, BP control, lipid control, and smoking cessation to reduce risks of development and progression of CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade with an ARB or an ACE inhibitor is recommended for persons with albuminuria (T1D or T2D) to reduce risk of DKD or CKD in DM progression. A sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) with proven benefit is recommended as foundational therapy for persons with T2D and CKD with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 to reduce progression of CKD and risk of CVD. A glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) with proven benefit is recommended for persons with T2D and DKD or CKD in DM with eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, for glycemic control and to reduce risk of ASCVD and progression of albuminuria. A non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (finerenone) with proven kidney and CVD benefit is recommended for persons with T2D, an eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2, normal serum potassium concentration, and albuminuria (albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR] ≥ 30 mg/g) despite a maximally tolerated dose of a renin–angiotensin–system inhibitor.

Guideline recommendations

A joint group of ADA and KDIGO representatives developed a series of consensus statements to identify and highlight shared recommendations from the ADA 2022 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in CKD. The consensus report found that the published guidelines are aligned in the areas of CKD screening and diagnosis, glycemia monitoring, lifestyle therapies, treatment goals, and pharmacologic management. Both the KDIGO and ADA recommend the use of ACEis and ARBs at the maximum‐tolerated dose in persons with diabetes who have hypertension and albuminuria. The recommendation is based on the results from randomized controlled trials that have demonstrated a decreased risk of CKD progression in persons treated with RAS inhibitors compared with a placebo or an active antihypertensive drug comparator. The consensus guidelines also recommend the use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven kidney or CV benefit for persons with T2D, CKD, and eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Use of an SGLT2 inhibitor can be continued at lower levels of eGFR per the treatment guidelines. The use of a GLP‐1 RA with proven CV benefit is recommended for persons with T2D and CKD who do not meet their individualized glycemic target with metformin alone, in combination with an SGLT2 inhibitor or an SGLT2 inhibitor alone. GLP‐1 RAs are also recommended for persons who are unable to use these drugs. The aims of GLP‐1 RA prescription are likely to be updated based on the results of the FLOW study. A nonsteroidal MRA with proven kidney and CV benefit is recommended for persons with T2D, eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2, normal serum potassium concentration, and albuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g) regardless of whether or not the individual is at the maximum tolerated dose of RAS inhibitor.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: a novel choice for the combination therapy in diabetic kidney disease [^e0fe84ed]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There are more than 350 million people suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worldwide, and its prevalence is increasing. One of the most common complications in T2DM is diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is characterized by prior diabetes mellitus, kidney damage, decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and persistent albuminuria. Etiologies of DKD include environmental insults, genetic susceptibility, primarily metabolic and hemodynamic factors, etc. Thus the treatment for DKD is mainly aimed at controlling metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities. The agents for treatment including the use of traditional anti-hyperglycemic agents (AHAs) such as metformin, insulin or pioglitazone, and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RRAS) inhibitors like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).

Despite a large armamentarium already being available for the management of hyperglycemia in T2DM, current oral AHAs often do not provide adequately effective or continuing glycemic control with improved β-cell function. Although metformin provides modest weight loss, most AHAs may result in weight gain or may not substantively decrease body weight. And renal insufficiency is definitely correlated with body fat in patients with coronary artery disease. Therefore, it is necessary to call for newer AHAs that can provide long-term glycemic control and additional benefits like weight loss and the renoprotection, etc.

Sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are new AHAs with an original insulin-independent mode of action and well tolerance, as well as favorable safety profile in patients with DKD. The present review provided an overview of studies with SGLT2 inhibitors, and discussed the synergistic mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors combined with ACEI/ARBs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in the treatment for DKD.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease — blood pressure (BP) targets and antihypertensive selection: In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and elevated systolic BP (SBP), improved cardiovascular outcomes were seen when assigned to an intensive SBP target < 120 mm Hg versus a standard strategy to lower SBP < 140 mm Hg in those ≥ 50 years. In T2D, diastolic BP (DBP) reductions in the HOT trial occurred across all target groups (target DBP ≤ 90 mm Hg: — 20.3 mm Hg; ≤ 85 mm Hg: — 22.3 mm Hg; ≤ 80 mm Hg: — 24.3 mm Hg). Any of the recommended antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi], angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB], calcium channel blocker [CCB], and diuretics) are useful in diabetes, and an ACEi or ARB is recommended as part of treatment in patients with diabetes and CKD. For CKD, including those with albuminuria defined as ACR ≥ 30 mg/g or 24-hour urine albumin ≥ 30 mg, evidence supporting ACEi or ARB benefits is strongest for moderate to severe albuminuria; in CKD without albuminuria, ACEi or ARB may be considered for cardiovascular disease event reduction, with little evidence for kidney protection. No hypoglycemic agents are specifically indicated for BP lowering, although sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) and GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to slow decline in kidney function whether or not diabetes is present and may have some beneficial BP effects.

### Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin added to existing antidiabetes treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^b7146ac6]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Optimum glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is important to minimise the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and to slow the progression of CKD. We assessed the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as an add-on treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

Methods

We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial at 127 centres in 15 countries. Patients with HbA1c of 7% or greater to 10% or less were eligible for inclusion. Patients with stage 2 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min per 1.73 m(2); n = 290) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg or placebo once daily for 52 weeks. Patients with stage 3 CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2); n = 374) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo for 52 weeks. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated random sequence and stratified by renal impairment, HbA1c, and background antidiabetes medication. Treatment assignment was masked from patients and investigators. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 by ANCOVA in the full analysis set. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164501.

Findings

In patients with stage 2 CKD, adjusted mean treatment differences versus placebo in changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 were -0.52% (95% CI -0.72 to -0.32) for empagliflozin 10 mg and -0.68% (-0.88 to -0.49) for empagliflozin 25 mg (both p < 0.0001). In patients with stage 3 CKD, adjusted mean treatment difference versus placebo in change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 was -0.42% (-0.56 to -0.28) for empagliflozin 25 mg (p < 0.0001). In patients with stage 2 CKD, adverse events were reported over 52 weeks by 83 patients (87%) on placebo (15 severe [16%] and 11 serious [12%]), 86 (88%) on empagliflozin 10 mg (six severe [6%] and six serious [6%]) and 78 (80%) on empagliflozin 25 mg (eight severe [8%] and seven serious [7%]). In patients with stage 3 CKD, adverse events were reported over 52 weeks by 156 patients (83%) on placebo (15 severe [8%] and 23 serious [12%]) and 156 (83%) on empagliflozin 25 mg (18 severe [10%] and 22 serious [12%]).

Interpretation

In patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 2 or 3 CKD, empagliflozin reduced HbA1c and was well tolerated. However, our findings might not be applicable to the general population of patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment.

### Report from the CVOT summit 2021: new cardiovascular, renal, and glycemic outcomes [^be32e2d2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Key topics discussed during the 7th CVOT Summit

Key aspects of the ESC heart failure guidelines 2021

In the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure, the definition of HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) was slightly modified. A mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) is defined as a range of 41–49%. Elevated natriuretic peptides, structural heart disease, or diastolic dysfunction are no longer required criteria. Regarding recommendations for pharmacological treatments of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; LVEF ≤ 40%), the guidelines issued a class I; level A (IA) recommendation for angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), beta-blockers, MRAs, and the SGLT2is dapagliflozin and empagliflozin to reduce the risk of HHF and death. Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) are recommended (class I, level B) to reduce the risk of HHF and CV death in symptomatic patients unable to tolerate ACEis or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs). Loop diuretics are still recommended for patients with congestion symptoms (class I, level C). The therapeutic algorithm for the management of patients with HFrEF has been updated accordingly. It is now recommended to initiate therapy with ACEis/ARBs, Beta-blockers, MRAs, and dapagliflozin/empagliflozin simultaneously; loop diuretics are prescribed for fluid retention. The SGLT2is canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin and sotagliflozin received the recommendation class I for persons with T2D at risk for CV events. For persons with T2D and HFrEF, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin were recommended (class I). The guidelines emphasize patient profiling and phenotyping to personalize medication use and achieve the best possible therapeutic effect.

### Use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and multiple cardiovascular risk factors: an Asian perspective and expert recommendations [^69298923]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

5.1 Current guidelines for the use of SGLT‐2 inhibitors

The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Diabetes Canada guidelines recommend SGLT‐2 inhibitors at any stage of T2DM as a combination therapy with other glucose‐lowering therapies. 59, 60, 61, 62 The guidelines also recommend SGLT‐2 inhibitors as an acceptable alternative to metformin as initial therapy when metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. Similar recommendations have been made in clinical practice guidelines for T2DM in Asian countries. 63, 64, 65 In 2019, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standard of Care provided a treatment algorithm based on the presence of established CVD or chronic kidney disease (CKD). 66 In patients with predominant atherosclerotic CVD, GLP‐1 analogues or SGLT‐2 inhibitors are recommended as add‐on therapy to metformin. In patients with predominant HF or CKD, an SGLT‐2 inhibitor is the recommended therapy after metformin. 66

The 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for CVD prevention recommend that SGLT‐2 inhibitors should be considered early on in the clinical course to reduce all‐cause and CV death in patients with T2DM and CVD (Class IIa recommendation). 67 The 2016 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic HF recommend that empagliflozin should be considered in patients with T2DM to prevent or delay the onset of HF and to prolong survival (Class IIa recommendation). 68 It should be noted that these guidelines require an update following the availability of evidence from the CANVAS and DECLARE‐TIMI 58 trials. The more recent Canadian practice guidelines recommend the addition of SGLT‐2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of major CV events, HF hospitalization, and progression of nephropathy in patients with T2DM. 69, 70, 71

### Beat it early: putative renoprotective haemodynamic effects of oral hypoglycaemic agents [^4557c02e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

PREVENTION OF CKD

Given the considerable burden of DN, in terms of morbidity (CVD and renal failure) and mortality, early intervention to slow the development of DN is good clinical practice.

Control of glycaemia and blood pressure

Control of glycaemia and blood pressure are the mainstays to prevent kidney damage and slow its progression. It has been definitively demonstrated that tight control of glycaemia significantly reduces the risk of microalbuminuria and kidney damage in patients with diabetes. In terms of blood pressure control, the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers is recommended, due to their effect on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) (Figure 4 B). Large clinical studies, such as Microvascular Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (Micro-HOPE), Reduction in ENdpoints with the Angiotensin Antagonist Losartan, Irbesartan in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Microalbuminuria, Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial and BENEDICT have demonstrated that RAAS blockade is renoprotective.

Potential renoprotective properties of hypoglycaemic agents; an ongoing question

There is emerging evidence and discussion around the potential for some hypoglycaemic agents to have renoprotective effects, independent of their glucose lowering effects (Figure 4 A).

SGLT-2 inhibitors

SGLT-2 inhibitors are novel hypoglycaemic agents, which reduce glycaemia using an insulin-independent mechanism. In vitro work in human proximal tubular cells suggests that the SGLT-2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, reduces inflammatory and fibrotic markers induced by hyperglycaemia and may limit glucose-induced damage of the proximal tubule. The specific mode of action is thought to be blockage of glucose entry into the cell. SGLT-2 inhibitors block the reabsorption of glucose and sodium via the SLGT-2 transporter in the proximal tubule, which decreases the capacity for renal glucose reabsorption and reduces the renal threshold at which glucose is excreted resulting in net loss of excess glucose in the urine. In addition to their action in reducing glycaemia, the SGLT-2 inhibitors also result in a modest reduction in blood pressure and body weight. Given their mode of action, the SGLT-2 inhibitors are only effective in patients with effective renal function.

### EMPA-REG OUTCOME: the nephrologist's point of view [^8e67385f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have renoprotective effects, as demonstrated by the renal analyses from clinical trials including Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), CANagliflozin Treatment And Trial Analysis versus SUlphonylurea (CANTATA-SU), and the dapagliflozin renal study. The potential mechanisms responsible are likely multifactorial, and direct renovascular and hemodynamic effects are postulated to play a central role. This report reviews the renal outcomes data from key SGLT2 inhibitor clinical trials, discusses the hypotheses for SGLT2 inhibitor-associated renoprotection, and considers the main renal safety issues associated with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment.

### ACE inhibitors vs. ARBs for patients with diabetic kidney… [^e0e1ca0f]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Studies comparing ACE inhibitors or ARBs with placebo found no mortality benefit in patients with diabetic kidney disease. A subgroup analysis of five studies found that, when given at full or maximally tolerated doses, ACE inhibitors reduce all-cause mortality. Both classes of drugs are similarly effective at preventing the progression of diabetic kidney disease. However, there were too few trials comparing ACE inhibitors with ARBs to draw clear conclusions.

1. Practice Pointers Within two to three decades of diagnosis, roughly one third of patients with diabetes will have some degree of diabetic kidney disease. 2 Patients with diabetic nephropathy are at a higher risk of mortality, mostly from cardiovascular complications, than other patients with diabetes.

3 Drugs used to delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease include beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs. Studies have shown that after a patient develops diabetic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors and ARBs are superior to the other drugs in reducing disease progression, making them the drugs of choice. Progression to end-stage kidney disease is also an important clinical outcome for patients with diabetic kidney disease. ACE inhibitors reduced the incidence of end-stage renal disease by 40 percent, and ARBs reduced this progression by 22 percent. However, the absolute benefit was small. Both drug classes reduced the risk of disease-oriented renal outcomes such as doubling of creatinine concentration and progression of micro- to macroalbuminuria.

Both classes also increased rates of regression from micro- to normoalbuminuria, with ACE inhibitors somewhat more effective than ARBs in placebo-controlled trials. Although these results suggest that ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs at reducing the progression of diabetic kidney disease, there are insufficient data directly comparing ACE inhibitors with ARBs. Authors' Conclusions: Although the survival benefits of ACE inhibitors are known for patients with diabetic kidney disease, the relative effects on survival of ACE inhibitors with ARBs are unknown because of the lack of adequate direct comparison studies. In placebo-controlled studies, only ACE inhibitors were found to significantly reduce the risk of all-cause mortality. Renal and toxicity profiles of these two classes of agents were not significantly different.

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: do the latest trials challenge existing evidence? [^e2477d00]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

High-risk patients with diabetes

Diabetes mellitus is considered as a major risk factor for CVD, and CVD is the leading cause of death in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Guidelines recommend RAS inhibitors as the first monotherapy for diabetes patients with hypertension. Landmark trials such as Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE), Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes study, ONTARGET ® and TRANSCEND ® have shown CV and renal benefits with ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with T2DM.

In ONTARGET ®, dual RAS inhibition was not found to be beneficial and was associated with increased harm. The ALiskiren Trial in Type 2 diabetes Using carDio-renal Endpoints (ALTITUDE) study evaluated the addition of aliskiren to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB in T2DM patients with CKD, CVD or both, but was stopped early due to safety concerns. The study randomized 8,506 patients to aliskiren or placebo added to standard cardiorenal-protective treatment (an ACE inhibitor or an ARB). The trial was stopped early because, after the seventh interim review of data, the Data Monitoring Committee identified increased incidence of AEs (renal dysfunction, hyperkalaemia, hypotension and an excess of strokes) in patients in the aliskiren arm and concluded that patients were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren treatment added on top of standard antihypertensives. The Combination Angiotensin Receptor Blocker and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor for Treatment of Diabetic Nephropathy (VA NEPHRON-D) multicentre trial to assess the effect of the combination of losartan and lisinopril compared with losartan alone, on the progression of kidney disease in 1,850 patients with diabetes and overt proteinuria, was terminated recently for similar reasons to those of the ALTITUDE study.

### Mind the gap in kidney care: translating what we know into what we Do [^e842953c]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Regardless of the cause, control of major risk factors, particularly diabetes and hypertension, forms the foundation of optimal care for CKD. Beyond lifestyle changes and risk factor control, the initial pharmacologic classes of agents proven to provide kidney protection were the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors in the form of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and the angiotensin receptor blockers. However, despite decades of knowledge that these medications have important protective effects on kidney and heart function in people with CKD, their use has remained low based on real-world data from electronic health records (Figure 2). For example, in the United States, ACEI or angiotensin receptor blocker use was reported in the range of 20%–40% at ≥ 15 years after the last approvals of these agents for patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes. Although more recent data show improvement in prescribing rates to 70% in this population, just 40% persist on an ACEI or angiotensin receptor blocker for at least 90 days. These data illustrate gaps in both prescribing kidney protective medication and continuity of care over time, potentially related to cost, lack of patient education, polypharmacy, and adverse effects.

Although initial enthusiasm for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors focused on their benefits for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, unprecedented therapeutic benefits have clearly been observed for CKD as well. The relative risk reductions with SGLT2 inhibitors approach 40% for a substantial decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, KF, and death in populations with CKD of several causes, heart failure, or high cardiovascular disease risk. These benefits accrued on top of standard-of-care risk factor management and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitor. Risks of heart failure, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality were also reduced in patients with CKD. Addition of SGLT2 inhibitor to renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors could delay the need for kidney replacement therapy by several years, depending on when they are started. Moreover, for every 1,000 patients with CKD treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor on top of standard therapy, 83 deaths, 19 heart failure hospitalizations, 51 dialysis initiations, and 39 episodes of acute kidney function worsening can be prevented.

### Combined sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition upregulates the renin-angiotensin system in chronic kidney disease with type 2 diabetes: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled exploratory trial [^7c58efbe]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) improve cardiorenal outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with and without type 2 diabetes. The molecular mechanisms underlying these pleiotropic effects remain unclear, yet it is speculated that SGLT-2i elicit a neurohormonal modulation resulting in renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation. We hypothesized that combined SGLT-2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) favours RAS regulation towards the beneficial angiotensin-(1–7)-driven axis.

Materials and Methods

This randomized controlled prospective study investigated the effect of 12weeks treatment with the SGLT-2i empagliflozin on top of ACEi on the molecular RAS dynamics in 24 diabetic and 24 non-diabetic patients with CKD. Systemic RAS peptides were quantified by mass spectrometry.

Results

In patients with type 2 diabetes, combined SGLT-2i and ACEi significantly upregulated plasma renin activity [pre-treatment median and interquartile range 298.0 (43.0–672.0) pmol/L versus post-treatment 577.0 (95.0–1543.0) pmol/L; p = .037] and angiotensin I levels [pre-treatment 289.0 (42.0–668.0) pmol/L versus post-treatment 573.0 (93.0–1522.0) pmol/L; p = .037], together with a significant increase of angiotensin-(1–7) levels [pre-treatment 14.0 (2.1–19.0) pmol/L versus post-treatment 32.0 (5.7–99.0) pmol/L; p = .012]. Empagliflozin treatment resulted in a 1.5 to 2-fold increase in main RAS peptides in patients with diabetes compared with placebo. No significant effect of empagliflozin on top of ACEi on RAS peptides was found in patients with CKD without diabetes.

Conclusion

A distinct RAS modulation by SGLT-2i occurs in diabetic kidney disease reflected by enhancement of the beneficial angiotensin-(1–7) providing a molecular background for this renoprotective therapeutic approach.

### Design considerations for future renoprotection trials in the era of multiple therapies for chronic kidney disease [^30e34451]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

In the last 5–10 years, several large high-quality research trials testing new treatments versus a dummy treatment in patients with kidney disease have provided new discoveries, particularly among people with diabetes. Some of these trials included patients with a wide variety of kidney diseases and therefore provided important information on how effective the treatment is, and whether it is safe to use for many people (and not just those with a specific type of kidney disease). The findings are particularly important as they suggest that, once established, kidney disease progresses in similar ways regardless of the initiating cause. These new treatments importantly slow kidney disease progression but, even when used together, do not arrest the loss of kidney function. New research is still needed to test new potential treatments. Now that we have several drugs that can be used to treat kidney disease, there are new challenges when designing and conducting new trials. These include the reduced risk of kidney disease progression and heart disease (because of the new treatments available). Future research trials need to include a sufficiently large number of patients to be able to answer research questions reliably. In addition, different types of people and diseases should be included. In an age of increasing regulation and bureaucracy, conducting such trials is challenging. Simplifying the design and conduct of future trials by focusing only on the necessary components needed to answer the research key question(s) is important. Such trials reduce the burden of participation for patients and busy clinical staff, whilst still ensuring careful focus on patient safety and data quality. We hope more high-quality trials that are sufficiently large, inclusive and simple will be conducted in the future, so that kidney teams can offer better care to their patients.

Abstract

Nephrology has benefited from conducting increasingly large high-quality trials in the last 5–10 years. In addition to the long-standing known benefits of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, we now have multiple pharmacotherapies that provide kidney and/or cardiovascular protection for certain types of patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD). These include sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. Trials of SGLT2i have had particularly important impact, as wide eligibility criteria in pivotal trials have enabled safety and efficacy across a wide range of causes of CKD to be demonstrated. These findings support the concept of final common pathways of CKD progression and should encourage similar trial designs recruiting broad ranges of patients at risk of CKD progression. This is important as these new drugs do not completely arrest CKD progression nor do they mitigate the full excess of cardiovascular disease. In the current era of multiple therapies to manage risk of CKD progression, trial design and conduct also need to consider new challenges. These include falling event rates, establishing standard of care for participants pre-randomization and improving the inclusion of trial participants understudied in previous trials. Streamlining trial design and conduct and reducing participation burden for patients and clinicians is increasingly important to facilitate larger sample sizes and to optimize adherence to study interventions and follow-up. Potential other solutions include maintaining a focus on wide generalizability (to include understudied patient groups) and empowering patients to volunteer for trials (through public and patient involvement and large-scale invitation methods), as well as innovations in trial design (including use of pre-randomization run-in periods to implement standard of care and factorial or platform trials to assess multiple treatments simultaneously).

### Renal and vascular effects of combined SGLT2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition [^bb3d6dde]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Our aim was to investigate the additive cardiorenal hemodynamic effects of combined treatment with both agents, specifically neurohormonal suppression (with an ACEi) and activation of tubular (SGLT2i) factors, in patients with uncomplicated T1D, T2D, or obesity as mechanistic models of early cardiorenal physiologic changes before the development of clinical kidney or cardiovascular complications. The primary objective of this clinical trial (BETWEEN Study [Empagliflozin and ACEi- Effects on Hyperfiltration]; URL:; Unique identifier: NCT02632747) was to determine the effect of a 4-week treatment with an SGLT2i, empagliflozin 25 mg QD, versus placebo, in addition to an ACEi, ramipril 10 mg QD or maximally tolerated dose, on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Our secondary objectives were to study the effect of the addition of empagliflozin to ramipril treatment on distal sodium delivery and systemic hemodynamics. We hypothesized that adding empagliflozin treatment to a background of ramipril would decrease GFR and reduce cardiac output and arterial stiffness, leading to declines in SBP.

Baseline Disease Characteristics and Demographics

EMPEROR-Reduced included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 1,856) and patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 1,874). The mean age of the trial population was 67 years (range: 25 to 94 years) and 76% were males, 24% were women, and 27% were 75 years of age or older. Approximately 71% of the trial population were White, 18% Asian and 7% Black or African American. At randomization, 75% of patients were NYHA class II, 24% were class III and 0.5% were class IV. The mean LVEF was 28%. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 62 mL/min/1.73 m2and the median urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) was 22 mg/g. Approximately half of the patients (52%) had eGFR equal to or above 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 24% had eGFR 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 19% had eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. At baseline, 88% of patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), 95% with beta-blockers, 71% with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and 95% with diuretics.

In EMPEROR-Reduced, history of type 2 diabetes mellitus was present in 50% of the patients, and 46% of these patients were treated with metformin HCl (444 patients in the empagliflozin group and 418 in the placebo group) and 25% were treated with insulin. In the type 2 diabetes mellitus subpopulation, the mean age was 67 years; 77% were males; 69% White, 19% Asian and 7% Black or African American; 32% were Hispanic/Latino. In the type 2 diabetes mellitus subpopulation, at baseline, 71% of patients were classified as NYHA class II, 28% class III and 0.7% class IV; the mean LVEF was 27%; the mean baseline eGFR was 61 mL/min/1.73 m2. In this subpopulation, at baseline, 88% of patients were treated with ACE inhibitors, ARB, or ARNI, 95% with beta-blockers, 70% with MRA, and 96% with diuretics.

### Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for preventing the progression of diabetic kidney disease [^71a6da10]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines suggest that adults with diabetes and kidney disease receive treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2006.

Objectives

We compared the efficacy and safety of ACEi and ARB therapy (either as monotherapy or in combination) on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in adults with diabetes and kidney disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplants Register of Studies to 17 March 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included studies evaluating ACEi or ARB alone or in combination, compared to each other, placebo or no treatment in people with diabetes and kidney disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

One hundred and nine studies (28,341 randomised participants) were eligible for inclusion. Overall, the risk of bias was high. Compared to placebo or no treatment, ACEi may make little or no difference to all-cause death (24 studies, 7413 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.15; I² = 23%; low certainty) and with similar withdrawals from treatment (7 studies, 5306 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.19; I² = 0%; low certainty). ACEi may prevent kidney failure (8 studies, 6643 participants: RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; I² = 0%; low certainty). Compared to placebo or no treatment, ARB may make little or no difference to all-cause death (11 studies, 4260 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; I² = 0%; low certainty). ARB have uncertain effects on withdrawal from treatment (3 studies, 721 participants: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.26; I² = 2%; low certainty) and cardiovascular death (6 studies, 878 participants: RR 3.36, 95% CI 0.93 to 12.07; low certainty). ARB may prevent kidney failure (3 studies, 3227 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94; I² = 0%; low certainty), doubling of serum creatinine (SCr) (4 studies, 3280 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97; I² = 32%; low certainty), and the progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria (5 studies, 815 participants: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85; I² = 74%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi, ARB had uncertain effects on all-cause death (15 studies, 1739 participants: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.88; I² = 0%; low certainty), withdrawal from treatment (6 studies, 612 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28; I² = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (13 studies, 1606 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.98; I² = 0%; low certainty), kidney failure (3 studies, 837 participants: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07; I² = 0%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (2 studies, 767 participants: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.48; I² = 0%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi plus ARB, ACEi alone has uncertain effects on all-cause death (6 studies, 1166 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.40; I² = 20%; low certainty), withdrawal from treatment (2 studies, 172 participants: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.86; I² = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (4 studies, 994 participants: RR 3.02, 95% CI 0.61 to 14.85; low certainty), kidney failure (3 studies, 880 participants: RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.32; I² = 0%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (2 studies, 813 participants: RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.85; I² = 0%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi plus ARB, ARB alone has uncertain effects on all-cause death (7 studies, 2607 participants: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.37; I² = 0%; low certainty), withdrawn from treatment (3 studies, 1615 participants: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.24; I² = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (4 studies, 992 participants: RR 3.03, 95% CI 0.62 to 14.93; low certainty), kidney failure (4 studies, 2321 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.95; I² = 29%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (3 studies, 2252 participants: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.64; I² = 0%; low certainty). Comparative effects of different ACEi or ARB and low-dose versus high-dose ARB were rarely evaluated. No study compared different doses of ACEi. Adverse events of ACEi and ARB were rarely reported.

Authors' Conclusions

ACEi or ARB may make little or no difference to all-cause and cardiovascular death compared to placebo or no treatment in people with diabetes and kidney disease but may prevent kidney failure. ARB may prevent the doubling of SCr and the progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria compared with a placebo or no treatment. Despite the international guidelines suggesting not combining ACEi and ARB treatment, the effects of ACEi or ARB monotherapy compared to dual therapy have not been adequately assessed. The limited data availability and the low quality of the included studies prevented the assessment of the benefits and harms of ACEi or ARB in people with diabetes and kidney disease. Low and very low certainty evidence indicates that it is possible that further studies might provide different results.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^537f1668]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor initiation and practical considerations are noted, including that individuals with HbA1c in the low or normal range (eg, < 7.0%) might not be initiated on an SGLT2 inhibitor based on the KDIGO guideline. Trial context indicates that approximately 18%–25% of participants in large SGLT2 inhibitor trials and 50% in CREDENCE were not on metformin at baseline, and there are no post hoc analyses comparing outcomes according to baseline metformin therapy; therefore, in some cases, it may be reasonable to reduce or discontinue metformin to safely utilize an SGLT2 inhibitor from a glycemic perspective. The KDOQI work group agreed with withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during hospitalization or periods of fasting when risk for diabetic ketoacidosis is higher and to consider decreasing or holding diuretics in euvolemic individuals at initiation to reduce hypovolemia risk, and it underscores the expected initial decline in eGFR with SGLT2 inhibitor initiation. For implementation, KDIGO offers a clinical practice point to prioritize agents with proven cardiorenal benefit and acknowledges that therapy choice will depend on insurance and assistance programs, while highlighting current US uptake gaps where only 21%–50% of eligible people receive ACEI/ARB therapy versus 75%–80% in Europe.

### Renal hemodynamic effects differ between antidiabetic combination strategies: randomized controlled clinical trial comparing empagliflozin / linagliptin with metformin / insulin glargine [^9d44f4c3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing. Combination of metformin and insulin is considered a valid and well established combination therapy in type 2 diabetes. However, according to the updated Position Statement of the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes, dual and even triple oral antidiabetic combination therapy is recommended. Among the goals of treatment for type 2 diabetes is the delay of cardiovascular and renal complications, including heart failure, one of the most common and serious complications experienced by about 20–40% of patients with diabetes. There exists an intricate relationship between cardiac and renal function, leading to a vicious and selfperpetuating cycle of diabetes, heart failure and renal insufficiency.

For several decades, after the introduction of renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-blockers, no other renoprotective treatment strategy has emerged that exerted, in addition to its cardioprotective effects, renoprotective effects beyond blood glucose and blood pressure control. In 2015, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial has triggered great enthusiasm. In patients with type 2 diabetes treated with the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin, cardiovascular outcome and death as well as hospitalization for heart failure decreased and the progression of kidney disease (as defined by incident or worsening of nephropathy) was attenuated.

Previously, several meta-analyses showed beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibition in type 2 diabetes over a spectrum of cardiovascular and renal risk.

Noteworthy, in patients treated with empagliflozin an initial drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) occurred, followed by a stabilization of eGFR decline compared to placebo during long-term treatment.

The initial decline in eGFR likely reflects attenuation of single-nephron hyperfiltration, which is associated with subsequent long-term renal function preservation. Indeed, data from experimental rodent models and from patients with type 1 diabetes and hyperfiltration support this view. However, corresponding data in type 2 diabetes, which represent 90% of patients with diabetic nephropathy, were not available for a long time and remain scare. Likewise, little is known on the renal and intraglomerular hemodynamic effects of insulin. Again, the nephroprotective effects of glucose lowering therapy with insulin therapy has been shown only in type 1 diabetes. The precise nephroprotective mechanisms remain unclear. In addition, in type 2 diabetes no effect was found on secondary outcomes (e.g. insulin regimens did not affect renal failure or doubling of serum creatinine level), compared to placebo or diet alone.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^226f803f]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that renal outcomes in the GLP1-RA trials were positive; however, they did not mount to the benefits demonstrated by SGLT2i (Additional file 1: Table S1). In the LEADER trial, the composite renal and retinal outcomes were reduced by 16% (HR: 0.84; 95% CI 0.73–0.97; p = 0.02), whereas the renal outcomes individually were reduced by 22% (HR: 0.78; 95% CI 0.67–0.92; p = 0.003). Similar results were seen in SUSTAIN 6 trial, semaglutide reduced the new onset or worsening nephropathy by 36% (HR: 0.64; CI 0.46–0.88; p = 0.005).

As mentioned above, following the approach of tight glycaemic control along with blood pressure regulation has a beneficial effect on management of renal complications. The clinical effects of the AHAs can be significantly achieved on top of the standard treatment with anti-hypertensive agents. Blocking the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system is currently considered the gold standard treatment for diabetic nephropathy. Studies have proved the efficacy of this class of agents in treating various stages of renal continuum. The TRENDY trial (Telmisartan versus Ramipril in renal ENdothelium DYsfunction) has shown effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) in improving endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, many trials have shown the potential of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in preventing microalbuminuria as well as preventing the progression to macroalbuminuria. In the IDNT trial (The Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial), irbesartan reduced the progression to end stage renal disease by 23%, while in RENAAL trial (Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan), losartan resulted in 29% risk reduction in progression to end stage renal disease and delay in doubling of serum creatinine.

Recommendation: in T2DM patients with peripheral vascular disease, we suggest the use of GLP1 analogues and to avoid canagliflozin (Grade A, B)

In T2DM patients with CVD and peripheral vascular disease, we suggest the use of GLP1-RA as the data from LEADER and SUSTAIN-6 did not show any evidence of increased risk of amputation, unlike canagliflozin, which showed an almost double the risk of lower limb amputation. Fortunately, this risk has not been proved in any other studies of the SGLT2i including the DECLARE- TIMI 58 trial.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The present study is the first, to our knowledge, to investigate the effect of combined SGLT‐2 and ACE inhibition on systemic RAS components in patients with CKD with and without type 2 diabetes. We found that empagliflozin on top of therapeutic ACEi treatment induced activation of the alternative RAS axis in patients with CKD and diabetes, corroborating the hypothesis that this drug exerts a modulatory effect on the neurohormonal system.

As SGLT‐2i exert their primary effect in the tubular system of the kidney and have been shown to associate with a reduction in blood pressure, the influence of neurohormonal regulators by this substance class is probable. SGLT‐2i provoke an increase in renin secretion, which then cleaves its substrate angiotensinogen into Ang I. Ang I is further cleaved by ACE, creating Ang II, which exhibits vasoconstrictive, profibrotic and proinflammatory effects, thereby contributing to increased blood pressure and renal damage. The importance of the 'alternative' RAS with Ang‐(1‐7) as a key opposing effector to Ang II has been well established. The alternative RAS axis is maintained by the enzymes ACE2 and neprilysin, which both lead to the formation of Ang‐(1‐7) from Ang II or Ang I.

Despite the guideline recommendations advocating the use of ACEis/ARBs in patients with T2D and CKD, reported rates of the use of these agents remain low. Although specific data regarding the use of ACEis/ARBs in patients with T2D and CKD are lacking, rates of use in patients with CKD and hypertension are low (only 36% of patients received an ACEi/ARB between 2010 and 2014) and have decreased since 2006. There is evidence to suggest that patients with CKD who are comanaged by a PCP and a nephrologist have higher ACEi/ARB prescription rates and that patients with more severe renal impairment are more likely to receive an ACEi/ARB when they have received care from both a PCP and a nephrologist compared with a PCP alone. Notably, PCPs may have reservations about prescribing ACEis/ARBs given the potential risk for developing hyperkalemia. To mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend starting ACEi/ARBs at a lower dose and titrating upwards in patients with an eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Importantly, eGFR and serum potassium should be monitored within a few weeks of a patient starting an ACEi/ARB. If hyperkalemia develops, consideration for a nephrology referral is appropriate. Additional strategies that can be considered include identification and restriction of dietary potassium, treatment of metabolic acidosis where required, initiation/up titration of thiazide or loop diuretic(s) to increase potassium excretion, and treatment with a potassium-binding exchange resin.

### Renal protection by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and its underlying mechanisms in diabetic kidney disease [^71ac29a1]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most frequent cause of mortality and morbidity, leading a global health burden. This review will focus on the potential therapeutic interventions using Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors that could prevent the development and progression of DKD.

Results

SGLT2 inhibitors have been widely used as anti-diabetic drugs. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that these drugs, which improve glycemic control and hypertension and decrease body weight, decrease the risk of renal function impairment and heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes. With regard to long-term clinical outcomes, the Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), the EMPA-REG Renal OUTCOME, and the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) program which have been integrated from CANVAS and CANVAS-Renal (CANVAS-R) trials reported significant risk reductions in primary combined major adverse cardiovascular events. Furthermore, regarding renal outcomes, the EMPA-REG Renal OUTCOME and CANVAS program clearly showed improvements in renal outcomes, including decreases in albuminuria and progression of nephropathy, doubling of serum creatinine levels, and initiation of renal replacement therapy.

Conclusions

Potential mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors related to renoprotection can be divided into two categories: hemodynamic actions and metabolic actions.
