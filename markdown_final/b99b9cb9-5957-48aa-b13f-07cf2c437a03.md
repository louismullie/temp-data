## Question

Gastritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an overview of gastritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental definition and classification of gastritis. Then, I should verify the dominant etiologies and their pathophysiology. Next, I will examine the clinical presentation and the often poor correlation with endoscopic or histologic findings. After that, I need to review diagnostic strategies, including biopsy protocols and risk stratification systems. Then, I will outline management by etiology, including H. pylori eradication, autoimmune gastritis care, and special entities like eosinophilic and collagenous gastritis. Finally, I should consider surveillance for premalignant conditions and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't build on a shaky foundation. Gastritis is inflammation of the gastric mucosa, and modern classification is etiology-based rather than purely descriptive, with the Kyoto Global Consensus and subsequent updates codifying H. pylori–associated, autoimmune, drug-induced, and other specific entities; importantly, ICD-11 moved to an etiologic framework, replacing the older morphology-only ICD-10 schema, which is now considered obsolete for gastritis [^113RBsUN] [^111EmDHg].

> Wait, let me verify the dominant etiologies before proceeding. H. pylori is the leading cause of chronic gastritis worldwide and is classified as a definite carcinogen by IARC; virtually all infected individuals develop chronic active gastritis, though clinical consequences vary widely, and eradication can reverse mucosal inflammation and reduce cancer risk if undertaken before advanced atrophy develops [^111aJCbW] [^117KnGjN] [^115YAUbr]. Autoimmune gastritis targets parietal cells and intrinsic factor, leading to corpus-predominant atrophy, hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria, and risks of pernicious anemia, neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, and gastric cancer; NSAIDs and immune checkpoint inhibitors are other important causes to keep in mind, with ICIs producing immune-related gastritis that can mimic tumor inflammation and complicate management decisions [^114kxGmb] [^1118RoQV] [^115dcvJ7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptoms. I initially thought dyspepsia reliably indicates gastritis, but I should double-check that assumption. The correlation between dyspeptic symptoms and histologic or endoscopic gastritis is poor; many patients with gastritis are asymptomatic, and conversely, dyspepsia can occur without demonstrable mucosal inflammation, which is why the term "gastritis" should not be used as a synonym for functional dyspepsia without histologic confirmation [^115TunbB] [^111WgsX7]. That said, a subset of H. pylori–infected dyspeptic patients experience sustained symptom improvement after eradication, supporting the concept of H. pylori–associated dyspepsia as a distinct entity in some cases [^116mqkiD] [^111aJCbW].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach is precise. Endoscopic appearance alone is insufficient; histopathology is the gold standard, and discordance between endoscopy and histology is common, so targeted biopsies from antrum and body (separate jars) are essential, with additional sampling of abnormal areas; risk stratification using OLGA/OLGIM staging should be incorporated into reports to guide surveillance and management [^1118RoQV] [^1174Nz8t] [^111RGxts]. For H. pylori, noninvasive testing (urea breath test or stool antigen) is appropriate in dyspeptic patients, with endoscopic biopsy-based methods reserved for upper endoscopy indications; eradication should be confirmed with nonserologic testing to avoid false positives from residual antibodies [^1118RoQV]. In suspected autoimmune gastritis, I should confirm with gastric biopsies and consider serologies such as anti–parietal cell and anti–intrinsic factor antibodies, while also screening for iron and B12 deficiencies and associated autoimmune diseases like thyroid disease [^1118RoQV] [^113TQAMD].

> Let me think about management by etiology, starting with H. pylori. Eradication is indicated for all who test positive unless contraindicated, as it halts progressive mucosal damage, reduces ulcer risk, and lowers gastric cancer risk; timing matters — benefit is maximized when treated before atrophy or intestinal metaplasia develop, and eradication can improve or resolve dyspepsia in a meaningful subset, with an NNT around 8–14 in functional dyspepsia populations [^115YAUbr] [^116mqkiD]. I should confirm eradication 4 or more weeks after antibiotics using urea breath test or stool antigen, and if symptoms persist after successful eradication, I should reconsider the diagnosis as functional dyspepsia and manage accordingly [^111HF4MX].

> For autoimmune gastritis, I need to check that I'm not inadvertently worsening things. Acid suppression is often ineffective and may aggravate hypochlorhydria; instead, I should correct deficiencies with parenteral B12 when indicated and iron as needed, and consider acid replacement strategies in selected cases, while arranging surveillance for neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and type 1 gastric carcinoids and coordinating endoscopic follow-up intervals based on risk and shared decision-making [^115hNeAX] [^113TQAMD] [^114cib5D]. But wait, what if I suspect concomitant H. pylori? I should test and eradicate if present, because H. pylori can accelerate mucosal damage and confound risk stratification in autoimmune gastritis [^1118RoQV].

> I will now examine special entities so I don't miss less common but important causes. Eosinophilic gastritis presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and sometimes obstructive symptoms, often in atopic patients; diagnosis relies on histology with elevated eosinophil counts using accepted thresholds, and treatment options include corticosteroids and dietary elimination, with variable response and frequent relapses necessitating individualized, often multidisciplinary care [^11563m2m] [^112iCdHX]. Collagenous gastritis is rare, more common in younger females, frequently presents with pain and iron-deficiency anemia, and shows characteristic subepithelial collagen bands; evidence is limited, so management is supportive and individualized, with attention to nutritional deficits and potential overlap with other collagenous gastroenteropathies [^1177sL77] [^116ZkSeX].

> Next, I should review surveillance for premalignant conditions so I don't under- or over-screen. Patients with advanced atrophic gastritis or extensive intestinal metaplasia (OLGA/OLGIM III–IV) have increased gastric cancer risk and should be considered for surveillance endoscopy about every 3 years, with intervals individualized by risk factors such as family history, persistent H. pylori, smoking, and diet; image-enhanced endoscopy improves detection of dysplasia and early cancer and should be used when available [^112ENXGT] [^112YDELD] [^11317QDX]. Hold on, I should verify that IM truly implies atrophy; yes, intestinal metaplasia almost invariably indicates underlying atrophic gastritis, reinforcing the need for careful mapping and staging on histology [^112rRSZN].

> Let me reconsider the overarching synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Gastritis spans acute and chronic inflammatory processes with diverse etiologies; H. pylori dominates globally, but autoimmune, drug-induced, and eosinophilic forms are clinically important and require tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Accurate diagnosis hinges on histology rather than endoscopic impression alone, and management should be etiology-specific: eradicate H. pylori when present, correct deficiencies and surveil appropriately in autoimmune gastritis, and treat inflammatory subtypes with immunomodulatory or dietary strategies while monitoring response. Because progression to atrophy and intestinal metaplasia confers cancer risk, risk-adapted surveillance with high-quality endoscopy and standardized histology reporting is essential to mitigate downstream malignancy [^113RBsUN] [^116oCzKr] [^115Zbiqm].

---

Gastritis is **inflammation of the gastric mucosa** with a broad differential, most commonly due to H. pylori [^114Gekjz], NSAIDs, or autoimmune injury [^114kxGmb]. Diagnosis relies on **endoscopy with biopsies** [^1174Nz8t] to confirm etiology and stage disease [^111RGxts]; H. pylori testing is essential [^1118RoQV], and autoimmune markers are indicated when suspected [^116oCzKr]. Management is **etiology-specific**: eradicate H. pylori [^111aJCbW], stop offending drugs, and treat autoimmune gastritis with B12/iron and surveillance [^1118RoQV]; PPIs provide symptomatic relief but do not alter cancer risk [^notfound]. atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia increase gastric cancer risk [^115ZQdq3]; surveillance every 3 years is reasonable for advanced atrophy or extensive IM [^112ENXGT] [^112YDELD]. Prognosis varies: H. pylori gastritis is reversible with eradication [^117KnGjN], whereas autoimmune gastritis is chronic and requires lifelong monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Gastritis has **diverse causes**; the most common are H. pylori infection, NSAID use, and autoimmune disease [^114Gekjz] [^114hUZC5].

| **Etiology** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Helicobacter pylori | - Most common cause of chronic gastritis [^114hUZC5] <br/> - Linked to peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer [^115YAUbr] |
| NSAIDs | - Cause acute erosive gastritis [^114xQ3Rs] <br/> - Increase risk of bleeding and ulceration [^115d831M] |
| Autoimmune gastritis | - Immune-mediated parietal cell destruction [^114kxGmb] <br/> - Causes atrophy, hypochlorhydria, and pernicious anemia [^1118RoQV] |
| Alcohol, smoking, stress | - Contribute to mucosal injury and inflammation [^111EmDHg] [^112JdbZP] |
| Infectious agents | - Viral (e.g. CMV) and bacterial infections can cause gastritis [^notfound] |

---

## Pathophysiology

Gastritis involves **complex interactions** among infectious, immune, and environmental factors [^116w6JHS]. H. pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa, triggering chronic inflammation, epithelial injury, and, over time, atrophy and intestinal metaplasia [^117KnGjN]. Autoimmune gastritis features autoantibodies against parietal cells and intrinsic factor, leading to atrophy, hypochlorhydria, and vitamin B12 deficiency [^114kxGmb].

---

## Clinical presentation

Gastritis may be **asymptomatic or present with nonspecific symptoms**:

- Epigastric pain or discomfort [^notfound]
- Nausea and vomiting [^112yyszm]
- Dyspepsia [^116mqkiD]
- Anorexia [^notfound]
- Hematemesis or melena (in severe cases) [^116iSdHw]

Autoimmune gastritis may also cause **vitamin B12 deficiency** with neurologic symptoms [^113TQAMD].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Accurate diagnosis requires a **combination of endoscopic, histologic, and laboratory evaluations** [^1118RoQV]:

- **Upper endoscopy**: Essential for visualizing mucosal changes and obtaining biopsies [^1174Nz8t].
- **Histopathology**: Confirms diagnosis, identifies etiology, and stages disease (e.g. OLGA/OLGIM) [^111RGxts] [^113Ebnmh].
- **H. pylori testing**: Urea breath test, stool antigen, or serology [^notfound].
- **Autoimmune markers**: Anti-parietal cell and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies [^1118RoQV].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **tailored to the underlying cause and severity**:

- **H. pylori eradication**: First-line therapy for H. pylori-associated gastritis [^1135wk2G].
- **NSAID management**: Discontinuation or use of gastroprotective agents [^114VDMWq].
- **Autoimmune gastritis**: Vitamin B12 and iron supplementation, surveillance for complications [^1118RoQV].
- **Symptomatic relief**: Proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists [^114VDMWq].

---

## Complications

Untreated gastritis can lead to **significant complications**:

- Peptic ulcer disease [^114hUZC5]
- Gastrointestinal bleeding [^116iSdHw]
- Gastric cancer (especially with atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia) [^115ZQdq3]
- Pernicious anemia (in autoimmune gastritis) [^114kxGmb]

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **cause, severity, and treatment**. H. pylori gastritis has a favorable prognosis with eradication [^117KnGjN], whereas autoimmune gastritis requires lifelong monitoring due to chronicity and cancer risk [^112DcL6D].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on **H. pylori screening and eradication**, NSAID risk mitigation, and lifestyle modifications (smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, dietary adjustments) [^1125KS4o] [^114w3tNr].

---

Gastritis is a common inflammatory condition with diverse causes; **accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy** are essential to prevent complications and improve outcomes [^114hUZC5].

Comment

H. pylori gastritis is an infectious disease and leads to chronic active gastritis of varying severity in virtually all infected subjects.

There is a significant variability in the interindividual expressions of gastric mucosal structural damage and accordingly the associated physiological perturbations also vary. H. pylori gastritis may remain clinically unapparent or evolve into severe complications. The rate of progression is unpredictable. The most severe clinical expression is gastric cancer, which is often incurable by the time of diagnosis.

Cure of H. pylori infection leads to healing of the inflamed gastric mucosa, which may return to normal. H. pylori eradication may improve or resolve dyspeptic symptoms and usually cures PUD. H. pylori gastritis is a disease which can be cured and thus prevent severe complications. If H. pylori gastritis has progressed to more severe forms of gastritis, including atrophic gastritis with or without intestinal metaplasia, or severe corpus predominant gastritis, the risk of gastric cancer is increased and eradication of the infection at this stage needs to be integrated with a follow-up strategy.

Comment

A large number of observations support the conclusion that H. pylori infection may be a cause of symptoms in a proportion of patients presenting with dyspepsia. First, acute iatrogenic or self-administered infection with H. pylori can induce acute dyspeptic symptoms. However, while persistent colonisation virtually always leads to chronic gastritis, in the majority of individuals severe dyspeptic symptoms are transient. Second, most but not all, epidemiological studies show associations between H. pylori infection and (uninvestigated) dyspeptic symptoms. The most convincing evidence can be derived from H. pylori eradication studies in infected patients with uninvestigated or FD. In these studies, eradication is associated with a small but statistically significant benefit for symptom control over no eradication; the estimated number needed to treat is 14and in a more recent study the number was 8. At present there are no criteria to predict whether a patient with dyspeptic symptoms will respond to eradication therapy or not. Therefore, the only way in clinical practice is to eradicate the H. pylori infection and see whether symptoms resolve or whether additional treatments will be required. The symptomatic gain takes at least 6 months to become significant over no eradication and this has been attributed to the time it takes for gastritis to recover.

CQ8. Should we categorise H. pylori -associated dyspepsia as a specific entity?

Statement 8A

In H. pylori -infected patients with dyspepsia, symptoms can be attributed to H. pylori gastritis if successful eradication therapy is followed by sustained symptom remission.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 97.4%

Statement 8B

H. pylori -associated dyspepsia (as in statement 8A) is a distinct entity.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: moderate

Consensus level: 92.1%

### Antitumor response to microscopic melanoma in the gastric mucosa mimicking ipilimumab-induced gastritis [^115dcvJ7]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Alongside its clinical success, checkpoint blockade has also given rise to a set of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). In addition to causing considerable morbidity and even mortality, irAEs may limit the success and scope of immunotherapy. Most irAEs arise at mucosal barriers, including the gastrointestinal mucosa, leading most commonly to colitis, though both gastritis and enteritis can result from checkpoint blockade. While guidelines generally recommend confirmatory testing for suspected severe irAEs, the role of endoscopy in diagnosing more moderate irAEs is less clear. Many patients with suspected gastrointestinal irAEs are treated empirically with glucocorticoids based on typical symptoms. Although efficient, this approach may miss less common underlying etiologies, and may expose patients unnecessarily to an increased risk of infection, and a potentially dampened antitumor response.

Case Presentation

We report a case of ipilimumab-induced antitumor immunity targeting microscopic gastric melanoma metastases, mimicking checkpoint blockade induced gastritis. Immune suppression was avoided and the immunotherapy was continued.

Conclusion

Checkpoint blockade can induce rapid inflammatory responses to tumor tissue present throughout the body. These responses are desirable, but may also lead to local tissue injury, causing symptoms that may mimic adverse events. This is particularly important to consider in organs where metastatic disease may be unappreciated at the time of treatment, and where irAEs are otherwise common, such as the gastrointestinal tract. In this setting, empiric immune suppression may inhibit antitumor responses, improving symptoms but at a potential cost to therapeutic efficacy.

Discussion

The global consensus meeting on H. pylori gastritis has set a new landmark for gastritis, which has continued to be an ill-conceived clinical entity placed between a histological picture and upper abdominal symptoms.

In spite of the fact that gastritis had been long recognised as an important clinical entity, generations of gastroenterologists have neglected the importance of treatment of this nosological entity. Rudolf Schindler described chronic gastritis as a serious disease and a precursor of gastric cancer and considered their relationship as being of outstanding importance in the fight against gastric cancer.

The discovery of H. pylori has revolutionised the pre-existing concepts of gastritis by assigning a specific aetiology to this entity underlying PUD and gastric cancer. The majority of these serious conditions are manifestations developed on the background of chronic gastritis caused by a unique infectious agent, H. pylori. For PUD, guidelines unanimously recommend eradication as the primary treatment for those with positive H. pylori tests. However, there has been no consensus on how and when to manage individuals with H. pylori gastritis itself, which is crucial to the efficiency of gastric cancer prevention because most patients with chronic gastritis may remain asymptomatic until the appearance of severe complications. Furthermore, both gastritis and duodenitis were recognised as important causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, encouraging our attention to these conditions now that anti-thrombotic therapies are increasingly being used.

To further compromise the concept of gastritis as a significant clinical entity, the term 'gastritis' has historically, but wrongly, been used as a substitute for a clinical diagnosis of FD. Historical studies, however, failed to demonstrate a significant association between histological findings of gastritis and the dyspeptic symptom complex. Hence, a potential pathogenetic role for H. pylori in causing dyspeptic symptoms was initially considered doubtful and its eradication in FD controversial. Meta-analysis of a large number of controlled trials with longer follow-up confirmed that eradication of H. pylori in patients with FD conveys a small but statistically significant benefit. Consequently, dyspepsia attributable to H. pylori gastritis involves an underlying organic cause and should be excluded from the FD category. Additionally, 'dyspeptic' patients should not automatically be labelled as having 'gastritis' without any histological confirmation.

Comment

As is apparent from statement 8, there is a group of patients with FD for whom H. pylori is considered the cause of their symptoms, and this can be established if eradication is associated with sustained symptom benefit. This scenario is the only one where patients with chronic dyspeptic symptoms and a negative endoscopy can be 'cured', albeit with some delay after successful eradication therapy. Moreover, very few effective alternative therapeutic approaches have been proved to have substantial and sustained benefit in FD. Finally, eradication therapy is a short treatment, with acceptable cost–benefit for controlling dyspeptic symptoms, and with other potential benefits for prevention of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Based on these considerations, eradication therapy can be proposed as first-line treatment for H. pylori -infected dyspeptic patients, which is in line with a recent management algorithm by the Rome foundation.

CQ10. How effective is H. pylori eradication on dyspeptic symptoms — in the short and long term — and how does it compare with other treatments (such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs))?

Statement 10

In H. pylori -infected dyspeptic patients, eradication therapy for dyspeptic symptoms is better than placebo and is the preferred option.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 97.4%

Comment

Eradication therapy studies have confirmed that a subset of H. pylori -infected patients with FD is relieved of dyspeptic symptoms by eradication therapy. To date, only a limited number of studies have directly compared eradication therapy with other treatments that are used for FD, such as PPIs or prokinetic therapy. Hence, although the symptomatic gain takes at least 6 months, eradication is the preferred treatment. Future trials should compare eradication with treatment modalities other than placebo in H pylori -infected patients with chronic dyspeptic symptoms and a negative endoscopy.

CQ11. Should patients who remain dyspeptic after successful H. pylori eradication be considered to have FD?

Statement 11

Patients who remain symptomatic after successful H. pylori eradication should be considered to have FD.

Grade of recommendation: weak

Evidence level: moderate

Consensus level: 97.4%

Introduction

For decades endoscopic 'gastritis', gastric erosions and even histological findings of gastric inflammation have failed to attract much attention from clinicians as the majority of patients with these findings remain asymptomatic. Although gastritis is often used to describe dyspeptic symptoms, the presence of such symptoms correlates poorly with histological or endoscopic gastritis. Although the term 'gastritis' is still used as a concept to explain dyspeptic symptoms, gastritis as a term refers to gastric inflammation, often accompanying structural mucosal changes. This gastric inflammation (gastritis) has long been associated with peptic ulcer, gastric cancer and pernicious anaemia, but the cause or causes of gastritis remain poorly understood. The discovery that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was a cause of gastritisfocused attention on the aetiology, natural history and prognosis of gastritis.

### Management of upper gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with autoimmune gastritis [^115hNeAX]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Autoimmune gastritis is characterized by atrophy of acid secreting parietal cells resulting in achlorhydria. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms are common in autoimmune gastritis and frequently result in prescriptions for acid suppressant medications despite the inability of the stomach to secrete acid. Evidence-based recommendations for management of gastrointestinal symptoms in autoimmune gastritis are lacking.

Recent Findings

The most common symptoms in patients with autoimmune gastritis are dyspepsia, heartburn, and regurgitation. Gastroesophageal reflux should be confirmed by pH-impedance testing and is typically weakly acid or alkaline. Therapy for reflux focuses on mechanical prevention of reflux (i.e., elevation of the head of the bed and alginates) or when severe, antireflux surgery. The etiology of dyspepsia in autoimmune gastritis is unclear and largely unstudied. In the first half of the 20th century, oral administration of acid to "aid digestion" was widely used with reported success. However, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are lacking. Here, we provide suggestions for attempting gastric acidification therapy.

Summary

Upper GI symptoms are common in autoimmune gastritis. Their pathogenesis and therapy remain incompletely understood. Acid suppressant medications are useless and should be discontinued. A trial of acid replacement therapy is recommended especially in the form of placebo-controlled trials.

Comment

Although the ICD-10 has been updated regularly to accommodate new diseases and concepts, WHO recognised the necessity of overall systematic changes in the ICD and decided to revise the current ICD-10 to ICD-11 in 2007. As the intermediate process for this revision, the ICD11 β version was formulated with input from various scientific advisory groups. This version was open to the public so that opinions from various interest groups and a broader range of medical specialists could be reflected before compiling the ICD-11. ICD11 β foundation component consists of the core of the ICD-11 classification from which mortality and morbidity classifications will derive. However, it remains a draft and can be changed from time to time before finalisation of ICD-11 (for more details, please visit).

In the ICD11 β foundation component of the gastritis section, classification of gastritis was principally based on aetiological factors with consideration of their specific pathophysiological principles (box 2). Accordingly, H. pylori gastritis is categorised as a specific nosological entity.

The assessment of gastritis based on histopathological criteria was completely changed after recognition of H. pylori as the most common cause of chronic gastritis. The Sydney System was developed as a consequence and has been integrated into clinical practice. The Sydney classification of gastritis combined histological parameters of activity, chronicity, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, topographical distribution and aetiopathogenic information for reporting the pathology of gastritis in endoscopic biopsies.

As described above, classification of gastritis in the foundation component of ICD11 β version is principally based on causative factors, in order to cover the three most important and best defined categories of gastritis — namely, (a) H. pylori -induced, (b) drug-induced and (c) autoimmune gastritis. A specific diagnosis among these different categories of gastritis is required to direct specific management and treatment strategies. The diagnosis of H. pylori -induced gastritis has major implications for life-long healthcare. H. pylori gastritis may cause dyspeptic symptomsand result in gastroduodenal pathologies, including peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and gastric cancer. The recognised role of H. pylori as a carcinogen makes eradication of H. pylori infection the preferred strategy for the prevention of gastric cancer. There is more to learn about aetiologies other than H. pylori in gastritis and this is dealt with as ' H. pylori -negative or idiopathic gastritis'.

### Characteristics of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated gastritis: report from a major tertiary care center [^112yyszm]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have increased our ability to treat an ever-expanding number of cancers. We describe a case series of 25 patients who were diagnosed with gastritis following ICI therapy.

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective study involving 1712 patients treated for malignancy with immunotherapy at Cleveland Clinic from January 2011 to June 2019 (IRB 18–1225). We searched electronic medical records using ICD-10 codes for gastritis diagnosis confirmed on endoscopy and histology within 3 months of ICI therapy. Patients with upper gastrointestinal tract malignancy or documented Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis were excluded.

Results

Twenty-five patients were found to meet the criteria for diagnosis of gastritis. Of these 25 patients, most common malignancies were non-small cell lung cancer (52%) and melanoma (24%). Median number of infusions preceding symptoms was 4 (1–30) and time to symptom onset 2 (0.5–12) weeks after last infusion. Symptoms experienced were nausea (80%), vomiting (52%), abdominal pain (72%), and melena (44%). Common endoscopic findings were erythema (88%), edema (52%), and friability (48%). The most common diagnosis of pathology was chronic active gastritis in 24% of patients. Ninety-six percent received acid suppression treatment and 36% of patients also received steroids with an initial median dose of prednisone 75 (20–80) mg. Within 2 months, 64% had documented complete resolution of symptoms and 52% were able to resume immunotherapy.

Conclusion

Patients presenting with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or melena following immunotherapy should be assessed for gastritis and if other causes are excluded, may require treatment as consideration for complication of immunotherapy.

Collagenous gastritis affects individuals across a broad age range but demonstrates a predilection for younger patients. Of the 133 patients with available demographic information, the reported median age at diagnosis is 18 years, with the majority of cases occurring in individuals younger than 40 years (± 20.66). A female predominance is also observed, accounting for approximately two‐thirds of the cases described in the literature.

Most patients with CG present with at least one symptom; only five patients in the reviewed literature were reported as asymptomatic. The nature and severity of presenting symptoms vary widely. The most commonly reported initial manifestations include abdominal pain and chronic anaemia, each occurring in nearly half of symptomatic cases. Abdominal pain ranged from mild, cramp‐like discomfort, sometimes postprandial or bloating‐related, to severe, recurrent or progressively worsening episodes. Chronic anaemia also presented with variable severity, from incidental laboratory findings to more overt signs such as pallor, exercise intolerance, palpitations, pica and resistance to iron therapy. Anaemia is likely secondary to chronic blood loss from entrapped dilated capillaries, potentially leading to iron deficiency. Concurrent gastric hypochlorhydria may further contribute to iron deficiency by impairing iron absorption.

### Helicobacter pylori-negative chronic gastritis in children: a systematic review [^111Sxg4y]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To systematically review the current evidence on Helicobacter pylori-negative chronic gastritis including natural history, available therapies and outcomes.

Methods

Articles providing data on the prevalence, treatment or outcomes of Helicobacter pylori-negative gastritis were identified through a systematic search in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. All original research articles from human studies until October 31, 2021, were included.

Results

A total of 54 studies were included consisted of eosinophilic gastritis (n = 9), autoimmune gastritis (n = 11), collagenous gastritis (n = 16), focally enhanced gastritis (n = 6), lymphocytic gastritis (n = 5) and other causes including idiopathic gastritis and chronic renal failure related (n = 7). Most of the included studies were either cross-sectional or longitudinal cohorts except for collagenous gastritis, which mainly included case reports and case series. The prevalence of paediatric eosinophilic gastritis ranges between 5 and 7/100,000 and patients have generally favourable outcome with 50% to 70% clinical and histological response to either corticosteroids or elimination diets. Autoimmune gastritis and collagenous gastritis are extremely rare entities, commonly present with refractory iron deficiency anaemia, while lymphocytic gastritis is relatively common (10%-45%) in children with coeliac disease. Data on treatments and outcomes of autoimmune, collagenous, and focally enhanced gastritis are lacking with limited data implying poor response to therapy in the former 2 diagnoses.

Conclusions

Helicobacter pylori-negative gastritis is uncommonly reported, mainly in small cohorts, mixed adult-paediatric cohorts or as sporadic case reports. As common symptoms are not specific, thus not always result in an endoscopic evaluation, the true prevalence of these distinct disorders may be underestimated, and thus under reported.

### Helicobacter pylori infection [^111izjHY]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The principal effect of Helicobacter pylori infection is lifelong chronic gastritis, affecting up to 20% of younger adults but 50% to 80% of adults born in resource-rich countries before 1950.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of H pylori eradication treatment in people with a confirmed duodenal ulcer, a confirmed gastric ulcer, confirmed gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), confirmed non-ulcer dyspepsia, uninvestigated dyspepsia, localised B cell lymphoma of the stomach, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-related peptic ulcers? What are the effects of H pylori eradication treatment for preventing NSAID-related peptic ulcers in people with or without previous ulcers or dyspepsia? What are the effects of H pylori eradication treatment on the risk of developing gastric cancer? Do H pylori eradication treatments differ in their effects? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 58 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: effects of H pylori eradication in different populations; relative effects of triple regimens, quadruple regimens, and sequential regimens.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^113RBsUN]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To present results of the Kyoto Global Consensus Meeting, which was convened to develop global consensus on (1) classification of chronic gastritis and duodenitis, (2) clinical distinction of dyspepsia caused by Helicobacter pylori from functional dyspepsia, (3) appropriate diagnostic assessment of gastritis and (4) when, whom and how to treat H. pylori gastritis.

Design

Twenty-three clinical questions addressing the above-mentioned four domains were drafted for which expert panels were asked to formulate relevant statements. A Delphi method using an anonymous electronic system was adopted to develop the consensus, the level of which was predefined as ≥ 80%. Final modifications of clinical questions and consensus were achieved at the face-to-face meeting in Kyoto.

Results

All 24 statements for 22 clinical questions after extensive modifications and omission of one clinical question were achieved with a consensus level of > 80%. To better organise classification of gastritis and duodenitis based on aetiology, a new classification of gastritis and duodenitis is recommended for the 11th international classification. A new category of H. pylori-associated dyspepsia together with a diagnostic algorithm was proposed. The adoption of grading systems for gastric cancer risk stratification, and modern image-enhancing endoscopy for the diagnosis of gastritis, were recommended. Treatment to eradicate H. pylori infection before preneoplastic changes develop, if feasible, was recommended to minimise the risk of more serious complications of the infection.

Conclusions

A global consensus for gastritis was developed for the first time, which will be the basis for an international classification system and for further research on the subject.

### Unveiling gastric precancerous stages: metabolomic insights for early detection and intervention [^115B7zZd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Globally, gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Regrettably, the majority of patients receive a diagnosis at advanced or late local stages, leading to poor prognoses. GC develops via a multi-step process, beginning with superficial gastritis and advancing through to chronic atrophic gastritis (AG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, ultimately leading to invasive GC. According to epidemiological data, AG is a prevalent and persistent condition, often without symptoms, affecting over half of the world's population at some stage. IM significantly increases GC risks, doubling the likelihood of its occurrence. Fortunately, at gastritis and IM stages, timely detection and intervention can effectively control or even reverse the disease. However, once the disease has progressed to different intraepithelial neoplasia levels, it is difficult to manage progression with non-surgical treatments. Therefore, identifying high-risk populations at AG and IM stages is crucial for developing and implementing effective prevention and management strategies. While Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is strongly associated with gastritis and gastric disease advancement, it does not directly cause GC. Currently, limited biomarkers can accurately predict GPL progression. Therefore, to inform precise clinical intervention strategies, addressing GC prevention and control challenges require enhanced etiological research and the exploration of novel molecular features to delineate gastric lesion progression.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^1118RoQV]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is to provide clinicians with guidance on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis, a common preneoplastic condition of the stomach, with a primary focus on atrophic gastritis due to chronic Helicobacter pylori infection-the most common etiology-or due to autoimmunity. To date, clinical guidance for best practices related to the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis remains very limited in the United States, which leads to poor recognition of this preneoplastic condition and suboptimal risk stratification. In addition, there is heterogeneity in the definitions of atrophic gastritis, autoimmune gastritis, pernicious anemia, and gastric neoplasia in the literature, which has led to confusion in clinical practice and research. Accordingly, the primary objective of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide clinicians with a framework for the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. By focusing on atrophic gastritis, this Clinical Practice Update is intended to complement the 2020 American Gastroenterological Association Institute guidelines on the management of gastric intestinal metaplasia. These recent guidelines did not specifically discuss the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. Providers should recognize, however, that a diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histopathology implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis because intestinal metaplasia occurs in underlying atrophic mucosa, although this is often not distinctly noted on histopathologic reports. Nevertheless, atrophic gastritis represents an important stage with distinct histopathologic alterations in the multistep cascade of gastric cancer pathogenesis.

Methods

The Best Practice Advice statements presented herein were developed from a combination of available evidence from published literature and consensus-based expert opinion. No formal rating of the strength or quality of the evidence was carried out. These statements are meant to provide practical advice to clinicians practicing in the United States. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Atrophic gastritis is defined as the loss of gastric glands, with or without metaplasia, in the setting of chronic inflammation mainly due to Helicobacter pylori infection or autoimmunity. Regardless of the etiology, the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis should be confirmed by histopathology. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Providers should be aware that the presence of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histology almost invariably implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis. There should be a coordinated effort between gastroenterologists and pathologists to improve the consistency of documenting the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis, particularly if marked atrophy is present. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Providers should recognize typical endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis, which include pale appearance of gastric mucosa, increased visibility of vasculature due to thinning of the gastric mucosa, and loss of gastric folds, and, if with concomitant intestinal metaplasia, light blue crests and white opaque fields. Because these mucosal changes are often subtle, techniques to optimize evaluation of the gastric mucosa should be performed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: When endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis are present, providers should assess the extent endoscopically. Providers should obtain biopsies from the suspected atrophic/metaplastic areas for histopathological confirmation and risk stratification; at a minimum, biopsies from the body and antrum/incisura should be obtained and placed in separately labeled jars. Targeted biopsies should additionally be obtained from any other mucosal abnormalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: In patients with histology compatible with autoimmune gastritis, providers should consider checking antiparietal cell antibodies and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies to assist with the diagnosis. Providers should also evaluate for anemia due to vitamin B-12 and iron deficiencies. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: All individuals with atrophic gastritis should be assessed for H pylori infection. If positive, treatment of H pylori should be administered and successful eradication should be confirmed using nonserological testing modalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: The optimal endoscopic surveillance interval for patients with atrophic gastritis is not well-defined and should be decided based on individual risk assessment and shared decision making. A surveillance endoscopy every 3 years should be considered in individuals with advanced atrophic gastritis, defined based on anatomic extent and histologic grade. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: The optimal surveillance interval for individuals with autoimmune gastritis is unclear. Interval endoscopic surveillance should be considered based on individualized assessment and shared decision making. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Providers should recognize pernicious anemia as a late-stage manifestation of autoimmune gastritis that is characterized by vitamin B-12 deficiency and macrocytic anemia. Patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia who have not had a recent endoscopy should undergo endoscopy with topographical biopsies to confirm corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis for risk stratification and to rule out prevalent gastric neoplasia, including neuroendocrine tumors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Individuals with autoimmune gastritis should be screened for type 1 gastric neuroendocrine tumors with upper endoscopy. Small neuroendocrine tumors should be removed endoscopically, followed by surveillance endoscopy every 1–2 years, depending on the burden of neuroendocrine tumors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Providers should evaluate for iron and vitamin B-12 deficiencies in patients with atrophic gastritis irrespective of etiology, especially if corpus-predominant. Likewise, in patients with unexplained iron or vitamin B-12 deficiency, atrophic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic evaluation pursued. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In patients with autoimmune gastritis, providers should recognize that concomitant autoimmune disorders, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, are common. Screening for autoimmune thyroid disease should be performed.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^115YAUbr]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

H. pylori is a major human pathogen that causes chronic and progressive gastric mucosal damage and is aetiologically related to peptic ulcer, gastric cancer and gastric atrophy. It is also closely associated with gastric MALT lymphoma, dyspepsia, hyperplastic gastric polyps and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. H. pylori -positive individuals are also the major reservoir for transmission of the infection.

The decision to eradicate a chronic infection in a society should be based on quantitative data regarding the outcome of untreated infections. H. pylori causes a chronic infection, similar, for example, to asymptomatic syphilis or tuberculosis, and the final outcome for any individual cannot be predicted. H. pylori infection differs from many other chronic infectious diseases because it is always transmissible, thus putting others at risk. Because the gastric damage is progressive, the lack of an obvious clinical manifestation at diagnosis has no predictive value for life-time risk to an individual patient, their family or to the community. Benefits of H. pylori eradication for an individual depend in part on the degree and extent of damage that has already occurred and the reversibility of that damage. Potential benefits of eradication include stopping the progression of mucosal damage, stabilisation or reduction in risk of developing gastric cancer, resolution of mucosal inflammation, stabilisation or improvement of gastric mucosal function, return of the normal mechanisms governing acid secretion, cure of H. pylori -related PUD, reduction in risk of gastrointestinal complications of NSAID therapy and prevention of future development of H. pylori -related peptic ulcer.

For society, the benefits include reduction of the reservoir of infected individuals capable of transmitting the infection to others, and avoidance of the costs associated with diagnosis, management and outcomes of H. pylori -related diseases that are prevented. Thus, H. pylori -infected patients should be offered eradication therapy unless there are competing considerations such as comorbidities, re-infection rates in their communities, competing health priorities of society and financial cost. It has to be remembered, however, that there are concerns about the negative impact of eradication therapies on human health, such as increase in allergy or obesity and perturbation of microbiota.

CQ18. What is the optimal timing for H. pylori eradication in asymptomatic subjects?

Statement 18

The maximum benefit of H. pylori eradication is obtained if it is done while the mucosal damage is still non-atrophic.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

A wide variety of infectious, inflammatory, and other disorders affect the gastric mucosa in pediatric patients. The most common cause of gastritis in children is Helicobacter pylori infection, which is also responsible for the majority of duodenal ulcers. Acute erosive gastritis is most commonly the result of metabolic stress or drug or corrosive injury. Other major causes of gastritis include celiac disease, allergic disorders, and Crohn's disease. The distinctive clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features of these disorders are discussed.

Conclusion

AIG is an important condition with both benign and malignant complications. Unfortunately, delays in diagnosis are common, given the indolent course and often subtle clinical presentation, if even at all, particularly in the early stages. Accordingly, clinicians should be aware of optimal practices related to diagnosis and management to reduce the likelihood of poor outcomes.

### Pathology of non-infective gastritis [^1158cJVG]. Histopathology (2007). Low credibility.

The discovery of Helicobacter pylori and its intimate role in the development of the most common form of chronic gastritis has elicited a much-needed interest in non-neoplastic gastric pathology. This has been paralleled by an increase in upper endoscopic examinations, which allow recognition of novel patterns and distribution of mucosal injury. Numerous attempts at classification have been made, most based on the acuteness or chronicity of gastric mucosal injury. In this review, we will not offer a new classification but present a detailed description of the major clinicopathological entities, based either on the salient morphological features or the underlying aetiologies, i.e. iatrogenic, autoimmune, vascular or idiopathic.

### Collagenous gastritis: clinical features, histologic correlates and unanswered questions [^113x436o]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Collagenous gastritis (CG) is a rare gastrointestinal disorder characterized by subepithelial collagen deposition and lamina propria inflammation. Despite its first description over four decades ago, the pathogenesis remains unclear, with no standardized pathologic criteria/classification, treatment or established prognosis. A systematic PubMed search identified all English-language case reports, series and observational studies describing CG. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, endoscopic appearance and histologic features were extracted. Of the 133 patients with available demographic data, 101 patients had corresponding histologic information, reflecting the overall rarity and limited characterization of collagenous gastritis in the literature. The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain and chronic anaemia. A subset of patients had concurrent collagenous colitis, collagenous sprue, Helicobacter pylori gastritis or celiac disease. The predominant endoscopic finding was gastric mucosal nodularity, typically diffuse or corpus-predominant. Collagen band thickness ranged widely, with a median of 50.5μm and a maximum of 225μm. Band distribution was most commonly pan-gastric or corpus-predominant. Among the proposed histologic subtypes of CG, the atrophic pattern was most frequently observed and often correlated with isolated gastric involvement and lack of clinical or histologic remission. This review highlights that histologic classification may help guide differential diagnoses and prognosis. Accordingly, we advocate for explicit reporting of these features in pathology reports. Key gaps in pathogenesis, including the roles of environmental and genetic factors, are also reviewed. This review synthesizes current knowledge of CG and underscores the need for further studies to clarify disease mechanisms. Improved histologic classification and exploration of underlying aetiologies may enhance diagnosis, treatment and research in this underrecognized condition.

### Dyspepsia in pregnancy [^11651D4p]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia with or without nausea is common during pregnancy. Known ulcer disease, gastritis, and GERD may improve during pregnancy. Many women have a stoic and long-suffering posture during pregnancy owing to an unrealistic expectation concerning the teratogenicity of commonly used drugs. It is appropriate in medicine to alleviate pain and suffering when possible, and many drugs can be used safely and effectively to control upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms. When symptoms are persistent into the late second trimester, refractory to pharmacologic treatment, or severe, H. pylori infection, complications of ulcer disease, and underlying cancer should be suspected and sequentially ruled out. More timely treatment and work-up of nonobstetric disease during pregnancy is expected to lower perinatal complications.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) surveillance intervals — The optimal surveillance strategy for individuals with AIG is unclear; current European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines advocate surveillance endoscopy at 3–5 years in patients with AIG, and the development of upper gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with AIG should prompt diagnostic endoscopy.

### Postgastrectomy syndromes and nutritional considerations following gastric surgery [^116CrG3B]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Postgastrectomy syndromes result from altered form and function of the stomach. Gastrectomy disrupts reservoir capacity, mechanical digestion and gastric emptying. Early recognition of symptoms with prompt evaluation and treatment is essential. Many syndromes resolve with minimal intervention or dietary modifications. Re-operation is not common but often warranted for afferent and efferent loop syndromes and bile reflux gastritis. Preoperative nutritional assessment and treatment of common vitamin and mineral deficiencies after gastrectomy can reduce the incidence of chronic complications. An integrated team approach to risk assessment, patient education, and postoperative management is critical to optimal care of patients with gastric cancer.

### REsolution of symptoms afTer oesophago-gastric cancer REsection Delphi (RESTOREd)-standardizing the definition, investigation and management of gastrointestinal symptoms and conditions after surgery [^113nx2vn]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Oesophago-gastric cancer surgery negatively affects quality of life with a high postoperative symptom burden. Several conditions that may be diagnosed and treated after surgery are recognised. However, consensus regarding their definition and management is lacking. This study aimed to develop consensus regarding the definition, investigation and management of the common symptoms and conditions, and triggers to consider disease recurrence, as a foundation for improving management and quality of life in these patients.

Method

Modified two-round Delphi consensus study of a multidisciplinary expert panel.

Results

Eighty-six of 127 (67.7%) and 77 of 93 (82.8%) responses were received in rounds 1 and 2. Consensus was achieved in defining 26 symptoms. For 10 conditions (anastomotic stricture, acid reflux, non-acid reflux, biliary gastritis, delayed gastric emptying, dumping syndrome, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, bile acid diarrhoea, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and carbohydrate malabsorption), definitions, diagnostic criteria, first- and second-line investigation and first-line treatments were agreed. Consensus was not reached for third-line investigation of some conditions, or for second-, third- or fourth-line treatments for others. Twelve of 14 (85.7%) symptoms were agreed as triggers to consider cancer recurrence, during the early (< 1 year) and late (> 1 year) postoperative periods.

Conclusion

Expert consensus regarding symptoms, conditions and triggers to consider investigation for recurrence after oesophago-gastric cancer surgery was achieved. This may allow standardization and timely diagnosis and treatment of postoperative conditions, reducing variation in care and optimizing patients' quality of life.

CONSENSUS STATEMENT

Section 1. Classification of gastritis in relation to ICD-11

CQ1. Is the current ICD-10 classification for gastritis appropriate?

Statement 1

The current ICD-10 classification for gastritis is obsolete in view of the discovery of H. pylori.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 100%

Comment

The ICD-10 classification of gastritis was formulated in 1989 and is still in effect in most countries. At the time of formulation, the ICD-10 classification of gastritis and duodenitis (K29) was rudimentary as it was based on macroscopic and histomorphological criteria; the only aetiological factor assigned was alcohol(box 1). The histological classification of gastritis considered mainly aspects of atrophy and autoimmunity.

The discovery of H. pylori had not been taken into account, possibly because even though release came after the discovery of Campylobacter pylori (H. pylori), the role of H. pylori in disease was still controversial. The recognition of H. pylori infection as the primary cause of chronic gastritis proved to be a breakthrough that reopened the chapter on gastritis and its role in disease. At present, no classification of gastritis would be complete without including H. pylori as the aetiological cause.

CQ2. Is the proposed ICD-11 classification for gastritis appropriate?

Statement 2

The newly proposed classification of gastritis in the ICD11 β version is an improvement because it is based on aetiological factors.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: moderate

Consensus level: 100%

### Increasing rates of diagnosis, substantial Co-occurrence, and variable treatment patterns of eosinophilic gastritis, gastroenteritis, and colitis based on 10-year data across a multicenter consortium [^1154wDMC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The literature related to eosinophilic gastritis (EG), gastroenteritis (EGE), and colitis (EC) is limited. We aimed to characterize rates of diagnosis, clinical features, and initial treatments for patients with EG, EGE, and EC.

Methods

In this retrospective study, data were collected from 6 centers in the Consortium of Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Researchers from 2005 to 2016. We analyzed demographics, time trends in diagnosis, medical history, presenting symptoms, disease overlap, and initial treatment patterns/responses.

Results

Of 373 subjects (317 children and 56 adults), 38% had EG, 33% EGE, and 29% EC. Rates of diagnosis of all diseases increased over time. There was no male predominance, and the majority of subjects had atopy. Presenting symptoms were similar between diseases with nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain, the most common. One hundred fifty-four subjects (41%) had eosinophilic inflammation outside of their primary disease location with the esophagus the second most common gastrointestinal (GI) segment involved. Multisite inflammation was more common in children than in adults (68% vs 37%; P < 0.001). Initial treatment patterns varied highly between centers. One hundred-nine subjects (29%) had follow-up within 6 months, and the majority had clinical, endoscopic, and histologic improvements.

Conclusions

In this cohort, EG, EGE, and EC were diagnosed more frequently over time, and inflammation of GI segments outside the primary disease site co-occurrence of atopy was common with a lack of male predominance. Symptoms were similar between diseases, and initial treatment strategies were highly variable. Future investigation should assess the cause of the increased prevalence of eosinophilic GI disorders and prospectively assess outcomes to establish treatment algorithms.

### Pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori infection [^112FL3CM]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infects over half of the world population. Infection with the bacterium causes gastritis and peptic ulcer disease and is associated with the development of gastric cancers. However, only a small proportion of individuals develop these complications of infection. Therefore, identification of both host and bacterial factors that mediate disease is an intense area of current research interest. This review highlights recent advances in understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease pathophysiology following infection with H. pylori.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on management of gastric intestinal metaplasia [^113bNiFp]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrophic gastritis:

- **Definition**: Atrophic gastritis is defined as a chronic inflammation leading to the loss of gastric glands, which can occur with or without metaplasia.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of atrophic gastritis involves an immune response directed towards the parietal cells and intrinsic factor of the gastric body and fundus. This leads to hypochlorhydria, hypergastrinemia, and inadequate production of the intrinsic factor, which in turn results in the reduction of essential substances like hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of atrophic gastritis worldwide is estimated at 25%, and the risk is 2.4 times higher in H. pylori-positive individuals.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for atrophic gastritis include H. pylori infection, autoimmune disorders, and long-term use of PPIs. It is also frequently found in association with other autoimmune diseases, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and T1DM.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, atrophic gastritis can be asymptomatic or present with vague gastrointestinal symptoms. Complications such as pernicious anemia or gastric cancer can occur due to the condition's impact on the stomach's secretion of essential substances.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of atrophic gastritis is influenced by the extent and severity of gland loss and the underlying cause. It can progress to gastric cancer, especially in patients with advanced stages of gastritis.

### Rare occurrence of immunotherapy-related gastritis and duodenitis in a single tertiary medical center: a diagnostic challenge [^113rYxCY]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer treatment. While generally well-tolerated, some immune-related adverse events (ir-AEs) can impact patient care, highlighting the need for accurate diagnosis. Immunotherapy-related gastritis and duodenitis (ir-GD) are two rare ir-AEs. Due to their low incidence and non-specific symptoms, standardized diagnostic criteria and evidence-based treatment guidelines are lacking.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) while receiving ICI. Our diagnostic criteria for ir-GD required at least two of three gastritis or duodenitis (GD) criteria (symptoms, EGD findings, or microscopic findings) along with at least one ICI-related criterion. Patients with ir-GD were compared to those without ir-GD.

Results

Of 2,553 patients treated with ICI between 2017 and 2023, 62 (2.4%) underwent EGD, of whom nine (0.4%) met the ir-GD diagnostic criteria. Nine other patients (0.4%) had GD unrelated to ICI. Notably, three of the nine patients (33%) with ir-GD had pre-existing inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions, compared to two of 53 patients (4%) in the non-ir-GD cohort (P = 0.019). Patients with ir-GD were significantly more symptomatic (100% vs 58%, P = 0.009). However, no single symptom was specific to ir-GD. While eight of nine (89%) patients with ir-GD were treated with proton pump inhibitors, only three (33%) required corticosteroids. Symptom resolution occurred in all patients, and three patients successfully underwent re-challenge.

Conclusion

ir-GD is a rare ir-AE that can be challenging to distinguish from GD caused by other etiologies. Once diagnosed, clinicians may consider non-steroidal treatment approaches in mild cases and, in selected cases, even ICI re-challenge.

### Gastritis: the clinico-pathological spectrum [^114Gekjz]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

The inflammatory spectrum of gastric diseases includes different clinico-pathological entities, the etiology of which was recently established in the international Kyoto classification. A diagnosis of gastritis combines the information resulting form the gross examination (endoscopy) and histology (microscopy). It is important to consider the anatomical/functional heterogeneity of the gastric mucosa when obtaining representative mucosal biopsy samples. Gastritis includes self-limiting and non-self-limiting (long-standing) inflammatory diseases, and the latter are epidemiologically, biologically and clinically linked to the onset of gastric cancer (i.e. "inflammation-associated cancer"). Different biological models of inflammation-associated gastric oncogenesis have been proposed. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) gastritis is the most prevalent worldwide, and H. pylori is classified as a first-class carcinogen. On these bases, eradicating H. pylori is mandatory for the primary prevention of gastric cancer. Non-self-limiting gastritis may also be triggered by the immune-mediated destruction of gastric parietal cells, resulting in autoimmune gastritis. In both H. pylori-related and autoimmune gastritis, the non-self-limiting inflammation results in atrophy of the gastric mucosa, which is the main factor promoting gastric cancer. Long-term follow-up studies consistently demonstrate the prognostic impact of the histological staging of gastritis in gastric cancer secondary prevention strategies.

### Gastric cancer consensus conference recommends Helicobacter pylori screening and treatment in asymptomatic persons from high-risk populations to prevent gastric cancer [^1125KS4o]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Gastric adenocarcinoma remains a common cause of death worldwide, and there is convincing evidence that this cancer is causally linked to Helicobacter pylori. The first Asian-Pacific Gastric Cancer Consensus brought together leading authorities in the field including the authors, and systematically reviewed all of the available evidence for the role of H. pylori, diet and other risk factors in this malignancy. The consensus conference boldly recommended population-based screening and treatment for H. pylori in particularly high-risk population settings. The evidence for these recommendations is summarized in this report, and the global and U.S. implications are considered.

### Primer: histopathology for the clinician – how to interpret biopsy information for gastritis [^111WgsX7]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Gastroenterologists can be frustrated, at times, by surgical pathology reports of gastritis that either do not match what was seen endoscopically, or do not indicate the presence of a specific disease. This might be because of one or more factors. First, it has been well established that the correlation between the endoscopic diagnosis of gastritis and histologic gastritis is poor. Second, there are a limited number of well-known histologic gastritides that yield specific diagnoses. Reports that are purely descriptive are, therefore, common, and might require discussion between endoscopist and pathologist.

### Ulcer and gastritis [^114w3tNr]. Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Recent progress in the area of ulcer and gastritis is still dominated by findings and reports on Helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which in turn are the two major causes of peptic ulcers. Although the prevalence of H. pylori is declining in most developed countries, it is still contributing to a significant proportion of peptic ulcers globally. The interrelationship of H. pylori gastritis in patients with gastroesophageal reflux has become more apparent. H. pylori-induced gastric body gastritis is associated with reduced acid production, and thus with reduced reflux and esophagitis. The controversies regarding the interactions between H. pylori and NSAIDs have still not been settled. With the availability of the new COX-2-specific inhibitors, the current scenario of NSAID-related gastroduodenal complications will certainly change. Short-term usage of these agents has significantly reduced the incidence of endoscopic ulcers, but the benefits in terms of clinical outcomes, such as bleeding or perforation, remain to be determined. This review summarizes the recent literature on peptic ulcer and gastritis.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^111RGxts]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

The updated Sydney System has been globally implemented into clinical practice and requires proper assessment of all the relevant characteristics of H. pylori gastritis including atrophy and intestinal metaplasia at different gastric subsites. Categorising gastritis is clinically relevant because the 'phenotype' of H. pylori gastritis determines the risk of progression to gastroduodenal complications.

Severity and extent of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are well established as indicators of the increased risk for developing gastric cancer. Similarly, severe H. pylori -induced corpus gastritis is associated with an increased risk for gastric cancer. New staging systems for the characterisation of gastritis have been introduced to assess the gastric cancer risk. They are used in clinical practice and are either based on the severity of atrophy in various gastric subsites (OLGA)or on intestinal metaplasia (OLGIM). Both systems, discussed further in section 3, are reported to have a positive impact on patient management.

CQ5. How should we classify gastric erosions in the context of chronic gastritis?

Statement 5

Gastric erosions should be reported separately from gastritis. The natural history and clinical significance of gastroduodenal erosions depend on aetiology and need further clarification.

### Rare occurrence of immunotherapy-related gastritis and duodenitis in a single tertiary medical center: a diagnostic challenge [^111E6nMK]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer treatment. While generally well-tolerated, some immune-related adverse events (ir-AEs) can impact patient care, highlighting the need for accurate diagnosis. Immunotherapy-related gastritis and duodenitis (ir-GD) is a rare ir-AE. Due to its low incidence and nonspecific symptoms, standardized diagnostic criteria and evidence-based treatment guidelines are lacking.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) while receiving ICI. Our diagnostic criteria for ir-GD required at least two of three gastritis or duodenitis (GD) criteria (symptoms, EGD findings, or microscopic findings) along with at least one ICI-related criterion. Patients with ir-GD were compared to those without ir-GD.

Results

Of 2553 patients treated with ICI between 2017 and 2023, 62 (2.4%) underwent EGD, of whom nine (0.4%) met the ir-GD diagnostic criteria. Nine other patients (0.4%) had GD unrelated to ICI. Notably, three of the nine patients (33%) with ir-GD had preexisting inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions, compared to two of 53 patients (4%) in the non-ir-GD cohort (P = 0.019). Patients with ir-GD were significantly more symptomatic (100% vs 58%, P = 0.009). However, no single symptom was specific to ir-GD. While eight of nine (89%) patients with ir-GD were treated with proton pump inhibitors, only three (33%) required corticosteroids. Symptom resolution occurred in all patients, and three patients successfully underwent rechallenge.

Conclusion

ir-GD is a rare ir-AE that can be challenging to distinguish from GD caused by other etiologies. Once diagnosed, clinicians may consider nonsteroidal treatment approaches in mild cases and, in selected cases, even ICI rechallenge.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^115vqjmX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations

Symptoms

AIG is most often asymptomatic. When present, symptoms are usually nonspecific with patients most commonly reporting dyspepsia, especially post-prandial distress. – One retrospective cohort analysis of 379 consecutive patients with AIG whose symptoms were scored using the Rome IV criteria found that 56.7% had GI symptoms, with dyspepsia being the most common. On multivariable analysis, younger age, and non-smoking status were more commonly associated with dyspepsia. Other cohort studies have demonstrated similar associations between younger age and dyspepsia. Another study of 41 patients with AIG who underwent pH impedance suggested that acid reflux rarely occurred and is thus likely not a common mechanism underlying symptoms in patients with AIG. Notably, though, patients with AIG are frequently treated with anti-acid therapy, which is likely to only worsen hypochlorhydria/achlorhydria.

Extra-gastrointestinal symptoms include a number of other organ systems (Figure 3). Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to subacute combined degeneration, a peripheral neuropathy and myelopathy of the posterior and lateral columns that can be irreversible if treatment is delayed. In severe cases, this can also cause optic neuropathy and encephalopathy. One retrospective study of 65 patients with both neuropathy and vitamin B12 deficiency, reported that low serum PG-1 levels (PG 1 < 70 ng/mL) and serum PG 1:2 ratios (< 3.0) correlated both with more severe anemia and more severe neurologic symptoms. Lower PG-1 levels (22.4 ng/mL or less) was a more specific measure. AIG may also be associated with miscarriage and infertility related to vitamin B12 deficiency. Infertility among patients with AIG may also be a manifestation of hypothyroidism or other autoimmune diseases commonly associated with AIG; practitioners should take care to replete B12 and investigate other potential etiologies.

### Gastritis: the histology report [^113Ebnmh]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Gastritis is defined as inflammation of the gastric mucosa. In histological terms, it is distinguishable into two main categories, i.e. non-atrophic and atrophic. In the gastric mucosa, atrophy is defined as the loss of appropriate glands. There are several etiological types of gastritis, their different etiology being related to different clinical manifestations and pathological features. Atrophic gastritis (resulting mainly from long-standing Helicobacter pylori infection) is a major risk factor for the onset of (intestinal type) gastric cancer. The extent and site of the atrophic changes correlate significantly with the cancer risk. The current format for histology reporting in cases of gastritis fails to establish an immediate link between gastritis phenotype and risk of malignancy. Building on current knowledge of the biology of gastritis, an international group of pathologists [Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment (OLGA)] has proposed a system for reporting gastritis in terms of its stage (the OLGA Staging System): this system places the histological phenotypes of gastritis on a scale of progressively increasing gastric cancer risk, from the lowest (Stage 0) to the highest (Stage IV). The aim of this tutorial is to provide unequivocal information on how to standardize histology reports on gastritis in diagnostic practice.

### Survey of general practitioners' knowledge about Helicobacter pylori infection [^112G4yTW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori, occurring throughout the world and causing gastroduodenal diseases, is one of the most common chronic bacterial agents in humans. Although the number of peptic ulcers unrelated to H. pylori is increasing, most ulcers are related to H. pylori infection. For most of the patients with gastrointestinal symptoms apply to general practitioners (GPs), non-invasive "test and treat" policies for H. pylori infection have been promoted in order to improve early detection and treatment of ulcers in dyspeptic patients.

The successful isolation of H. pylori infection in patients with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in 1983 has fundamentally changed concept of the etiologic, pathogenesis and management of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) diseases. This has led to an explosion of H. pylori related information and the development and publication of international, regional and national guidelines. Subsequently, numerous educational initiatives have been undertaken to educate health care professionals regarding the appropriate diagnosis and management of this infection. However, results from several recent surveys conducted in different countries have revealed that significant confusion exists and discrepancies are present in the thinking among GPs with respect to the understanding of the relationship between H. pylori infection and the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of UGI diseases. The major uncertainties surround the management of patients with dyspepsia where the GPs needs to make a decision whether to test for H. pylori infection and treat if positive, and when to refer patients to a specialist.

It is thought that too many patients with dyspeptic symptoms apply to GPs in Turkey. This study was performed a survey of GPs' to assess their knowledge and practices pertaining to H. pylori infection.

### Rare occurrence of immunotherapy-related gastritis and duodenitis in a single tertiary medical center: a diagnostic challenge [^114xQ3Rs]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment across a wide range of malignancies, significantly prolonging patient survival. Its mechanism of action involves disrupting immune tolerance toward cancer cells by targeting neo antigens arising from tumor-specific mutations. However, this enhanced immune activation can also disrupt tolerance to self-antigens and lead to immune-related adverse events (ir-AEs).

Gastritis and/or duodenitis (GD), including ulcer-forming GD, is a common disorder in the general population with a prevalence of approximately 0.5%. Endoscopic appearance can vary, ranging from patchy erythema in mild cases to mucosal erosions or ulcerations in more severe cases. Discordance between endoscopic findings and histology is common, occurring in more than one-third of cases. Helicobacter pylori (HP) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the primary risk factors for GD in the general population. In cancer patients, additional risk factors, including radiation, chemotherapy, and corticosteroid treatment, can also damage the mucosa.

The occurrence of immune-related gastritis or duodenitis (ir-GD) in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has been reported to range from 0.8% to 1.4%. The current understanding of ir-GD is based on a few case series and retrospective studies that did not systematically exclude other common etiologies leading to GD in cancer patients. The present study aims to explore the incidence and management of this rare toxicity and provide a practical approach to differentiate between ir-GD and non-treatment-related GD in patients receiving ICI.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^1135wk2G]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnostic assessment of gastritis has been advanced by the recent introduction of high-resolution endoscopy with image-enhanced modalities, and magnification is now used routinely in major hospitals in Japan. This endoscopic technology allows the identification of mucosal changes (for targeted biopsies) more precisely, leading to more accurate evaluation of cancer risks such as preneoplastic changes. Wider use of this new endoscopic system outside Japan may be limited at present.

The Kyoto consensus meeting focused attention on gastritis in all its clinical expression and dealt with four main topics: classification of gastritis in relation to ongoing ICD revision, FD and H. pylori infection, diagnosis of gastritis and the management of gastritis. The methodology of the meeting adopted all modern means for reaching consensus and included an internet-based Delphi method with full access to published data in a completely 'neutral' environment.

In summary, The Kyoto meeting proposed an aetiology-based classification for gastritis and concluded that H. pylori gastritis is an infectious disease. As such, H. pylori gastritis requires treatment whether or not it is associated with symptoms because it represents a condition that may evolve towards serious complications, including peptic ulcer and gastric neoplasia.

Consensus was reached on the existence of a separate category of patients with dyspeptic symptoms that are due to H. pylori gastritis. In these patients, eradication therapy is the recommended first-line treatment. Because of the diagnostic problems related to 'gastritis', these patients should be labelled as having H. pylori -associated dyspepsia and are identified by sustained dyspeptic symptom relief after eradication.

For the diagnosis of gastritis, it was agreed that risk stratification systems such as OLGA and OLGIM are useful as are the serological markers. In view of recent technological advancements, image-enhanced endoscopy should be encouraged for identifying mucosal changes which carry a high risk of developing into gastric neoplasia. Finally, it was recommended that early eradication therapy, ideally before preneoplastic changes occur, should be undertaken. However, the feasibility of implementing this strategy should be regionally tailored. As eradication therapy does not guarantee elimination of the risk of gastric cancer, follow-up should be considered for patients who have preneoplastic conditions.

Although there are still many remaining areas to be discussed, we believe the outcome of the Kyoto consensus meeting presented in this report will improve patient care and will provide a cornerstone for further refinement and research in the area of gastritis.

### Chronic gastritis in China: a national multi-center survey [^112VWHmA]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic gastritis, a chronic inflammatory condition of gastric mucosa, is considered as one of the most common findings at endoscopy in the general population of Eastern countries. In addition, Helicobacter pylori induced atrophic gastritis is epidemiologically associated with the occurrence of gastric cancer. It is estimated the patients with premalignant gastric lesions carry a significant risk of gastric cancer within 10 years of follow-up, and the annual incidence of gastric cancer was 0.1% for patients with atrophic gastritis within 5 years after diagnosis. Though there seems to be a worldwide decline in the overall incidence of gastric cancer, the public health burden of gastric cancer remains significant, and it is still the fourth in cancer incidence and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.

China is a country with a very high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric cancer, to improve the endoscopic diagnostic accuracy of chronic gastritis and standardize the diagnosis and treatment procedures of chronic gastritis, the Second Chinese National Consensus Meeting on Chronic Gastritis was held on 14th – 16th September 2006 in Shanghai, after anonymous vote according to Delphi process, the second national Chinese consensus on chronic gastritis was released. However, the current status of diagnosis and treatment of chronic gastritis in China is unclear after the release of national consensus; for example, for some endoscopists, it is still a common practice to make the diagnosis of chronic atrophic gastritis just by mucosal appearance without biopsy and pathologic evidence. On the other hand, the treatment of chronic gastritis vastly varies among clinicians, and some clinicians empirically prescribe proton pump inhibitor (PPI), while some clinicians use mucosal protecting agents, occasionally natural supplements or herbal remedies are provided. Meanwhile, it remains controversial if non-ulcer patients with Helicobacter pylori infection shall receive eradication therapy. To address these issues, a nationwide multi-center survey was conducted to investigate the clinical, endoscopic features and treatment of chronic gastritis in Chinese patients. In addition, we aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic appearance for pathologic atrophic gastritis and erosive gastritis.

### Autoimmune gastritis [^115vZGKK]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context —

Autoimmune gastritis (AG) is a corpus-restricted chronic atrophic gastritis associated with intrinsic factor deficiency, either with or without pernicious anemia. Autoimmune gastritis is a microscopic disease because patients present with no or vague symptoms, and clinicians rarely find endoscopic changes. Autoimmune gastritis only becomes a clinical disease when pathologists diagnose it in gastric biopsies performed for a variety of clinical indications. Unfamiliarity with this disease can result in misdiagnosis of patients, and thus inadequate patient management.

Objective —

To review the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnoses, sequelae, and surveillance recommendations for AG.

Data Sources —

The sources of the study include a review of the pertinent literature for AG.

Conclusions —

Autoimmune gastritis is an important disease characterized by a loss of oxyntic mucosa and presence of metaplastic epithelium and enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia. Awareness and proper diagnosis are critical to prevent mismanagement of patients.

### Gastric biopsies with prominent eosinophils: clinicopathologic features and response to therapy [^112iCdHX]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Eosinophilic gastritis (EoG) is part of a group of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease (EGID) of unknown aetiology characterized by elevated gastrointestinal eosinophils and variable gastrointestinal symptoms. There is a frequent association with autoimmune and allergic conditions such as food allergies, asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. Peripheral eosinophilia is observed in 23%–86% of patients, and many individuals may present with elevated serum IgE levels. Rare cases have been reported in conjunction with familial Mediterranean fever.

Non‐EoE Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Diseases (EGID) currently lack established diagnostic guidelines and patients often face long delays before diagnosis. In 2011, Lewin et al. proposed the threshold of 38 eosinophils/mm 2 and the term 'histological eosinophilic gastritis' for gastric biopsies with ≥ 30 eosinophils per high power field (HPF), in at least five HPFs in the absence of known associated causes of eosinophilia. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted this threshold for the diagnosis of EoG; however, the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis (EoG) is complicated by a lack of standardized range for normal eosinophil counts in the gastric mucosa, with studies reporting averages between 4 and 11 eosinophils per high‐power field (HPF). Moreover, the optimal number of biopsies and the eosinophil cut‐off required for diagnosis are unclear.

The diagnosis of EoG is also complicated by the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and response to a variety of therapeutic modalities. Disease symptoms and presentation are heterogeneous, and clinical presentation may vary with the depth of involvement. While some patients experience spontaneous remission, others exhibit a relapsing course that necessitates long‐term maintenance therapy. Given the putative role of T helper (Th)2 immunity, atopy and food allergy, dietary‐based therapy and immunomodulation with corticosteroids are common treatment options. Other therapeutic options include other anti‐allergy drugs such as mast cell stabilizers or leukotriene receptor antagonists. Clinical trials are currently investigating the role of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders including EoG. In some publications, steroid therapy appears to be the most successful treatment modality with symptomatic improvement in 55%–90% of patients. While EoG has been previously reported to be highly responsive to dietary restriction in paediatric populations, other studies have reported that avoidance of specific food allergens did not resolve symptoms in EGID.

We examined the clinical presentation, pathologic characteristics and natural history of patients that satisfied the proposed definition of 'histologic eosinophilic gastritis'as well as cases that showed 'prominent eosinophils' without qualifying for 'histologic eosinophilic gastritis'.

### Comparison of gastrointestinal symptoms and findings in renal replacement therapy modalities [^115ELzJ3]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As a result; GIS symptoms and signs are quite common in patients with CKD. The majority of patients have more than one gastrointestinal symptom. In addition, when evaluated in terms of frequency, some of the GI symptoms and diseases vary according to the renal replacement therapy method, while some do not. Further studies are needed to evaluate physiopathological changes in the gastrointestinal system in CKD, the effects of these changes on GIS symptoms and signs, and the effects of symptoms and diseases on quality of life, morbidity and mortality.

Main Points:
Gastrointestinal complaints and findings are common in CKD patients
Dyspepsia, gastritis, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux findings, hemorrhoids and constipation are the findings often seen in CKD.
Knowing the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms, signs and diseases that may occur in CKD patients is valuable for early diagnosis and treatment of GIS disorders.
Knowing the gastrointestinal symptoms, signs and diseases that may vary according to the treatment modality in CKD patients may help in the choice of renal replacement therapy model.

### Common occurrence of atrophic gastritis in an ageing non-hospitalised population: an autopsy study [^116w6JHS]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection usually induces acute gastritis with an active inflammation that lasts a few weeks and subsequent chronic inflammation which may become lifelong. Not all patients with H. pylori infections develop chronic gastritis. It is estimated that 20% of acute cases of H. pylori gastritis are self-limiting, most likely due to a combination of bacterial strain diversity, host genetics and environmental factors. Helicobacter pylori infection tends to appear first in the antrum, developing antrum-predominant chronic gastritis, then spread to the corpus, leading to pan-gastritis. During the acute phase, a histological evaluation of gastric mucosa shows an infiltration of neutrophils. When the infection becomes persistent, neutrophils and other polymorphonuclear leukocytes are gradually replaced by mononuclear inflammatory cells. This stage is referred to as chronic gastritis. As the infection progresses, mononuclear cells form organised lymphoid follicles and the inflammation usually becomes less intense. Atrophic gastritis represents the end stage of this inflammatory sequence, with the process from chronic gastritis to chronic gastritis with atrophic changes (atrophic gastritis) advancing gradually over decades, usually while the patient remains asymptomatic. Heartburn and regurgitation are present in ~24% and 12% of the patients, respectively.

### Collagenous gastritis: clinical features, histologic correlates and unanswered questions [^116ZkSeX]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Collagenous gastritis (CG) is a rare disorder characterized by prominent subepithelial collagen deposition, usually exceeding 10 μm, in association with inflammatory changes in the gastric mucosa. It was first described in 1989, and its prevalence is estimated to be 13 per 100,000 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies.CG is considered part of the broader spectrum of collagenous gastroenteropathies, which includes conditions like collagenous sprue and collagenous colitis. The literature typically categorizes CG into paediatric and adult forms based on the age of presentation. Despite its initial description over four decades ago, the pathogenesis of CG remains incompletely understood. Standardized pathological criteria, classification systems and evidence‐based treatment guidelines are lacking, and the overall prognosis remains uncertain. This comprehensive review aims to provide a clearer understanding of CG by synthesizing the available clinical and pathological data, while also highlighting the existing knowledge gaps in the literature.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for atrophic gastritis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic endoscopy, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend to when endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis are present, providers should assess the extent endoscopically. Providers should obtain biopsies from the suspected atrophic/metaplastic areas for histopathological confirmation and risk stratification; at a minimum, biopsies from the body and antrum/incisura should be obtained and placed in separately labeled jars. Targeted biopsies should additionally be obtained from any other mucosal abnormalities.

Medical management

There is limited guidance on the management of non-neoplastic complications of AIG/PA, including frequency of interval surveillance and monitoring for vitamin B12 deficiency and iron deficiency. Importantly, vitamin B12 deficiency can occur in the absence of anemia and if not addressed can lead to irreversible neurologic deficits. Parenteral rather than oral supplementation is preferred, especially if neurologic symptoms are present. Appropriate supplementation of vitamin B12 and iron is important, along with workup of other etiologies for these not uncommon deficiencies based on the clinical scenario.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma [^115ZQdq3]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Executive summary

Gastric adenocarcinoma continues to be a frequent cause of death in the world and is the 16th most common cancer in the UK. The most common stages in the progression to gastric adenocarcinoma are gastric atrophy (GA) and gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM), which are collectively known as chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). These conditions are principally caused by Helicobacter pylori infection and less commonly by autoimmune gastritis. The key to having a significant impact on the prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma and its economic burden is to accurately identify individuals at greatest risk and intervene with recognised efficacious treatments, including endoscopic resection, before cancer is established. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) endoscopy committee agreed to create a guideline to provide statements and recommendations on the prevalence, risks, diagnosis, treatment, surveillance and screening of gastric premalignant and early gastric malignant lesions. The principal patient group are those found to have GA, GIM, gastric epithelial dysplasia or early gastric adenocarcinoma limited to the mucosal or superficial submucosal layers. The target users include gastroenterologists, GI surgeons, pathologists, endoscopists and general practitioners. We followed the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument, and the quality of the evidence was assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.

### Chronic gastritis in China: a national multi-center survey [^112SiRub]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic gastritis is one of the most common findings at upper endoscopy in the general population, and chronic atrophic gastritis is epidemiologically associated with the occurrence of gastric cancer. However, the current status of diagnosis and treatment of chronic gastritis in China is unclear.

Methods

A multi-center national study was performed; all patients who underwent diagnostic upper endoscopy for evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms from 33 centers were enrolled. Data including sex, age, symptoms and endoscopic findings were prospectively recorded.

Results

Totally 8892 patients were included. At endoscopy, 4389, 3760 and 1573 patients were diagnosed to have superficial gastritis, erosive gastritis, and atrophic gastritis, respectively. After pathologic examination, it is found that atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia were prevalent, which accounted for 25.8%, 23.6% and 7.3% of this patient population. Endoscopic features were useful for predicting pathologic atrophy (PLR = 4.78), but it was not useful for predicting erosive gastritis. Mucosal-protective agents and PPI were most commonly used medications for chronic gastritis.

Conclusions

The present study suggests non-atrophic gastritis is the most common endoscopic finding in Chinese patients with upper GI symptoms. Precancerous lesions, including atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia are prevalent in Chinese patients with chronic gastritis, and endoscopic features are useful for predicting pathologic atrophy.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^112cNTXQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastric premalignant conditions (GPMC) are common and include atrophic gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and certain gastric epithelial polyps. GPMC have an increased risk of progression to gastric adenocarcinoma. Gastric cancer (GC) in the United States represents an important cancer disparity because incidence rates are 2- to 13-fold greater in non-White individuals, particularly early-generation immigrants from regions of high GC incidence. The US 5-year survival rate for GC is 36%, which falls short of global standards and is driven by the fact that only a small percentage of GC in the US is diagnosed in the early, curable stage. This document represents the first iteration of American College of Gastroenterology guidelines on this topic and encompasses endoscopic surveillance for high-risk patients with GPMC, the performance of high-quality endoscopy and image-enhanced endoscopy for diagnosis and surveillance, GPMC histology criteria and reporting, endoscopic treatment of dysplasia, the role of Helicobacter pylori eradication, general risk reduction measures, and the management of autoimmune gastritis and gastric epithelial polyps. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on upper endoscopic screening for GC/GPMC detection in US populations deemed high-risk for GC. Surveillance endoscopy is recommended for individuals at high risk for GPMC progression, as defined by endoscopic, histologic, and demographic factors, typically every 3 years, but an individualized interval may be warranted. H. pylori testing, treatment, and eradication confirmation are recommended in all individuals with GPMC. Extensive high-quality data from US populations regarding GPMC management are lacking, but continue to accrue, and the quality of evidence for the recommendations presented herein should be interpreted with this dynamic context in mind. The GPMC research and education agendas are broad and include high-quality prospective studies evaluating opportunistic endoscopic screening for GC/GPMC, refined delineation of what constitutes "high-risk" populations, development of novel biomarkers, alignment of best practices, implementation of training programs for improved GPMC/GC detection, and evaluation of the impact of these interventions on GC incidence and mortality in the US.

At the end of the last century, a far-sighted 'working party' held in Sydney, Australia addressed the clinicopathological issues related to gastric inflammatory diseases. A few years later, an international conference held in Houston, Texas, USA critically updated the seminal Sydney classification.

The most relevant topics related to the gastric inflammatory diseases have been addressed by the Real-world Gastritis Initiative (RE.GA. IN.), from disease definitions to the clinical diagnosis and prognosis. This paper reports the conclusions of the RE.GA. IN. consensus process, which culminated in Venice in November 2022 after more than 8months of intense global scientific deliberations. A forum of gastritis scholars from five continents participated in the multidisciplinary RE.GA. IN. consensus. After lively debates on the most controversial aspects of the gastritis spectrum, the RE.GA. IN. Faculty amalgamated complementary knowledge to distil patient-centred, evidence-based statements to assist health professionals in their real-world clinical practice. The sections of this report focus on: the epidemiology of gastritis; Helicobacter pylori as dominant aetiology of environmental gastritis and as the most important determinant of the gastric oncogenetic field; the evolving knowledge on gastric autoimmunity; the clinicopathological relevance of gastric microbiota; the new diagnostic horizons of endoscopy; and the clinical priority of histologically reporting gastritis in terms of staging. The ultimate goal of RE.GA. IN. was and remains the promotion of further improvement in the clinical management of patients with gastritis.

### Chronic gastritis in China: a national multi-center survey [^111m6Vmd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Most importantly, 7.3% of the studied population had dysplasia, though the majority patients (642 out of 652) had mild to moderate precancerous lesion, it has been established that the odds ratios (ORs) of gastric cancer increased from 17.1, for those with baseline diagnoses of superficial intestinal metaplasia, to 29.3, for those with deep intestinal metaplasia or mild dysplasia or intestinal metaplasia with glandular atrophy and neck hyperplasia, to 104.2, for those with moderate or severe dysplasia, as compared with subjects with superficial gastritis or chronic atrophic gastritis at baseline. Therefore, a surveillance program is appropriate for this group of patients, who have the highest chance to progress to cancer.

As for the medical treatment of chronic gastritis, we found in this study, mucosal-protective agents and PPI were the most commonly prescribed medications. It is very interesting to note that there is great difference between Eastern and Western physicians in terms of the management of chronic gastritis, for instance, in Western countries, high acid output is a major etiology of upper GI disorders, so physicians in Western countries prescribe the potent anti-acid secretion drugs such as PPIs for patients. However, though cumulative evidence suggested anti-acids play a major role in the treatment of gastric disorders including peptic ulcers, not all upper GI symptoms can be explained by excessive acid secretion. In particular in Asian countries, glandular atrophy is much more prevalent than that in Western societies, so low acid secretion is very common in these patients. For this reason, gastric mucosal protection is an alternative treatment for these patients. It has been reported mucosal-protective agents have different beneficial effects from PPI, for example, these agents has some biological activities for gastric mucosa, including increasing the blood flow and biosynthesis prostaglandins and the decrease of oxygen radicals. Taken into the complex symptoms of patients with chronic gastritis into consideration, it is quite important to appropriately select medical treatment according to patient's symptoms and pathologic findings.

### Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders [^11563m2m]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGID) are a group of disorders characterized by pathologic eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or colon leading to organ dysfunction and clinical symptoms (J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr; Spergel et al., 52: 300–306, 2011). These disorders include eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), eosinophilic gastritis (EG), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE), eosinophilic enteritis (EE), and eosinophilic colitis (EC). Symptoms are dependent not only on the location (organ) as well as extent (layer invasion of the bowel wall). Common symptoms of EoE include dysphagia and food impaction in adults and heartburn, abdominal pain, and vomiting in children. Common symptoms of the other EGIDs include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, diarrhea, and weight loss. These disorders are considered immune-mediated chronic inflammatory disorders with strong links to food allergen triggers. Treatment strategies focus on either medical or dietary therapy. These options include not only controlling symptoms and bowel inflammation but also on identifying potential food triggers. This chapter will focus on the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of these increasingly recognized disorders.

### Management of Helicobacter pylori infection: guidelines of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology (SIGE) and the Italian Society of Digestive Endoscopy (SIED) [^113nsKRc]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is very common and affects more than one-third of adults in Italy. Helicobacter pylori causes several gastro-duodenal diseases, such as gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric malignancy, and extra-gastric diseases. The eradication of the bacteria is becoming complex to achieve due to increasing antimicrobial resistance. To address clinical questions related to the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, three working groups examined the following topics: (1) non-invasive and invasive diagnostic tests, (2) first-line treatment, and (3) rescue therapies for Helicobacter pylori infection. Recommendations are based on the best available evidence to help physicians manage Helicobacter pylori infection in Italy, and have been endorsed by the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Society of Digestive Endoscopy.

### Common occurrence of atrophic gastritis in an ageing non-hospitalised population: an autopsy study [^113NtQqG]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the guidelines, the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis should be confirmed by means of histopathology The actual prevalence of chronic gastritis and chronic atrophic gastritis in a community-dwelling population remains unclear; however, as the disease is often asymptomatic and the golden standard for diagnosis is a histological evaluation of biopsies from invasive endoscopies. In a meta-analysis of 14 studies covering 18,510 cases, the prevalence of atrophic gastritis in the general population was suggested to be ~16%. There are no data on the prevalence of less advanced forms of chronic gastritis in the general population. However, in a cohort of Finnish outpatients who underwent gastroscopy due to gastrointestinal symptoms, the prevalence of chronic gastritis amounted to as high as 80% among those aged 70+ years and that of atrophic gastritis to 40%. The only non-invasive way to assess the prevalence of atrophic gastritis at a population level is to apply serological assays whose results have not shown good concordance with biopsy studies, generally yielding much lower figures of prevalence. The prevalence of pepsinogen I-defined functional atrophic corpus gastritis was only 5.7% in a study comprising a stratified sample of healthy adults aged 35–64 years from the populations of two small communities in Northern Sweden in 2009. Among the oldest age group of 55–64 years, the prevalence was 8.3%. Similarly, based on serum pepsinogen I and II assays, the prevalence of atrophic gastritis among New Zealanders was 6.7%. In a systematic meta-analysis review, the combination of pepsinogen, gastrin-17 and anti- H. pylori antibodies in serological assays (panel test) seemed to be a reliable non-invasive tool for the diagnosis and exclusion of advanced atrophic gastritis, but it does not help in detecting the preceding stages of the disease. As healthy patients cannot ethically be biopsied, autopsy samples may provide a solution, but to the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous gastritis studies have utilised autopsy series in which the victims had died of reasons unrelated to chronic gastritis.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and age-dependence of the spectrum of chronic gastritis, and especially that of atrophic gastritis and H. pylori infection in an autopsy series most closely representing the general population.

### Collagenous gastritis: clinical features, histologic correlates and unanswered questions [^113rc79R]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

A PubMed literature search was conducted using the term 'collagenous gastritis', limited to English‐language publications. We review and summarize the available literature, including the references listed below and supplemental references not cited in the main text, to evaluate the clinical and histologic characteristics of CG. Clinical data including demographics, presentation and endoscopic and imaging findings are summarized. Histologic features were assessed with a focus on the main diagnostic components: the collagen band and the inflammatory changes in the gastric mucosa. Based on the extracted information, we propose key histologic features to be included in pathology reports and highlight unanswered questions related to the pathogenesis of CG. Ethics approval and/or informed consent were not required for this study. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for atrophic gastritis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic endoscopy, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend to providers should recognize typical endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis, which include pale appearance of gastric mucosa, increased visibility of vasculature due to thinning of the gastric mucosa, and loss of gastric folds, and, if with concomitant intestinal metaplasia, light blue crests and white opaque fields. Because these mucosal changes are often subtle, techniques to optimize evaluation of the gastric mucosa should be performed.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug gastropathy and Helicobacter pylori: the search for an improbable consensus [^113pcRwt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and Helicobacter pylori are known to share a number of pathogenic mechanisms, but there is no evidence to show a significant synergistic action between these two risk factors. Studies to assess possible interactions in the pathogenesis of dyspepsia and upper gastrointestinal mucosal lesions have differed in their endpoints, the definition of dyspepsia, and the regimens used for eradication of H. pylori. However, some conclusions may be drawn from the results of clinical trials. As far as dyspepsia is concerned, an association between NSAID dyspepsia and infection with H. pylori, seems likely, but it is difficult to make sense of the discrepant data that are currently available. On the contrary, neither short- nor long-term NSAID administration presents a definite major risk of gastric and duodenal injury or, above all, of ulcer-related complications (bleeding or perforation) in H. pylori-positive patients. Based on these considerations, what recommendations can be made with regard to H. pylori eradication in patients requiring treatment with NSAIDs? H. pylori and anti-inflammatory drugs are probably independent causes of gastric and duodenal damage. Patients taking NSAIDs who are found to have gastric or duodenal ulcers should, therefore, be tested for the bacterium and specifically treated, because H. pylori and NSAID-induced ulcers may be macroscopically indistinguishable. Whether asymptomatic patients taking NSAIDs should be tested and treated for H. pylori infection is still a matter of debate.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^1158xZLx]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

The categorisation of H. pylori gastritis according to gastritis subsites together with the assessment of gastritis severity allows prediction of an individual's risk of developing severe gastroduodenal complications and, in particular, gastric cancer.

Depending on the gastric subsites involved, gastric function and, in particular, gastric acid secretion may be profoundly affected, resulting in gastric acid hypersecretion, hyposecretion or even achlorhydria.

Subsite characterisation of gastritis is also critically important for identifying those patients who remain at high risk after H. pylori eradication and thus are candidates for regular endoscopic and histological follow-up. Patients with severe atrophic gastritis (with or without intestinal metaplasia) in the corpus or with severe corpus predominant gastritis are those at highest risk for progression to gastric cancer of the intestinal typeand for diffuse-type gastric cancer. In diffuse-type gastric cancer the prevalence of antral atrophic gastritis is almost identical to that seen in the intestinal type but is slightly less with corpus atrophic gastritis than with intestinal type gastric cancer.

CQ4. Is it necessary to categorise gastritis according to histology (severity) and/or endoscopy?

Statement 4

It is advisable to categorise gastritis according to histology, because the risk of development of gastric cancer in H. pylori gastritis varies according to the extent and severity of inflammation and atrophy.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 100%

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^112DcL6D]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a chronic immune-mediated, inflammatory condition that involves the destruction of the gastric oxyntic mucosa through the autoimmune-mediated loss of parietal cells, with replacement by atrophic and metaplastic tissue. Diagnosing AIG is important, given the need for ongoing clinical management and vigilance with respect to downstream complications, the most serious of which is gastric adenocarcinoma. Other clinical consequences include gastric neuroendocrine tumors, consequences related to decreased gastric acid and decreased intrinsic factor due to parietal cell destruction and antibodies against intrinsic factor (e.g. micronutrient deficiencies), as well as concomitant autoimmune disorders. Considering the prevalence of AIG and the potential for severe clinical outcomes, it is important to engage in efforts to reduce practice pattern variability related to diagnosis and management. Accordingly, herein, we review of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation of AIG, including both gastric and extragastric manifestations, and provide an overview of clinical management.

Discussion

Methodological and results approaches

The four case histories in this study are representative of patients with conditions frequently seen in medical practice. Diseases of the gastrointestinal tract account for about 6% of all reported consultations in Sweden. Gastritis, dyspepsia, and unspecified diseases in the ventricle and duodenum (patients 1 and 2) are diagnosed in 1.6% of the population; oesophagitis and reflux (patient 3) in 0.9%; and different ulcers (patient 4) in 0.6%.

The clinicians who participated in this study were not representative of a randomised selection of clinicians in Sweden but rather of a select group with a special interest in patients with symptoms from the gastrointestinal tract. Since their experience with these patients was extensive, they should have been able to develop a treatment policy. One would expect a variation in treatment strategy in this group to be more limited than among a randomised selection of clinicians.

The results underpin existing evidence that variations in medical practice exist. This study presents variations both in treatment strategy and in what information is considered important for making treatment decisions. The histories of patients with diffuse symptoms but no objective findings (patients 1 and 2) gave rise to more extensive variations than did the case histories of patients 3 and 4 where the symptoms were more obviously related to a diagnosis (patient 3) or where more obvious organic changes existed (patient 4). Uncertainty in diagnosis could lead to uncertainty regarding which outcome of alternative interventions is optimal. A meta-analysis that evaluates the most effective treatment in patients with functional dyspepsia recommended the eradication of H. pylori if the treatment is to be effective from the patient's perspective, whereas other randomised, double-blind, controlled studies find that eradication has no beneficial effect. These results were underpinned by the variations observed in this study.

### Autoimmune atrophic gastritis – pathogenesis, pathology and management [^114kxGmb]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis is a chronic progressive inflammatory condition that results in the replacement of the parietal cell mass by atrophic and metaplastic mucosa. A complex interaction of autoantibodies against the parietal cell proton pump and sensitized T cells progressively destroy the parietal cells, inducing hypochlorhydria and then achlorhydria, while autoantibodies against the intrinsic factor impair the absorption of vitamin B₁₂. The resulting cobalamin deficiency manifests with megaloblastic anaemia and neurological and systemic signs and symptoms collectively known as pernicious anaemia. Previously believed to be predominantly a disease of elderly women of Northern European ancestry, autoimmune gastritis has now been recognized in all populations and ethnic groups, but because of the complexity of the diagnosis no reliable prevalence data are available. For similar reasons, as well as the frequent and often unknown overlap with Helicobacter pylori infection, the risk of gastric cancer has not been adequately assessed in these patients. This Review summarizes the epidemiology, pathogenesis and pathological aspects of autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis. We also provide practical advice for the diagnosis and management of patients with this disease.

### Histopathological features of glandular atrophy of the lamina propria of the gastric mucosa during its occurrence and development [^117EFXV4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Inflammation of the gastric mucosa can induce mucosal atrophy, which involves the disappearance and metaplasia of normal glands. The incidence of chronic atrophic gastritis remains unclear. The disease is often not diagnosed at an early stage but in the advanced stage. Chronic atrophic gastritis is considered as a precursory lesion of gastric cancer, and the common causes of this precancerous condition are H.pylori infection and autoimmune gastritis, which lead to low gastric acid, hypergastrinemia, and inadequate secretion of intrinsic factor. What's more, Autoimmune gastritis with Helicobacter pylori infection is a high risk factor for precancerous lesions, while autoimmune gastritis in the absence of H. pylori infection does not represent precancerous lesions. In terms of histopathology, chronic atrophic gastritis is often accompanied by atrophy and inflammation, which is often subsumed under atrophic gastropathy in actual pathological work. In this study, we propose the term gastric mucosal atrophic lesion for this pathology.

### Ulcers and gastritis [^114VDMWq]. Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

This article reviews recently published literature regarding ulcers and gastritis. Although endoscopy is the most useful procedure for diagnosis in the upper gastrointestinal tract, complications do occur, and procedure-related costs are significant. The appropriate indication for endoscopy has recently been debated. Helicobacter pylori is known to be an important pathogen involved in gastric and duodenal inflammation. Peptic ulcer disease and severe gastric mucosal injury are caused by virulent strains, and many reports have focused on CagA. Follow-up studies on surveillance endoscopy in patients with peptic ulcer or gastritis report that patients with atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are at significantly higher risk for gastric cancer. H. pylori eradication sometimes causes gastroduodenal erosion and reflux esophagitis, and the mechanisms involved have been revealed. Proton-pump inhibitors are useful in the treatment of ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), reflux esophagitis, and for preventing rebleeding after endoscopic hemostasis, but the effect of long-term acid suppression on the gastric mucosa is still a matter of debate. H. pylori infection and NSAID intake are both risk factors for peptic ulcer disease, and are important aspects in this field.

### Gastrointestinal beriberi: a forme fruste of Wernicke's encephalopathy? [^114osDaX]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, are very common in patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE). Mild thiamine deficiency may have only gastrointestinal symptoms. We are reporting two patients with thiamine deficiency who predominantly had gastrointestinal symptoms. Case 1: a 38-year-old man had gastrointestinal problems for about 2–3 years. It gradually became severe. The patient came to the neurology outpatient department for his recent-onset vertigo and headache. Clinical examinations fulfilled Caine's criteria of WE. Gastrointestinal symptoms responded dramatically to intravenous thiamine. Case 2: a 21-year-old woman developed drug-induced hepatitis and gastritis. Associated nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain progressively increased over the weeks. The patient responded only to intravenous thiamine administration. We suggest that a suspicion for gastrointestinal beriberi should arise if gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain) are refractory to the usual therapies.

### Key points from the revised maastricht consensus report: the impact on general practice [^115d831M]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The Maastricht 2 Consensus Report features evidence-based recommendations for the management of Helicobacter pylori infection. Strongly recommended indications for H. pylori eradication include duodenal and gastric ulcer, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, atrophic gastritis, post gastric cancer resection, first-degree relation to gastric cancer patients, and patient's wishes. Advisable indications include functional dyspepsia, with the statement that eradication can lead to long-term improvement of symptoms in a subset of patients. Because H. pylori eradication does not cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in most patients, or exacerbate existing GORD, H. pylori should be eradicated in patients requiring long-term acid suppression. Also advisable is H. pylori eradication before administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although this alone may be insufficient to reduce recurrent bleeding or enhance ulcer healing in patients receiving antisecretory therapy who continue to take NSAIDs. Maastricht 2 also introduced the concept of the 'treatment package' that considers first- and second-line eradication therapies together. A 'search and treat' strategy should be considered in patients with peptic ulcers; for patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, administration of proton pump inhibitors can be limited to the period of antibiotic treatment.

Unanswered Questions: Theoretical Insights and Genetic Evidence in Pathogenesis of Collagenous Gastritis

The pathogenesis of CG remains unclear, with several hypotheses proposed to explain the origin of the subepithelial collagen band, a hallmark of the disease. These include an inflammatory aetiology, local abnormalities of the pericryptal collagen sheath and immune‐mediated injury. One theory posits that the initial trigger for both atrophic gastritis and CG is shared; however, once initiated, collagen deposition in CG progresses independently of the ongoing mucosal inflammatory activity.

Activated fibroblasts have been identified in the gastrointestinal mucosa of affected individuals, which may account for the simultaneous collagen deposition in both colon and stomach in cases of synchronous CG and CC. A potential decrease in collagen turnover has also been suggested, although the exact stimulus that activates the subepithelial fibroblasts is still unclear. Additional proposed hypothesis involves leakage of plasma proteins and fibrinogen into the lamina propria, potentially contributing to the formation of the collagen band.

Gastritis, although a common diagnosis used by clinicians and pathologists in most parts of the world, is not well understood, especially its pathophysiology. Two major forms are recognized. 1 Type A gastritis, which involves the fundus, is associated with pernicious anemia, antibodies to parietal cells, and autoimmune conditions of other organs. Type B gastritis, which is much more common, appears to mainly affect the antrum, autoimmune phenomena are absent, and it has been considered idiopathic. Patients with peptic ulcer disease almost invariably also have type B gastritis, but the relationship of these two entities has not been satisfactorily resolved. 2, 3. See also p

Population-based studies of gastric histologic characteristics in adults in northern Europe performed a number of years ago indicated that gastritis was surprisingly common. 4 The incidence of gastritis, nearly all type B, increased with age, reaching 78% in those over 50 years old.

Probably no term employed in the nomenclature of gastric diseases has been more misused than that of chronic gastritis. The disease has been and still is considered by some physicians a very common affection, yet Riegel says: "Chronic catarrh of the stomach is not a frequent disease. If we cease to force all known gastric disorders into a few disease categories, and rely only on positive signs of this condition, we shall soon learn that chronic gastritis is not so frequent as older physicians thought and as many modern ones still persist in believing". Stockton1 says that "the comparative infrequency of chronic gastritis will be endorsed by experience if the cases are carefully studied.
