## Question

Ozempic initial dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the initial dose of Ozempic (semaglutide) and how to start it safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled starting dose and escalation for Ozempic in type 2 diabetes. Then, I should verify the rationale for that low starting dose, especially gastrointestinal tolerability. Next, I will consider special populations and whether the same initiation applies. After that, I should distinguish Ozempic from Wegovy, since the obesity indication uses a different titration. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with monitoring points and counseling language.

> Let me first confirm the labeled starting dose. The FDA prescribing information for Ozempic directs initiation at 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks, after which the dose should be increased to 0.5 mg once weekly, with further titration to 1 mg or 2 mg based on glycemic response and tolerability, up to a maximum of 2 mg weekly [^1c0ad6c4] [^1e98b0a3].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for starting low. The 0.25 mg dose is not intended for glycemic control; it is a priming dose to improve gastrointestinal tolerability, because GLP-1 receptor agonists commonly cause nausea, vomiting, and delayed gastric emptying, and slow titration mitigates these effects without sacrificing long-term efficacy, which is why the label explicitly recommends this 4-week run-in before escalation [^1c0ad6c4] [^2896d6bf].

> Hold on, I should verify whether this same initiation applies across indications. For type 2 diabetes and for cardiovascular risk reduction in T2D, the Ozempic start remains 0.25 mg weekly for 4 weeks, followed by 0.5 mg weekly, with maintenance typically 0.5–1 mg and up to 2 mg if needed for glycemic control, so the initial dose does not change by indication within the Ozempic label [^1e98b0a3] [^2f2b65b3] [^1ba926fa].

> I need to check special populations. In chronic kidney disease, the same Ozempic initiation applies: 0.25 mg weekly for 4 weeks, then 0.5 mg weekly, with a typical maintenance of 1 mg weekly in CKD populations, and no dose adjustment is required for renal impairment, reinforcing that the initial 0.25 mg start is universal for Ozempic in adults with T2D [^1ba926fa] [^5c7e5d11].

> But wait, what if someone is using semaglutide for obesity rather than diabetes. I should confirm the distinction. Wegovy, the semaglutide product indicated for obesity, uses a different titration: 0.25 mg weekly for 4 weeks, then 0.5 mg for 4 weeks, then 1 mg for 4 weeks, then 1.7 mg for 4 weeks, then 2.4 mg weekly as maintenance; this is a 16-week escalation designed to maximize tolerability at higher doses, and it is not the Ozempic regimen, so I should not conflate them [^2896d6bf] [^424ab074].

> Let me consider practical implementation. I should confirm administration details: inject once weekly on the same day, any time of day, with or without meals, rotate sites among abdomen, thigh, or upper arm, and if a dose is missed, administer within 5 days if remembered; if more than 5 days have passed, skip and resume the next scheduled dose, which helps avoid dosing confusion during initiation [^1c0ad6c4].

> I should double-check that my synthesis is consistent with high-quality guidance. The AGA obesity guideline and ACC expert consensus both endorse starting semaglutide at 0.25 mg weekly and escalating every 4 weeks to mitigate GI adverse effects, aligning with the FDA label and supporting the 0.25 mg initial dose as standard of care for Ozempic in T2D [^2896d6bf] [^edc61714].

> Final answer: The initial dose of Ozempic is 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks, after which increase to 0.5 mg once weekly, with further titration to 1 mg or 2 mg based on glycemic response and tolerability, up to a maximum of 2 mg weekly [^1c0ad6c4] [^1e98b0a3].

---

The initial dose of Ozempic (semaglutide) is **0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly** for 4 weeks [^1c0ad6c4]. This starting dose is **not for glycemic control** but to improve gastrointestinal tolerability [^1c0ad6c4]; after 4 weeks, increase to 0.5 mg once weekly, then titrate to 1 mg or 2 mg based on response and tolerability [^1c0ad6c4]. No dose adjustment is needed for renal or hepatic impairment [^5c7e5d11] [^4b50198f], and the same initiation applies to patients with chronic kidney disease or cardiovascular disease [^1ba926fa] [^2f2b65b3].

---

## Initial dose and titration schedule

- **Initial dose**: 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks (weeks 1–4) [^1c0ad6c4].
- **First escalation**: Increase to 0.5 mg once weekly after 4 weeks (week 5 onward) [^1c0ad6c4].
- **Further titration**: If additional glycemic control is needed, increase to 1 mg after at least 4 weeks at 0.5 mg; then to 2 mg after at least 4 weeks at 1 mg, based on response and tolerability [^1c0ad6c4].
- **Maximum dose**: 2 mg once weekly [^1c0ad6c4].

---

## Rationale for initial low dose

The 0.25 mg starting dose is **intended to improve gastrointestinal tolerability** by allowing the body to adjust to GLP-1 receptor agonist effects, thereby reducing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [^1c0ad6c4] [^2896d6bf]. It is **not intended to provide significant glycemic control** during this initial period [^1c0ad6c4].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting initial dose

Clinical trials show that starting at 0.25 mg and titrating gradually **reduces gastrointestinal adverse effects** and improves adherence without compromising long-term glycemic efficacy [^bc496fac] [^1c0ad6c4]. The SUSTAIN program demonstrated robust HbA1c and weight reductions with this titration strategy [^6e4f38e2].

---

## Special populations and dose adjustments

- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment is required for renal impairment, including chronic kidney disease [^5c7e5d11].
- **Hepatic impairment**: No dose adjustment is required for hepatic impairment [^4b50198f].
- **Elderly patients**: No specific dose adjustment is required, but monitor closely for adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Administration instructions

- **Injection sites**: Abdomen, thigh, or upper arm; rotate sites weekly [^1c0ad6c4].
- **Timing**: Same day each week, any time of day, with or without meals [^1c0ad6c4].
- **Missed dose**: If within 5 days, take as soon as possible; if more than 5 days, skip and resume the next scheduled dose [^1c0ad6c4].

---

## Patient counseling points

Counsel patients on **gastrointestinal side effects** (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and advise dietary adjustments to mitigate symptoms [^2896d6bf]. Emphasize adherence to the weekly schedule and proper injection technique, and review hypoglycemia risk when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas, including dose-adjustment strategies [^f361db67].

## Ozempic initial dose and titration schedule

| **Week** | **Dose** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1–4 | 0.25 mg once weekly | Tolerability |
| 5–8 | 0.5 mg once weekly | Glycemic control |
| 9–12 | 1 mg once weekly (if needed) | Enhanced control |
| 13–16 | 2 mg once weekly (if needed) | Maximal control |

---

The initial dose of Ozempic is **0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks** to improve tolerability, followed by titration to 0.5 mg and then 1–2 mg based on response and tolerability, with no dose adjustment needed for renal or hepatic impairment [^1c0ad6c4] [^5c7e5d11] [^4b50198f].

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Inspect OZEMPIC visually before use. It should appear clear and colorless. Do not use OZEMPIC if particulate matter and coloration is seen.
Administer OZEMPIC once weekly, on the same day each week, at any time of the day, with or without meals.
Inject OZEMPIC subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Instruct patients to use a different injection site each week when injecting in the same body region.
When using OZEMPIC with insulin, instruct patients to administer as separate injections and to never mix the products. It is acceptable to inject OZEMPIC and insulin in the same body region, but the injections should not be adjacent to each other.
The day of weekly administration can be changed if necessary as long as the time between two doses is at least 2 days (> 48 hours).
If a dose is missed, administer OZEMPIC as soon as possible within 5 days after the missed dose. If more than 5 days have passed, skip the missed dose and administer the next dose on the regularly scheduled day. In each case, patients can then resume their regular once weekly dosing schedule.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

Recommended Initiation Dosage

Initiate OZEMPIC with a dosage of 0.25 mg injected subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks. Follow the dosage escalation below to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

After 4 weeks on the 0.25 mg dosage, increase the dosage to 0.5 mg once weekly.

Recommended Maintenance and Maximum Dosages for Glycemic Control

The recommended maintenance dosage is 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg, injected subcutaneously once weekly, based on glycemic control.

If additional glycemic control is needed after at least 4 weeks on the:

0.5 mg dosage, the dosage may be increased to 1 mg once weekly.
1 mg dosage, the dosage may be increased to 2 mg once weekly.

The maximum recommended dosage is 2 mg once weekly.

Recommended Maintenance Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease

Increase the dosage to the maintenance dosage, 1 mg once weekly, after at least 4 weeks on the 0.5 mg dosage.

Combination with metformin or metformin with sulfonylurea

In a 30-week, open-label trial (NCT02128932), 1089 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to OZEMPIC 0.5 mg once weekly, OZEMPIC 1 mg once weekly, or insulin glargine once daily on a background of metformin (48%) or metformin and sulfonylurea (51%). Patients had a mean age of 57 years and 53% were men. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 8.6 years, and the mean BMI was 33 kg/m2. Overall, 77% were White, 9% were Black or African American, and 11% were Asian; 20% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

Patients assigned to insulin glargine had a baseline mean HbA1c of 8.1% and were started on a dose of 10 U once daily. Insulin glargine dose adjustments occurred throughout the trial period based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose before breakfast, targeting 71 to < 100 mg/dL. In addition, investigators could titrate insulin glargine at their discretion between study visits. Only 26% of patients had been titrated to goal by the primary endpoint at week 30, at which time the mean daily insulin dose was 29 U per day.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Absolute bioavailability of semaglutide is 89%. Maximum concentration of semaglutide is reached 1 to 3 days post dose.

Similar exposure is achieved with subcutaneous administration of semaglutide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.

In patients with type 2 diabetes, semaglutide exposure increases in a dose-proportional manner for once-weekly doses of 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg. Steady-state exposure is achieved following 4 to 5 weeks of once-weekly administration. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the mean population-PK estimated steady-state concentrations following once weekly subcutaneous administration of 0.5 mg and 1 mg semaglutide were approximately 65 ng/mL and 123 ng/mL, respectively. In the trial comparing semaglutide 1 mg and 2 mg, the mean steady state concentrations were 111.1 ng/mL and 222.1 ng/mL, respectively.

Distribution

The mean apparent volume of distribution of semaglutide following subcutaneous administration in patients with type 2 diabetes is approximately 12.5L. Semaglutide is extensively bound to plasma albumin (> 99%).

Elimination

The apparent clearance of semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes is approximately 0.05 L/h. With an elimination half-life of approximately 1 week, semaglutide will be present in the circulation for about 5 weeks after the last dose.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Semaglutide lowers fasting and postprandial blood glucose and reduces body weight. All pharmacodynamic evaluations were performed after 12 weeks of treatment (including dose escalation) at steady state with semaglutide 1 mg.

Fasting and Postprandial Glucose

Semaglutide reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with semaglutide 1 mg resulted in reductions in glucose in terms of absolute change from baseline and relative reduction compared to placebo of 29 mg/dL (22%) for fasting glucose, 74 mg/dL (36%) for 2-hour postprandial glucose, and 30 mg/dL (22%) for mean 24-hour glucose concentration (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Mean 24-hour Plasma Glucose Profiles (standardized meals) in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes before (Baseline) and after 12 Weeks of Treatment with Semaglutide or Placebo

Insulin Secretion

Both first-and second-phase insulin secretion are increased in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with OZEMPIC compared with placebo.

Glucagon Secretion

Semaglutide lowers the fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with semaglutide resulted in the following relative reductions in glucagon compared to placebo, fasting glucagon (8%), postprandial glucagon response (14 to 15%), and mean 24-hour glucagon concentration (12%).

Glucose dependent insulin and glucagon secretion

Semaglutide lowers high blood glucose concentrations by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. With semaglutide, the insulin secretion rate in patients with type 2 diabetes was similar to that of healthy subjects (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Mean Insulin Secretion Rate Versus Glucose Concentration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes during Graded Glucose Infusion before (Baseline) and after 12 Weeks of Treatment with Semaglutide or Placebo and in Untreated Healthy Subjects

During induced hypoglycemia, semaglutide did not alter the counter regulatory responses of increased glucagon compared to placebo and did not impair the decrease of C-peptide in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Gastric emptying

Semaglutide causes a delay of early postprandial gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which glucose appears in the circulation postprandially.

Cardiac electrophysiology (QTc)

The effect of semaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc trial. Semaglutide does not prolong QTc intervals at doses up to 1.5 mg at steady-state.

### Semaglutide (Ozempic) [^18e634d4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In an embryofetal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (0.5-, 3-, and 8-fold the MRHD) were administered throughout organogenesis, from Gestation Day 16 to 50. Pharmacologically mediated, marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with the occurrence of sporadic abnormalities (vertebra, sternebra, ribs) at ≥ 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (≥ 3X human exposure).

In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (0.3-, 2-, and 4-fold the MRHD) were administered from Gestation Day 16 to 140. Pharmacologically mediated marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with an increase in early pregnancy losses and led to delivery of slightly smaller offspring at ≥ 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (≥ 2X human exposure).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of semaglutide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Semaglutide was present in the milk of lactating rats, however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, the clinical relevance of these data are not clear (see Data). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for OZEMPIC and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from OZEMPIC or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

In lactating rats, semaglutide was detected in milk at levels 3- to 12- fold lower than in maternal plasma.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Discontinue OZEMPIC in women at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long washout period for semaglutide [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and efficacy of OZEMPIC have not been established in pediatric patients.

Fig. 5
Structure of semaglutide (subcutaneous formulation)

The SURPASS-2 trial compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, with those of semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg in patients with type 2 Diabetes over a period of 40 weeks. The overall mean duration of Diabetes was 8.6 years, the average body weight was 93.7 kg, and the mean glycated hemoglobin level was 8.28%. The final and mean points of reduction in body weight show that tirzepatide at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg were − 7.6 kg, − 9.3 kg, and − 11.2 kg, respectively, compared to −5.7 kg for semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg. Both drugs also decreased glycated haemoglobin levels. The reductions observed in glycated haemoglobin levels with tirzepatide at a dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg were − 2.01% points, − 2.24% points, and − 2.30% points, respectively, compared to − 1.86% points with semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg. These final results confirm the primary pharmacological effects of semaglutide.

However, Ozempic does not exhibit greater impact on gastric emptying. Semaglutide may also cause some side effects, the frequency of which is shown in Fig. 6.

Ozempic is available in injectable form. In the treatment of type 2 Diabetes, Ozempic is administered subcutaneously once a week at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, with an initial dose of 0.25 mg/week for the first 4 weeks. However, in the treatment of obesity, this drug is used in larger doses – 2.4 mg/week.

Properties and applications of semaglutide

The primary indication of semaglutide is type 2 diabetes. Currently, it is used as medication for adults who are obese or overweight, provided they have at least one weight-related comorbidity (for instance, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol).

Semaglutide, as a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, increases the secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells. Addictionally, it supress glucagon release from pancreatic α-cells. It also contributes to a reduction in hunger and food cravings, and stimulates the satiety center in the hypothalamus, thereby increasing a feeling of fullness. It causes weight loss by reduced energy intake with minimal effects on energy expenditure.

Semaglutide is available in two forms: oral and injectable (under the skin fold). The structure of semaglutide in the subcutaneous formulation is presented in Fig. 5. Oral tablets of Ozempic are often administered once a day at doses of 7 mg and 14 mg, with an initial dose of 3 mg once a day for the first 30 days. Oral absorption of semaglutide is considerably faster than subcutaneous administration. However, other oral drugs should be administrated 30 min after swallowing the semaglutide tablet as they can disturb the absorption process. The elimination of this medication is very similar for both the oral and injectable form.

Introduction

Sustained glycaemic control and weight loss are key targets for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), with current guidelines recommending a patient-centred approach for treatment selection. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) deliver effective glycaemic control with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, while increasing satiety, reducing body weight and blood pressure and improving cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue that was initially approved as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection (Ozempic ®, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg) for treating T2D. An initial oral formulation of semaglutide was subsequently developed as the first once-daily orally available GLP-1 analogue, using novel constituents to obtain oral bioavailability with the additional benefits of convenience and non-invasive administration. The Peptide InnOvatioN for Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) phase 3 programme demonstrated the efficacy of oral semaglutide versus placebo and active comparators (including empagliflozin, sitagliptin and liraglutide) in achieving glycaemic control and weight loss, with a safety profile consistent with the GLP-1RA drug class. Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus ®) received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval in 2019 and 2020, respectively, for the second-line treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled T2D to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise at the once-daily oral doses of 3, 7 and 14 mg. In 2023, the FDA approved a label update for oral semaglutide allowing use as a first-line treatment option for adults with T2D.

5.3 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications

In a 2-year trial involving patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, more events of diabetic retinopathy complications occurred in patients treated with OZEMPIC (3.0%) compared to placebo (1.8%). The absolute risk increase for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy at baseline (OZEMPIC 8.2%, placebo 5.2%) than among patients without a known history of diabetic retinopathy (OZEMPIC 0.7%, placebo 0.4%).

Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. The effect of long-term glycemic control with semaglutide on diabetic retinopathy complications has not been studied. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy.

5.4 Never Share an OZEMPIC Pen Between Patients

OZEMPIC pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.

5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin

Patients receiving OZEMPIC in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7)].

The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

5.6 Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion

There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, in some cases requiring hemodialysis, in patients treated with semaglutide. The majority of the reported events occurred in patients who experienced gastrointestinal reactions leading to dehydration such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to OZEMPIC that could lead to volume depletion, especially during dosage initiation and escalation of OZEMPIC.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors

In mice and rats, semaglutide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. It is unknown whether OZEMPIC causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including MTC, in humans as human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.

OZEMPIC is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of OZEMPIC and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with OZEMPIC. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low-test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin value may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

5.2 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

After initiation of OZEMPIC, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue OZEMPIC and initiate appropriate management.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Oral Medications: OZEMPIC delays gastric emptying. May impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Use with caution (7.2).

7.1 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g. Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin

OZEMPIC stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving OZEMPIC in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia.

When initiating OZEMPIC, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6)].

7.2 Oral Medications

OZEMPIC causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, semaglutide did not affect the absorption of orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with OZEMPIC.

Trial procedures

The metformin dose at inclusion (as prescribed by the primary care physician) was maintained throughout the study. After a screening visit, participants wore a Libre Pro sensor (Abbott Diabetes Care) for continuous glucose monitoring for 2 weeks. This was followed by a first study visit for baseline measurements, including an OGTT with venous blood sampling at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after ingesting 75 g of glucose. At the end of this visit, the participants were randomized to receive either semaglutide (Ozempic, Novo Nordisk) or dapagliflozin (Forxiga, AstraZeneca) in addition to metformin (Extended Data Fig. 1). Three months after randomization, the participants attended a visit for measurement of HbA1c and safety variables and application of another glucose sensor to wear for 2 weeks. Six months after randomization, they attended a final study visit for measurement of primary and secondary variables, including an OGTT. Participants who discontinued before the scheduled 6-month visit were invited to attend an immediate final visit before suspending their study medication.

Semaglutide was injected at a dose of 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly during the first 4 weeks, followed by 0.5 mg weekly for the subsequent 4 weeks and, finally, 1.0 mg weekly throughout the trial (the maximal dose approved for diabetes treatment). A dose reduction to 0.5 mg was allowed if the participant experienced unacceptable side effects at 1.0 mg. Those randomized to dapagliflozin treatment received 10 mg orally once daily (the maximal dose approved for diabetes treatment). Participants on semaglutide were instructed to adjust the administration schedule such that the last dose was taken 3 days before their final visit to standardize administration in relation to the final OGTT. In parallel, participants on dapagliflozin were instructed to take their tablet in the evening at least 3 days before their final visit, including the evening before the visit. These considerations were based on the pharmacokinetics and routes of administration of the study drugs to provide an average steady-state condition for both drugs before the OGTT.

Need for Urgency in Glucose Control

The prescribing information for oral semaglutide mentions that dose escalation should be done after 1 month. This advice is aimed at minimizing gastrointestinal symptoms and maximizing patient comfort.

There may be situations, however, where patients need urgent glucose control, to resolve symptoms, comorbidities, or complications of diabetes. Others may be concerned about their glucose levels, and may ask for early control.

If such people demonstrate good gastrointestinal tolerance to the 3 mg or 7 mg dose of semaglutide, one may consider dose up-titration after 10 or 20 days of therapy. Patients must be counseled about the possibility of transient symptoms, and how to mitigate them.

Methods

Study Design and Setting

Data for this retrospective cohort study were obtained from the Cleveland Clinic electronic health record (EHR) in Ohio and Florida, including linked Surescripts pharmacy dispensation records, from January 1, 2015, to July 28, 2023. The Surescripts prescription data service captures prescriptions paid for via insurance benefits, cash, coupons, or other methods, from nearly all major pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers in the US.

The study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board as minimal risk research using data collected for routine clinical practice, for which the requirement for informed consent was waived. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines were followed.

Study Participants

We identified adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who filled an initial prescription for injectable semaglutide or liraglutide from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2022, and had a body mass index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared) of at least 30.0, recorded on the date of treatment initiation (index date) or during the latest available primary care visit before the index date. To ensure that these were initial fills, we excluded patients prescribed these medications between January 1 and June 30, 2015. Individuals were required to have a follow-up weight measurement at least 12 months after the treatment initiation to be included in the study. Patients who were pregnant, had cancer diagnoses during the study period, or underwent bariatric surgery within 2 years of the initial medication fill were excluded (Figure 1). This study captured fills for injectable forms of semaglutide and liraglutide under the brand names approved by the FDA for obesity (semaglutide, 1.7 or 2.4 mg [Wegovy], and liraglutide, 3.0 mg [Saxenda]), as well as those approved for T2D (semaglutide, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg [Ozempic], and liraglutide, 1.2 or 1.8 mg [Victoza]), including all starting doses.

### Efficacy and safety of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg: a single-center, retrospective observational study [^e004cfe5]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide, the first glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist available in tablet form for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, were established in the phase 3a PIONEER program. However, evidence regarding the titration of oral semaglutide in real-world clinical settings remains insufficient. This study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic advantages of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg through clinical data analysis.

Methods

This retrospective observational study was conducted at a single center in Japan, focusing on adults with type 2 diabetes who were initiated on 14 mg oral semaglutide. The primary endpoint was the alteration in HbA1c levels 24 weeks after the initial prescription of 14 mg oral semaglutide. Secondary endpoints included changes in metabolic parameters and the incidence of adverse events.

Results

Data from 66 patients who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The mean change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 24 weeks following dose escalation was − 0.5 ± 0.8% [from 7.4 ± 1.0% at baseline to 7.0 ± 0.9% at 24 weeks (p < 0.01)]. Moreover, a significant reduction in body weight of − 2.0 ± 4.4 kg was observed at 24 weeks [from 90.0 ± 20.5 kg at baseline to 88.2 ± 21.4 kg at 24 weeks (p < 0.01)], with 41% of patients achieving at least a 3% reduction compared to baseline. Gastrointestinal disorders emerged as the most prevalent adverse event (10.6%), particularly nausea (7.6%), although predominantly of mild or moderate severity, with no instances of serious adverse events necessitating drug discontinuation.

Conclusion

Escalating the dose of oral semaglutide to 14 mg could be an effective approach for enhancing glycemic control and managing body weight in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

6.2 Key clinical considerations for using once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in clinical practice

Currently, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is approved for use in Canada, Europe, the UK and the USA as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with an initial BMI of ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of ≥ 1 weight‐related comorbid condition.,

Figure 1 illustrates key considerations for the use of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in clinical practice. Semaglutide should be initiated at a dose of 0.25 mg once weekly and then escalated every 4 weeks according to the dose‐escalation schedule in Figure 1, until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly is reached. This escalation schedule is designed to minimize GI AEs, but if a patient does not tolerate a dose during the escalation period, the subsequent escalation step can be delayed for a further 4 weeks, after which it should be re‐escalated to 2.4 mg. If needed, this re‐escalation step can be postponed (e.g. for 4 more weeks) and the escalation can be stopped at a lower maintenance dose where AEs are tolerable. In patients with type 2 diabetes, blood glucose should be monitored prior to starting and during treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg.

2.4 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose

If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is more than 2 days away (48 hours), administer WEGOVY as soon as possible. If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days away (48 hours), do not administer the dose. Resume dosing on the regularly scheduled day of the week.
If 2 or more consecutive doses are missed, resume dosing as scheduled or, if needed, reinitiate WEGOVY and follow the dose escalation schedule, which may reduce the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment.

Dulaglutide

Dulaglutide (Trulicity) is administered subcutaneously at a maximum dose of 1.5 mg once weekly, and available on license since 2014 for people with T2D as monotherapy in those who cannot take metformin or as add-on treatment in people using oral agents and/or insulin. As monotherapy the use of dulaglutide in people with T2D has been reported to increase weight loss by up to 2.3 kg

Semaglutide

Semaglutide (Ozempic) is the most recent GLP-1 analogue to be approved for use in T2D and is currently available by subcutaneous injection for the treatment of T2D at a dose of up to 1.0 mg once weekly. It is licensed for use as monotherapy in those unable to take metformin or as add-on treatment. The absolute weight loss associated with semaglutide use is up to 4.6 kg and 6.5 kg at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg respectively over 40 weeks. Indeed, comparative trials have shown that semaglutide 1.0 mg demonstrated greater weight loss efficacy than dulaglutide 1.5 mg (6.5 kg vs. 3.0 kg). Indeed, a phase II dose-finding trial demonstrated greater body weight reductions associated with daily subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose greater than 0.2 mg compared with liraglutide 3.0 mg daily. The development of oral semaglutide for T2D and/or obesity is of interest, as other GLP-1 analogues are currently available only as injectables often limiting their use. One trial recently reported that oral semaglutide (14 mg once daily) resulted in greater weight loss compared with subcutaneous liraglutide (4.4 kg vs. 3.1 kg) over 26 weeks. Whilst the FDA approved the use of oral semaglutide for the treatment of people with T2D in September 2019, the EMA have not approved its use in T2D at the time of writing.

The effect of currently approved GLP-1 monotherapies for T2D on weight loss are presented in Table 2.

### Semaglutide in obesity: unmet needs in men [^1f8e9cb7]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Finding the optimal dose titration scheme helps to reduce AEs, and improve tolerability and adherence. A phase 2 dose-finding study for semaglutide in which 65% of the study population were men reported that slow dose escalation of semaglutide using 4-week dose escalation steps starting from an initial dose of 0.25 mg/week ameliorated AEs without compromising efficacy. A trial that included only a male population, which had the aim to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single escalating doses of semaglutide, identified the maximum tolerated single dose (MTSD) to be 15 μg/kg body weight, which was worked out to be 1.2 mg in a male subject weighing 80 kg. There were no serious AEs and no subjects were withdrawn due to AEs.

Based on differences in exposure-response analysis between men and women, established MTSD and our clinical experience, we propose that a higher initial dose of semaglutide of 0.5 mg/week should be considered for men, especially those with BMI > 35 kg/m 2. In the event of good tolerability, a rapid titration scheme in general may then be used in men. Since the response on weight reduction in men seems to be delayed in comparison to that in women, we also advise to delay the efficacy assessment in men to later than 3 months after treatment initiation. It would be of specific clinical interest to design randomized controlled trails to address these issues.

Suggested Strategies for Optimal Oral Semaglutide Administration

Ensuring that patients who start oral semaglutide therapy receive comprehensive education from their healthcare provider is crucial. This education should encompass various aspects such as instructions on timing and method of administration, expectations regarding efficacy and adverse events, preventive measures to minimize the occurrence of side effects and on how to address them promptly. Thus, thorough patient education not only enhances treatment adherence but also promotes proactive management of potential challenges, ultimately promoting better overall outcomes.

The different aspects, suggested by the experts, to consider in subjects starting therapy with oral semaglutide were the following:
Patient communication Adopt specific and proactive counseling as a key component in the management of patients with T2D initiating oral semaglutide treatment. Recommend and explain the dose escalation strategy, with a starting dose of 3 mg once daily for at least 1 month, which can be then increased to 7 mg. After at least 1 month the dose can be increased to a maintenance dose of 14 mg once daily if needed to further improve glycemic control and body weight. Staying longer than 1 month on the 7-mg dose may help diluting GI side effects, but should not delay the achievement of individual targets. Inform patients about the potential occurrence of GI side effects in the initial weeks of oral semaglutide treatment, particularly during dose escalation periods. Patients should be reassured that in most cases, GI symptoms are mild to moderate and typically resolve naturally over time, encouraging them to persist on treatment.
Method and timing of administration Communicate the specific instructions related to mode of administration and their importance to patients initiating oral semaglutide treatment, to guarantee an effective drug bioavailability. Underline the necessity for a pre-dose fasting condition (enough to have an empty stomach) and observing an additional fasting period of at least 30 min post-dose, along with avoiding pharmacological interactions to allow correct semaglutide absorption. Recommend taking the medication in a time slot based on patient daily routine, when the stomach is empty. Address the patient's lifestyle and needs, to evaluate whether taking oral semaglutide after the overnight fast is the most suitable option or whether an alternative dosing time could be considered. In the latter case, provide the patients with clear written dosing instructions, regarding pre- and post-dose fasting.
Dose escalation schedule Extend the escalation periods beyond the recommended duration, if tolerability concerns arise at lower doses, i.e. maintain longer than 1 month on 7 mg before increasing the dose to 14 mg. Reduce the dose temporarily if adverse events persist and resume dose escalation once the symptoms diminish or resolve.
Presence of diseases or conditions affecting adherence and prescription of therapy. Emphasize adherence to specific administration timing recommendations, such as taking oral semaglutide before any other oral medications and waiting for at least 30 min before other oral medications.
Adherence to recommended eating behaviors for patients with T2D (details reported in Table 1).

### Semaglutide s.C. once-weekly in type 2 diabetes: a population pharmacokinetic analysis [^6e4f38e2]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is of increasing global concern. Since 1980, the population of adults with diabetes has quadrupled worldwide. The age-standardized prevalence of diabetes has increased, and no single country has managed to see a reduction in this prevalence. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common type of diabetes, making up approximately 90% of the total number of patients with diabetes in high-income countries, with an estimated 415 million adults with diabetes worldwide in 2015.

T2DM is linked to a range of comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), microvascular complications, and cancer. Patients with T2DM have twice the risk of CVD mortality compared with age-matched subjects without T2DM, approximately 10% increased risk of cancer, and poorer survival rates of cancer. As the number of comorbidities a patient suffers from and the number of medications a patient is prescribed increase, his or her perceived quality of life decreases. There are many available treatments, but there is still a need for more effective treatments for T2DM.

Semaglutide (marketed as Ozempic ®) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved for the treatment of T2DM. Native human GLP-1 functions in a glucose-dependent manner, increasing insulin secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion in the presence of elevated blood glucose. GLP-1 also decreases appetite and energy intake. However, endogenous GLP-1 has a short half-life (t ½ = 2–3 min) and is therefore not well suited for the treatment of T2DM. Semaglutide retains 94% amino acid homology with native GLP-1, allowing it to retain GLP-1 signaling functionality but with a half-life of about 1 week. This allows for subcutaneous injection once weekly.

The Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) phase III trials have shown that semaglutide has a strong glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c)-lowering effect in patients with T2DM when injected subcutaneously once weekly. As with other GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), treatment with semaglutide causes a reduction in body weight. Globally conducted clinical trials have shown that semaglutide can provide superior glycemic control and body weight loss compared with placebo, sitagliptin, exenatide extended-release or insulin glargine and compared with additional oral anti-diabetic drugs investigated in a dedicated Japanese trial. In addition, semaglutide has been shown to reduce systolic blood pressure, and no cardiovascular risk was demonstrated.

We enrolled patients with T2DM who had been treated with OW semaglutide (Ozempic ® subcutaneous injection SD) in the Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center between June 2021 and December 2021. Semaglutide was used for better glycemic control at the discretion of the attending physician according to the Japanese package insert, with a starting dose of 0.25 mg. We evaluated clinical parameters 6 months after OW semaglutide initiation. The inclusion criteria were as follows: Japanese patients with T2DM who initiated OW semaglutide in an outpatient setting. The exclusion criteria were patients with acute metabolic disorders, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome; who were taking steroids, had acute infectious disease, or had any newly diagnosed cancer; who required hospitalization, self-discontinued, or had poor adherence to injections; who exhibited a change in an oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) or new insulin induction during the observation period; and whose adverse events led to discontinuation within 6 months.

Persons on Once-Weekly GLP1RA

People who switch from once-weekly exenatide, dulaglutide, or semaglutide should start oral semaglutide 7 days after their last injection. Similar principles, as detailed above, apply to the choice of dose of initiation. A prescription of oral semaglutide that is started in response to lack of tolerability should begin with 3 mg daily. However, if oral semaglutide is chosen owing to lack of efficacy of current therapy, one may commence with 7 mg/day.

Once-weekly semaglutide has been compared with oral semaglutide, i.e. 0.5 mg once-weekly semaglutide with 7 mg of oral semaglutide. However, the difference in the impact on weight should be explained to the patient.

2.2 Study protocol and titration schedule

Each STEP trial included an initial dose escalation for semaglutide, with initiation at 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks, increased at 4‐weekly intervals to 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg and finally 2.4 mg at week 16., Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg (i.e. would otherwise discontinue treatment) were permitted to remain at lower maintenance doses, with at least one attempt to re‐escalate to 2.4 mg. Participants discontinuing treatment prematurely remained in each trial.

AE information, including onset and end date, was collected throughout each trial, using open‐ended, non‐leading verbal questions. Reported AEs were proactively followed up at each subsequent visit/contact. AEs were coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 22.1) and categorized based on severity and seriousness, using standard definitions (File S1). AE incidence was assessed as a supportive secondary safety endpoint in each trial.

### Efficacy and safety of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg: a single-center, retrospective observational study [^521d871b]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This retrospective observational study, utilizing real-world clinical data, revealed the efficacy and safety of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg. Our findings demonstrated that this dose escalation resulted in an additional improvement of − 0.5% in HbA1c levels and a reduction of − 2.0 kg in body weight, all achieved without encountering serious AEs. Escalating the dose of oral semaglutide to 14 mg may serve as an effective strategy for intensifying glycemic therapy and managing body weight in patients with T2D.

Fig. 7
SNAC technology for Semaglutide permeation.

This illustration demonstrates how SNAC in the tablet helps oral semaglutide survive stomach acid. SNAC raises local pH, protects the drug from gastric enzymes, and increases its absorption through the stomach lining.

Preclinical pharmacoscintigraphic imaging and studies in canine models have demonstrated that semaglutide is primarily absorbed in the stomach, with higher drug concentrations detected in the splenic vein relative to the portal vein, indicating site-specific uptake. This innovative approach effectively bypasses the traditional barriers associated with oral peptide delivery, offering a clinically viable and patient-preferred alternative to injectable formulations.

Semaglutide is also available as injectable formulations, including Ozempic ® and Wegovy ®, which are widely recognized for their efficacy in the management of T2DM and obesity. Both formulations are administered as once-weekly SC injections due to the long half-life of Semaglutide (approximately one week). Furthermore, Ozempic ® is primarily used for glycemic control in diabetes patients, while Wegovy ® targets weight management by reducing hunger and enhancing satiety through activation of GLP-1 receptors. The pharmacokinetic profiles of these formulations indicate that maximum plasma concentrations are typically attained within 1 to 3 days following SC administration, while steady-state plasma levels are generally achieved after 4 to 5 weeks of once-weekly dosing. Dosing regimens for both products involve gradual titration to optimize therapeutic outcomes; Ozempic® progresses from 0.25 mg to a maintenance dose of up to 1 mg, whereas Wegovy® reaches a higher maintenance dose of 2.4 mg to support weight loss goals.

### Insights into the early use of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice: the IGNITE study [^4165dcff]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral semaglutide is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and showed significant benefits in glycaemic control and weight reduction versus active comparators in the PIONEER phase 3a randomized controlled trial programme. In this retrospective study, we present early data on the use of oral semaglutide in clinical practice, from the US IBM Explorys electronic health record database. In 782 patients prescribed oral semaglutide, 54.5% were women, and the mean age (SD) was 57.8years (11.3); 66.0% of patients received their prescription from a primary care practitioner. Although prescribing information recommends increasing the dose to 7 mg after 30days, 37.0% of patients received a prescription only for the initial 3 mg dose. Mean body mass index was 36.2 kg/m 2 (7.6); mean HbA1c was 8.4% (1.8%). Mean HbA1c change from baseline to approximately 6 months after oral semaglutide initiation was -0.9% (95% CI: -1.1%; -0.6%), with greater reductions in patients with higher baseline HbA1c. These data indicate prevalent early adoption of oral semaglutide in primary care, show real-world improvements in glycaemic control, and identify potential treatment gaps.

In STEP 1 (without T2D), placebo-subtracted weight loss was "16.9%" (on-treatment) and "14.9%" (in-trial), with STEP 1/3/4 yielding "16.9% to 18.2%" weight loss with a lifestyle program. In a phase 2 NASH study, semaglutide produced "13% weight loss" with fibrosis improvement in "43%" versus "7%" and "33%" with placebo. In STEP 2 (with T2D and ABCD), randomization included "2.4 mg/week," "1.0 mg/week," and placebo; placebo-subtracted weight loss was "6.2%" with 2.4 mg versus "3.6%" with 1.0 mg, and "10.6% weight loss" with 2.4 mg plus lifestyle, along with improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide and the effect of switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 52-week, randomized, open-label extension of the PIONEER 7 trial [^a615a1ba]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Treatment guidelines for T2D highlight the need for an individualized approach, and in clinical practice doses of therapeutic agents are frequently adjusted to achieve optimum results. The main phase of the PIONEER 7 study demonstrated that oral semaglutide dosing can be individualized, and that it is able to provide greater benefits to patients than sitagliptin. This long-term, open-label extension builds on these results, with the durability part representing the longest follow-up reported to date for oral semaglutide. Continued flexible dosing of oral semaglutide maintained reductions in HbA 1c and rates of achievement of HbA 1c goals, and resulted in further reductions in body weight over 104 weeks, while remaining well tolerated with no new safety signals. As expected for a GLP-1RA, and consistent with other trials from the PIONEER program, gastrointestinal events were the most frequently reported AEs with oral semaglutide and the AEs that most often resulted in premature discontinuation. However, the majority of these AEs occurred in the early part of the main phase, and only one patient discontinued due to an AE in the second year of the durability part, indicating that discontinuations due to gastrointestinal AEs with oral semaglutide are likely to occur early on in treatment (during the initial dose-escalation phase) and not with long-term use.

### High-dose semaglutide (up to 16 mg) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^37b83665]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for glycemic control and body weight. The aim of this trial was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of semaglutide (up to 16 mg/week) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity.

Research Design and Methods

In this parallel-group, participant- and investigator-blinded, phase 2 trial, 245 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 on metformin were randomized to weekly semaglutide (2, 8, or 16 mg s.c.) or placebo for 40 weeks. Doses were escalated every 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance period. Dose modifications were not allowed. Primary and secondary efficacy end points included change from baseline to week 40 in HbA1c and body weight, respectively.

Results

Estimated treatment difference between 16 and 2 mg was -0.3 percentage points (%-points) (95% CI -0.7 to 0.2; P = 0.245) for HbA1c change and -3.4 kg (-6.0 to -0.8; P = 0.011) for weight change for the treatment policy estimand and -0.5%-points (-1.0 to -0.1; P = 0.015) and -4.5 kg (-7.6 to -1.4; P = 0.004), respectively, for the hypothetical estimand. Dose-response modeling confirmed these findings. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, primarily gastrointestinal, were more frequent in the semaglutide 8 and 16 mg groups than in the 2 mg group. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported.

Conclusions

Higher semaglutide doses for type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity provide modest additional glucose-lowering effect, with additional weight loss, at the expense of more AEs and treatment discontinuations. A study for evaluating high-dose semaglutide in obesity is currently underway.

### Effect of oral semaglutide compared with placebo and subcutaneous semaglutide on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^54857065]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and are all currently available as an injection.

Objectives

To compare the effects of oral semaglutide with placebo (primary) and open-label subcutaneous semaglutide (secondary) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, dosage-finding, 26-week trial with 5-week follow-up at 100 sites (hospital clinics, general practices, and clinical research centers) in 14 countries conducted between December 2013 and December 2014. Of 1106 participants assessed, 632 with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycemic control using diet and exercise alone or a stable dose of metformin were randomized. Randomization was stratified by metformin use.

Interventions

Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2.5 mg (n = 70), 5 mg (n = 70), 10 mg (n = 70), 20 mg (n = 70), 40-mg 4-week dose escalation (standard escalation; n = 71), 40-mg 8-week dose escalation (slow escalation; n = 70), 40-mg 2-week dose escalation (fast escalation, n = 70), oral placebo (n = 71; double-blind) or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide of 1.0 mg (n = 70) for 26 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included change from baseline in body weight and adverse events.

Results

Baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Of the 632 randomized patients (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 10.6]; men, 395 (62.7%); diabetes duration, 6.3 years [SD, 5.2]; body weight, 92.3 kg [SD, 16.8]; BMI, 31.7 [SD, 4.3]), 583 (92%) completed the trial. Mean change in HbA1c level from baseline to week 26 decreased with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -0.7% to -1.9%) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-1.9%) and placebo (-0.3%); oral semaglutide reductions were significant vs placebo (dosage-dependent estimated treatment difference [ETD] range for oral semaglutide vs placebo, -0.4% to -1.6%; P = 0.01 for 2.5 mg, < .001 for all other dosages). Reductions in body weight were greater with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -2.1 kg to -6.9 kg) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-6.4 kg) vs placebo (-1.2 kg), and significant for oral semaglutide dosages of 10 mg or more vs placebo (dosage-dependent ETD range, -0.9 to -5.7 kg; P < .001). Adverse events were reported by 63% to 86% (371 of 490 patients) in the oral semaglutide groups, 81% (56 of 69 patients) in the subcutaneous semaglutide group, and 68% (48 of 71 patients) in the placebo group; mild to moderate gastrointestinal events were most common.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide resulted in better glycemic control than placebo over 26 weeks. These findings support phase 3 studies to assess longer-term and clinical outcomes, as well as safety.

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^657df84c]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was done in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or more. We randomly assigned participants (6:1) to each active treatment group (ie, semaglutide [0·05 mg, 0·1 mg, 0·2 mg, 0·3 mg, or 0·4 mg; initiated at 0·05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3·0 mg; initiated at 0·6 mg per day and escalated by 0·6 mg per week]) or matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once-daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation with missing data derived from the placebo pool. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453711.

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group). Mean baseline characteristics included age 47 years, bodyweight 111·5 kg, and BMI 39·3 kg/m 2. Bodyweight data were available for 891 (93%) of 957 participants at week 52. Estimated mean weight loss was -2·3% for the placebo group versus -6·0% (0·05 mg), -8·6% (0·1 mg), -11·6% (0·2 mg), -11·2% (0·3 mg), and -13·8% (0·4 mg) for the semaglutide groups. All semaglutide groups versus placebo were significant (unadjusted p ≤ 0·0010), and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p ≤ 0·0055). Mean bodyweight reductions for 0·2 mg or more of semaglutide versus liraglutide were all significant (-13·8% to -11·2% vs -7·8%). Estimated weight loss of 10% or more occurred in 10% of participants receiving placebo compared with 37–65% receiving 0·1 mg or more of semaglutide (p < 0·0001 vs placebo). All semaglutide doses were generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. The most common adverse events were dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Interpretation

In combination with dietary and physical activity counselling, semaglutide was well tolerated over 52 weeks and showed clinically relevant weight loss compared with placebo at all doses.

### Dose-dependent erythema nodosum after initiation of semaglutide [^85c215d3]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythema nodosum (EN) is an acute septal panniculitis characterized by tender erythematous nodules primarily localized on extensor surfaces of the lower legs. EN is considered a hypersensitivity response to antigenic stimuli. The exact mechanism is disputed, with some authors postulating the pathogenesis as due to deposition of immune complexes in the venules of the septae of the subcutaneous fat, Though the etiology is typically idiopathic, it can occur with a vast number of underlying causes including streptococcal infections, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, medications, and pregnancy. Medications that have been most commonly associated with EN include sulfonamides, bromides, and oral contraceptives, as well as a host of vaccines. Semaglutide (Ozempic) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and more recently, it has gained considerable popularity as a treatment for weight loss. Here we report a unique case of EN attributed to semaglutide.

### Insights into the early use of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice: the IGNITE study [^4019cd8e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

In total, 34% of patients had no prescription for the 3 mg starting dose. This could be attributable to switching from another GLP‐1 RA, which permits initiation at a higher dose, or to patients receiving oral semaglutide samples, which were not captured in this dataset. The latter possibility would cause underestimation of changes in HbA1c from baseline because initiation of oral semaglutide for these patients would be earlier than the recorded index date. It is also notable that HbA1c reductions were observed, even though 26.1% of this cohort did not have a dose escalation beyond the initial 3 mg dose, indicating that further improvements might be achieved with escalation to the highest recommended dose of 14 mg. This is supported by the results of the PIONEER 7 trial, a flexible dosing study comparing oral semaglutide with sitagliptin 100 mg. All patients initiated the 3 mg dose of oral semaglutide, with the potential for dose adjustment to 7 or 14 mg at subsequent eight‐weekly intervals, based on HbA1c and gastrointestinal tolerability. Overall, 59% of patients on oral semaglutide at week 52 were receiving the 14 mg dose, 30% were receiving 7 mg and only 9% were receiving 3 mg. Overall, mean HbA1c reduction in the oral semaglutide group at this time point was −1.3% (standard error [SE]: 0.1) for the treatment policy estimand and −1.4% (SE: 0.1) for the trial product estimand. Although it is not possible to gather comprehensive information on the rationale underlying clinical decision‐making in a retrospective study, the fact that some patients in the current study received prescriptions only for the 3 mg initial dose may indicate an opportunity for education on dose escalation in the clinical care setting. Finally, the higher HbA1c reductions observed for patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels are consistent with data from the PIONEER programme highlighting the glycaemic benefit of oral semaglutide against comparators, across the full range of baseline HbA1c.

In a Phase II dose‐finding trial, oral semaglutide at doses of 2.5‐40 mg once daily demonstrated significant dose‐dependent reductions in glucose and body weight in patients with early T2D. 34 Oral semaglutide was well tolerated, and the main adverse events were GI‐related, which (in common with other GLP‐1RAs) mainly consisted of dose‐dependent, mild‐to‐moderate and transient nausea when initiating or titrating therapy. Fewer GI events were reported when patients started on a lower dose, suggesting that a gradual escalation could be a helpful mitigation strategy. 34 Based on the results of the Phase II trial, 34 oral semaglutide doses of 3, 7 and 14 mg were taken forward to the Phase 3 Peptide InnOvatioN for the Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) programme, a series of 10 multicentre, randomized clinical trials.

3.1.2 Subset with baseline clinical data

For patients with a measurement in the baseline period, mean weight was 104.9 kg (SD: 24.0; n = 689) and mean body mass index (BMI) was 36.2 kg/m 2 (SD: 7.6). Most patients met the criteria for obesity: 77.6% had a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 or higher. Mean HbA1c was 8.4% (SD: 1.8%; n = 499); 112/499 patients (22.4%) had HbA1c less than 7% and 84/499 (16.8%) had HbA1c of 10% or higher. Mean time with T2D noted in the Explorys database, used to estimate approximate disease duration, was 6.9 years (SD: 4.8; Table 1).

3.2 Oral semaglutide dosing

The majority of patients had a first prescription that included the 3 mg dose: 404/782 (51.7%) had a first prescription for 3 mg alone, 112/782 (14.3%) had prescriptions for 3 and 7 mg, and 5/782 (0.6%) had prescriptions for 3, 7 and 14 mg. However, 201/782 patients (25.7%) had an initial prescription recorded for 7 mg alone, 41/782 (5.2%) had a prescription for 14 mg alone, and 8/782 (1.0%) had a prescription for both 7 and 14 mg. Overall, 289/782 patients (37.0%) were prescribed 3 mg as their highest dose, of whom 36/289 received their prescription during the last 6 weeks of the study period (1 November to 15 December 2020). Only 106/782 patients (13.6%) were prescribed the 14 mg dose.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

Safety Outcomes

Throughout the study period, AEs were reported in 18 of 66 patients (27.3%) (Table 3). The predominant AEs were gastrointestinal disorders (10.6%), with nausea being the most commonly reported symptom (7.6%). However, most of these events were mild or moderate in severity. Notably, only one patient (1.5%) required a dose reduction of oral semaglutide due to gastrointestinal disorders. Other reasons for discontinuation or dose reduction included perceived treatment ineffectiveness by the attending physician, financial constraints, and patient requests. Additionally, a single instance (1.5%) of blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycemia (54 mg/dL) was observed, with no serious AEs.

Subgroup Analysis

The median duration of the escalation of the oral semaglutide dose from 3 to 14 mg was 114 days. In the subgroup analysis, significant improvements in HbA1c levels were evident in both the early (< 114 days) and late dose-titration groups (≥ 114 days) (Supplementary Material, Table S2). However, notable weight loss was observed in the early dose-titration group. Conversely, gastrointestinal tract disorders were more prevalent in the early dose-titration group (Supplementary Material, Table S3).

### Suitability and usefulness of a flexible dosing timing of oral semaglutide to maximize benefit in clinical practice: an expert panel [^36e03f5e]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

From clinical trials and observational data, oral semaglutide has proven to be the most effective second-line oral therapy for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. This review aims to describe the perspective of an Italian expert panel that addressed the potential challenges arising during the use of oral semaglutide in the free-living conditions of routine clinical care. A group of Italian experts discussed and generated insights into the use of oral semaglutide in clinical practice. Key topics included the effectiveness of oral semaglutide in clinical practice, the positioning of the agent to optimize the treatment benefits, the possibility to adopt flexibility in the administration schedule, critical issues encountered, the role of patient communication and information in the importance of dose escalation and management of adverse events. Available data on efficacy and effectiveness of oral semaglutide from randomized clinical trials and real-world studies were reported, along with factors that determine tolerability and persistence on treatment. The debate over a fixed versus a flexible dosing schedule was critically addressed, providing anecdotical clues from a small case series and a real-world database. Additionally, a set of recommendations for clinicians to consider when prescribing oral semaglutide and during the process of patient monitoring were provided.

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^54c38004]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) have recently gained momentum after the introduction of semaglutide, the first oral molecule in their class. In a recent article in this journal by Evans et al., a succinct overview of the utility of semaglutide is highlighted in the context of virtual diabetes care. To take this discussion further, this commentary describes the value and positioning of oral semaglutide in common clinical situations. Its insights assist in pragmatic placement of this drug in clinical practice. Special emphasis is laid on the use of oral semaglutide in persons already on injectable GLP-1RA formulations, those experiencing sudden changes in life style pattern due to religious, social, or professional commitments, individuals seeking help for urgent glycemic control, and those who face sudden change in their concomitant medications or comorbidities.

Study Population

Inclusion criteria included: ≥ 1 pharmacy claim for any dose of T2D-indicated tirzepatide (Mounjaro® only) or injectable semaglutide (Ozempic® only) (index medications; hereafter referred to as tirzepatide and semaglutide) between May 13, 2022, and May 29, 2023, with the date of the first claim serving as the index date. Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years old on the index date and had ≥ 2 medical claims with a diagnosis of T2D (ICD-10-CM E11.xx), in any position, in any place of service, at any time prior to the index date, going back to January 1, 2016. Patients were required to have continuous enrollment in medical and pharmacy benefits during the six-month pre-index period and the 12-month post-index period. Exclusion criteria included any diagnosis in medical claims for gestational diabetes or type 1 diabetes during the 6-month pre-index period, any claims related to bariatric surgery or other obesity-related procedures from January 1, 2016, through 12 months post-index, and patients with pregnancy, labor, or delivery claims from 6 months pre-index to 12 months post-index.

Eligible patients were first stratified according to their index medication, either tirzepatide or semaglutide, excluding anyone prescribed both on the index date. Further stratification was based on prior use of GLP-1 RAs indicated for T2D during the 6-month pre-index period. Those with no previous fills within the 6-month pre-index period were categorized as GLP-1 RA naïve, while those with ≥ 1 fill for a non-index GLP-1 RA were categorized as GLP-1 RA non-naïve. No patients were prescribed tirzepatide during the 6-month pre-index period, as it had not yet been approved for T2D at that time. The study compared GLP-1 RA naïve (henceforth referred to as naïve) patients initiating tirzepatide to those initiating semaglutide, as well as GLP-1 RA non-naïve (henceforth referred to as non-naïve) patients initiating tirzepatide to those initiating semaglutide. No statistical comparisons between the GLP-1 naïve and GLP-1 non-naïve cohorts were conducted.

Conclusions

On the basis of the combined results of the current food-effect and dosing conditions trials with oral semaglutide, it is concluded that administration of oral semaglutide in the fasting state with up to 120 mL water and at least 30 min post-dose fasting results in clinically relevant semaglutide plasma exposure. These dosing recommendations were implemented in the phase 3 clinical development programme for oral semaglutide and are part of the approved label.

TABLE 2
Key eligibility criteria for STEP trials

Adults are excluded from the trials if there is a self‐reported change in body weight of > 5 kg within 90 days before screening. For trials that excluded patients with T2D (STEP trails 1, 3, 4, and 5), adults are excluded if they have a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus or T2D mellitus, HbA 1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), or previous treatment with glucose‐lowering agents or any AOM within the past 90 days before screening.

For all trials, treatment discontinuation can be decided by the investigator or participant. After discontinuation, participants are encouraged to continue to attend visits per the schedule and may be given the option to restart trial medication. Protocol‐specified discontinuation criteria include safety concerns from the investigator, calcitonin level ≥ 100 ng/L, suspicion of pancreatitis, pregnancy or intention to become pregnant, and participation in another clinical trial. Participants can withdraw consent at any point and are considered lost to follow‐up if they repeatedly fail to attend scheduled visits and cannot be contacted.

The protocols allow for dose reductions in case a participant does not tolerate the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg and may stay at the lower dose level of 1.7 mg once weekly, if needed. This is only allowed if the participant would otherwise discontinue trial treatment completely and if it is considered safe to continue trial treatment, per the investigator's discretion. It is recommended that the participant make at least one attempt to re‐escalate to the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg once weekly. Dose is recorded at selected visits throughout the trials.

Outcome measures

The primary and confirmatory secondary end points are described in Table 1. For all trials, the primary endpoints are percentage change from baseline at randomization (note that this was from week 20 in STEP 4) to end of treatment (EOT) in body weight and ≥ 5% WL from baseline after EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Confirmatory secondary trial endpoints include the proportion of participants achieving a body weight reduction ≥ 10% or ≥ 15% from baseline to EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Other confirmatory secondary endpoints for all the trials are change from baseline to EOT (or change from randomization [week 20] to EOT for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]), in waist circumference (centimeters), systolic blood pressure (millimeters of mercury), and clinical outcome assessments.

Semaglutide STEP 3 — subcutaneous semaglutide as an adjunct to intensive behavior therapy in adults with overweight or obesity — enrolled participants without diabetes mellitus, used a low-calorie, meal-replacement diet for the first 8 weeks (1000–1200 kcal/day) followed by 1200–1800 kcal/day with regular physical activity goals of 200 minutes per week and 30 individual sessions; semaglutide 2.4 mg SQ per week plus intensive behavior therapy resulted in a 16.9% reduction in body weight versus 5.7% with placebo, and the authors noted 14.9% vs 2.4% at 68 weeks in STEP 1, concluding that these findings suggest that the inclusion of intensive behavioral therapy plus an 8-week low-calorie diet ultimately may not contribute significant additional weight reduction beyond that achieved by semaglutide and less-intensive lifestyle intervention.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; semaglutide and liraglutide) — titration, missed doses, and precautions are detailed as follows: To minimize risk of GI adverse effects, gradual dose titration is recommended for semaglutide and liraglutide. Semaglutide is started at 0.25 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, and 1.7 mg weekly every 4 weeks at each dose, until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg is reached after 16 weeks; for liraglutide, it is recommended to start with 0.6 mg daily for the first 7 days, followed by doses of 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, and 2.4 mg daily every 7 days at each dose until the maintenance dose of 3.0 mg is reached after 4 weeks. If more than 2 consecutive doses are missed, clinical judgement is required to decide on subsequent dosing, and restarting the titration schedule should be considered if 3 or more consecutive doses are missed. Liraglutide or semaglutide should not be used with other GLP-1 RAs or with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors; caution is advised when using GLP-1 RAs in combination with insulin or sulfonylureas, with dose adjustment and monitoring for hypoglycemia. Because GLP-1 RAs can delay gastric emptying, it may impact the absorption of some medications that require rapid onset of action, and GLP-1 RAs have been associated with thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents in dose- and treatment duration-dependent fashion.

### Once-weekly semaglutide 7. 2 mg in adults with obesity (STEP UP): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^e15e4726]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg is approved for weight management in people with obesity and related complications; however, some individuals do not reach their therapeutic goals with this dose. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of a higher dose of semaglutide (7·2 mg) in people with obesity.

Methods

STEP UP was a phase 3b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial conducted across 95 hospitals, specialist clinics, and medical centres in 11 countries in adults with BMI 30 kg/m 2 or greater, without diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned (5:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 7·2 mg, 2·4 mg, or placebo, with a lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of participants with a bodyweight reduction of 5% or greater for semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo from baseline to week 72 (treatment policy estimand). Confirmatory secondary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight with 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg, change in waist circumference (cm), and proportion of participants with bodyweight reductions of 10% or greater, 15% or greater, 20% or greater, and 25% or greater versus placebo, and 20% or greater and 25% or greater versus 2·4 mg. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the trial product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05646706) and is now completed.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, 1407 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 7·2 mg (n = 1005), semaglutide 2·4 mg (n = 201), or placebo (n = 201). 1037 (73·7%) of 1407 participants were female, the mean age was 47 (SD 12) years, mean bodyweight was 113·0 (24·1) kg, and mean BMI was 39·9 (7·1) kg/m 2. The mean change in bodyweight was greater with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg (-18·7% [SE 0·4] vs -15·6% [0·7]; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -3·1% [95% CI -4·7 to -1·6]; p < 0·0001) and with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (-18·7% [0·4] vs -3·9% [0·6]; -14·8% [-16·2 to -13·4]; p < 0·0001). Participants in the semaglutide 7·2 mg group were more likely than those in the placebo group to reach bodyweight reductions of 5% or greater (odds ratio 12·1 [95% CI 8·3 to 17·6]; p < 0·0001), 10% or greater (14·5 [9·6 to 21·9]; p < 0·0001), 15% or greater (20·3 [11·2 to 36·8]; p < 0·0001), 20% or greater (27·3 [10·9 to 68·0]; p < 0·0001), and 25% or greater (127·4 [36·8 to 441·4]; p < 0·0001); and more likely than those in the 2·4 mg group to reach bodyweight reductions of 20% or greater (1·8 [1·3 to 2·4]; p = 0·0006) and 25% or greater (2·4 [1·6 to 3·5]; p < 0·0001). Improvements in waist circumference were observed with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (ETD -11·7 cm [95% CI -13·0 to -10·4]; p < 0·0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with semaglutide 7·2 mg (711 [70·8%] of 1004) versus 2·4 mg (123 [61·2%] of 201) or placebo (86 [42·8%] of 201), as was dysaesthesia (230 [22·9%], 12 [6·0%], and one [0·5%], respectively). Serious adverse events were reported by 68 (6·8%) of 1004 participants with semaglutide 7·2 mg, 22 (10·9%) of 201 with semaglutide 2·4 mg, and 11 (5·5%) of 201 with placebo.

Interpretation

Semaglutide 7·2 mg was superior to placebo and 2·4 mg for bodyweight reduction in adults with obesity, while retaining a favourable risk-benefit profile.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^26315fa5]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several trials that demonstrate the promising effects of GLP‐1s in general and semaglutide in particular on WM in subpopulations of people with obesity. In the Satiety and Clinical Adiposity – Liraglutide Evidence in individuals with and without diabetes (SCALE) trial of 3,731 people without diabetes, WL was maintained at 56 weeks with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus placebo (−8.0% versus −2.6%, respectively; P < 0.001) (34). The SCALE trial of 846 people with T2D and obesity or overweight demonstrated a 6.0% (6.4‐kg) reduction of initial body weight with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus 1.8 mg and placebo (4.7% [5.0 kg] and 2.0% [2.2 kg], respectively) (35). The Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) clinical development program, which included > 8,000 people with T2D, demonstrated that semaglutide at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg weekly offered WM benefits of 2.5 to 5.7 kg and 2.0 to 7.9 kg, respectively (36). Liraglutide and semaglutide are administered at different frequencies and doses, and over a 24‐hour period, they have distinct pharmacodynamic effects (37, 38). However, they are equally associated with transient, mild, or moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (17, 39). Clinical experience shows that slowing the initial escalation of liraglutide and semaglutide helps mitigate these side effects; hence, we have designed the trials in the STEP program to have a slow titration of semaglutide over a 16‐week period.

### Efficacy and safety of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg: a single-center, retrospective observational study [^d23ba63d]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Avoiding clinical inertia and early intensification of diabetes therapy have been emphasized as crucial for achieving HbA1c goals. In the present study, both the early and late dose-titration groups showed significant glycemic improvement, whereas only the early dose-titration group showed significant improvement in weight loss. However, the relatively short median time required for dose titration (114 days) suggests that the early dose-titration group may have been more likely to benefit from the weight loss associated with oral semaglutide initiation.

This study had some limitations. First, being a retrospective observational study conducted at a single center using historical data, the study is susceptible to confounding factors and biases. These factors may impact the results, posing challenges in ascertaining the true effects of the intervention. Additionally, it is a single-arm study without a comparator group, which limits its ability to draw direct comparisons. Although the patients were not stratified on the basis of concomitant medications, prior investigations have indicated that oral semaglutide is effective in reducing HbA1c levels and body weight, regardless of concurrent glucose-lowering agents. Additionally, the constant number of glucose-lowering medications throughout the study period and the predominant reduction in the total daily insulin dose suggested a minimal likelihood of overestimating the effect of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide, validating the obtained results. However, given the potentially heightened effects of 14 mg oral semaglutide in Asian populations, further verification is necessary to ascertain the applicability of these results to other racial groups. AEs may have been underestimated owing to inaccurate or selective records; however, it is noteworthy that no serious AEs leading to dose reduction or discontinuation were missed owing to accurate prescription records. Second, the relatively small number of enrolled patients, although all patients prescribed 14 mg of oral semaglutide were included at the time of study planning, is a limitation. In particular, blood pressure and UACR assessments were challenging because they were often omitted or not measured. Further validation of the effects on blood pressure and UACR requires the inclusion of more cases. Third, two patients were lost to follow-up at the end of the 12-week visit as a result of hospital transfer and did not complete the full 24-week duration. Additionally, we excluded non-adherent patients, and data subsequent to the reduction or discontinuation of oral semaglutide during the observation period were not included in outcome measurements, which could introduce bias. Exclusion of non-adherent patients could lead to underreporting of adverse effects. However, only one patient was excluded because of non-adherence in this study. The patient initially switched from another GLP-1 receptor agonist to oral semaglutide but often took it after meals instead of on an empty stomach or forgot to take it altogether because of a busy morning schedule. They subsequently switched to injectable semaglutide and tolerated the maximum dosage without adverse effects, suggesting that proper oral administration would unlikely have led to adverse effects.

### Assessing patient PREFERence between the dulaglutide pen and the semaglutide pen: a crossover study (PREFER) [^7c9fca12]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

This study, called PREFER, was an open‐label, multicentre, randomized, crossover study assessing patient preference for the dulaglutide single‐use pen 33 and the semaglutide single‐patient‐use pen 34 (which is used multiple times by each patient). Injection‐naïve patients with T2D were recruited at 13 clinical sites in the USA (located in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia), including nine general practice clinics and four endocrinology clinics. The crossover study design was selected to allow participants to directly compare the two injection devices. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the two device orders (ie, either dulaglutide first or semaglutide first, followed by the other device). The device order to which each patient was assigned was determined by a computer‐generated random sequence and assigned using a validated interactive web response system (IWRS). After being trained to use each device based on device instructions for use (IFU), participants performed all steps of injection preparation and administered mock injections into an injection pad.

The devices used in this study were the commercialized injection pens as of 2018, containing non‐modified commercial product. The generic and brand names were visible to participants, and questionnaires used the brand names (Trulicity for dulaglutide; Ozempic for semaglutide), which are displayed prominently on the devices. All of the questionnaires asking about preferences or perceptions related to the devices included colour images of the devices along with the medication names to avoid any confusion regarding which device corresponded to each question and response option.

No active drug was administered. The participants were trained with devices that contained the lowest available dose of each medication (dulaglutide, 0.75 mg; semaglutide, 0.25 mg) because these are the recommended starting doses for these two products in the US labels and because of safety concerns (eg, in case of an accidental needle stick). However, the device procedures are virtually identical across all drug dosages. Therefore, the study findings could be applicable to other dulaglutide and semaglutide device doses, as well as other drugs using the same devices.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1ad67f23]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, general principles, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to use a person-centered shared decision-making approach to guide the choice of glucose-lowering medications in adult patients with T2DM. Use medications providing sufficient effectiveness to achieve and maintain intended treatment goals with consideration of the effects on cardiovascular, kidney, weight, and other relevant comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, cost and access, risk for adverse reactions and tolerability, and individual preferences:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |

### Gradual titration of semaglutide results in better treatment adherence and fewer adverse events: a randomized controlled open-label pilot study examining a 16-week flexible titration regimen versus label-recommended 8-week semaglutide titration regimen [^bc496fac]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a slower, flexible titration regimen of semaglutide would improve adherence and reduce gastrointestinal adverse events (GI-AEs) compared with the label-recommended regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Research Design and Methods

A total of 104 patients with T2D were randomized to label-recommended titration (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg at 4-week intervals) or flexible titration (starting at 0.0675 mg [measured as five clicks made by the dose selector dial], with gradual increases by 0.0675 mg/week and delays for GI-AEs) for 26 weeks.

Results

While final doses were similar between groups, only 2% of patients in the flexible arm withdrew due to GI-AEs vs. 19% in the label arm (P = 0.005). The flexible arm reported less nausea (45.1% vs. 64.2%; P = 0.051) and asthenia (9.8% vs. 24.5%; P = 0.047), with fewer days experiencing nausea (2.88 vs. 6.3 days; P = 0.017). HbA1c and BMI changes were similar between groups.

Conclusions

Slower, flexible titration improved adherence and reduced adverse events without compromising efficacy.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide for chronic weight management.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched (inception to September 8, 2021) using keywords "semaglutide" and "obesity", "weight", "high dose", "high-dose", or "2.4".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with published results were included. Publications studying the oral or < 2.4 mg formulation of semaglutide were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Four phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials demonstrated efficacy of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide compared with placebo for weight loss. Study populations included patients with overweight or obesity (STEP 1, STEP 3, and STEP 4) or patients with diabetes and with overweight or obesity (STEP 2). Lifestyle interventions for diet and exercise were included for all participants. Weight loss from baseline was significant for all studies, and secondary outcomes demonstrated cardiometabolic improvements including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and lipid profiles. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, but the medication was otherwise well tolerated.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

High-dose semaglutide offers significant weight-lowering potential and favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and glycemic indices. Clinicians and patients should consider the route and frequency of administration, adverse effect profile, and cost when choosing an antiobesity medication. The importance of concomitant lifestyle interventions should be emphasized.

Conclusions

High-dose once-weekly semaglutide can significantly reduce weight, and although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, it is generally well tolerated.

### Less frequent dosing of GLP-1 receptor agonists as a viable weight maintenance strategy [^a34db51c]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide simulations assume once‐weekly doses of 2.4 mg for 120 weeks (including the dose escalation in Wilding et al.). After 120 weeks, various reduced dosing frequencies are implemented as follows: every 7, 10, 14, and 28 days, plus the placebo. Similarly, tirzepatide simulations assume once‐weekly doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg for 120 weeks (including the dose escalation in Jastreboff et al.), after which dosing matches the reduced frequencies used for semaglutide.

Figure 1 predicts the change in BW for these regimens. For each drug and dose size, BW initially decreases and then levels off after 120 weeks of once‐weekly dosing. At 120 weeks, BW increases for virtual patients who reduce dosing frequency and plateaus by 240 weeks. As expected, lower dose frequencies reduce BW loss at 240 weeks. However, the reduction in BW loss is not proportional to the reduction in dose frequency. For instance, switching from one dose per week to one dose every 2 weeks reduces the steady‐state BW loss from 17% to 12% for a 2.4‐mg dose of semaglutide (Figure 1A). That is, switching from one dose per week to one dose every 2 weeks reduces the dose frequency by 50% but maintains 72% of the BW loss for semaglutide.

FIGURE 1
BW loss remains high after reducing dose frequency. After weight loss plateaus with once‐weekly dosing, virtual patients increase their dosing interval (denoted) from 7 days to 10 days (green), 14 days (purple), or 28 days (brown) or retain a 7‐day dosing interval (blue). The red dashed curve depicts a patient who is always on the placebo (PBO 1), and the red dot dashed curve depicts a patient who switches from once‐weekly dosing to the placebo after weight loss plateaus (PBO 2). Black markers show weight loss data from Jastreboff et al. (semaglutide in panel A) and Wilding et al. (tirzepatide in other three panels) for the placebo (square markers) and the drug (circle markers). BW, body weight; PBO 1, patient always takes placebo; PBO 2, patient switches to placebo after 120 weeks on the drug. [Color figure can be viewed at]

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^dd0823dd]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Persons on Daily Injectable GLP1RA

Persons on daily injectable GLP1RA (exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide) who interchange to oral semaglutide may take their first dose the day after discontinuation of previous therapy. As mentioned by Evans et al. a detailed explanation of the method of drug administration must be shared with the patient. Oral semaglutide usage may be associated with gastrointestinal side effects, but these are usually mild and transient.

If this interchange is prompted by lack of tolerability, oral semaglutide should be initiated at 3 mg/day for 1 month, after which the dose can be up-titrated. If the shift is due to lack of efficacy of 10 µg twice daily (BD) exenatide, 20 µg once daily (OD) lixisenatide, or 1.2 mg once daily (OD) liraglutide, one may consider initiating oral semaglutide at 7 mg/day. While some experts propose a 14 mg/day starting dosage for persons on 1.8 mg liraglutide, we suggest a more cautious approach, to minimize potential side effects and ensure patient comfort. These suggestions are based only on expert opinion of the authors and previously published suggestions.

If the switch is requested for reasons of convenience, i.e. to avoid injectable therapy, a 3 mg oral semaglutide dose can be used to substitute for 5 µg BD exenatide, 10 µg OD lixisenatide, or 0.6 mg OD liraglutide. Although the manufacturers do not provide equivalent doses of different GLP-1RAs, these have been proposed previously by other experts. People on a higher dose of these injectables can be directly transitioned to 7 mg oral semaglutide.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^98c73f1e]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg — implementation and safety considerations for adults with obesity: Given the stated net benefit, semaglutide 2.4 mg "may be prioritized over other approved AOMs for the long-term treatment of obesity for most patients." It "has glucoregulatory benefits and is also approved for the treatment of T2DM." Adverse effects are noted as it "may delay gastric emptying with adverse effects of nausea and vomiting," and "gradual dose titration may help mitigate these adverse effects." Class-level risks are flagged as "Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) have been associated with increased risk of pancreatitis and gallbladder disease," and semaglutide "is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2."

### Real-world hbAchanges and prescription characteristics among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients initiating treatment with once weekly semaglutide for diabetes [^65c696c1]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are a class of antihyperglycemic drugs that were first approved for treatment of patients with T2DM in 2005. GLP-1 RAs have been shown to decrease HbA 1c levels by at least 1% and to have positive impacts on weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels. GLP1- RAs are recommended for patients who need to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia and to help promote heathy weight management. Once-weekly semaglutide for diabetes (OW sema T2D) is a GLP-1 RA administered weekly as a subcutaneous injection first approved by the FDA in 2017. In the Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) clinical trials, OW sema T2D was effective at lowering HbA 1c levels in patients with T2DM. Across the SUSTAIN trials, a 1.0 mg dose of OW sema T2D was shown to reduce HbA 1c by 1.5–1.8% after 30–56 weeks. Additionally, patients using OW sema T2D reduced their body weight significantly more than patients who used the DPP-4, SGLT-2, daily subcutaneous GLP-1 RA, once weekly subcutaneous GLP-1 RA and insulin medications tested in the trials. Recently, results from the SUSTAIN-FORTE trial showed that patients on a 2.0 mg dose of OW sema T2D had their HbA 1c levels reduced by an average of 2.1%. 27 Dosing instructions for OW sema T2D recommend an initial dose of 0.25 mg weekly and that this dose be increased to 0.50 mg weekly after 4 weeks. After 4 weeks at the 0.50 mg dose, a 1.0 mg weekly dose may be used if the patient needs further glycemic control. At the time this study was conducted, the 1.0 mg weekly dose was the maximum dose; a 2.0 mg weekly dose was approved in 2022 and this dose can be prescribed if additional glycemic control is needed.

### Coadministered cagrilintide and semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^508b4d8c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg has established weight-loss and cardiovascular benefits, and cagrilintide at a dose of 2.4 mg has shown promising results in early-phase trials; the efficacy of the combination (known as CagriSema) on weight loss in persons with either overweight and coexisting conditions or obesity is unknown.

Methods

In a phase 3a, 68-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial, we enrolled adults without diabetes who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or higher or a BMI of 27 or higher with at least one obesity-related complication. Participants were randomly assigned in a ratio of 21:3:3:7 to receive the combination of semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg and cagrilintide at a dose of 2.4 mg, semaglutide alone at a dose of 2.4 mg, cagrilintide alone at a dose of 2.4 mg, or placebo, plus lifestyle interventions for all groups. The coprimary end points were the relative change in body weight and a reduction of 5% or more in body weight from baseline to week 68 with cagrilintide-semaglutide as compared with placebo. Body-weight reductions of 20% or more, 25% or more, and 30% or more were assessed as confirmatory secondary end points. Effect estimates were assessed with the treatment-policy estimand (consistent with the intention-to-treat principle). Safety was assessed.

Results

A total of 3417 participants underwent randomization, with 2108 assigned to receive cagrilintide-semaglutide, 302 to receive semaglutide, 302 to receive cagrilintide, and 705 to receive placebo. The estimated mean percent change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -20.4% with cagrilintide-semaglutide as compared with -3.0% with placebo (estimated difference, -17.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -18.1 to -16.6; P < 0.001). Participants receiving cagrilintide-semaglutide were more likely than those receiving placebo to reach weight-loss targets of 5% or more, 20% or more, 25% or more, and 30% or more (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Gastrointestinal adverse events (affecting 79.6% in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group and 39.9% in the placebo group), including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain, were mainly transient and mild-to-moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Cagrilintide-semaglutide provided significant and clinically relevant body-weight reductions in adults with overweight or obesity, as compared with placebo. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; REDEFINE 1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05567796.).
