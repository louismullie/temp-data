## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended LDL-C goal for patients with diabetes and ASCVD, and how to apply it clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, up-to-date guideline source. Then, I should verify the exact LDL-C target and whether it is framed as a percentage reduction or an absolute goal. Next, I will check the strength of evidence and whether the recommendation is the same across ages. After that, I should review add-on therapy thresholds and alternatives if statins are not tolerated. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting guidance and synthesize a practical, reference-aligned recommendation with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the guideline anchor. The 2025 ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes is the most current, high-credibility source for lipid management in people with diabetes, including those with established ASCVD, so I should prioritize those recommendations and verify the exact LDL-C goal language used there [^notfound].

> I will now examine the specific recommendation. For adults with diabetes and clinical ASCVD, the ADA 2025 recommends high-intensity statin therapy to achieve an LDL-C reduction of at least 50% from baseline and to reach an LDL-C goal of less than 55 mg/dL, which is less than 1.4 mmol/L. This applies irrespective of age, and if this goal is not achieved on maximally tolerated statin therapy, the ADA advises adding ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor with proven benefit in this population [^115GfDUL] [^113XtMp8].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence and whether this is consistent across documents. The ADA assigns a Grade A recommendation to high-intensity statin therapy in diabetes with ASCVD and explicitly endorses the less-than-55 mg/dL target with add-on therapy when needed, which aligns with contemporary risk-based approaches that treat diabetes with ASCVD as very high risk and endorse aggressive LDL-C lowering to reduce recurrent events [^115GfDUL] [^113XtMp8].

> Hold on, I should verify how this relates to broader cardiovascular guidelines. The ESC/EAS 2019 guideline similarly places patients with diabetes and ASCVD in the very-high-risk category and recommends an LDL-C goal of less than 55 mg/dL with at least a 50% reduction from baseline, reinforcing the same numeric target and intensification strategy endorsed by the ADA [^111TifyJ].

> Next, I should review add-on therapy details and alternatives. If the less-than-55 mg/dL goal is not achieved on maximally tolerated statin, the ADA recommends adding ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor; for statin intolerance, bempedoic acid is a reasonable alternative that has shown ASCVD risk reduction in high-risk adults, including those with diabetes, and can be used as part of a statin-free regimen when needed [^115GfDUL] [^117QyuKf].

> But wait, what if someone cites older ADA guidance suggesting a less-than-70 mg/dL target for diabetes with ASCVD. I need to check the timeline. The shift to less than 55 mg/dL for diabetes with ASCVD is a 2025 update; prior ADA guidance emphasized less than 70 mg/dL for very-high-risk diabetes, so the correct, current target is less than 55 mg/dL, superseding earlier thresholds [^115GfDUL].

> I should confirm monitoring cadence and practical implementation. A lipid panel should be checked 4 to 12 weeks after initiating or changing therapy to assess adherence and response, then every 3 to 12 months thereafter, with therapy intensified every 6 to 12 weeks until the LDL-C goal is achieved; this cadence is consistent with ACC/AHA and NLA guidance on monitoring and titration to reach risk-based LDL-C goals [^115GmjJN] [^112sods7].

> Let me synthesize the final, clinically actionable answer. For patients with diabetes and established ASCVD, the recommended LDL-C goal is less than 55 mg/dL, with a mandatory reduction of at least 50% from baseline; if this is not achieved on maximally tolerated high-intensity statin, add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor, and if statins are not tolerated, consider bempedoic acid as an alternative pathway to reach the goal [^115GfDUL] [^113XtMp8] [^117QyuKf].

---

For patients with diabetes and ASCVD, the recommended LDL-C goal is **< 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L)** with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline [^115GfDUL] [^113XtMp8]. If this goal is not achieved on maximally tolerated statin therapy, add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor [^115GfDUL] [^113eCvmi]. For patients who cannot tolerate statins, use bempedoic acid or a PCSK9 inhibitor as alternatives [^115GfDUL] [^117QyuKf]. These targets are supported by ADA 2025 and align with ESC/EAS guidance for very-high-risk patients [^111TifyJ].

---

## Recommended LDL-C goals

The ADA 2025 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes provide **clear recommendations** for LDL-C management in patients with diabetes and ASCVD:

- **Primary goal**: LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline [^115GfDUL] [^113XtMp8].
- **Secondary goal**: If LDL-C < 55 mg/dL is not achieved on maximally tolerated statin therapy, add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor [^115GfDUL] [^113eCvmi].
- **Alternative therapy**: For statin-intolerant patients, consider bempedoic acid or a PCSK9 inhibitor [^115GfDUL] [^117QyuKf].

---

## Rationale for aggressive LDL-C lowering

Patients with diabetes and ASCVD are at **very high cardiovascular risk**, and aggressive LDL-C lowering is essential to reduce recurrent cardiovascular events. The "lower is better" paradigm is supported by robust evidence demonstrating that reducing LDL-C to very low levels significantly reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [^117K2Wwx] [^11549Uar].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting LDL-C goals

Several **major clinical trials and guidelines** support the aggressive LDL-C targets in this population:

| **Study/guideline** | **Key findings/recommendations** |
|-|-|
| ADA 2025 | - LDL-C < 55 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline <br/> - Add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor if goal not achieved [^115GfDUL] [^113XtMp8] |
| ESC/EAS 2019 | - LDL-C < 55 mg/dL for very high-risk patients <br/> - ≥ 50% reduction from baseline [^111TifyJ] |
| FOURIER trial | - PCSK9 inhibitor significantly reduced LDL-C and cardiovascular events in high-risk patients [^notfound] |
| IMPROVE-IT | - Ezetimibe added to statin therapy reduced cardiovascular events in high-risk patients [^notfound] |

---

## Practical implementation strategies

Achieving these aggressive LDL-C goals often requires **combination therapy** and careful monitoring:

- **Initial therapy**: High-intensity statin (e.g. atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) [^115GfDUL].
- **Add-on therapy**: If LDL-C remains ≥ 55 mg/dL, add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor [^115GfDUL] [^113eCvmi].
- **Monitoring**: Reassess lipid levels 4–12 weeks after initiation or adjustment of therapy, then every 3–12 months [^115GmjJN].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Emphasize diet, exercise, weight management, and smoking cessation [^117JUPp4].

---

## Challenges and considerations

Despite clear guidelines, many patients **fail to achieve LDL-C goals** due to therapeutic inertia, statin intolerance, or patient adherence issues. Clinicians should proactively address these barriers through patient education, shared decision-making, and appropriate use of combination therapies [^111Kajbt] [^112qQVLo].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Primary goal**: LDL-C < 55 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline [^115GfDUL] [^113XtMp8].
- **Add-on therapy**: Ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor if goal not achieved on statin [^115GfDUL] [^113eCvmi].
- **Alternative therapy**: Bempedoic acid or PCSK9 inhibitor for statin-intolerant patients [^115GfDUL] [^117QyuKf].
- **Monitoring**: Regular lipid panels to assess adherence and efficacy [^115GmjJN].

---

The recommended LDL-C goal for patients with diabetes and ASCVD is **< 55 mg/dL with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline**. If this goal is not achieved, escalate therapy with ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor, and consider bempedoic acid or a PCSK9 inhibitor for statin intolerance.

ASCVD risk assessment and treatment goals — ASCVD risk has been classified into 4 categories, and the NLA Expert Panel recommends consideration of the use of moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels, for patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, based on RCT results that demonstrate a benefit in these patients at all levels of baseline lipids. Lifestyle therapies should be emphasized and monitored in all patients with elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol, whether or not pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia management is used. Risk assessment will often proceed according to the following steps: Step 1 — identify high- and very high–risk conditions, if present, including Clinical ASCVD and Diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) with ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage (estimated glomerular filtration rate, < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), and high risk conditions such as LDL-C of ≥ 190 mg/dL (severe hypercholesterolemia phenotype) or Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factors.

Cholesterol reduction — Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline recommendations specify statin treatment thresholds, targets, and monitoring for adults at metabolic risk. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 5.9 mmol/L), we recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L), we recommend a 10-year risk for ASCVD should be calculated. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes and a 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, we recommend high-intensity statin therapy either to achieve an LDL-C goal < 100 mg/dL (< 2.6 mmol/L) or an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes and a 10-year risk of 5% to 7.5%, we recommend moderate statin therapy as an option after consideration of risk reduction, adverse events, drug interactions, and individual preferences, to achieve either an LDL-C goal < 130 mg/dL (< 3.4 mmol/L) or an LDL-C reduction of 30% to 50%. In individuals with metabolic risk, without diabetes, on statin therapy, we suggest monitoring glycemia at least annually to detect new-onset diabetes mellitus. In individuals aged > 75 years without diabetes and a 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, we recommend discussing the benefits of statin therapy with the patient based on expected benefits vs possible risks/side effects; decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis and statin therapy should be calibrated to reach the recommended LDL targets.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111KzxVa]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease risk management in diabetes — risk‑based statin therapy and LDL targets state that the evidence is strong for people with diabetes aged 40–75 years, and current guidelines recommend that in people with diabetes who are at higher cardiovascular risk, especially those with one or more ASCVD risk factors, high-intensity statin therapy should be prescribed to reduce LDL cholesterol by ≥ 50% from baseline and to achieve the recommended LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). Since baseline LDL cholesterol may be difficult to ascertain in practice, a focus on an LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) rather than percent reduction in LDL cholesterol is recommended, and it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy if LDL goal is not achieved; while there are no randomized controlled trials specifically assessing cardiovascular outcomes of adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statin therapy in primary prevention, a meta-analysis suggests that there is a cardiovascular benefit of adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to treatment for people at high risk.

National Lipid Association — ASCVD risk categories and atherogenic cholesterol targets are organized as follows: For low risk (0–1 major ASCVD risk factors), treatment goals are Non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL; for moderate risk (≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors), goals are Non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL; for high risk (criteria include ≥ 3 major ASCVD risk factors; diabetes mellitus [type 1 or 2]; CKD stage 3B or 4; LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL; or quantitative risk score reaching the high-risk threshold), goals are Non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL; for very high risk (ASCVD; diabetes mellitus with ≥ 2 other major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage), goals are Non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL. For patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, consideration should be given to use of moderate or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels.

### Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: what are their effects on the lipid profile? [^112qfEdb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Although absolute risk varies as a spectrum among a group of individuals, the National Lipid Association (NLA) currently defines only two risk categories for patients with diabetes: very high risk and high risk. The very-high-risk category for diabetes includes not only secondary prevention patients (i.e. those with prior clinical ASCVD events) but also primary prevention patients with ≥ 2 other major risk factors: low HDL-C (< 40 mg/dL [< 1.04 mmol/L]), hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) or on antihypertensive medication, smoking, family history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) in a male first-degree relative < 55 years of age or in a female first-degree relative < 65 years of age, age (men ≥ 45 years of age; women ≥ 55 years of age), or evidence of end-organ damage (albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g [> 3.39 mg/mmol], CKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate > 60 mL/min/1.73 m²], or retinopathy). The high-risk category for diabetes includes primary prevention patients (i.e. no recognized prior clinical ASCVD events) with ≤ 1 other major ASCVD risk factor and no evidence of end-organ damage. While not defining lower limits for atherogenic cholesterol goals, for very-high-risk patients with diabetes, the specific lipid targets of non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and apo B, have treatment goals of < 100 mg/dL [< 2.59 mmol/L], < 70 mg/dL [< 1.81 mmol/L], and < 80 mg/dL [< 0.80 g/L], respectively. For high-risk patients with diabetes, the specific lipid targets of non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and apo B have treatment goals of < 130 mg/dL [< 3.37 mmol/L], < 100 mg/dL [< 2.59 mmol/L], and < 90 mg/dL [< 0.90 g/L], respectively. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) currently also describes only two categories of risk for patients with diabetes. Targeted atherogenic cholesterol particle goals (i.e. non-HDL-C, LDL-C, apo B) are similar to those of the NLA, with the added targeted LDL-P goal of < 1000 nmol/L for very-high-risk and < 1200 nmol/L for high-risk patients, consistent with the population percentile cut-points and equivalent to apo B < 80 mg/dL [< 0.80 g/L] and < 90 mg/dL [0.9 g/L], respectively (Table 1). Recommendations for dyslipidemia management in diabetes, utilizing lifestyle changes and lipid-lowering agents (e.g. statins, possibly in combination with a fibrate, niacin, omega-3 fatty acids, or ezetimibe) that target atherogenic cholesterol particles to specific goals determined by absolute risk, have recently been published.

Optimization of lipid-lowering treatment in patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia

In our opinion, the stepwise approach to intensification of lipid-lowering treatment in patients with diabetes (as recommended by ESC) (Fig. 3) should be replaced with a one-step intensive lipid lowering treatment strategy to follow the abovementioned paradigms and to really prevent first and recurring CVD events.

Moreover, with the advent of novel therapies and those expected to be available soon, we now have the potential to offer effective individualized treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes. The main rules to remember to be effective with lipid lowering therapy (LLT) are: (1) correctly assess the ASCVD risk of the diabetic patient; (2) determine the baseline LDL-C level to be able to calculate the expected absolute LDL-C reduction needed for your patient to reach their target; (3) explore the full lipid and lipoprotein profile to tailor the therapy to the specific dyslipidemia.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115GfDUL]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in diabetes — secondary prevention lipid management specifies targets and add-on options: High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for all people with diabetes and ASCVD to obtain an LDL cholesterol reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL cholesterol goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L). The addition of ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended if this goal is not achieved on maximum tolerated statin therapy. Figure 10.4 directs: Use lifestyle and high-intensity statin therapy to reduce LDL cholesterol by ≥ 50% from baseline to a goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L); add ezetimibe or a PCSK9-directed therapy with demonstrated benefit if LDL cholesterol goals are not met on maximally tolerated statin therapy; and use an alternative lipid-lowering treatment for those who are statin intolerant, including PCSK9 inhibitor with monoclonal antibody treatment, bempedoic acid, or PCSK9 inhibitor with siRNA inclisiran.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^115e1AQY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Preceding the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines (hereafter referred to as the "2013 guidelines" or simply "guidelines"), LDL‐C goals were < 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single CVD risk factor, < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for patients with 2 or more risk factors, and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for patients with known CVD or risk factor equivalent. 4 The guidelines were revised in 2013 to recommend moving away from a "treating to goal" approach with respect to LDL‐C 1 and instead focus on treating with the most appropriate statin intensity based on the patient's risk. The 4 statin benefit groups described in the guidelines are (1) patients with clinical ASCVD, (2) adult patients with LDL‐C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), (3) patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL), and (4) patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL; primary prevention). 1 With some exceptions for age and risk, in general, high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate 10‐year ASCVD risk and engage in patient‐clinician discussions to determine an appropriate course of action. 5 In addition, the 2013 guidelines no longer recommend monitoring LDL‐C to assess achievement of a particular LDL‐C goal, but instead recommend monitoring LDL‐C to determine adherence and anticipated therapeutic response.

Lipid management

The presence of diabetic dyslipidemia in patients with T2DM is, at least in part, a cause of CVD. Moreover, diabetic dyslipidemia, including elevated triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), is associated with increased CV events, especially in high-risk populations. Accounting for metabolic dyslipidemia in CVD risk stratification is necessary for patients with T2DM.

Lipid targets

The concept of "lower is better" regarding LDL levels has been supported for reducing the risk of CVD in patients with T2DM and CVD. The ADA guidelines recommend that lifestyle interventions be initiated for individuals with abnormal triglyceride levels (> 150 mg/dL) and/or HDL-C levels (< 40 mg/dL for men, 50 mg/dL for women), and an LDL-C target reduction of ≥ 50% or more from baseline is reasonable for patients with diabetes and 10-year ASCVD risk of 20% or higher. The ESC/EASD guidelines recommend an LDL-C target of < 55 mg/dL for those with T2DM and at very high CV risk. The AHA guidelines recommend an LDL-C target reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline for those with diabetes and clinical CVD. The ESC established goals for LDL-C based on level of ASCVD risk. With respect to lipid targets, the AHA/ADA and the ESC/EASD guideline are shown in Table 7.

Very high risk — population, goals, and therapy — includes patients with clinical evidence of ASCVD and those with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 and ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage, who have aggressive atherogenic cholesterol goals of non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL; for those at very high risk, pharmacotherapy is recommended when atherogenic cholesterol levels are above goal, and pharmacotherapy with a moderate- or high-intensity statin is considered a therapeutic option even at lower pretreatment levels, with use of a moderate- or high-intensity statin stated as something that should be considered in patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels; end-stage (stage 5) chronic kidney disease is associated with very high risk for ASCVD events, randomized controlled trials of lipid-altering therapies have not consistently shown benefits in this group, and goals for atherogenic cholesterol levels in stage 5 CKD have not been defined and are instead considered a matter of clinical judgment.

NLA Part 1 recommendations — ASCVD risk categories define atherogenic cholesterol goals and thresholds to consider drug therapy as follows: Low risk (0–1 major ASCVD risk factors; consider other risk indicators) targets Non–HDL-C < 130 and LDL-C < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 190 or LDL-C ≥ 160. Moderate risk (≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors; consider quantitative risk scoring and other risk indicators) keeps goals < 130 and < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 160 or LDL-C ≥ 130. High risk (≥ 3 major ASCVD risk factors; diabetes mellitus [type 1 or 2]; CKD stage 3B or 4; LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL; or a quantitative risk score reaching the high-risk threshold) keeps goals < 130 and < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 130 or LDL-C ≥ 100. Very high risk (ASCVD; diabetes mellitus with ≥ 2 other major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage) sets goals Non–HDL-C < 100 and LDL-C < 70, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 100 or LDL-C ≥ 70. For patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, consideration should be given to use of moderate or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels.

### Lipid-lowering in diabetes: an update [^115YbwQj]. Atherosclerosis (2024). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is accelerated in people with diabetes. Dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation play a role via a variety of mechanisms operative in the artery wall. In addition, some unique features predispose people with type 1 diabetes to accelerated atherosclerosis. Various organizations have created guidelines that provide advice regarding screening, risk assessment, and roadmaps for treatment to prevent ASCVD in diabetes. Management of dyslipidemia, especially with statins, has proven to be of immense benefit in the prevention of clinical CVD. However, since many patients fail to attain the low levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) recommended in these guidelines, supplemental therapy, such as the addition of ezetimibe, bempedoic acid or PCSK9 inhibitors, is often required to reach LDL goals. As a result, the upfront use of combination therapies, particularly a statin plus ezetimibe, is a rational initial approach. The addition to statins of drugs that specifically lower triglyceride levels has not proven beneficial, although the addition of icosapent-ethyl has been shown to be of value, likely by mechanisms independent of triglyceride lowering. Newer treatments in development, including apoC-III and ANGPTL3 inhibitors, seem promising in further reducing apoB-containing lipoproteins.

Conclusions

The above recommendations aim to optimize LLT in high-risk patients with diabetes (which should also refer to those with prediabetes/metabolic disturbances), where ASCVD risk is often underestimated and undertreated. In fact, fewer than 30% of type II diabetes patients reach their LDL-C targets, irrespective of CVD risk. Due to the concise and practical form of this guidance paper, we have decided to mainly focus on the largest unmet need in diabetic patients — LDL-C goal achievement to clearly show that with the currently available LLTs and suitable approach we can easily be on the LDL-C target in this group of patients at high CVD risk. Thus, we do not discuss the role of non-HDL-C, which is now an equivalent lipid biomarker to LDL-C, the remnants — and their important role in CV risk prediction in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia, as well as apolipoprotein B (ApoB) — which has the largest predictive power, but it is still measured definitely too rarely. We are also aware that for some of the above suggested recommendations, additional outcome data is required. It is undoubtedly true for pitavastatin, which has been much less extensively investigated in comparison to rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, for which we still need real-world data. Further evidence is required for the use of early combination therapy, as well for the novel compounds, inclisiran and bempedoic acid. Further investigations and new data are also required for the approach suggested to promote the reduction of TG associated ASCVD residual risk with omega-3 acids. In this context, we are also awaiting new therapies that may further improve the suggested therapeutic paradigms, including evinacumab, apabetalone, and obicetrapib.

Overall, patients with diabetes should be carefully examined in terms of CV risk stratification (e.g. taking into consideration TOD, renal function, subclinical atherosclerosis, etc.), to define their lipid goals. We strongly suggest that, for such high-risk patients, LDL-C target should be achieved as early as possible to maximize CVD prevention.

1 INTRODUCTION

Secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by modification of risk factors is well‐established to slow disease progression and improve outcomes. Recommendations in cardiovascular society guidelines (e.g. of the European Society of Cardiology [ESC]) promote pharmacological control of risk factors of dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus (DM) — among others — and offer precise treatment goals for low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which have proven efficient and cost‐effective. However, treatment goal attainment with lipid‐lowering therapy remains poor in clinical trialsand real‐world settings, considerably worse compared to glycemic control in DM. Cardiovascular societies thus urge physicians to improve guideline implementation in secondary prevention of ASCVD — particularly in lipid‐lowering therapy.

In patients with DM, some evidence exists that better knowledge of disease management goals has been associated with better outcomes, including glycemic control. Thus far, little is known about the potential role of patient knowledge of treatment goals of lipid‐lowering therapy in cardiovascular disease, urging a further exploration and a comparison of dyslipidemia to DM.

In patient‐centered health care, there are several interacting factors that can influence this level of implementation. Physicians are challenged to indicate, inform about, prescribe, and maintain optimal therapy, while patients need to understand and use the information to manage and adhere to it. Recently, updated guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practicegive the highest class of recommendation to an informed discussion about cardiovascular disease risk and treatment benefits tailored to the needs of patients. An essential condition for this discussion is the assessment of disease‐related patient knowledge and information needs. Generally, information is understood as acquired through external sources, whereas knowledge is processed information that gains meaning in individual thinking. Within the context of health, patient knowledge can be acquired through information provided by physicians or other health professionals as well as other resources.

A perceived deficiency in disease‐related knowledge is thought to raise information needs which might influence patients' behavior regarding treatment decisions. For instance, patients with diabetes, especially those with comorbidities, have a high need for information, which may also influence secondary prevention efforts on the patient side of ASCVD. Understanding patient information needs might help to identify potential starting points for strategies to improve patient knowledge (e.g. of treatment goals) and thereby secondary prevention of ASCVD.

ESC/EAS 2019 dyslipidemia guidelines — Very high total cardiovascular (CV) risk groups are defined as documented cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 1 or type 2 diabetes (T1D or T2D), very high risk factor levels generating a 10-year cumulative risk score of > 10% for a first fatal CV event using SCORE, and chronic kidney disease (CKD); lower risks use SCORE thresholds of > 5% to 10% for high risk, 1% to 5% for moderate risk, and < 1% for low risk. Treatment goals by CV risk specify, for very high risk (secondary or primary prevention), an LDL-C goal of < 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) with a reduction of > 50% from baseline; for high risk, an LDL-C goal of < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) with at least 50% reduction if baseline LDL-C is between 1.8 and 3.5 mmol/L (70 and 135 mg/dL); for moderate risk, LDL-C < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL); and for low risk, LDL-C < 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL). For individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who have a second vascular event within 2 years while taking maximal tolerated statin doses, the guidelines suggest consideration of an LDL-C goal of < 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL).

How can we stratify cardiovascular risk in diabetes?

The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology approach

The 2013 AHA/ACC guidelines propose an approach based on the global risk estimation. The panel considers that patients with diabetes, either type 1 or 2, aged between 40 and 75 years, who have a baseline non-treated LDL-c between 70 and 189 mg/dL, should be stratified into a higher or a lower risk category to receive either high or moderate intensity treatment with statins. This categorization is based on the calculation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes.

The ACC/AHA calculator was developed to estimate the 10-year risk for the first ASCVD event (non-fatal myocardial infarction or CHD death, or fatal/non-fatal stroke) by entering definite risk factors. It uses a risk equation derived from a pool of 4 cohorts obtained from the American population. The 10-year risk is based on the first ASCVD event over a 10-year period among people previously free from ASCVD. The calculator should be used in non-Hispanic African Americans and in non-Hispanic whites in the range of 40–79 years of age. For patients with diabetes, the guidelines indicate intensive statin treatment for patients with an ASCVD risk above 7.5% in 10 years. If the risk is below this cut-off, moderate-intensity statin treatment is indicated.

The panel defines high-intensity treatment as the statin therapy able to reduce LDL-c in more than 50% from baseline. Moderate-intensity treatment is defined as the reduction of LDL-c in about 30 to < 50%. In patients aged less than 40 years, or above 75 years, the evidence of benefit is less clear. In these cases, when deciding to initiate or intensify statin therapy, the AHA/ACC panel consider reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD benefits, considering the preferences of the patient and the potential for adverse effects.

Type 2 diabetes dyslipidemia — statins are first-line and intensity is matched to ASCVD risk with monitoring. Unless contraindicated, a statin should be used as the first-line therapy for dyslipidemia in persons with T2D. High-risk patients (T2D with < 10% 10-year risk) should be started on moderate-intensity statin therapy, which results in an LDL-C reduction in the range of 30% to 40%. For persons at very high risk (10%–20% 10-year risk) and extreme risk (> 20% 10-year risk), high-intensity statin therapy, which lowers LDL-C by > 50% to 60%, should be started regardless of baseline LDL-C level. Lipids should initially be monitored at 6- to 12-week intervals and then at less frequent intervals (eg, 6 months) once at goal.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and lipid management in diabetes mellitus — persons with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes (T2D) without ASCVD and with less than 2 traditional risk factors should be assessed with one of the ASCVD risk calculators to determine initiation and intensity of lipid-lowering therapy, and clinicians should assess nontraditional ASCVD risk factors beyond a lipid panel to guide management when the initial shared decision is not self-evident. Manage persons with prediabetes and persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D) over the age of 40 in the same manner as those with T2D. In persons with high ASCVD risk, use a moderate-intensity statin regardless of DM type or status; in very high ASCVD risk (including family history of premature ASCVD in men < 55 y and women < 65 y), use a high-intensity statin regardless of baseline LDL-C level, and for extreme risk use a high-intensity statin plus other therapies as needed to achieve lipid targets. Treatment targets are specified by risk: high (LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, apolipoprotein B [apo B] < 90 mg/dL, non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL), very high (LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, apo B < 80 mg/dL, non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL), and extreme (LDL-C < 55 mg/dL, apo B < 70 mg/dL, non-HDL-C < 90 mg/dL). Statins are recommended for the initial treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Monitor efficacy every 6 to 12 wk and increase the dose or intensity of statin as needed to achieve goals; once targets are achieved, lipid panel or apo B can be monitored less often. Combining the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe with a statin may be considered when the desired lipid targets are not achieved with a maximally tolerated statin dose; alternately add bempedoic acid or consider adding icosapent ethyl (in persons with triglycerides 135 to 499 mg/dL) for ASCVD risk reduction. Management of hypertriglyceridemia in persons with high or very high ASCVD risk should begin with intensive lifestyle modification and statin therapy; in those on a maximally tolerated statin who have triglyceride concentrations ≥ 200 mg/dL and HDL-C < 40 mg/dL, add a fibrate or high-dose omega-3 fatty acid to achieve the desired apo B or non-HDL-C goal, and icosapent ethyl can be considered in persons with high or very high ASCVD risk.

Key Points for Practice
- A nonfasting plasma lipid profile can be obtained to estimate ASCVD risk and document baseline LDL-C in adults 20 years and older who are not on lipid-lowering therapy.
- Maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended for patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg per dL or greater.
- Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus.
- Patients without diabetes at intermediate risk of ASCVD with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin for a goal of 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. SECONDARY PREVENTION Based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-intensity statin therapy should be instituted with a goal of lowering LDL-C levels by 50% or more in patients with ASCVD up to 75 years of age.

If treatment is not tolerated, then moderate-intensity therapy should be used with a goal of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. High-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes who are at intermediate risk with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin. A 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels is recommended, and in high-risk patients a 50% or greater reduction is recommended. Selected Moderate-Strength Recommendations Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, the addition of nonstatin drug therapy should be considered at a threshold LDL-C level of at least 70 mg per dL on maximal statin therapy in patients with ASCVD at very high risk. Based on moderate-quality evidence from nonrandomized studies, the 10-year risk of a first ASCVD event can be assessed in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes and an LDL-C level of 70 to 189 mg per dL.

Patients with diabetes who have multiple ASCVD risk factors should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy with a goal of reducing LDL-C levels by 50% or more, according to data from RCTs.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease: highlights for the clinician of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines [^113e2uhq]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70–189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a < 140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

Evaluate and optimize lifestyle modifications, adherence to guideline-recommended statin therapy, risk factor control, and SASEs, and 3. Referral to RD/RDN. If 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, diabetes-specific risk enhancers, or subclinical atherosclerosis, increase to high-intensity statin therapy; among those with 10-year risk ≥ 20%, assess for ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction (and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL or non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL) on maximally-tolerated statin therapy and, if not met, may consider ezetimibe‡. If the initial risk criteria are not present, determine whether there is ≥ 30–49% LDL-C reduction (and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL or non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL) on at least moderate-intensity statin therapy; if not, increase to high-intensity statin therapy. Monitor adherence to lifestyle modifications, medications, and LDL-C response to therapy.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^117K2Wwx]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

In the management of other risk factors for ASCVD, such as blood pressure and blood glucose, a balance must be struck between the risk of having a high level (and accelerated atherosclerosis) and problems linked to too low a level (hypotension, hypoglycaemia). Management of LDL-C requires a distinct approach since there appears to be no 'downside' to profound lowering of this lipoprotein. The key question is: can we lower LDL-C into the proximity of the goals identified in the 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines without detriment to the patient? This is a particularly pertinent issue in secondary prevention where there is a perceived need to immediately and aggressively decrease the exposure of atherosclerotic lesions to LDL-C with the objective of inducing lesion stabilisation and regression.

### Transatlantic lipid guideline divergence: same data but different interpretations [^115m8mFL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Examining the Guidelines: Major Similarities But Differences in Interpretation of the Data

Both the 2018 AHA/ACC/MS Guideline and the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines employ a risk‐based approach to grade intensity of the intervention and use patient history, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data to identify individuals most likely to benefit from lipid‐lowering therapy. Both guidelines identify 4 major, mutually exclusive categories of patients likely to benefit from lipid‐lowering interventions, including those with clinical ASCVD, severe primary hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and primary prevention patients with high 10‐year risk for ASCVD. They recommend treatments based on the premise that the higher the baseline risk, the greater the absolute ASCVD risk reduction derived from the same reduction of LDL‐C. Some key differences in the interpretation of data include the following: definition of risk categories; employment of risk calculation systems that depend on ASCVD death (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE]) versus fatal and nonfatal ASCVD (Pooled Cohort Equations); use of atherosclerosis imaging tests to inform treatment decisions; value of employing LDL‐C goals, and, in selected hypertriglyceridemic patients, non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (non‐HDL‐C) and apoB goals, for clinical decision making; and use of pharmacotherapy that is based upon achieved LDL‐C levels. While both guidelines recognize that there is a continuum of risk, the ESC/EAS Guidelines proceed on the premise that ASCVD risk is a continuum from low to very high without categorizing people to primary and secondary prevention, while the AHA/ACC/MS Guideline maintains that differentiation between primary and secondary prevention is warranted based on the results of randomized controlled trials. The 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines provide a number of important updates to the previous ESC/EAS Guidelines of 2016 and among other key points, emphasize that lower LDL‐C is better and that the absolute LDL‐C reduction drives the clinical benefit (Data S1, Table S1). This perspective has led to new goals in high‐risk and very high‐risk patients, shifting the focus from high‐intensity statin to high‐intensity lipid‐lowering. The philosophical underpinnings of these documents and their divergent approaches to lipid lowering for ASCVD risk reduction are summarized in Table 1.

National Lipid Association — risk criteria details and special cases include quantitative risk thresholds, CKD definitions, severe hypercholesterolemia management, diabetes targets, and end-organ damage markers. The high-risk threshold is defined as ≥ 10% using Adult Treatment Panel III Framingham Risk Score for hard coronary heart disease, ≥ 15% using the 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations for hard ASCVD, or ≥ 25% using the Framingham long-term cardiovascular disease calculation. For CKD, stage 3B corresponds to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m2 and stage 4 to eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m2; risk calculators should not be used in these patients, and stage 5 CKD has no defined lipid treatment goals. If LDL-C is ≥ 190 mg/dL, severe hypercholesterolemia phenotype should be considered and a reduction of at least 50% is recommended. For patients with diabetes plus 1 major ASCVD risk factor, treating to a non–HDL-C goal of < 100 mg/dL (LDL-C of < 70 mg/dL) is considered a therapeutic option. End-organ damage is indicated by albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g, CKD with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, or retinopathy. Desirable levels for primary prevention are < 130 mg/dL for non–HDL-C and < 100 mg/dL for LDL-C; for very high risk patients they are < 100 mg/dL for non–HDL-C and < 70 mg/dL for LDL-C.

High-risk treatment targets and limits of risk equations — risk equations should generally not be used in patients already treated for dyslipidemia and should not be used in individuals with FH because they underestimate risk. The goals of therapy for patients at high risk are non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, with consideration given to drug therapy in those whose atherogenic cholesterol levels are higher than those goal levels, generally after a trial of lifestyle therapy. Drug treatment may be started concurrently with lifestyle therapy in some high-risk patients, such as those unlikely to attain goal atherogenic cholesterol without drug therapy (eg, LDL-C of ≥ 190 mg/dL) or with diabetes mellitus and 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factors.

Drug classes that lower LDL-C and are highlighted in green have proven benefits in CVOTs. – All patients at elevated ASCVD risk should receive a statin at the maximally tolerated dose unless there is a contraindication. If the baseline LDL-C is more than 50% above the goal, initial combination therapy with a statin plus ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, or a PCSK9 inhibitor should be instituted. The choice of the second or third agent to add to statin therapy is based on how much LDL-C lowering is required to reach the LDL-C goal. Whether treatment begins with a statin alone or in combination with another agent, therapy should be intensified every 6–12 weeks until the LDL-C goal is achieved.

Estimated Decline in ASCVD 10 With Statin Therapy

Assumptions included (1) for each 39‐mg/dL decline in LDL‐C, ASCVD events would fall 21% for ASCVD 10 ≥ 20% and 33% for ASCVD 10 < 20% 15; (2) LDL–C would fall 33% with moderate‐intensity and 51% with high‐intensity statin therapy, that is, the conservative end of the estimated 30% to < 50% LDL‐C reduction with moderate‐intensity and ≥ 50% decline with high‐intensity statins 6, 29; and (3) for patients with prior stroke or myocardial infarction in whom ASCVD 10 is not calculated, a 39% 10‐year risk was assigned. In subjects with angina or transient ischemic attack, a 10‐year risk of 31.5% was assigned. Estimates were derived as follows. Adults with clinical CHD have a ≥ 26% 10‐year risk of another CHD event. Patients with CHD risk equivalent status, excluding diabetes mellitus, 6 have a 10‐year CHD risk of > 20%. 20, 30, 31 Respective risks of 26% and 21% were multiplied by 1.5, which assumes ASCVD 10 event rates were 50% greater than 10‐year CHD risk alone. This assumption is conservative, as annual numbers of strokes (≈795 000) and myocardial infarctions (≈735 000) in the United States are similar. 1, 2

ASCVD 10, while not required for treating adults aged 21 to 79 years with LDL‐C ≥ 190 mg/dL, 6 was calculated to estimate absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed‐to‐treat (NNT). The ACC/AHA ASCVD risk calculator accepts ages 20 to 79 years and limits total cholesterol values to a maximum of 320 mg/dL. In NHANES 2007–2012, 0.59% of adults aged 21 to 79 years in the fasting sample used for this analysis had total cholesterol levels of > 320, and all of them had LDL‐C levels of ≥ 190 mg/dL. Total cholesterol values > 320 were entered as 320 in the ASCVD risk calculator.

The treatment of lipid disorders begins with lifestyle therapy to improve nutrition, physical activity, weight, and other factors that affect lipids. Secondary causes of lipid disorders should be addressed, and pharmacologic therapy initiated based on a patient's risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients at extreme ASCVD risk should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of < 55 mg/dL, and those at very high ASCVD risk should be treated to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. Treatment for moderate and high ASCVD risk patients may begin with a moderate-intensity statin to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, while the LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL for those at low risk. In all cases, treatment should be intensified, including the addition of other LDL-C-lowering agents (i.e., proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, colesevelam, or bempedoic acid) as needed to achieve treatment goals. When targeting triglyceride levels, the desirable goal is < 150 mg/dL. Statin therapy should be combined with a fibrate, prescription-grade omega-3 fatty acid, and/or niacin to reduce triglycerides in all patients with triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and icosapent ethyl should be added to a statin in any patient with established ASCVD or diabetes with ≥ 2 ASCVD risk factors and triglycerides between 135 and 499 mg/dL to prevent ASCVD events. Management of additional risk factors such as elevated lipoprotein(a) and statin intolerance is also described.

Goals and rules of lipid-lowering treatment in patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia

More than 1/3 of diabetic patients have atherogenic dyslipidemia, which further increases the risk of atherosclerotic CVD. As shown in the AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study, the presence of dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes significantly increased the risk of ASCVD (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.03–1.63) and coronary artery disease (HR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.14–1.93). In patients with diabetes and coexistence of lipid disorders, it is recommended to reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to < 1.8 mmol/l (< 70 mg/dl) and to achieve at least a reduction of 50% of the baseline value (Fig. 2).

In the case of lipid disorders in diabetic patients, practitioners should follow the principle: "the lower, the better", but also to strive for "the earlier, the better" as soon as possible and maintain it as long as possible, preferably throughout the patient's lifetime "the longer, the better". Such an approach will significantly reduce the risk of CVD in these patients. The paradigm of "the lower, the better" has been confirmed in hundreds of trials and meta-analyses, therefore we would like to explain the importance of the two additional rules.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC 2022 ECDP — Adults with diabetes without ASCVD and baseline LDL-C < 190 mg/dL on statin therapy for primary prevention: The guideline recommends that all adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes receive at least a moderate-intensity statin, and higher-risk subgroups (including reduced eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² and ankle brachial index < 0.9) are potential candidates for high-intensity statin therapy. For the small proportion with 10-year predicted ASCVD risk < 7.5% and no additional high-risk features, moderate-intensity statin therapy with anticipated LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) reduction 30%-49% is supported; soluble dietary fiber and phytosterols may also be considered. Because elevated non-HDL-C (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is common in diabetes, non-HDL-C thresholds are important to consider. If, despite adherence to lifestyle recommendations and moderate-intensity statin therapy, patients have < 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), consideration of intensification of therapy is indicated and routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted. If the response reaches a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue current therapy. If still inadequate after these steps, the patient and clinician may consider increasing the statin dose to a high-intensity statin. If high-intensity statin therapy still results in inadequate percent LDL-C reduction or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), the clinician and patient should enter a discussion focused on adding a nonstatin; ezetimibe 10 mg daily may be considered as the initial nonstatin agent for most patients when additional LDL-C lowering is desired.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^1147H4Bj]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

When deciding how aggressive an LDL-C-lowering regimen to prescribe, clinicians should be mindful that the absolute risk reduction is a function of both the absolute decrease in LDL-C concentration and the estimated ongoing ASCVD risk. The smaller the absolute drop in LDL-C, the less the relative risk reduction, and so the benefit gained from intervention depends on the risk status of the patient. At low LDL-C levels (eg, patients on statin) further lowering is recommended primarily for those in the highest risk categories. This approach is explored in figure 3 where we present typical patients with ASCVD at high/very high risk, who would fall into three of the categories of LDL-C goals set out in the guidelines.

Figure 3
Patient scenarios. Cases of patients at high ASCVD risk being ascribed to regimens of increasingly intensive LDL-C lowering. LDL-C and triglyceride levels are given in mmol/L (see online supplemental figure 1 for the mg/dL version). The predicted LDL-C reductions of 20% for ezetimibe and 60% for PCSK9i are based on average published responses. Case 1 is a patient with probable FH on the basis of his high LDL-C and sibling with diagnosed FH. Note, the additional 6% reduction on 40 mg rosuvastatin is based on the untreated LDL-C of 5.1 mmol/L; the 20% drop on ezetimibe is calculated from the LDL-C on 20 mg rosuvastatin. Case 2 is a woman with obesity, type 2 diabetes plus other risk factors (hypertension) with symptomatic ASCVD. Case 3 is a man with hypertension with repeat ASCVD events within a short time period (26 months). Note, when LDL-C levels are low — typically < 1.8 mmol/L — laboratory measurement can be problematic especially if lipoprotein(a) or plasma triglyceride levels are high. The guidelines recommend the use of non-HDL-C or apolipoprotein B as secondary measures to assess the need for further lipid-lowering action when LDL-C is low, as discussed in more detail.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^116bUaRu]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Lipid-lowering treatment — diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular risk: Lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to < 100 mg/dL is a recommended goal for individuals without overt cardiovascular disease (CVD); in those with overt CVD, LDL < 70 mg/dL is recommended. Statins are the first drug choice for reducing high cholesterol, and the ADA recommends that statin therapy should be initiated for all persons with diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In addition, statin therapy should be initiated for persons with diabetes without ASCVD risk factors who are ≥ 40 years old, and those with diabetes < 40 years of age who have one or more ASCVD risk factors (family history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, or albuminuria) should also be considered for statin therapy. The use of statins may be related to an increase in A1C levels, and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, some statins (e.g., moderate-intensity pitavastatin) have been found to improve glycemic control, whereas others (e.g., high-intensity atorvastatin) worsened it (Evidence Grade: A).

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^114EB8LN]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Risk assessment markers for ASCVD — Primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD require an accurate estimation of risk of both future and recurrent cardiovascular events, and the LDL-C level is the focus of this article and is a highly relevant biomarker (indicator) of ASCVD risk, with high LDL-C generally indicative of high ASCVD risk and very low LDL-C levels generally indicative of low ASCVD risk (in the absence of other major risk factors). In individuals with hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes, obesity, or metabolic syndrome, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apo B) offer superior risk assessment by accounting for all atherogenic particles, and the National Lipid Association (NLA) and other major guidelines recommend consideration of apo B or non–HDL-C as secondary targets, particularly in high-risk patients or when triglyceride levels are elevated; the level of ASCVD risk should inform intensity of treatment to lower LDL-C.

Diabetes aged 40–75 years — statin response targets and nonstatin discussion: For patients aged 40–75 years with diabetes who have elevated 10-year ASCVD risk and high-risk features or diabetes-specific risk enhancers, use of high-intensity statin therapy (anticipated LDL-C reduction ≥ 50%) is supported. If response is achieved with ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue current therapy and monitor. If high-intensity statin therapy results in < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), the clinician and patient should enter a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin medication, and if no additional medication is pursued, it is reasonable to continue current therapy and monitoring.

Table 1
ADA evidence grading system for clinical practice recommendations

These guidelines are based on numerous trials showing a benefit for statin therapy both as primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Trials like the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), proved beyond doubt that patients with type 2 diabetes and other risk factors for CVD should be treated with a statin, apparently disregarding their initial LDL cholesterol level. However, most of these trials did not set a goal LDL cholesterol level for treatment but examined the effect of a predetermined statin dose on the outcome. Extrapolated from these trials and from epidemiologic data, a goal LDL of 100 mg% seems adequate for the majority of patients. Yet because of the problematic interpretation of clinical trial data that was not inherent in its basic structure, alternative treatment goals have arisen, including a reduction of LDL by 40% (in patients where LDL reduction could not reach the 100 mg% goal) or a reduction below 70 mg% (in very-high-risk patients — those with prior cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndromes).

Some questions are raised from these guidelines. First, the overall efficacy of statin use for primary prevention raises the question who should not get a statin, i.e. what is the evidence for their use as primary prevention in diabetic individuals. Should a statin be given on an LDL-based treat-to-target goal (as stated in the guidelines, reduce the LDL below 100 mg%), existence of other vascular risk factors, age, or regardless of the measured cholesterol at predetermined doses (similar to current use of aspirin).

The second question is what is the evidence for the target LDL in secondary prevention in high-risk diabetic individuals — how aggressive should we be, and should we limit ourselves to an LDL-targeted therapy versus a comprehensive high-dose statin strategy. Again there is the question of the target LDL versus the "evidence-based" fixed dose?

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^117QyuKf]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

LDL-C pharmacological treatment in adults — statin-first approach with evidence-based add-ons. Patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) may benefit from pharmacotherapy, including those with very high baseline LDL-C levels suggestive of a genetic cause such as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), individuals with multiple risk factors for ASCVD, or those already diagnosed with ASCVD. Statin therapy, which is the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for LDL-C reduction, reduces ASCVD risk in most individuals, and based on meta-analysis of 27 statin RCTs, for every 1 mmol/L (∼39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C there is a corresponding 22% reduction in ASCVD event risk. It should be noted that statin therapy does not seem to reduce ASCVD in adults receiving hemodialysis or those who have significant heart failure, and stopping statin therapy in these individuals is not advised if it is well tolerated. Given variability in individual response even at full therapeutic doses, routine monitoring for both efficacy and tolerability is essential to guide ongoing management. Based upon contemporary clinical trial evidence, LDL-C lowering therapy should start with statins, then if response is incomplete or a tolerated statin regimen cannot be found, nonstatin LDL-C lowering pharmacotherapy should be considered, with medicine selection based on factors including safety, tolerability, LDL-C lowering efficacy, RCT evidence supporting use, desirable LDL-C and expectations of treatment, patient preference, convenience and cost of therapy, and availability. Nonstatin pharmacotherapy also reduces ASCVD risk, with randomized trials showing risk reduction when ezetimibe is added to moderate intensity statin and when proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody inhibition (PCSK9i) is added to high-intensity statin therapy. Additional options include bempedoic acid, which has demonstrated ASCVD risk reduction in high-risk adults (especially those with diabetes mellitus) on low dose or no statin because of intolerance, and high dose icosapent ethyl, which has minimal impact on LDL-C but demonstrated ASCVD risk reduction in adults with established ASCVD or high-risk patients with diabetes with hypertriglyceridemia. While niacin is no longer recommended as a routine therapy for LDL-C lowering or ASCVD risk reduction due to lack of incremental benefit when added to statins in contemporary trials, it may have a limited role and may be considered in rare cases of multidrug intolerance or if cost or access constraints limit other options. Bile acid sequestrants can be used but have a high degree of limiting side effects and have been mostly abandoned because of their side effects and modest potency.

Diabetes mellitus lipid targets — We recommend the use of apo B measurements as this is more accurate than non-HDL-C and predicts ASCVD risk more accurately than LDL-C. In persons at high risk, the lipid targets should be LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, apo B < 90 mg/dL, and non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL. In persons at very high risk for ASCVD, the lipid targets should be LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, apo B < 80 mg/dL, and non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL.

### Transatlantic lipid guideline divergence: same data but different interpretations [^112c8bzr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Differences also emerge in the approach to treating older patients with ASCVD. The AHA/ACC/MS Guideline suggests that it is reasonable to treat patients with ASCVD > 75 years of age with a moderate or high‐intensity statin after evaluation of the potential for ASCVD risk reduction, adverse effects, drug–drug interactions, patient frailty, and preferences (class IIa, B‐NR). The ESC/EAS Guidelines contend that treatment with statins should be the same in older (> age 65 years) patients with ASCVD as in younger patients (class I, A), with the provision that if there is significant renal impairment or the potential for drug–drug interactions, the statin should be started at a low dose and titrated upward to achieve LDL‐C treatment goals (class I, C).

Diabetes Mellitus

Both sets of guidelines recognize that diabetes mellitus is an intermediate‐ to high‐risk condition in which additional information may help to more reliably quantify risk. The AHA/ACC/MS Guideline recommends the use of at least moderate‐intensity statins for all patients with diabetes mellitus (class I, A), but those with multiple risk factors may reasonably be treated with a high‐intensity statin (class IIa, B‐NR). If the clinician chooses to use the Pooled Cohort Equations for further risk stratification, patients with a ≥ 20% 10‐year risk may be considered for high‐intensity statins, or, if needed, ezetimibe to lower LDL‐C by ≥ 50% (class IIb, C‐LD). A weak recommendation is given for the initiation of statins in patients who have diabetes mellitus and who are > 75 years of age (class IIb, C‐LD). Younger patients 20 to 39 years of age who have had type 2 diabetes mellitus for ≥ 10 years, or > 20 years of type 1 diabetes mellitus, and have evidence of end‐organ involvement or an ankle–brachial index < 0.9 also have a weak recommendation for initiation of statin therapy (class IIb‐C‐LD).

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^111ykjRF]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

The leadership of the National Lipid Association convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. An Executive Summary of those recommendations was previously published. This document provides support for the recommendations outlined in the Executive Summary. The major conclusions include (1) an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis, the key underlying process contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; (2) reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies; (3) the intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event; (4) atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting a clinical ASCVD event. Therefore, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies; (5) for patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk; (6) nonlipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus; and (7) the measurement and monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels remain an important part of a comprehensive ASCVD prevention strategy.

### Aggravating effect of abnormal low-density protein cholesterol level on coronary atherosclerotic plaque in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients assessed by coronary computed tomography angiography [^113J6jP6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) steadily represents the main cause of death in type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) patients and is disproportionately affected by T2DM. T2DM has been identified as an established important risk factor in accelerating the development of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). Dyslipidemia, classified as a condition characterized by an imbalance of atherogenic and protective lipids, especially an elevated plasma concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is a major risk factor for ASCVD. It is worth drawing attention to the prevalence of elevated LDL-C among patients with T2DM has been as high as 50–68%.

Management strategies for diabetic dyslipidemia have significantly changed over recent years with the advent of newer lipid-lowering drugs. Germane to diabetes, the 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) Guideline for the Management of Dyslipidemias revised CV risk stratification and proposed new LDL-C goals. For diabetic patients at very high risk, an LDL-C goal of < 1.4 mmol/L is recommended; for diabetic patients at high risk, it is < 1.8 mmol/L; and for diabetic patients at moderate risk, it is < 2.6 mmol/L. Despite the incremental interventions in recent years, diabetic patients have experienced a significant reduction in LDL-C, and many patients still do not achieve the ideal LDL-C goal.

### Effects of evolocumab in individuals with type 2 diabetes with and without atherogenic dyslipidemia: an analysis from BANTING and BERSON [^112D7rFK]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Lipid treatment goals attainment

The participants in this analysis represent a population in which a vast majority had a very high risk of CVD events. For such individuals, the ESC/EAS 2019 dyslipidemia guidelines recommend an LDL-C goal of < 1.4 mmol/L, at least a 50% reduction from baseline in LDL-C, and secondary goals of non-HDL-C < 2.2 mmol/L and ApoB < 65 mg/dL. Similar aggressive goals are recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology in patients with diabetes and ASCVD. Our analysis shows that the recommended goals for high-risk patients are attainable when a PCSK9i is added to background statin therapy. Evolocumab enabled the majority of individuals with and without high TGs (74.7% to 79.8%) to achieve both an LDL-C goal of < 1.4 mmol/L and an LDL-C reduction of at least 50%. More than 68% achieved each separately. By contrast, in a recent Italian registry, only 3.2% of 4751 patients with very high CVD risk attained the combined LDL-C goal, despite 55% of patients receiving high-intensity statins (4.8% received ezetimibe). The DA VINCI study, a cross-sectional study that collected data from 18 European countries, showed that less than 30% of patients at high- or very high-risk receiving high-intensity statin monotherapy or a statin in combination with ezetimibe attained their 2019 ESC/EAS risk-based LDL-C goal. Notably, an LDL-C < 1.0 mmol/L, which may be considered for patients with a recurrent vascular event within 2 years, was achieved by 59.1% to 70.4% of individuals with and without high TGs who received evolocumab, compared with placebo (only one individual reached an LDL-C of less than 1.4 mmol/L), on top of statin therapy. In addition, more than 75% of evolocumab-treated individuals achieved the non-HDL-C goal of less than 2.2 mmol/L compared with less than 18% of placebo-treated individuals. ApoB less than 65 mg/dL was achieved by more than 67% of individuals at week 12 compared with 25% or less of placebo-treated individuals.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with diabetes [^115qadXq]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

The American Diabetes Association approach

The 2016 American Diabetes Association Standards of Diabetes Care endorses th e use of a risk factor-based approach to decide on initiation of statin therapy. Basically, it recommends risk stratification including 3 variables: age, the existence of previous cardiovascular events and the presence or not of risk factors. ADA risk factors include: LDL-c above 100 mg/dL, high blood pressure, smoking, overweight/obesity and family history of premature ASCVD. All patients with definite ASCVD events should receive high-intensity statin therapy, independently of age. In patients between 40 and 75 years without ASCVD events, but in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, it is recommended high-intensity statin therapy. In older or younger patients, if in the presence of risk factors, either moderate or high-intensity statin therapy can be indicated, depending on the individual patient preference and tolerance. In older patients without ASCVD events and without risk factors, moderate statin therapy is advocated. In younger patients without ASCVD or risk factors, ADA considers that lifestyle therapy alone may be more appropriate. Recently, ADA has included a recommendation for patients with recent acute coronary syndrome. In these patients, generally high-intensity statins is appropriate, however, considering the results of the IMPROVE-IT study, ezetimibe plus moderate-statin therapy is now also advocated for those with LDL-c above 50 mg/dL, who cannot tolerate high-doses of statin.

### Approach to lipid management in the patient with diabetes [^112z8W5F]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Diabetes is associated with increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Disordered lipid metabolism is a major contributor to ASCVD risk in diabetes. Dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes is characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the presence of small, dense low-density lipoprotein particles. Statins have demonstrated longstanding benefit for reducing ASCVD risk in individuals with diabetes. Newer agents for add-on therapies to statins are now available for additional cardiovascular risk reduction. In this clinical overview, we review the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia in both type 1 and 2 diabetes and provide an update on the management of lipids in the individual with diabetes. We discuss the importance of appropriate risk stratification and individualized treatment selection and the need to avoid therapy inertia to mitigate cardiovascular risk. We also address lipid-related effects of glycemic-lowering therapies.

2.2.1. Management of Lipids in Diabetes, Cardiorenal, and Metabolic Diseases

Lipid management should be based on patients' comorbidities, which, along with their baseline lipid levels, informs their level of risk. A wealth of data from outcomes trials with statins, ezetimibe, and pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have shown that for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), there appears to be no threshold of benefit for LDL-C level — so far, lower is always better. – It is recommended to reduce LDL-C levels by at least 50% from baseline or reach the patient's risk-based goal, whichever is lower. Achieving these levels often requires combination therapy.

Risk-based goals shown in the slide are based on guideline recommendations from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA), the AACE, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Atherosclerotic Society (EAS) (Table S1). The extreme plus goal (< 40 mg/dL [< 104 mmol/L]) is for patients who have an extreme risk and continue to have cardiovascular events despite LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (< 1.42 mmol/L). Ten-year risk, which refers to the risk of a hard ASCVD event (myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, non-fatal or fatal stroke) within 10 years, can be calculated using a validated risk calculator chosen based on the patient's characteristics (Table S2). – The Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA;) calculator is preferred because it incorporates the CAC score.

### Bempedoic acid: the new kid on the block for the treatment of dyslipidemia and LDL cholesterol: a narrative review [^1111DyAf]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a major cause of global mortality and dyslipidaemia is a key mechanism in establishing ASCVD. Indeed, ASCVD remains the primary cause of mortality and disability among patients with diabetes mellitus. Data from the WHO Multinational Study of Vascular Disease in Diabetes (WHO MSVDD) study demonstrated that cardiovascular disease was the most prevalent cause of death in type 1 diabetes mellitus (44%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (52%). A number of studies confirmed the significance of diabetes mellitus as an ASCVD risk factor and demonstrated it as a similar risk equivalent those with established ASCVD without diabetes.

There is an overwhelming amount of data in support of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as a risk factor for ASCVD. A number of population-based studies have demonstrated that optimal total cholesterol levels are about 150 mg/dl (3.8 mmol/l); this parallels an LDL-C status of approximately 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l). Indeed, statin therapy, which primarily targets the LDL-C pathway, has a wealth of data expanding over the last three decades demonstrating its considerable efficacy in the prevention of ASCVD and death. In addition, ASCVD benefits from statin therapy are primarily related to absolute LDL-C lowering. Statins are recommended as first-line therapy in both primary and secondary prevention cohorts through the prevention of ASCVD and are one of the foundations of multi-risk factor therapy in diabetes mellitus. Indeed, studies of statins in diabetes demonstrate significant reductions in both coronary and cerebrovascular events. The American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (US) and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (UK) both advocate a priority of lowering LDL-C primarily through moderate intensity statin therapy.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^113KaHZB]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

ASCVD remains the #1 cause of death in the United States and has been on the rise for more than a decade after more than 40 years of steady decline. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established causal factor for the development of ASCVD that should be monitored in a timely manner and may be modified through both lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Despite the existence of cholesterol guidelines, universal screening ages, risk assessment tools, and recommendations for LDL-C management based on risk, data show that LDL-C measurement and management in patients with ASCVD are not meeting guideline-directed objectives. Further, there is no single clinical guideline that presents LDL-C measurement frequency, risk assessment, management, and desirable LDL-C levels for adults based on risk.

Objective

This document aims to summarize the numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C.

Methods

Guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other relevant professional organizations were systematically reviewed. Key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application.

Results

The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations across major guidelines emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and the use of shared decision-making to improve adherence. The resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care.

Conclusion

Integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding. This approach supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances the implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. The primary goals for LDL-C management are to achieve an acceptable level for the patient's risk category and to maintain that over time because lower for longer is better to reduce ASCVD risk.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to management of dyslipidemia (non-statin lipid-lowering therapy), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor with proven benefit in patients with diabetes and ASCVD if the goal is not achieved on maximum tolerated statin therapy.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^113A6taB]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

In assessing progress towards goals, it should be noted that laboratory measurement of LDL-C at very low levels can present challenges especially when lipoprotein (a) or plasma triglyceride levels are elevated. In this context, secondary goals relating to non-HDL-C or apolipoprotein B can be useful when judging whether to prescribe add-on therapy.

Figure 4 summarises the types of conditions that would lead to intensification of LDL-C-lowering therapy, that is, combination of statins with ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitors. Identification of an individual with elevated risk of ASCVD, based on risk factor screening and evaluation of their SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Estimation), or the presence of disorders that predispose to the development of ASCVD, such as type 2 diabetes or chronic kidney disease, would place them in the 'high risk' category with goals of LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L and at least a 50% reduction from baseline. Among individuals with established ASCVD (on imaging or clinical presentation) and comorbidities (chronic kidney disease or history of diabetes with organ damage, proteinuria, hypertension), vascular imaging can aid in judging the most appropriate LDL-C goal. Where it is clear that a patient has atherosclerotic disease that is following an aggressive course, as indicated by serial events within 2 years, a goal of < 1.0 mmol/L is warranted.

Figure 4
Schematic showing rationale for intensive LDL-C lowering. The outer circle represents patients at 'high risk' with an LDL-C goal of below 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). Evidence of established disease, comorbidities, cardiometabolic disorders and multiple risk factors moves patients into the 'very high' risk middle circle, with a more ambitious target of below 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL). The most stringent goal of below 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) is recommended for those with a particularly aggressive disease course(see online supplemental figure 2 for the mg/dL (mmol/L) version). Note, all patients should achieve an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% relative to a measured or predicted off-treatment LDL-C.

Cholesterol

Cholesterol‐containing lipoproteins are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Elevated total cholesterol and LDL‐C are associated with increased ASCVD risk, – and lipid‐lowering medications can reduce this risk. – Intensive lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, should be recommended as first‐line therapy for all patients.

The newest iteration of the guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol (to reduce atherosclerotic CV risk in adults) have markedly changed the approach to lipid management, identifying statins as the preferred drug class to lower LDL‐C. Randomized controlled trial data support the use of statins to reduce CV risk in 4 groups: (1) those with known ASCVD, (2) those with an LDL‐C level ≥ 190 mg/dL, (3) those aged 40 to 75 years with DM and LDL‐C 70 to 189 md/dL, and (4) those aged 40 to 75 years with LDL‐C 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated ASCVD 10‐year risk of ≥ 7.5% (Table 4). The new pooled cohort risk estimator weighs age quite heavily; therefore, many more adults may be considered eligible for statin therapy despite having well‐controlled risk factors. Consequently, a central component of the new guideline recommendations is to have an informed discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and risks of drug therapy before starting a statin.

Table 4.
Groups in Who Randomized Controlled Trial Evidence Demonstrated a Reduction in ASCVD With Statin Therapy

Intensity of statin therapy is chosen to match the risk of those who are most likely to benefit (Table 4). A high‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by ≥ 50%, and a moderate‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by 30% to < 50%. Recommendations for statin intensity based on indication are summarized in Table 4. In addition, appropriate periodic monitoring (every 3 to 12 months) of lipid values should be obtained to monitor adherence, adequacy of response, and safety measures, as stated in the 2013 cholesterol guidelines.

Patients with increased concentrations of LDL‐C particles, decreased HDL‐C particles, and increased triglycerides carry an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 DM. This form of atherogenic dyslipidemia can be assessed by non–HDL‐C or by measuring an apolipoprotein B level. In addition, lipoprotein(a), which is a modified form of LDL that confers atherogenic risk independent of LDL‐C, can be elevated in the absence of other lipid abnormalities.
