## Question

What is the impact of depression on global functioning?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the impact of depression on global functioning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how global functioning is defined and measured. Then, I should examine the core relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD) and functional impairment. Next, I will quantify the impact across social, occupational, cognitive, and physical domains. After that, I need to consider temporal patterns during treatment and recovery. I will then review key moderators and predictors, followed by measurement issues and clinical assessment. Finally, I will extract treatment implications and synthesize the overall clinical message.

> Let me first confirm what we mean by "global functioning". In psychiatric contexts, it refers to overall performance in social, occupational/educational, and daily living domains and is commonly measured with tools such as the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), and the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), which are complementary rather than interchangeable measures of disability and role performance.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the foundational relationship. Functional impairment is inherent to MDD, not merely epiphenomenal, and contributes substantially to disability burden and relapse risk; crucially, the relationship is bidirectional such that depressive symptoms worsen function and functional deficits perpetuate depression and future episodes [^113Z7qFM] [^116U3jpU] [^114YGujM].

> I will now examine social and occupational functioning. Depression is associated with marked role impairment, including absenteeism and especially presenteeism, producing substantial economic and societal costs; these effects are comparable to or exceed many chronic medical illnesses, underscoring the centrality of functioning to the illness burden rather than being a secondary outcome [^116U3jpU] [^115hNDKC] [^114YGujM].

> Next, I should review cognitive functioning because it often drives real-world performance. Objective deficits in executive function, attention, memory, and processing speed are common in MDD and frequently persist into remission, indicating trait-tinged vulnerabilities; moreover, perceived cognitive problems independently predict functional impairment beyond neuropsychological test performance, so both subjective and objective cognition matter clinically [^114kYzbH] [^111cWpUQ] [^1135mi1U].

> Wait, let me verify the physical functioning angle as well. Depression correlates with reduced physical activity, fatigue, and somatic symptoms that constrain activities of daily living; in older adults, depression and multimorbidity trajectories accelerate functional decline in both ADLs and IADLs over time, compounding disability risk and recovery challenges [^notfound].

> I need to check temporal dynamics during treatment. Functional improvement typically lags behind symptomatic improvement — symptoms may respond within weeks, while restoration of functioning often takes months and can remain incomplete; functional impairments also tend to be more treatment-resistant than core mood symptoms, with cognitive domains showing particularly persistent deficits even after mood remission [^116U3jpU] [^113Z7qFM] [^114kYzbH].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied baseline symptom severity doesn't matter for function. Early symptom response predicts later functional gains in some treatment studies, but across broader samples, overall depressive severity remains the strongest correlate of disability on WHODAS with substantial explained variance, so I should reconcile these findings as complementary rather than contradictory — severity signals burden, while early change signals prognosis for functional recovery [^116U3jpU] [^115CHGjc].

> Next, I should review illness features that moderate functional impact. Recurrent episodes and longer episode duration predict more entrenched role impairment, while comorbid conditions — particularly anxiety spectrum disorders such as agoraphobia — add independent disability beyond depression severity, underscoring the need to address comorbidity in functional care plans [^115hNDKC] [^115CHGjc].

> Let me consider personal and environmental contributors. Higher neuroticism, lower conscientiousness, reduced physical activity, work stress, and sparse social support exacerbate functional limitations, and severely stressful life events — common in clinical samples — portend worse near-term outcomes unless adequately contextualized and managed in treatment planning [^1153k4cQ] [^115NLXiu] [^117CEk85].

> I should confirm measurement pitfalls, because they affect clinical decisions. Standard symptom scales do not fully capture functioning; an optimal HAMD-17 threshold corresponding to "normal functioning" may be closer to ≤ 5, not the conventional ≤ 7, and functional outcomes are underassessed in trials despite their clinical primacy; composite indices like the IBI-D better integrate symptom severity, QoL, and functioning, capturing a larger share of clinically meaningful change than symptom scales alone [^115BzP1v] [^112ZcgzE] [^1118Lp99].

> Hold on, I should verify rating fidelity. Clinician scoring on legacy scales like HAMD can show logical and statistical inconsistencies that obscure true change, and global functioning ratings such as the GAF reflect integrated judgments across symptoms and behavior; improving measurement consistency and using validated functional instruments can reduce misclassification of recovery [^115kcjD1] [^117CHzuY].

> But wait, what if I'm conflating functioning with quality of life? Let me reconsider and correct that. Functioning reflects role performance and capacity, whereas quality of life reflects satisfaction and well-being; both are important but not identical, so outcome assessment should include dedicated measures for each to avoid overinterpreting symptom change as functional or QoL recovery [^112ZcgzE] [^1118Lp99].

> Next, I should review treatment implications. Guidelines explicitly recommend maximizing functioning as a primary treatment goal with patient-specific functional targets; interventions beyond standard antidepressants — such as problem-solving therapy in executive dysfunction, cognitive remediation paradigms, and structured exercise — demonstrate benefits on functioning independent of symptom change, although effect sizes and populations vary [^114DNCbX] [^114eqMBP] [^114bVD25] [^1164NdiB] [^113HFndY].

> I need to ensure we account for evidence quality. Psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and their combination can improve functioning and QoL, but meta-analytic conclusions are tempered by trial heterogeneity and underreporting of functional domains; nevertheless, convergent data support functional gains with effective, measurement-informed care plans that target role deficits directly [^116h654j] [^114bpQFV].

> Let me double-check residual burden after symptom remission. A sizable proportion of symptomatic remitters continue to have abnormal functioning and/or QoL, reinforcing that true recovery requires explicit functional assessment and targeted rehabilitation rather than assuming symptoms-to-function translation [^1118Lp99].

> Finally, I will synthesize the clinical message. Depression exerts profound, pervasive, and often persistent effects on global functioning through multidimensional mechanisms — neurocognitive impairment, motivational deficits, social withdrawal, and perceived cognitive/physical limitations — and these functional deficits can exceed the burden seen in many chronic medical illnesses; therefore, restoring functioning must be a primary therapeutic objective, monitored with appropriate tools and addressed with targeted interventions to reduce relapse risk and improve real-world recovery [^114YGujM] [^115hNDKC] [^113Z7qFM] [^116U3jpU].

---

Depression causes broad, persistent functional impairment across occupational, social, and daily living domains, with severity and chronicity closely linked to disability [^113Z7qFM]. Cognitive deficits (attention, memory, executive function) and fatigue/apathy drive reduced productivity, social withdrawal, and impaired self-care, often persisting after mood remission [^114kYzbH]. Functional recovery typically lags symptom improvement, and residual impairment increases relapse risk [^116U3jpU]. Effective treatment improves functioning, but comprehensive, individualized plans targeting both symptoms and function are essential for full recovery [^114DNCbX].

---

## Occupational functioning

Depression markedly impairs occupational functioning, leading to reduced productivity, absenteeism, and presenteeism [^116U3jpU]. Cognitive deficits — impaired attention, memory, and executive function — decrease work performance and increase errors [^111cWpUQ]. Fatigue and lack of motivation further worsen impairment, often resulting in job loss or stalled career advancement.

---

## Social functioning

Depression profoundly affects social functioning, causing withdrawal, reduced participation, and strained interpersonal relationships [^114YGujM]. Social isolation and diminished support networks are common, further exacerbating symptoms and perpetuating a vicious cycle of worsening impairment [^112ZcgzE].

---

## Daily living activities

Depression significantly impairs daily living activities, including self-care, household tasks, and financial management [^111Xbx97]. Many individuals experience difficulty maintaining personal hygiene, managing household responsibilities, and adhering to daily routines. These impairments can lead to greater dependence on others and reduced autonomy [^1153k4cQ].

---

## Cognitive functioning

Cognitive impairment is a core feature of depression, affecting attention, memory, and executive function [^111cWpUQ]. These deficits often persist after mood symptoms remit, significantly impacting daily functioning and quality of life [^114kYzbH]. They are also associated with increased relapse risk and greater chronicity [^116U3jpU].

---

## Quality of life

Depression significantly reduces quality of life across physical, psychological, and social domains [^1118Lp99]. Affected individuals report lower life satisfaction, reduced enjoyment of activities, and impaired overall well-being [^115MU1US]. This impairment often persists after symptomatic remission, underscoring the need for comprehensive treatment that addresses both symptoms and functioning [^113Z7qFM].

---

## Severity and chronicity of depression

The severity and chronicity of depression are strongly associated with the extent of functional impairment [^115CHGjc]. Severe, chronic depression leads to greater disability, higher healthcare utilization, and increased economic burden, with impairment often persisting even after symptomatic improvement [^114YGujM].

---

## Treatment and functional recovery

Effective treatment — including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and combined approaches — significantly improves global functioning [^114bpQFV]. However, functional recovery often lags symptomatic improvement, and residual impairment is common [^116U3jpU]. Comprehensive plans that address both symptoms and functional impairment are essential for achieving full recovery [^114DNCbX].

---

## Measurement of functional impairment

Functional impairment in depression is commonly assessed with standardized instruments such as the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) [^117CHzuY], World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) [^1153k4cQ], and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) [^116U3jpU]. These tools provide valuable information on the extent of impairment and guide treatment planning [^113Z7qFM].

---

## Societal and economic impact

Depression significantly impacts society and the economy, contributing to higher healthcare costs, reduced productivity, and more disability claims [^111hBvsx]. The economic burden is substantial, underscoring the importance of effective treatment and prevention strategies [^114YGujM].

---

Depression significantly impairs global functioning across occupational, social, and daily living domains. Cognitive impairment, severity, and chronicity of depression contribute to persistent functional impairment, even after symptomatic remission. Effective treatment improves functioning, but comprehensive approaches addressing both symptoms and functional impairment are essential for full recovery [^116h654j].

### The efficacy of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and their combination on functioning and quality of life in depression: a meta-analysis [^114bpQFV]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This study must be viewed considering certain limitations. First, half of the included trials were of low quality, which questions the robustness of the results. However, the sensitivity and subgroup analyses performed did not reveal significant differences in the effects between high and low-quality studies. Second, the number of studies for some of the individual analyses was insufficient to allow for generalizability of the results. Furthermore, mainly overall improvements in functioning and quality of life (QoL) were assessed; there was a lack of domain-specific reporting that could have provided information on the effects of interventions on specific areas of functioning and QoL.

This meta-analysis was based on study-level data. An individual patient-level meta-analysis, based on original datasets of the included studies, could have revealed differences among first cases of depression and recurrent depression, the level of severity, or allowed for a better analysis of predictors of depression. A further limitation was the inability to analyze long-term outcomes and their interactions due to a lack of follow-up data. Follow-up data would allow for investigating long-term effects of interventions and temporal relationships between changes in functioning, QoL, and severity of symptoms. Future longitudinal epidemiological studies could fill this research gap and provide important information on the course of functioning in depression. Lastly, only articles in English were considered, which might have omitted relevant information.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides comprehensive evidence that existing data on this topic needs to be carefully interpreted within the context of these limitations.

Functional impairment is inherent to depression, but these impairments are often more resistant to treatment than the actual symptoms of depression. A patient cannot truly overcome depression until these impairments are addressed. Numerous validated instruments are available to assist clinicians in assessing functional impairment and monitoring it throughout treatment. Clinicians must collaborate with patients to develop personalized short-term and long-term functional goals and determine whether pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, or rehabilitative treatment is needed.

### Restoring function in major depressive disorder: A systematic review [^116U3jpU]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Functional impairment contributes to significant disability and economic burden in major depressive disorder (MDD). Treatment response is measured by improvement in depressive symptoms, but functional improvement often lags behind symptomatic improvement. Residual deficits are associated with relapse of depressive symptoms.

- **Methods**: A literature search was conducted using the following terms: "major depressive disorder", "functional impairment", "functional outcomes", "recovery of function", "treatment outcome", "outcome assessment", "social functioning", "presenteeism", "absenteeism", "psychiatric status rating scales", and "quality of life". Search limits included publication date (January 1, 1995, to August 31, 2016), English language, and human clinical trials. Controlled, acute-phase, non-remission MDD treatment studies in adults were included if a functional outcome was measured at baseline and endpoint.

- **Results**: The qualitative analysis included 35 controlled studies. The Sheehan Disability Scale was the most commonly used functional assessment. Antidepressant treatments significantly improved functional outcomes. Early treatment response predicted functional improvement, while baseline disease severity did not.

- **Limitations**: Clinical studies utilized various methodologies and assessments for functional impairment and were not standardized or adequately powered.

- **Conclusions**: The lack of synchronicity between symptomatic and functional improvement highlights an unmet need for MDD. Treatment guided by routine monitoring of symptoms and functionality may m

### Impact of untreated major depressive disorder on cognition and daily function [^111cWpUQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Cognitive symptoms are an emerging clinical focus in patients with major depressive disorder. Deficits in executive function, memory, attention, and processing speed, as well as negative cognitive bias, can contribute to low mood symptoms and reduced occupational and social functioning. Both patient reports and objective measures demonstrate that cognitive symptoms are common in patients with depression. Cognitive dysfunction may be present even before the first depressive episode and may remain after mood symptoms have remitted. Clinicians must assess cognitive symptoms in their patients with major depressive disorder, monitor symptoms throughout the course of the disorder and after remission, and understand how these symptoms affect daily function.

### Cognitive function following a major depressive episode: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114kYzbH]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Substantial evidence suggests that cognitive deficits might persist after remission from a major depressive episode. However, results are inconsistent relative to the importance, pattern, severity, and moderating factors of this impairment. We aimed to determine how cognitive function following a major depressive episode compares with normal function, to specify the pattern and severity of persistent cognitive dysfunctions, and to examine the potential moderator effect of ten prespecified clinical and demographic variables.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published research. We searched systematically across MEDLINE, Embase, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, and relevant reviews identified by our database search. Our search spanned research published from Jan 1, 1972, up to Jan 31, 2018, focusing on studies of patients with past depression. We included all independent studies of patients assessed while in remission from a major depressive episode with at least one cognitive test, including a healthy control group assessed with either the same test(s) as the major depressive episode group or with a standardized test with published age-stratified normative data. The main outcome was the difference in cognitive performance between major depressive episode remitters and healthy controls. Effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models for cognitive outcomes classified into 18 standard domains. Moderators of between-study variability were assessed using mixed-effects subgroup analyses and meta-regressions.

### Explaining heterogeneity in disability with major depressive disorder: Effects of personal and environmental characteristics [^1153k4cQ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with disability, yet some patients function surprisingly well. The reason for this heterogeneity between patients is unclear. Building on the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) model, this study aims to examine the effects of personal and environmental characteristics on disability with MDD, over and above illness characteristics.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from 573 patients with a diagnosis of MDD. Three measures for disability were used, varying in objectivity and specificity: 'WHODAS disability', 'days out of role', and 'work absence'. Univariate and stepwise multivariate regression analyses were conducted.

- **Results**: WHODAS disability was best explained by study variables. Illness characteristics were clearly the strongest correlates of WHODAS disability, whereas personal and environmental characteristics were less influential. Personal and, more restrictedly, environmental characteristics were almost equally important to illness characteristics in explaining days out of role and work absence. High conscientiousness, high neuroticism, low level of physical activity, and high work stress were the strongest predictors of disability among MDD patients.

- **Limitations**: Due to the cross-sectional design of the present study, we could not draw conclusions about causal relationships between our predictor variables and disability.

- **Conclusions**: Personal characteristics appeared to be almost equally important to illness characteristics in explaining heterogeneity in disability when measured objectively.

### Novel and emerging treatments for major depression [^117VwM4k]. Lancet (2023). Low credibility.

Depression is common, costly, debilitating, and associated with an increased risk of suicide. It ranks as one of the leading global public health problems. While existing pharmacological treatments can be effective, their onset of action can take up to six weeks, side effects are common, and recovery may require treatment with multiple different agents. Although psychosocial interventions might also be recommended, more effective treatments than those currently available are necessary for people with moderate or severe depression.

Over the past decade, treatment trials have developed and tested numerous new targeted interventions. This review assesses novel and emerging biological treatments for major depressive disorder, evaluates their putative brain and body mechanisms, and highlights how close each might be to clinical use.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, particularly in elderly patients with cognitive impairment, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following options for patients with MDD or minor depression in the context of cognitive impairment or dementia:

- **Problem-solving therapy**: Individual therapy is recommended for older adult patients with MDD and executive dysfunction.
- **Problem-solving behavioral therapy or pleasant events behavioral therapy**: These individual therapies are suggested for minor or MDD in older adults with dementia.

### One (effect) size does not fit at all: Interpreting clinical significance and effect sizes in depression treatment trials [^112MgfhY]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

There are reasons to doubt the validity of this seven-point cut-off signifying 'minimal improvement' in an individual patient. First, the authors of the original analysis did not suggest the seven-point cut-off; rather, they commented that "[a] CGI-I score of 3 ('minimally improved') corresponds to a reduction from baseline in the total HAMD-17 score of between 25% and 35%". By choosing a relative cut-off, the authors recognized that those with less severe illness require a smaller absolute decrease in HDRS scores for a clinically significant difference. The lower estimate, 25%, means the seven-point cut-off would be appropriate for people with a baseline score of 28, which is far higher than the average person participating in antidepressant treatment trials.

Second, most depression treatment trials enforce a minimum HDRS score as an inclusion criterion, and this is usually known to the HDRS rater. Because there is often pressure to recruit patients, this practice can lead to inflated baseline scores. If HDRS baseline scores are inflated, then all subsequent HDRS change scores are as well. Consequently, HDRS change scores corresponding to specific CGI-I categories, such as the 'minimally improved' category, will also be inflated.

Third, although knowing that the HDRS and CGI correlate is interesting, a 'minimal improvement' in CGI-I is still an approximation, for which we do not necessarily know the meaning, for example, in terms of functioning.

### Association of depressive symptoms with worse functioning in schizophrenia: A study in older outpatients [^112hA78j]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Subsyndromal depressive symptoms are highly prevalent and associated with substantial impairments of daily function in the general population. Depressive symptoms are common in schizophrenia; however, few studies have examined the relationship of functioning and well-being to the presence of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia.

- **Method**: 202 middle-aged or elderly outpatients with schizophrenia (DSM-III-R or DSM-IV criteria) were categorized by severity of depressive symptoms on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) using previously validated cutoff points, i.e. HAM-D total score ≥ 17 (high). We also assessed the severity of positive and negative symptoms, movement disorders, neurocognitive performance, daily functioning, and health-related quality of well-being with standardized measures.

- **Results**: A total of 11.4% of patients had HAM-D scores ≥ 17, and 56.4% had HAM-D scores from 7 to 16. Even after adjusting for the severity of other psychopathology, patients with more severe depressive symptoms had significantly worse everyday functioning (p < .02), except for physical functioning. They also had a poorer health-related quality of well-being (r = -.365, p < .001) than those with lower HAM-D scores. These differences were unrelated to demographics, extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, neurocognitive performance, or the number of physical illnesses.

- **Conclusion**: The results suggest the importance of evaluating schizophrenia patients for the presence of depressive symptoms.

### Explaining heterogeneity in disability associated with current major depressive disorder: Effects of illness characteristics and comorbid mental disorders [^115CHGjc]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Although major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with disability, some individuals function well despite their illness. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of illness characteristics and comorbid mental disorders on various aspects of disability among persons experiencing a MDD episode.

- **Methods**: Data were derived from 607 participants with MDD, based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Severity was assessed via the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms self-report (IDS-SR). Three outcome measures for disability were used: the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHODAS) and its seven dimensions, days out of role, and work absence. Using multiple regression analysis, the effects of MDD characteristics and comorbid mental disorders were estimated.

- **Results**: The IDS-SR score was the best predictor of all disability outcomes. Among the comorbid mental disorders, agoraphobia was significantly associated with overall disability. Collectively, all illness characteristics accounted for 43% of variance in WHODAS disability, 13% in days out of role, and 10% in work absence, suggesting substantial unexplained variance.

- **Limitations**: Only self-report measures of disability were used. There were no assessments of diagnoses other than depressive, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders.

- **Conclusions**: Although the heterogeneity in disability among persons with MDD is partially explained by illness characteristics of MDD (especially symptom severity) and comorbid mental disorders, most of the variance is unaccounted for.

### Impact of severity and type of depression on quality of life in cases identified in the community [^116CMxb6]. Psychological Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The impact of different levels of depression severity on quality of life (QoL) is not well studied, particularly regarding ICD-10 criteria. The ICD classification of depressive episodes in three levels of severity is also controversial, and the less severe category, mild, has been considered unnecessary and not clearly distinguishable from non-clinical states. The present work aimed to test the relationship between depression severity according to ICD-10 criteria and several dimensions of functioning, as assessed by the Medical Outcome Study (MOS) 36-item Short Form general health survey (SF-36) at the population level.

Method

A sample of 551 participants from the second phase of the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study (228 controls without depression and 313 persons fulfilling ICD criteria for depressive episode) was selected for a further assessment of several variables, including QoL related to physical and mental health as measured with the SF-36.

Results

Statistically significant differences between controls and the depression group were found in both physical and mental markers of health, regardless of the level of depression severity; however, there were very few differences in QoL between levels of depression as defined by ICD-10. Regardless of the presence of depression, disability, widowed status, being a woman, and older age were associated with worse QoL in a structural equation analysis with covariates. Likewise, there were no differences according to the type of depression (single-episode versus recurrent).

Conclusions

These results suggest that while depression severity is a determinant of QoL, other demographic and health-related factors also play significant roles.

### The trajectories of depression and multimorbidity affect the patterns of cognitive decline: a prospective cohort study [^113prQRa]. Age and Ageing (2025). Low credibility.

The course of decline in global cognitive function is heterogeneous, with patterns varying among individuals. The influence of depression, functional limitations, and multimorbidity on patterns of decline in global cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults remains unknown. This study examines the relationship between these health conditions and the course of decline in global cognitive function.

- **Methods**: A prospective cohort of 4,032 participants aged ≥ 60 years at baseline was constructed using the Health and Retirement Study (2006–2020), through surveys every two years. Information on depression, functional limitations, and multimorbidity was collected from 2006 to 2012. Data on cognitive function were collected between 2012 and 2020. Latent class trajectory models were used to identify the latent trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression models were employed to analyze the association between the latent trajectories and cognitive function.

- **Results**: Different trajectories were identified for depression (low-stable, decline-rise, and rise-decline), activities of daily living (ADLs; low-stable, decline-rise, and rise-decline), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs; low-stable and rise), and multimorbidity (stable and rise). Three trajectories of cognitive decline were identified: high stable, modest, and later steep. The trajectories of depression (for decline-rise: OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.11–1.95; for rise-decline: OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.24–2.38) and multimorbidity (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.08–2.46) increased the risk of cognitive decline.

### What does the HAMD mean [^113o9P5V]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Little is known about the clinical relevance of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) total scores. It is unclear how total scores translate into clinical severity, or what commonly used measures for response (reduction from baseline of ≥ 50% in the total score) and remission (total HAMD-17 score ≤ 7) mean from a clinical perspective.

We therefore compared the following:

- **Percentage and absolute change**: The HAMD-17 total scores with Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I).

- **Absolute and percentage change**: The HAMD-17 total scores with Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) absolute change.

- **Subgroup analysis**: The percentage and absolute change in the HAMD-17 total scores with CGI-I in the subgroups of patients with ≤ median and > median HAMD-17 total scores at baseline.

The method used was equipercentile linking of HAMD-17 and CGI ratings from 43 drug trials in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (n = 7131). Our results confirm the validity of the commonly used measures for remission and response in MDD trials: a CGI-I score of 2 ('much improved') corresponded to a reduction from baseline of > 50% and 75% and < 85%. The CGI-S score of 1 ('normal, not at all ill') corresponded to the HAMD-17 total score of < 5 and the CGI-S score of 2 ('borderline mentally ill') to the score between 6 and 8. An effect of baseline illness severity was observed.

### Alternative metrics for characterizing longer-term clinical outcomes in difficult-to-treat depression: I. Association with change in quality of life [^115BSxUm]. Psychological Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Depression severity and quality-of-life measures

The MADRS is a 10-item clinician-rated scale that assesses the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with mood disorders. Each item is rated on a scale of 0–6 for symptom manifestation over the past week. Suggested severity ranges for total scores are: 0–6 for no depression, 7–19 for mild depression, 20–34 for moderate depression, and 34–60 for severe depression.

The QIDS-SR is a 16-item self-report instrument that also assesses depressive symptom severity over the past week. Items are rated on a scale of 0–3. Suggested severity ranges for total scores are: 0–5 for no depression, 6–10 for mild depression, 11–15 for moderate depression, 16–20 for severe depression, and 21–27 for very severe depression.

The Q-LES-Q-SF is a self-report scale that assesses the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by the participant during the past week. The short form documents satisfaction in 14 content domains (e.g. household activities; family relationships), followed by two global ratings (e.g. life satisfaction and contentment). Items are rated on a scale of 1–5, and the scores on the 14 content domains are summed, producing raw total scores ranging from 14 (worst) to 70 (best). The Q-LES-Q-SF has excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability. While its content applies to quality of life in the general population, it has shown sensitivity to clinical presentation and treatment outcomes.

### The actual process of rating the global assessment of functioning scale [^117CHzuY]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

The Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) was developed for the overall assessment of psychological, social, and occupational functioning. While the advantage of the GAF lies in this comprehensiveness, questions have been raised on whether clinicians rate appropriately. To clarify this issue, the actual process of how clinicians assign GAF scores was investigated.

A total of 2,462 inpatients of 19 psychiatric hospitals in Japan were assessed by their primary psychiatrists using the following rating scales: GAF, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), World Health Organization Psychiatric Disability Assessment Schedule (DAS), and physical Activities of Daily Living (ADL) index. A tree-based model analysis (also referred to as Automatic Interaction Detector [AID] or Classification and Regression Tree [CART]) was used to construct a statistical model with the GAF score as the dependent variable.

The statistically best-fitted tree to predict the GAF score is as follows: The first split is based on the "conceptual disorganization" score in the BPRS, followed by splits based on DAS item scores, such as "conversation" and "underactivity". The tree model obtained suggests that Japanese clinicians judge the level of global functioning by integrating the information on both the severity of psychiatric symptoms and the level of impaired behavior and social functioning. This logical structure was clinically acceptable and agreed well with the concept of the GAF.

### Subsyndromal depression is associated with functional impairment in patients with bipolar disorder [^115xHvH4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether a relationship exists between mild depressive symptoms and overall functioning in subjects with bipolar disorder.

- **Method**: Twenty-five male subjects with bipolar I disorder (DSM-III-R criteria), who had not experienced a DSM-III-R episode of mania, hypomania, or major depression for 3 months as determined using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, were evaluated for degree of depressive symptoms using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and for overall functional status using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF, DSM-IV Axis V).

- **Results**: GAF scores were significantly negatively correlated with HAM-D scores (r = -0.61, df = 23, p = .001), despite the fact that no patient had a HAM-D score high enough to be considered clinically depressed.

- **Conclusion**: The results of this study support a relationship between subsyndromal depressive symptoms and functional impairment in bipolar subjects, despite their not meeting threshold criteria for a major depressive episode. These findings raise the possibility that in some patients with bipolar disorder, subsyndromal depressive symptoms might contribute to ongoing functional impairment.

### Self-report versus clinician examination in early Parkinson's disease [^114boaYH]. Movement Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Both explanations are supported by findings in previous studies. Treatment of depression was associated with improved self-reported quality of life and a reduced self-reported functional motor-related impact on the UPDRS-ADL score, but there was no change in the UPDRS motor score. Weintraub and colleagues reported that nonmotor symptoms, such as signs of depression or cognitive impairment, but not physician-assessed motor sign severity, were significant predictors of functional disability in Parkinson's disease as measured by the self-reported UPDRS-ADL subscale. Others have reported positive correlations between depression and higher self-reported functional disability, motor impairment, and disease severity. These findings could support the first explanation; for example, someone who suffers from depression may perform daily motor activities slowly or with more difficulty due to apathy, subjective fatigue, and so on. In line with the second explanation, depression may also affect the degree to which patients recognize, perceive, or are impacted by motor difficulties that make activities more difficult.

### Development of a clinical global impression scale for fatigue [^115sgx5Y]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2012). Low credibility.

Physical, cognitive, and affective components of fatigue are often associated with depression and other Axis I psychiatric disorders. We developed two single-item global assessment scales to specifically evaluate symptoms of fatigue. A total of 101 subjects visiting a clinical trial site consented to participate in this reliability and validity study. Diagnoses included major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

There were two clinic visits during which the modified clinician and patient impressions of fatigue rating instruments were administered in conjunction with the MGH Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (MGH-CPFQ), a validated patient-rated 7-item scale. CGI-Severity and PGI-Severity for fatigue were well correlated at two separate visits (p < 0.00005). At visit 1, the mean CGI-S for fatigue was 3.33 ± 1.53 (SD) and the PGI-S for fatigue was 3.57 ± 1.70 (r = 0.75; p = 0.000). At visit 1, the total MGH-CPFQ was 21.66 ± 6.92. Both CGI-S and PGI-S measures for fatigue were highly correlated with the MGH-CPFQ: CGI-S (r = 0.76; p < 0.00005); PGI-S (r = 0.62; p < 0.00005).

Both the PGI-S and CGI-S for fatigue revealed temporal stability and convergent validity for the MGH-CPFQ (r = 0.83 for CGI-S and 0.73 for PGI-S). There was high internal consistency between the two independent CGI raters at visit 2 as demonstrated by a kappa statistic = 0.971 (CGI-S) and 0.868 (CGI-I) and Cronbach's alpha = 0.998 (CGI-S) and 0.941 (CGI-I). As shown here, the modified CGI and PGI instruments for fatigue are reliable measures of fatigue, and both measures are validated.

### Rating depression over brief time intervals with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale: Standard vs. abbreviated scales [^117LfwhC]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2015). Low credibility.

Although antidepressant trials typically use weekly ratings to examine changes in symptoms over six to 12 weeks, antidepressant treatments may improve symptoms more quickly. Thus, rating scales must be adapted to capture changes over shorter intervals. We examined the use of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) to evaluate more rapid changes.

Data were examined from 58 patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder enrolled in double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies. These patients received a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo over 40 minutes and then crossed over to the other condition. The HDRS subscales, a single HDRS depressed mood item, and a visual analogue scale were used at baseline, following a brief interval (230 minutes), and one week post-infusion. Effect sizes for the ketamine-placebo difference were moderate (d > 0.50), but the one and two-item HDRS subscales had the smallest effects.

Response rates on the active drug were lowest for the complete HDRS (43%); the remaining scales had higher response rates to the active drug, but the shortest subscales had higher response rates to placebo. Correlations between the changes from baseline to 230 minutes post-ketamine across scores were similar for most subscales (r = 0.82–0.97), but correlations using the single items were lower (r < 0.74). Overall, effect sizes for drug-placebo differences and correlations between changes were lower for one- and two-item measures. Response rates were lower with the full HDRS scale.

The data suggest that, to best identify rapid antidepressant effects, a scale should have more comprehensive measures than one- or two-item assessments.

### Computerized cognitive training and functional recovery in major depressive disorder: A meta-analysis [^114bVD25]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Depression is common, frequently resistant to antidepressant treatment, and associated with impairments in cognition and everyday functioning. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) paradigms offer potential to improve cognition, mood, and everyday functioning, but their effectiveness is not well established. The objective of this article was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of CCT in depressive disorders.

A search was conducted to identify high-quality randomized controlled CCT trials per PRISMA guidelines using PsycINFO and MEDLINE with the keywords "cognitive training", "cognitive remediation", or "cognitive rehabilitation", and "depression". Nine randomized trials for depressed adults met the inclusion criteria. Effect sizes (Hedge's g) were calculated for key outcome measures of mood symptom severity, daily functioning, and cognition. A three-level Bayesian hierarchical linear model was used to estimate effect sizes for each domain and study. Publication bias was assessed using Classic Fail Safe N's, and homogeneity was evaluated using Q and I(2) indexes.

- **Results**: Significant small-moderate effects for symptom severity (0.43) and daily functioning (0.72), and moderate-large effects for attention (0.67), working memory (0.72), and global functioning (1.05) were found. No significant effects were found for executive functioning or verbal memory. Moderator variable analysis revealed a decreased effect of CCT with age. Gender and concurrent medication treatment did not affect the results.

- **Limitations**: Small sample size and short duration.

### The associations between depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and quality of life, in patients with major depression: Undirected and Bayesian network analyses [^112dhETN]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

This study was strengthened by a large, multi-site sample of individuals suffering from MDD and the use of network models that are appropriate for describing complex dynamic systems. However, our study has some limitations that need to be mentioned. First, even though the DAG provides preliminary clues to both the strength and direction of the possible connections among the variables under analysis, caution is still required as causal inference is only fully defensible when all assumptions are completely met. Longitudinal studies focusing on disease development are needed for further validation. Second, although a wide range of clinical dimensions were assessed, these network structures must be explained under the assumption of the absence of unmeasured confounders or selection variables. These variables may include shame, self-esteem, or cognitive biases. The inclusion of those variables in future network-based studies may enrich the research of MDD. Third, the study excluded patients with suicidal ideation item score > 2 (as high risk for suicide), which may impact the relationship of suicidal ideation with other depressive symptoms, QOL, and functioning.

Despite these limitations, to our knowledge, this study was the first to elucidate the associations between depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and QOL in patients with MDD at the level of individual symptoms. We found that functional disability mediated the relationship between depressive symptoms and QOL. Depressed mood played the…

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^113cZ2TD]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding major depressive disorder, specifically in elderly patients with cognitive impairment, the APA 2019 guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend the combination of individual behavioral activation therapy and usual treatment over usual treatment alone for depressive symptoms in older adult patients with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment.

### Depression [^114YGujM]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Major depression is a common illness that severely limits psychosocial functioning and diminishes quality of life. In 2008, WHO ranked major depression as the third cause of the burden of disease worldwide and projected that the disease will rank first by 2030. In practice, its detection, diagnosis, and management often pose challenges for clinicians because of its various presentations, unpredictable course and prognosis, and variable response to treatment.

### Patient-reported health-related quality of life from a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of zuranolone in adults with major depressive disorder [^115xCeXY]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD), a disabling, potentially life-threatening condition, negatively affects health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This secondary analysis aimed to understand the impact of the neuroactive steroid zuranolone on HRQoL using the Short Form-36v2 Health Survey (SF-36v2).

- **Methods**: Adult patients with MDD and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score ≥ 22 were randomized 1:1 to receive zuranolone 30 mg or placebo for 2 weeks, with a 4-week follow-up. SF-36v2 scores were assessed at Day 15 across 8 domains (Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health) and 2 summary scores (Physical and Mental Component), using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Correlations between SF-36v2 scores and clinician-reported efficacy endpoints were assessed using Pearson's correlation.

- **Results**: Eighty-nine patients were treated with zuranolone 30 mg (n = 45) or placebo (n = 44). In zuranolone-treated patients, HRQoL improved across all SF-36v2 domains and summary scores at Day 15. Improvements exceeding established minimally important difference thresholds were observed in Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health scores. Improvements in General Health, Vitality, Mental Health, and Mental Component Summary were statistically significant versus placebo (p ≤ 0.025). Clinician-rated endpoints negatively correlated with SF-36v2 scores.

- **Limitations**: The small unipolar depression sample may not be representative of broader populations.

### On the nature of objective and perceived cognitive impairments in depressive symptoms and real-world functioning in young adults [^1135mi1U]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Low credibility.

Cognitive impairments in depression contribute to disability. According to prevailing cognitive theories, one's perception related to cognitive ability can cause and maintain depression and related outcomes. Here, we investigate the degree to which perceived cognitive impairment predicts functional impairment beyond objective neurocognition. A sample of young adults (n = 123) completed a battery of tests measuring objective cognitive ability, perceived cognitive function (e.g. Perceived Deficits Questionnaire), disability (e.g. World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule), and depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-2). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses tested the incremental variance that perceived cognitive impairment accounts for beyond neuropsychological test measures and disability related to depression. Results show that perceived cognitive impairment accounts for significant incremental variance in depressive symptoms beyond neuropsychological test scores; disability measures were significantly associated with depressive symptoms, as was perceived cognitive impairment. Individuals with depression and related disorders are more likely to report cognitive impairments and experience diminished cognitive ability relative to healthy controls, regardless of objective impairments. This finding highlights the importance of considering, measuring, and treating perceived cognitive impairment, known as Cognitive Impairment Bias (Dhillon and Zakzanis, 2019).

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1137zVc3]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, particularly in elderly patients with other comorbidities, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following options for patients with both depression and a complicating factor:

- **Combination of CBT (individual) and usual care**: This is suggested for patients with minor or major depressive disorder (MDD) who also have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

- **Multicomponent intervention (individual)**: Recommended for treating symptoms of depression in temporarily homebound African American adults.

- **Coping improvement (group)**: Favored over psychotherapy on request (individual) for older adults with mild-to-severe depressive symptoms and HIV.

### A longitudinal analysis of the relationship between emotional symptoms and cognitive function in patients with major depressive disorder [^113CaffX]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent condition that affects approximately 280 million individuals globally [World Health Organization]. It is a leading cause of disability worldwide and significantly contributes to the global burden of disease [GBD 2019 Diseases and Injuries Collaborators]. A study on first-episode drug-naive patients with MDD found that 13.7% of the patients exhibited suicide attempts within 1 month of the study [Li et al.]. Annually, more than 700,000 individuals die by suicide due to depression [World Health Organization].

Cognitive impairment is a significant manifestation of MDD; however, its relationship with depressive symptoms remains unclear. Diagnostic criteria, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), recognize cognitive disturbances as associated features of MDD. A meta-analysis revealed significant moderate cognitive deficits in executive function, memory, and attention in patients with MDD; it also found that these cognitive impairments are fundamental aspects of the disorder, rather than mere epiphenomena secondary to low mood symptoms (Rock, Roiser, Riedel, & Blackwell). Although cognitive symptoms are traditionally thought to be influenced by the depressive state, research indicates that these deficits can persist even in remitted states [Preiss et al; Rock et al.], negatively impacting patients' overall functionality [Evans, Iverson, Yatham, & Lam]. Our previous study found that difficulty with concentration and decision-making was the core residual symptom in individuals with MDD.

### The burden of recurrent depression: causes, consequences, and future prospects [^115hNDKC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Depression represents one of the most profound human problems currently facing the global health care system. It is a prevalent clinical condition and is estimated to rival virtually every other known medical illness in the burden of disease morbidity early in this millennium. Understanding the chronic nature of this illness is key to the development of a more informed, longitudinal perspective on the diagnosis and treatment of depression.

In this report, the morbid impact of depression is reviewed from the perspectives of illness symptoms, societal impact, and emerging evidence of critical neurobiological consequences of the untreated condition. Reconceptualizing major depression from this longitudinal and multidimensional perspective is crucial to providing an effective response to this critical public health challenge.

### Psychological treatment of depression in primary care: Recent developments [^112z4mYg]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Depressive disorders are highly prevalent, disabling, and costly conditions associated with significantly diminished role functioning and quality of life, medical comorbidity, and increased mortality. In recent decades, substantial progress has been made in researching and developing treatments for depression across various settings, including primary care. Multiple types of antidepressant medications and psychotherapies have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous randomized trials. Based on these significant and positive effects, many treatments are included in treatment guidelines and are widely used in clinical practice.

The majority of depressed patients are treated in primary care, with only a small proportion referred to mental health services. Despite the existence of hundreds of randomized trials on drugs and therapy, only a limited number focus specifically on primary care patients. It is possible that the results found in specialized mental health care settings may not fully apply to depressed primary care patients, as the severity of depression is generally assumed to be less in primary care contexts.

Although both antidepressant medication and psychotherapies show small but positive effects on depression, with no clinically significant differences in the short-term, many general practitioners (GPs) tend to prescribe antidepressant medications. However, the majority of patients prefer psychological treatments. In a systematic review of 34 studies conducted in different settings, recommendations are provided to better align treatment approaches with patient preferences and clinical outcomes.

### The associations between depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and quality of life, in patients with major depression: undirected and Bayesian network analyses [^112jHkHJ]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

We performed an online supplementary analysis, highlighting a significant gender disparity among participants (only 32% were male). Depression was more prevalent in females, and some factors, such as family dynamics, differed by gender. It was essential to investigate whether findings varied between males and females. Using the Network Comparison Test (NCT), we compared gender differences in the network. NCT enables researchers to assess differences in global network strength (overall connectivity) and global network structure (overall organization) between two networks [Borkulo et al.].

The Q-LES-Q-SF contains 16 items, mirroring the general activities section of its longer version [Lee et al.]. No criteria were found to categorize the items into dimensions. Including all individual items of the Q-LES-Q-SF as nodes in the network analyses proved challenging for interpretation. Therefore, only the total score was included. The undirected network analysis results are included in the online supplementary material, with the items of the Q-LES-Q-SF illustrated (online supplementary Fig. S7).

We used follow-up data at week 4 to verify the DAG analysis results. To adequately analyze the findings, we included longitudinal data from baseline and week 4 to examine associations discovered in the DAG analysis.

### Life events and treatment prognosis for depression: A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^115AYpuD]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Use of a standardized outcome has been criticized, but the results using the z-score outcome were similar to those with the log outcome and the secondary and sensitivity outcomes, suggesting no substantive impact on the results. Alternative outcomes may be of use in future research. For example, if studies incorporate more regular outcome measurement schedules, they could provide a more fine-grained assessment over time of the impact of major life events on outcomes. Indeed, it would be informative for future research to address the hypothesis that severely stressful acute events lead to a longer time to remission, even if they do not greatly impact overall prognosis 3–4 months after commencing treatment.

### Physical exercise improves quality of life, depressive symptoms, and cognition across chronic brain disorders: a transdiagnostic systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1164NdiB]. Journal of Neurology (2021). High credibility.

One hundred and twenty-two studies, including 7,231 patients, showed a significant medium-size effect (ES = 0.40) of exercise as an add-on therapeutic intervention on QoL (k = 64, n = 4,334). A large effect (ES = 0.78) was observed on depressive symptoms (k = 60, n = 2,909), and a small but significant effect (ES = 0.12–0.24) was found on improving function in several cognitive domains. The effects for QoL and depression were well-powered. The included number of patients was lower for cognition (k = 36, n = 2,125), which makes these results more sensitive to new findings. From the studies that reported on safety (k = 18), low incidences of complications related to the exercise interventions were found, with no lasting consequences for participation in and completion of the exercise interventions.

### Incorporating multidimensional patient-reported outcomes of symptom severity, functioning, and quality of life in the individual burden of illness index for depression to measure treatment impact and recovery in MDD [^1118Lp99]. JAMA Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The National Institute of Mental Health Affective Disorders Workgroup identified the assessment of an individual's burden of illness as an important need. The Individual Burden of Illness Index for Depression (IBI-D) metric was developed to meet this need.

- **Objective**: To assess the use of the IBI-D for multidimensional assessment of treatment efficacy for depressed patients.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: Complete data on depressive symptom severity, functioning, and quality of life (QOL) from depressed patients (N = 2280) at entry and exit of level 1 of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study (12-week citalopram treatment) were used as the basis for calculating IBI-D and self-rating scale changes.

- **Results**: Principal component analysis of patient responses at the end of level 1 of STAR*D yielded a single principal component, IBI-D, with a nearly identical eigenvector to that previously reported. While changes in symptom severity (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report) accounted for only 50% of the variance in changes in QOL (Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form) and 47% of the variance in changes in functioning (Work and Social Adjustment Scale), changes in IBI-D captured 83% of the variance in changes in QOL and 80% in functioning, while also capturing 79% of the variance in change in symptom severity (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report). Most importantly, the changes in IBI-D of the 36.6% of remitters who had abnormal QOL and/or functioning (mean [SD], 2.98

### Optimal cutoff point of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression according to normal levels of social and occupational functioning [^115BzP1v]. Psychiatry Research (2011). Low credibility.

The main goal in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) is to achieve remission, defined as the resolution of symptoms and the return to normal levels of functionality. However, the clinical assessment of remission is usually based merely on scores of symptomatic rating scales. One of the most widely used scales to measure remission is the HAM-D(17), in which remission is defined as a score ≤ 7. Nevertheless, several studies have shown that this cutoff could be too high when also considering functioning.

This is a post-hoc analysis of a 6-month prospective study, performed over a sample of 292 Spanish patients with MDD, to find the optimal cutoff in the HAM-D(17) scale, considering normal levels of functionality, evaluated by the SOFAS, using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves. Our results show that a score of ≤ 5 maximized both sensitivity and specificity for identifying normal levels of functionality compared to other scores. Thus, our findings agree with previous works, which suggest that a cutoff ≤ 7 might be too high to consider remission in patients with MDD when normal levels of functioning are taken into account.

### Asking patients about their general level of functioning: Is it worth it for common mental disorders [^111NrAca]? Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Functional disability (FD) is a diagnostic criterion for many psychiatric disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive episode (MDE). This study aimed to assess the contribution of measuring FD to diagnosing GAD and MDE using clinical methods (Global Assessment of Functioning, GAF) and self-reported methods (Analog Scale of Functioning, ASF, and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule WHODAS 2.0).

Patients seeking professional help for mood and anxiety symptoms (N = 244) were evaluated. The MINI interview was used to determine the presence of common mental disorders. Symptoms were assessed with two short checklists. Logistic and hierarchical logistic models were used to determine the diagnostic accuracy and the added diagnostic value of FD assessment in detecting GAD and MDE.

FD alone had a diagnostic accuracy of 0.79 (GAF), 0.79 (ASF), and 0.78 (WHODAS) for GAD, and 0.83, 0.84, and 0.81, respectively, for MDE. Self-reported measures of FD improved the diagnostic performance of the number of symptoms by a 4% AUC increase for GAD, but not for MDE. If assessed before symptom evaluation, FD can discriminate well between patients with and without GAD/MDE. When assessed together with symptoms, self-reported methods improve GAD detection rates.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^114Fe3PT]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, especially in elderly patients, the management of major depression according to the APA 2019 guidelines recommends offering any of the following options as initial treatment for older adults with depression, using a shared decision-making approach with the patient:

- **Group life review treatment or group CBT**: Either alone or in addition to usual care.

- **Combined pharmacotherapy and interpersonal psychotherapy**: Use a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects.

### Predictors of treatment outcome in depression in later life: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113AtMSb]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Predictor analyses of late-life depression can be used to identify variables associated with outcomes of treatments and hence ways of tailoring specific treatments to patients. The aim of this review was to systematically identify, review, and meta-analyze predictors of outcomes of any type of treatment for late-life depression.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched for studies published up to December 2016. Both primary and secondary studies reporting treatment predictors from randomized controlled trials for patients with major depressive disorder aged over 60 were included. Treatment outcomes included response, remission, and change in depression score.

- **Results**: Sixty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Of 65 identified statistically significant predictors, only 7 were reported in at least 3 studies. Of these, 5 were included in meta-analyses, and only 3 were statistically significant. Most studies were rated as being of moderate to strong quality and satisfied key quality criteria for predictor analyses.

- **Limitations**: The searches were limited to randomized controlled trials, and most of the included studies were secondary analyses.

- **Conclusions**: Baseline depression severity, co-morbid anxiety, executive dysfunction, episode duration, early improvement, physical illnesses, and age were reported as statistically significant predictors of treatment outcomes. However, only the first three were significant in meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses showed differences in predictor effects between biological and psychosocial treatments.

### Clinical effectiveness: The importance of psychosocial functioning outcomes [^112ZcgzE]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with significant impairment in quality of life and psychosocial functioning, including social and occupational/role functioning. Evaluation of the clinical effectiveness of treatments for depression must include improvement in these important functional outcomes. However, clinical trials for depression have primarily focused on the reduction of symptoms, as measured by symptom severity scales such as the HDRS and MADRS or by standard definitions of response and remission.

- **Method**: The rationale and necessity for assessing both symptom and functional outcomes in clinical trials for MDD are reviewed, and examples of validated scales for measuring QoL and social and occupational functioning are provided.

- **Results**: Emerging data suggest that treatment effects assessed with functioning scales may differ from those captured by symptoms scales. Many validated scales are available to measure global and specific aspects of functional outcomes, including QoL, psychosocial functioning, and occupational functioning. Nevertheless, systematic reviews have shown that functional outcome scales are used in fewer than 5% of trials.

- **Conclusions**: Given the importance of psychosocial functioning for individuals with MDD as well as for society, greater attention must be focused on the assessment of functional outcomes in clinical trials for MDD, as well as in the clinical management of people with depression.

### The association between cognitive function and subsequent depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1151Axei]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Despite a growing interest in understanding the cognitive deficits associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), it is largely unknown whether such deficits exist before disorder onset or how they might influence the severity of subsequent illness. The purpose of the present study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal datasets to determine whether cognitive function acts as a predictor of later MDD diagnosis or change in depression symptoms. Eligible studies included longitudinal designs with baseline measures of cognitive functioning and later unipolar MDD diagnosis or symptom assessment.

The systematic review identified 29 publications, representing 34 unique samples and 121,749 participants, that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Quantitative meta-analysis demonstrated that higher cognitive function was associated with decreased levels of subsequent depression (r = -0.088, 95% confidence interval: -0.121 to -0.054, p < 0.001). However, sensitivity analyses revealed that this association is likely driven by depression symptoms present at the time of cognitive assessment. Our review and meta-analysis indicate that the association between lower cognitive function and later depression is confounded by the presence of contemporaneous depression symptoms at the time of cognitive assessment. Thus, cognitive deficits predicting MDD likely represent deleterious effects of subclinical depression symptoms on performance rather than premorbid risk factors for the disorder.

### The efficacy of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and their combination on functioning and quality of life in depression: A meta-analysis [^116h654j]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A considerable number of meta-analyses published in the last decade have clearly shown that both psychological and pharmacological treatments are efficacious for reducing symptoms in depression. Recent literature, however, has suggested that functioning and quality of life (QoL) improvement might be equally important for people with depression as their symptom amelioration. The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) highlighted the need for evidence-based interventions that demonstrate improvement in functioning.

From a clinical perspective, patients have prioritized functional over symptomatic outcomes and determined the return to a normal level of functioning at work, home, or school as a significant factor for remission in depression. Furthermore, improvement in QoL has been considered the ultimate outcome measure that indicates whether certain treatments have succeeded.

Despite the importance given to functioning and QoL, both dimensions remain under-researched in interventional studies. The terms have been used interchangeably in previous studies, but there is agreement that these concepts are not identical. Generally, functioning refers to one's performance in daily or social activities, and QoL as one's satisfaction with these activities and perception of his or her health.

The conclusions drawn from the few published meta-analyses on functioning are limited.

### Psychosocial and quality of life assessment in kidney transplant recipients: A focus on anxiety, depression, and clinical correlates [^115gJeFy]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant global health issue, affecting millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function, leading to complications such as cardiovascular diseases, anemia, and mineral bone disorders. The prevalence of CKD has been increasing globally, driven by factors such as population growth, aging, and the rising incidence of diabetes and hypertension. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, the global prevalence of CKD was estimated to be 359 million cases in 2021, representing a 92% increase since 1990. CKD is a progressive condition that can ultimately lead to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), at which point the kidneys are no longer able to function adequately on their own, and renal replacement therapy — such as dialysis or kidney transplantation (KT) — is required for survival.

KT plays a crucial role in managing ESKD, offering significant advantages over dialysis in terms of survival, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. It is recognized as the preferred treatment option, particularly for patients with chronic renal failure, as it can substantially reduce mortality rates associated with chronic dialysis programs. The significance of psychosocial factors, particularly anxiety and depression, in post-transplant care is increasingly recognized as critical for improving patient outcomes. These factors can adversely affect the quality of life, treatment adherence, and overall survival rates of kidney transplant recipients.

The evidence overwhelmingly supports the superiority of KT.

### Associations between specific depressive symptoms and psychosocial functioning in psychotherapy [^114gFrFe]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Psychotherapy for depression aims to reduce symptoms and improve psychosocial functioning. We examined whether some symptoms are more important than others in the association between depression and functioning over the course of psychotherapy treatment.

- **Methods**: We studied associations between specific symptoms of depression (PHQ-9) and change in social and occupational functioning (SOFAS), both with structural equation models (considering liabilities of depression and each specific symptom) and with logistic regression models (considering the risk for individual patients). The study sample consisted of adult patients (n = 771) from the Finnish Psychotherapy Quality Registry (FPQR) who completed psychotherapy treatment between September 2018 and September 2021.

- **Results**: Based on our results of logistic regression analyses and SEM models, the baseline measures of depression symptoms were not associated with changes in functioning. Changes in depressed mood or hopelessness, problems with sleep, feeling tired, and feeling little interest or pleasure were associated with improved functioning during psychotherapy. The strongest evidence for symptom-specific effects was found for the symptom of depressed mood or hopelessness.

- **Limitations**: Due to our naturalistic study design containing only two measurement points, we were unable to study the causal relationship between symptoms and functioning.

- **Conclusions**: Changes in certain symptoms during psychotherapy may affect functioning independently of underlying depression. Knowledge about the dynamics between symptoms and functioning remains important for therapeutic strategies.

### Automated classification of depression from structural brain measures across two independent community-based cohorts [^111hBvsx]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Low credibility.

Depression (major depressive disorder, MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition that affects, on average, between 10 and 15% of the general population over their lifetime in countries around the world. It is among the leading causes of disability-adjusted life years, with significant economic costs estimated at €92 billion in Europe and $210 billion in the United States as of 2010. Diagnosing depression reliably remains a challenge, as current research indicates a particularly low rate of diagnostic agreement between specialists. This highlights the importance of developing more reliable and objective diagnostic methods for the illness.

### Clinical research challenges posed by difficult-to-treat depression [^112Cv8he]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Approximately one-third of individuals in a major depressive episode will not achieve sustained remission despite multiple, well-delivered treatments. These patients experience prolonged suffering and disproportionately utilize mental and general health care resources. The recently proposed clinical heuristic of 'difficult-to-treat depression' (DTD) aims to broaden our understanding and focus attention on the identification, clinical management, treatment selection, and outcomes of such individuals.

Clinical trial methodologies developed to detect short-term therapeutic effects in treatment-responsive populations may not be appropriate in DTD. This report reviews three essential challenges for clinical intervention research in DTD:

- **Challenge 1**: How to define and subtype this heterogeneous group of patients.
- **Challenge 2**: How, when, and by what methods to select, acquire, compile, and interpret clinically meaningful outcome metrics.
- **Challenge 3**: How to choose among alternative clinical trial design options to promote causal inference and generalizability.

The boundaries of DTD are uncertain, and an evidence-based taxonomy and reliable assessment tools are preconditions for clinical research and subtyping. Traditional outcome metrics in treatment-responsive depression may not apply to DTD, as they largely reflect only short-term symptomatic change and do not incorporate durability of benefit, side effect burden, or sustained impact on quality of life or daily function. The trial methodology will also require modification as trials will likely be of longer duration to examine the sustained impact.

### The associations between depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and quality of life, in patients with major depression: Undirected and Bayesian network analyses [^1118fxK4]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Based on this background, we hypothesized that there are potential sequential relationships among dimensions of depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and QOL. In addition, we hypothesized that clinical symptoms and dysfunction have domain-specific associations with QOL. These hypotheses were tested on a large sample of patients with MDD using undirected network analyses and DAG.

### Consistency checks to improve measurement with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) [^115kcjD1]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Symptom manifestations in mood disorders can be subtle. Cumulatively, small imprecisions in measurement can limit our ability to measure treatment response accurately. Logical and statistical consistency checks between item responses (i.e. cross-sectionally) and across administrations (i.e. longitudinally) can contribute to improving measurement fidelity.

- **Methods**: The International Society for CNS Clinical Trials and Methodology convened an expert working group that assembled flags indicating consistency/inconsistency ratings for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17), a widely used rating scale in studies of depression. Proposed flags were applied to assessments derived from the NEWMEDS data repository of 95,468 HAM-D administrations from 32 registration trials of antidepressant medications and to Monte Carlo-simulated data as a proxy for applying flags under conditions of known inconsistency.

- **Results**: Two types of flags were derived: logical consistency checks and statistical outlier-response pattern checks. Almost thirty percent of the HAM-D administrations had at least one logical scoring inconsistency flag. Seven percent had flags judged to suggest that a thorough review of rating is warranted. Almost 22% of the administrations had at least one statistical outlier flag and 7.9% had more than one. Most of the administrations in the Monte Carlo-simulated data raised multiple flags.

- **Limitations**: Flagged ratings may represent less common presentations of administrations done correctly.

- **Conclusions**: Application of flags to clinical ratings may contribute to improved measurement with the HAM-D scale.

### Use of the late-life function and disability instrument to assess disability in major depression [^111Xbx97]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). Low credibility.

To determine whether there was greater disability in subjects with depression than in those without, the correlation between disability and depression severity, and quality of life, and whether improvement in disability after antidepressant pharmacotherapy was greater in those who responded to antidepressant treatment, disability in subjects with and without depression from two different studies was compared for 22 weeks. Correlations were performed for the subjects with depression between disability and depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and medical comorbidity. T-tests were used to compare disability between subjects who did and did not respond to antidepressant treatment and change in disability after pharmacotherapy.

The study was conducted in a late-life depression research clinic. The 313 subjects were recruited from primary care and the community and were aged 60 and older. Among them, 244 subjects participated in a depression treatment protocol, and 69 subjects without depression participated in a separate longitudinal observational study of the mental and cognitive health of depression-free older adults. The Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (LL-FDI), a measure of instrumental activity of daily living, personal role, and social role functioning, was used for measurements.

Results showed that subjects with depression scored lower than controls for domains measuring limitation (can do) and frequency (does do) of activities. Both disability domains correlated with depression severity, anxiety, HRQOL, and cognition. Disability improved with antidepressant treatment.

### Life events and treatment prognosis for depression: A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^115NLXiu]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Stressful life events are common; in the present sample, over 70% reported at least one event in the past 6 months. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to it have resulted in increases in people experiencing major life events, particularly serious illness, bereavement, unemployment, and problematic debt. We would expect that, on average, people experiencing such events will be more likely to feel distressed as a result of the events and will be at greater risk of becoming depressed, whether that be with a first lifetime episode or a recurrent one.

This study has shown that life events may play a role in the prognosis for patients seeking treatment for depression in primary care, regardless of treatment type, and whether or not they had chronic depression or were presenting with a first lifetime depressive episode. However, the effects were largely shared with variables that might have been affected by the events (depressive severity, social support, marital status, employment status, and financial strain), and there are a number of important problems with the use of solely self-report checklist measures of life events. Therefore, it may be most informative for prognosis to first assess for clinical, sociodemographic, and contextual prognostic factors, and when considering life events, to use a more thorough method of assessment to consider the ongoing impact of any life events at the point the patient presents. This does not mean that clinicians should not ask their patients about experiences of any such life events; indeed, it is crucial for a comprehensive understanding.

### Life events and treatment prognosis for depression: A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^117CEk85]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

- **Highlights**:
	- Depressed patients reporting severely stressful life events had worse prognoses.
	- Reporting three or more events was associated with considerably worse outcomes.
	- This held in patients with long durations and those in a first depressive episode.
	- Effects were attenuated by variables that might have been affected by the events.
	- Clinicians should routinely ask patients about life events and assess their impact.

### Evaluating the effect of exercise-based interventions on functioning in people with transdiagnostic depressive symptoms: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^113HFndY]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Depressive symptoms are associated with various conditions and can exacerbate the outcome of somatic diseases. Transdiagnostic symptom-based approaches provide treatment flexibility, and exercise has demonstrated benefits beyond clinical symptoms. This work aimed to synthesize and establish the effects of exercise-based interventions on global functioning and quality of life in adults with transdiagnostic depressive symptoms, as well as their impact on clinical symptoms.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to April 2023. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials involving adults with transdiagnostic depressive symptoms who received exercise-based interventions and provided details of the interventions. Comparators included treatment as usual or other active control groups. The Cochrane quality assessment tool was used for quality assessment.

- **Results**: Fifteen articles involving 2,064 participants were included. Data on study design, sample, intervention characteristics, and outcomes were extracted. Several trials demonstrated the expected positive effects of exercise on functioning (7/15). Most results supported the benefits of adjunctive exercise interventions on illness outcomes.

- **Limitations**: The studies had methodological limitations, including small sample sizes and an underrepresentation of somatic diseases.

- **Conclusions**: The functional consequences of exercise-based interventions targeting depressive symptoms are often understudied.

### The responsiveness of EQ-5D utility scores in patients with depression: A comparison with instruments measuring quality of life, psychopathology and social functioning [^115MU1US]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

The EQ-5D provides preference weights (utilities) for health-related quality of life to be used for calculating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in cost-utility analysis. The aim of this study was to compare differences in EQ-5D utility scores with differences in quality of life, psychopathology, and social functioning scores.

- **Methods**: In an observational longitudinal cohort study, EQ-5D utilities (EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS), EQ-5D indices of the United Kingdom (EQ-5D index-UK) and Germany (EQ-5D index-D)) were compared with scores of the WHOQOL-BREF, CGI, and GAF at baseline and at 18 months (N = 104). The patients' health status at follow-up was categorized as "worse", "stable", or "better" using the EQ-5D transition question (patient-based anchor) and the Bech-Rafaelsen melancholy scale (clinician-based anchor). Effect sizes (ES) were used to compare differences in scores within each group over time; regression analysis was used to derive meaningful difference scores in health status associated with a shift from "stable" to "better" health status.

- **Results**: The most responsive instrument was the CGI (patient-based anchor: ES = |0.98|; clinician-based anchor: ES = |1.35|); responsiveness was large in EQ VAS (patient-based anchor: ES = |0.84|; clinician-based anchor: ES = |1.19|), but rather small to medium for EQ-5D index-UK (patient-based anchor: ES = |0.55|; clinician-based anchor: ES = |0.65|) and EQ-5D index-D (patient-based anchor: ES = |0.41|; clinician-based anchor: ES = |0.45|). Compared with the other instruments, the shift to a "better health status" was…

### Health-related quality of life in older depressed psychogeriatric patients: One year follow-up [^112DGyPP]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Depression is one of the most common mental disorders among older adults and the most common mood disorder in late life, leading to increasing global concern as the number of older adults rises. About 4 to 10% of older adults in community settings suffer from major depressive disorders. Risk factors for depression among older adults include female gender, physical morbidity, and impaired levels of physical and cognitive functioning. Depression has been associated with an increased risk of mortality, poorer outcomes in the treatment of physical disorders, and diminished health-related quality of life (HQoL) in older adults.

HQoL relates to the perceived effects of mental and physical health on each individual's ability to live a fulfilling life; thus, it is an important outcome measure in old age and a multidimensional concept. There is no consensus on the definition of HQoL or which questionnaires to use. In the present study, HQoL was understood as a simple index formed by an algorithm where the importance of five health problems (mental and physical) were taken into account. A visual analog scale was used where experiences of overall health were rated.

Knowledge about changes in HQoL after treatment of depression among older adults is an important outcome measure of relevance for those with depression as well as their family, healthcare planners, and healthcare providers. A recent review identified five longitudinal studies of depressed psychogeriatric in- and outpatients with no follow-up after discharge or up to three months after discharge.

### Functioning and quality of life in the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS) [^113eMWx8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to test whether a 12-week treatment of major depression could improve the level of functioning, global health, and quality of life in adolescents.

The Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study (TADS) was a multisite, randomized clinical trial that investigated the effects of fluoxetine, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), their combination (COMB), or clinical management with placebo in 439 adolescents suffering from major depression. Functioning was assessed using the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), global health was measured with the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA), and quality of life was evaluated with the Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PQ-LES-Q). Random-effects regression models were applied to analyze the data.

Compared with placebo, the combination therapy (COMB) was effective on the CGAS (p < .0001), HoNOSCA (p < .05), and PQ-LES-Q (p < .001), whereas fluoxetine was superior to placebo only on the CGAS (p < .05). The combination (COMB) was superior to fluoxetine on the CGAS (p < .05) and PQ-LES-Q (p = .001). Fluoxetine was superior to CBT on the CGAS (p < .01). CBT monotherapy did not show statistically significant differences compared to the placebo group on any of the measures assessed. The treatment effects were mediated by an improvement in depressive symptoms measured on the Child Depression Rating Scale-Revised.

In conclusion, the combination of fluoxetine and CBT proved effective in improving functioning, global health, and quality of life in depressed adolescents, while fluoxetine monotherapy improved functioning.

### Ecological momentary assessment versus weekly questionnaire assessment of change in depression [^112qfizR]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Low credibility.

Studying the effects of a 6-week antidepressant trial, Targum et al. discovered that continuous EMA of changes in depression significantly predicted clinician-rated outcomes. To corroborate these findings, we analyzed the validity of EMA and WQA in predicting changes in global functioning.

- **Separate models (EMA or WQA)**: Changes in depressive symptoms and RNT assessed with WQA significantly predicted changes in global functioning. In contrast, the results for EMA were mixed. Specifically, changes in depressive symptoms assessed with EMA emerged as a significant predictor, but EMA-assessed changes in RNT failed to significantly predict change in global functioning.

- **Combined models (EMA and WQA)**: Changes in depressive symptoms and RNT assessed with WQA continued to significantly predict changes in global functioning. However, in the combined models, changes in depressive symptoms assessed with EMA did not emerge as significant predictors.

The results are consistent with those of Targum et al. in that EMA-assessed changes in depression significantly predict clinician ratings. Nevertheless, our hypothesis, asserting that EMA-assessed changes in depressive symptoms and RNT could be stronger predictors of clinician-rated changes in global functioning, was not supported by the results. A plausible explanation for our findings could be the shared time reference of questionnaires and clinician ratings, as both, unlike EMA, rely on retrospective recall.
