## Question

CLSI of ESBL

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of CLSI's current stance on ESBL detection and reporting, including historical changes, current recommendations, practical implementation, and how to align with IDSA treatment guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical evolution from mandatory ESBL testing to breakpoint-based interpretation. Then, I should verify the current CLSI M100 position and what changed in recent editions. Next, I will examine phenotypic and genotypic detection methods and their limitations. After that, I should review species-specific issues, especially Klebsiella oxytoca complex and AmpC overlap. Then, I will reconcile CLSI laboratory guidance with IDSA treatment recommendations. Finally, I will outline a pragmatic laboratory workflow and summarize the key takeaways with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the historical context. Initially, CLSI required screening and confirmatory ESBL testing for E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca, and laboratories were instructed to report ESBL-producing isolates as resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam regardless of MICs, which meant suppressing susceptible results for these agents when ESBL was detected [^notfound]. Wait, let me verify the timing — this mandatory ESBL reporting approach predated the 2010 breakpoint revision, after which CLSI moved away from routine ESBL confirmation and toward lower cephalosporin and carbapenem breakpoints to capture resistance phenotypes directly [^114wTf5y].

> Hold on, I should verify the pivotal 2010 change. CLSI lowered Enterobacterales breakpoints for third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems and explicitly eliminated the requirement to perform ESBL screening and confirmation for routine clinical care, arguing that the revised breakpoints would detect wild-type organisms lacking acquired resistance and obviate the need for mechanism-specific testing in most cases [^114wTf5y] [^113PM8Ex]. I need to ensure I'm precise here: this did not prohibit ESBL testing; it removed the mandate and shifted interpretation to MIC-based categories, which many laboratories adopted to streamline workflows and reporting [^114wTf5y].

> Next, I should review the most recent updates. In M100 32nd–33rd editions, CLSI reintroduced nuanced guidance: laboratories may still choose to perform ESBL testing for epidemiology or infection control, and a new comment in Table 2A advises consulting antimicrobial stewardship when deciding whether to pursue phenotypic or genotypic ESBL testing to guide therapy, reflecting renewed interest in mechanism-informed treatment decisions and the availability of newer agents [^114wTf5y]. Let me double-check the wording — yes, the language is permissive rather than prescriptive, emphasizing institutional policy and stewardship input rather than a universal requirement [^114wTf5y].

> I will now examine phenotypic detection methods and their pitfalls. Traditional approaches include screening for non-susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins or cefpodoxime, followed by confirmatory tests such as the combination disk test or double-disk synergy test, which rely on clavulanate synergy to infer ESBL activity [^116E4h7s]. But wait, what if AmpC is present? Coproduction of plasmid-mediated AmpC can mask ESBLs and cause false negatives, and multiple resistance mechanisms can yield false positives, so phenotypic confirmation is imperfect and may require additional incubation, impacting turnaround time [^114wTf5y] [^116E4h7s]. I should confirm that modified approaches using boronic acid or aztreonam plus clavulanate can improve detection in AmpC backgrounds; indeed, aztreonam–clavulanate and boronic acid–supplemented tests show higher sensitivity in these settings, though they are not universally standardized in CLSI documents [^112p74LK] [^117C8PPw].

> Let me consider genotypic methods. PCR and whole-genome sequencing can rapidly identify blaCTX-M, blaSHV, and blaTEM variants, offering high analytical specificity and actionable epidemiologic data, but they may miss uncommon or emerging alleles and do not quantify enzyme expression or account for porin changes that affect MICs [^116h1j83]. I should double-check that CLSI acknowledges these trade-offs and supports selective genotypic testing in coordination with stewardship, which it does in the recent M100 commentary framework [^114wTf5y].

> Now, species-specific issues. For Klebsiella oxytoca complex, standard ESBL screens and MIC-based confirmatory tests often cannot distinguish ESBL producers from hyperproducers of chromosomal OXY β-lactamases, leading to high false-positive ESBL calls and unnecessary confirmatory testing; optimized disk diffusion strategies and species-tailored cutoffs can mitigate this, but evidence is limited to small strain sets and needs validation [^116g2QsH] [^112acRWa]. Hold on, I should verify that CLSI does not currently endorse a specific Ko C algorithm; that remains an area of evolving practice rather than a formal CLSI standard [^11525qQx].

> I need to check AmpC overlap as well. CLSI lacks a standardized phenotypic method for AmpC detection, yet cefepime is often active against derepressed AmpC organisms and is suggested by IDSA for moderate-risk AmpC species, whereas ESBLs commonly inactivate cefepime and MIC testing for cefepime can be unreliable in ESBL-E, complicating interpretation and counseling to clinicians [^1142eo3Y] [^11515DY3]. Let me reconsider the implication: this means that even when cefepime appears susceptible, ESBL-E infections outside the urinary tract are generally not managed with cefepime per IDSA, reinforcing the need to communicate mechanism risk rather than rely solely on MIC categories [^11515DY3].

> Next, I should review how to reconcile CLSI laboratory guidance with IDSA treatment recommendations. CLSI does not dictate therapy, but IDSA advises carbapenems as preferred therapy for ESBL-E bloodstream infections based on MERINO trial data and extrapolates this to other serious sites, while suggesting fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX for pyelonephritis/cUTI if susceptible and avoiding piperacillin–tazobactam for ESBL-E infections outside the urinary tract despite in vitro susceptibility [^113tN5kt] [^114SRmeB] [^115SPMPY]. Wait, let me verify the piperacillin–tazobactam point — yes, IDSA explicitly recommends against piperacillin–tazobactam for ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI and for infections outside the urinary tract, even if the lab reports susceptibility, due to clinical failure signals and PK/PD limitations in high-burden infections [^114SRmeB] [^115SPMPY]. I should confirm that CLSI M100 does not instruct hiding TZP susceptibility; correct, CLSI leaves reporting decisions to institutional policy coordinated with stewardship, even as IDSA advises clinicians not to use TZP for these infections [^114wTf5y] [^115SPMPY].

> Let me outline a pragmatic laboratory workflow while acknowledging variability. Screening can be triggered by non-susceptibility to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefpodoxime, or cefotaxime, with some laboratories using ceftriaxone MIC thresholds as a proxy for ESBL risk, recognizing imperfect predictive value and the need for local validation [^114EyVD3] [^114iN8uE]. Confirmatory testing with combination disk or double-disk synergy can be performed when epidemiology or clinical context warrants, and genotypic testing can be reserved for discordant phenotypes, outbreaks, or high-risk settings; results should be communicated with clear stewardship prompts and, where relevant, with cautions about cefepime and piperacillin–tazobactam in ESBL-E [^114wTf5y] [^116E4h7s] [^116h1j83]. Hold on, I should verify that rapid blood culture assays exist; yes, direct ESBL tests from positive blood cultures can shorten time-to-result by about two days in some protocols, though implementation varies and should be aligned with local validation and stewardship pathways [^114nXPws] [^112AAQAT].

> I should confirm reporting conventions. CLSI no longer mandates suppression of susceptible cephalosporin or aztreonam results when ESBL is detected; laboratories may report ESBL status as a comment for infection control or epidemiology, but therapeutic decisions should be guided by MICs interpreted with current breakpoints and clinical context, ideally in consultation with stewardship and IDSA guidance [^114wTf5y]. But wait, what if an institution wants to hide TZP susceptibility for ESBL-E? That remains an institutional policy decision, not a CLSI requirement, and should be explicitly agreed upon with clinicians and stewardship to avoid confusion and delays in care [^114wTf5y].

> Key takeaway, and let me double-check the balance of evidence. CLSI's current position is that routine ESBL testing is not required for routine patient care because lowered cephalosporin and carbapenem breakpoints detect resistance phenotypes, but laboratories may selectively perform ESBL testing for epidemiology, infection control, or mechanism-guided therapy in coordination with stewardship; phenotypic tests have limitations with AmpC and multiple enzymes, and genotypic methods add value but are not a panacea, so results must be interpreted in clinical context and aligned with IDSA treatment principles favoring carbapenems for serious ESBL-E infections and avoidance of piperacillin–tazobactam for ESBL-E outside the urinary tract despite susceptibility [^114wTf5y] [^113tN5kt] [^115SPMPY].

---

CLSI no longer requires routine ESBL screening or confirmation for Enterobacterales because **lowered cephalosporin breakpoints** [^1155TXPe] reliably detect ESBL-mediated resistance [^113PM8Ex]. Laboratories should report MICs or zone sizes using **current CLSI breakpoints** [^113PM8Ex] and may add an ESBL comment for infection control or epidemiology [^114wTf5y]. For isolates with elevated third-generation cephalosporin MICs (e.g. ceftriaxone ≥ 2 μg/mL) [^114EyVD3], consider phenotypic confirmation (e.g. combination disk test) [^116E4h7s] or molecular testing [^116h1j83] if results will guide therapy or outbreak control. Piperacillin-tazobactam should not be used for ESBL infections [^113L9Jv2] despite in vitro susceptibility, and carbapenems remain first-line therapy for severe infections [^113tN5kt].

---

## Historical evolution of CLSI ESBL guidelines

- **Pre-2010 guidelines**: Routine ESBL screening and confirmation were required for Enterobacterales, and ESBL producers were reported as resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam regardless of MICs.

- **2010 CLSI revision**: Lowered cephalosporin and aztreonam breakpoints [^113PM8Ex] for Enterobacterales, eliminating the need for routine ESBL screening/confirmation; MICs or disk diffusion results using current breakpoints suffice [^113PM8Ex].

- **Recent updates (M100 32nd–33rd editions)**: Emphasize reporting MICs/zone sizes with current breakpoints [^notfound]; ESBL testing is optional for infection control/epidemiology, not for routine clinical decisions.

---

## Current CLSI recommendations for ESBL detection

### Primary detection method

The primary approach is **MIC-based interpretation** [^114wTf5y] — use current CLSI breakpoints to interpret third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam; ESBL-mediated resistance is captured by lowered breakpoints [^113PM8Ex].

---

### Optional confirmatory methods

- **Phenotypic confirmation**: Combination disk test (CDT) or double-disk synergy test (DDST) [^116E4h7s] may be used when ESBL confirmation is needed (e.g. infection control, epidemiology) [^114wTf5y].

- **Molecular methods**: PCR or whole-genome sequencing can identify ESBL genes (e.g. blaCTX-M, blaSHV, blaTEM) [^116h1j83] for epidemiologic or outbreak investigations [^114wTf5y].

---

## Clinical implications of ESBL detection

### Therapeutic considerations

Carbapenems are **first-line therapy** [^113tN5kt] for severe ESBL infections (e.g. bloodstream, pneumonia, intra-abdominal) given superior clinical outcomes. Piperacillin-tazobactam is **not recommended** for ESBL infections [^115SPMPY] despite in vitro susceptibility due to clinical failure risk [^113L9Jv2]. Alternative agents such as ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and cefiderocol are reserved for carbapenem-resistant organisms or polymicrobial infections [^1175kcte] [^117TnyzY].

---

### Infection control measures

Contact precautions are recommended for patients with **ESBL-producing organisms** to prevent transmission [^notfound]. Antimicrobial stewardship programs should guide appropriate use of **carbapenems and alternative agents** to limit resistance [^114wTf5y].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **False positives/negatives**: Phenotypic tests can be confounded by AmpC co-production or multiple β-lactamases, requiring careful interpretation [^114wTf5y] [^113amgsE].

- **Resource constraints**: Molecular methods are rapid and accurate [^116h1j83] but costly and may be limited to reference or outbreak settings [^115eAbwV].

- **Clinical correlation**: ESBL detection should guide therapy but must be integrated with clinical context and patient factors [^113tN5kt].

## Summary of CLSI ESBL guidelines

| **Aspect** | **Current clsi recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Primary detection | MIC-based interpretation using current breakpoints [^114wTf5y] |
| Confirmatory testing | Optional (CDT, DDST, PCR) for infection control/epidemiology [^114wTf5y] [^116h1j83] |
| Reporting | Report MICs/zone sizes; ESBL comment optional [^114wTf5y] |
| Clinical management | Carbapenems first-line; avoid piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL infections [^113tN5kt] [^115SPMPY] |

---

CLSI's current approach prioritizes **MIC-based interpretation** [^114wTf5y] with lowered cephalosporin breakpoints, making routine ESBL screening unnecessary for clinical decisions. ESBL testing remains optional for infection control or epidemiology, and results should guide therapy while aligning with stewardship and clinical judgment [^114wTf5y].

### Breakpoints for intravenously used cephalosporins in enterobacteriaceae – EUCAST and CLSI breakpoints [^111WAURR]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

It has long been acknowledged that the cephalosporin breakpoints used in most European countries and the United States fail to detect many or most extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Enterobacteriaceae and that all ESBLs are clinically significant. Therefore, microbiological laboratories have undertaken not only regular cephalosporin susceptibility tests based on breakpoints, but also special tests to detect all ESBLs. An increasing accumulation of clinical data implies that the clinical success of third generation cephalosporin therapy is related more to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) than to the presence or absence of an ESBL. However, the breakpoints must be lower than those previously recommended by many breakpoint committees. In Europe, this adjustment has been achieved by EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) through the ongoing process of harmonising European breakpoints. In the United States, the CLSI recently voted to adopt similar guidelines but are waiting to implement these while revising other beta-lactam breakpoints. As Enterobacteriaceae are becoming increasingly resistant, a less 'diehard' interpretation of the relationship among MICs, ESBLs and clinical outcome may provide therapeutic alternatives in difficult situations.

### Overview of changes in the clinical and laboratory standards institute performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing: M100 32nd and 33rd editions [^114wTf5y]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2010, CLSI lowered the Enterobacterales cephalosporin and carbapenem breakpoints, eliminating the requirement to perform specific resistance mechanism identification for ESBLs or carbapenemase producers for laboratories that adopted the lower breakpoints. At the time, the lower breakpoints were considered sufficient to accurately detect wild-type organisms lacking acquired resistance mechanisms. However, with the publication of the MERINO trial data that focused on infections caused by ESBL-producing isolates of Enterobacterales and the development of new antimicrobials that target specific mechanisms of resistance, the need to identify the mechanism of certain types of resistance has resurfaced. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) updated its treatment guidelines to reflect these newer developments and made therapeutic recommendations based on the known presence of a specific resistance mechanism. The M100 33rd edition provides a comment in Table 2A, pointing the laboratory user to consult with ASP when deciding whether to perform phenotypic or genotypic testing for ESBLs to guide therapeutic management. Laboratories may still choose to report ESBLs for infection control or epidemiological purposes but may also report for therapeutic decisions. A similar comment concerning carbapenemase producers was also added to the carbapenem section of M100 Table 2A.

There are several factors that need to be taken into consideration before implementing these new testing and reporting recommendations. One such consideration is whether the laboratory has the workflow and methodology capabilities to assess ESBL and carbapenem resistance mechanisms — either by phenotypic or genotypic methods. False-negative results of phenotypic ESBL testing have been observed due to the coproduction of AmpC beta-lactamases, and false-positive results have occurred among isolates with multiple mechanisms of resistance. Phenotypic testing may require additional setup and incubation times and lead to a longer time to results compared to genotypic testing. Certain tests are limited to select species of Enterobacterales, and laboratories using commercial systems may have additional reporting limitations. One must also consider how to report the resistance mechanism accurately and clearly in the laboratory report so that it conveys the correct message to the clinician treating the patient. It is important to note that CLSI M100 does not include specific treatment recommendations. The IDSA treatment guidelines recommend that piperacillin-tazobactam should not be used for ESBL-producing isolates of Enterobacterales, even if the antimicrobial tests are susceptible; however, there is no guidance in the M100 33rd edition that recommends hiding susceptible piperacillin-tazobactam results or changing the interpretation to resistant when an ESBL is detected. These decisions are institution-specific and are to be discussed in collaboration with the laboratory and relevant stakeholders.

Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance — ceftriaxone for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production states: "Ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime or ceftazidime) is not suggested for the treatment of invasive infections" caused by E. cloacae complex, K. aerogenes, and C. freundii, but "Ceftriaxone is reasonable for uncomplicated cystitis… when susceptibility is demonstrated". The rationale notes uncertainty and diagnostic limits: "Clinical reports differ on how frequently resistance to ceftriaxone emerges", "there are no CLSI-endorsed approaches for AmpC detection in clinical isolates", and "these organisms may display ceftriaxone resistance for other reasons (eg, ESBL production)".

### Innovative approaches in phenotypic β-lactamase detection for personalised infection management [^116E4h7s]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

ESBL Detection methods

In most laboratories, ESBL detection and characterisation is mandatory or strongly recommended as beta-lactamase-producing bacteria tend to harbour broad resistance to many first-line antimicrobials used in clinical practice. Both the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines recommend ESBL screening followed by a confirmatory test. Failure to identify and mitigate the transmission of plasmid mediated ESBL can have serious consequences for infection control. Traditionally, detection of ESBL-producing isolates has relied on phenotypic methods that take advantage of beta-lactamase inhibition in vitro by clavulanate.

Screening for ESBLs is conducted on bacterial isolates using methods such as disc diffusion and agar or broth dilution, or automated systems. If an isolate is found to be indeterminate or resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, or cefpodoxime), ESBL confirmation testing is required. The confirmation of ESBL production can be performed using several techniques. The most common methods are the combination disc test (CDT), where antibiotic discs containing a beta-lactamase inhibitor show a significant increase in the inhibition zone compared to the antibiotic alone; and the double disc synergy test (DDST), which places cephalosporin discs near a disc with a beta-lactamase inhibitor and looks for an enhanced inhibition zone. Other methods include the ESBL gradient test, which utilises strips with a gradient of a beta-lactam antibiotic and a beta-lactamase inhibitor to reveal differences in minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs); and broth microdilution methods which compare MICs in the presence and absence of a beta-lactamase inhibitor.

### Time to switch from CLSI to EUCAST? A southeast Asian perspective [^116hCAtc]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, there are important practical differences between CLSI and EUCAST disk-diffusion AST guidelines, and whilst we agree with other authors advocating EUCAST as the preferred AST methodology in low- and middle-income countries, challenges involved in switching to EUCAST from CLSI should not be underestimated in these settings. Furthermore, discrepancies in clinical breakpoints will alter institutional antibiograms following a switch between the two methodologies, and will hamper broader AMR surveillance initiatives such as GLASS. This report highlights the need for a globally harmonized AST system that is practical and freely available, and we hope it will be a useful guide for laboratories considering switching between CLSI and EUCAST.

### Controversies about extended-spectrum and ampC β-lactamases [^1165e1kd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Many clinical laboratories have problems detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. Confusion exists about the importance of these resistance mechanisms, optimal test methods, and appropriate reporting conventions. Failure to detect these enzymes has contributed to their uncontrolled spread and sometimes to therapeutic failures. Although National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards recommendations exist for detecting ESBL- producing isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., no recommendations exist for detecting ESBLs in other organisms or for detecting plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases in any organisms. Clinical laboratories need to have adequate funding, equipment, and expertise to provide a rapid and clinically relevant antibiotic testing service in centers where these resistance mechanisms are encountered.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114EyVD3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

IDSA 2023 ESBL-E background — enzymatic activity, prevalence, and laboratory detection are outlined as follows: ESBLs are enzymes that inactivate most penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, and ESBLs do not inactivate non-β-lactam agents such as ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), gentamicin, and doxycycline, although organisms carrying ESBL genes often harbor additional genes or mutations in genes expanding their resistance to a broad range of antibiotics. ESBL genes are most prevalent in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis. Routine ESBL testing is not performed by most clinical microbiology laboratories; rather, non-susceptibility to ceftriaxone (ie, ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] ≥ 2 μg/mL), is often used as a proxy for ESBL production, although this threshold has limitations, and for this guidance document, ESBL-E refers to presumed or confirmed ESBL-producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, or P. mirabilis.

### Determining the optimal ceftriaxone MIC for triggering extended-spectrum β-lactamase confirmatory testing [^114iN8uE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

As routine testing of clinical isolates for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production (screen plus phenotypic confirmatory testing) is no longer required by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), a number of clinical microbiology laboratories use ceftriaxone MICs as a proxy means of identifying bacteria as potential ESBL producers. Data from 1,386 clinical isolates suggest that a ceftriaxone MIC cutoff of 8 μg/ml is an excellent predictor of ESBL production, with a positive predictive value and negative predictive value approaching 100% and 99.5%, respectively.

### Global spread of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae [^112LxgEB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of Carbapenemase Producers

The detection of carbapenemase producers in clinical infections is based first on susceptibility testing results obtained by disk diffusion or by automated systems. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; Wayne, PA, USA) breakpoints of carbapenems have been lowered substantially in 2010 for a better detection of carbapenem-resistant isolates and carbapenemase producers (Table 2). The CLSI breakpoints of carbapenems are now lower than those of the European guidelines (Table 2). Applying the CLSI breakpoints is all that is needed for making treatment decisions according to CLSI recommendations. Special tests for carbapenemase detection are recommended for epidemiology and infection issues.

Table 2
Breakpoint values (MIC, mg/L) for carbapenems according to guidelines in Europe (EUCAST) and the United States (CLSI), September 2010*

*EUCAST, European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing; CLSI, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; S, sensitive; R, resistant.

However, low-level resistance and even susceptibility to carbapenems have been observed for producers of any type of carbapenemases (Table 1). We believe, as do others, that the search for carbapenemase producers should be made for any enterobacterial isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems. Our opinion is based on the paucity of clinical experience for treating infections caused by carbapenemase producers, on the unknown level of carbapenemase production in the site of the infection in vivo, and on the possibility of selecting in vivo for strains with increased levels of resistance to carbapenems and additional mechanisms of carbapenem resistance (carbapenemase, outer-membrane permeability defects).

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing gram-negative bacilli in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) — antibiotic selection emphasizes susceptibility testing rather than a single preferred regimen, as "the panel did not recommend a preferred antibiotic regimen for patients with confirmed HAP/VAP caused by ESBL-producing gram-negative bacilli", and "The panel agreed that antimicrobial susceptibility testing provides the best information to inform antibiotic choices". The guideline states, "The recommendation is strong despite the very low quality of evidence", and adds that "the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute no longer recommends specific ESBL testing, thus, this recommendation also applies when the ESBL phenotype is suspected".

### Antimicrobials: a global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^114QegzD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Obtaining microbiological results from blood or fluid/tissue culture from the site of infection has two advantages: a) it provides an opportunity to expand antimicrobial regimen if the initial choice was too narrow, and, b) it also allows de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy if the empirical regimen was too broad. When a microorganism is identified in clinical cultures, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) should always be performed and reported to guide antibiotic therapy. AST measures the ability of a specific organism to grow in the presence of a particular drug using guidelines established by either the Clinical or Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) in United States or the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) in Europe. By the end of 2012, in several European Countries, CLSI guidelines had been replaced by EUCAST. In vitro susceptibility results are correlated with the clinical success or failure of an antibiotic against a particular organism. Data are reported in the form of MIC, which is the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that inhibits visible growth of a microorganism. The numerical MIC number, expressed as micrograms/ml, is usually reported by microbiology laboratories as a categorical guide for clinicians, ie as "susceptible", "resistant", or "intermediate", according to CLSI and EUCAST criteria. In general, EUCAST supports lower, more stringent, resistance MIC breakpoints than CLSI, in particular for Gram-negative bacteria. However, in only a few cases have these differences been translated into major interpretive category discrepancies. Both CLSI and EUCAST periodically update their recommendations concerning the interpretation of in vitro AST. Recently, both CLSI and EUCAST published new AST guidelines, but some differences in terms of the categorization of ESBLs still remain in the EUCAST guidelines. In general, it may be a wise practice to communicate directly with the microbiology laboratory when antimicrobial susceptibility patterns appear unusual.

### Diagnosis and treatment of extended-spectrum and ampC β-lactamase-producing organisms [^113amgsE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the laboratory diagnosis of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and evaluate potential treatment options.

Data Sources

A PubMed search, restricted to English-language articles, was conducted (1966-May 2007) using the search terms ESBL, AmpC, diagnosis, detection, carbapenem, ertapenem, fluoroquinolone, cephalosporin, cefepime, tigecycline, and colistin. Additional references were identified through review of bibliographies of identified articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies that evaluated laboratory methods for the detection of ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases and/or the treatment of these organisms were reviewed. All articles that were deemed to be clinically pertinent were included and critically evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Numerous laboratory techniques are available for the detection of ESBLs. In contrast, laboratory techniques for detection of AmpC beta-lactamases are limited, particularly for plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. Routine microbiologic testing may not detect ESBLs or AmpC beta-lactamases. Optimal antibiotic treatment options are derived from limited observational studies and case reports. Randomized clinical trials evaluating appropriate antibiotic treatment options are lacking. In vitro susceptibility does not always correlate with clinical outcomes. The use of imipenem was associated with the lowest incidence of mortality in patients with bacteremia due to ESBL-producing organisms.

Conclusions

Laboratory detection of ESBLs for most organisms is possible with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute-recommended testing. However, these tests can be associated with both false negative and false positive results, particularly with organisms that harbor both ESBL- and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. No established guidelines exist for the detection of AmpC beta-lactamases. Imipenem and meropenem are superior to other antibiotics for the treatment of serious infections due to ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. While in vitro data demonstrate that tigecycline, ertapenem, and colistin might be potential choices, clinical experience is lacking.

### Impact of changes in CLSI and EUCAST breakpoints for susceptibility in bloodstream infections due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli [^112Bxow8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

The impact of recent changes in and discrepancies between the breakpoints for cephalosporins and other antimicrobials, as determined by CLSI and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), was analysed in patients with bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli in Spain, was analysed. We studied a cohort of 191 episodes of bloodstream infection caused by ESBL-producing E. coli in 13 Spanish hospitals; the susceptibility of isolates to different antimicrobials was investigated by microdilution and interpreted according to recommendations established in 2009 and 2010 by CLSI, and in 2011 by EUCAST. Overall, 58.6% and 14.7% of isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime, and 35.1% and 14.7% to cefepime using the CLSI-2010 and EUCAST-2009/2011 recommendations, respectively (all isolates would have been considered resistant using the previous guidelines). Discrepancies between the CLSI-2010 and the EUCAST-2011 recommendations were statistically significant for other antimicrobials only in the case of amikacin (98.4% versus 75.9% of susceptible isolates; p < 0.01). The results varied depending on the ESBL produced. No significant differences were found in the percentage of patients classified as receiving appropriate therapy, following the different recommendations. Four out of 11 patients treated with active cephalosporins according to CLSI-2010 guidelines died (all had severe sepsis or shock); these cases would have been considered resistant according to EUCAST-2011. In conclusion, by using current breakpoints, extended-spectrum cephalosporins would be regarded as active agents for treating a significant proportion of patients with bloodstream infections caused by ESBL-producing E. coli.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114SRmeB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Drug-resistant enteric fever worldwide, 1990 to 2018: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Fj3Mt]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

We identified several studies that reported higher proportions of ceftriaxone- and azithromycin-resistant S. Typhi organisms than a recently published smaller systematic review on resistance determinants of S. Typhi; this discrepancy may reflect methodological weaknesses. The majority of studies with a high proportion of ceftriaxone-resistant isolates performed disc susceptibility testing only, without further MIC and ESBL-testing. Whilst these comply with current CLSI guidelines (the recommendations to perform confirmatory tests were removed in 2010), we identified several studies that reported conflicting results between disc susceptibility testing and MIC testing (i.e. resistance not confirmed by MIC), raising doubt about the reliability of some of these results. For example, one study reported 100% intermediate ceftriaxone resistance but did not investigate ESBL-production or discuss these alarming results.

High-quality AST testing is an important public health tool; identifying AMR will guide practitioners towards effective antimicrobial regimens and enable updated local treatment guidelines, whilst at the same time it also prevents practitioners being steered away from effective antimicrobials due to unsubstantiated results. These issues are very important as our antimicrobial armamentarium is limited.

Piperacillin–tazobactam dosing ratios and susceptibility breakpoints — In a 4.5 g dose of piperacillin-tazobactam there is an 8:1 ratio of piperacillin to tazobactam (ie, 4 grams of piperacillin and 0.5 grams of tazobactam), whereas in a 3 g dose of cefotolozane there is a 2:1 ratio of cefotolozane to tazobactam. The piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoint for Enterobacterales has been based on PK/PD considerations and a fixed concentration of 4 μg/mL of tazobactam in testing wells. In 2022, the CLSI lowered the piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoints for Enterobacterales: MICs of ≤ 8/4 μg/mL are considered susceptible and a MIC of 16 μg/mL is considered susceptible, dose-dependent; in the clinical trial mentioned in Question 1.3, 94% of isolates would have been considered susceptible or susceptible dose-dependent under the revised breakpoints, indicating that in the presence of ESBL production, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam may not correlate with clinical success.

### Evaluation of a diagnostic flow chart for detection and confirmation of extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) in enterobacteriaceae [^113MB6ct]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

This study aimed to develop a modular, diagnostic algorithm for extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) detection in Enterobacteriaceae. Clinical Enterobacteriaceae strains (n = 2518) were screened for ESBL production using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints for third-generation cephalosporins and by synergy image detection (clavulanic acid/extended-spectrum cephalosporins). Isolates screening positive for ESBL (n = 242, 108 by critical CLSI diameters alone, five by double disk synergy test (DDST) alone, and 129 by both critical diameters and DDST) and 138 ESBL screening negative isolates (control group) were investigated by molecular methods considered to be the reference standard (multiplex CTX-M type PCR, TEM and SHV type sequence characterization). One hundred and twenty-four out of 242 Enterobacteriaceae isolates screening positive for ESBL were confirmed to be ESBL positive by the reference standard, the majority of them in E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae (94, 17 and nine isolates, respectively). Prevalence of ESBL production ranged from < 1% for P. mirabilis to 4.7%, 5.1% and 6.6%, for K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and E. coli, respectively. Combining CLSI ceftriaxone and cefpodoxime critical ESBL diameters was found to be the most sensitive phenotypic screening method (sensitivity 99.2%). Combining critical diameters of cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone with DDST for cefpodoxime resulted in a sensitivity of 100%. For phenotypic confirmation, combining the CLSI recommended combined disk test (CDT) for ceftazidime and cefotaxime amended with a cefepime CDT was highly sensitive (100%) and specific (97.5%). With respect to the studied population, the diagnostic ESBL algorithm developed would have resulted in sensitivity and specificity of 100%. The corresponding flow chart is simple, easy to use, inexpensive and applicable in the routine diagnostic laboratory.

### Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae detection practices in California: what are we missing? [^117PMFf8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) revised the carbapenem breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae in 2010. The number of hospitals that adopted revised breakpoints and the clinical impact of delayed adoption has not been explored.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional, voluntary survey of microbiology laboratories from California acute care hospitals and long-term acute care hospitals (LTAC) to determine use of revised CLSI breakpoints. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) clinical isolates from a single tertiary-care hospital from 2013 to 2017 were examined. All isolates with an elevated minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; ≥ 2 µg/mL) to imipenem or meropenem were tested for the presence of carbapenemase genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Results

We received responses from 128 laboratories that serve 264/393 (67%) of hospitals and LTACs. Current CLSI carbapenem breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae were used by 92/128 (72%) laboratories. Among laboratories that used current breakpoints, time to implementation varied from 0 to 68 months (mean, 41 months; median, 55 months). Application of historical breakpoints to isolates with a carbapenemase gene detected by PCR resulted in susceptibility rates of 8.9%, 18.6%, and 18.6% to ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem, respectively. By current breakpoints, < 1% of these isolates were susceptible to ertapenem or imipenem and 2.6% to meropenem.

Conclusion

Clinicians and epidemiologists should be aware that use of outdated MIC breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae remains common and can result in reports of false susceptibility to carbapenems and missed identification of carbapenemase producers. This misclassification could have consequences for patient care and infection control efforts to address carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

### Background and rationale for revised clinical and laboratory standards institute interpretive criteria (breakpoints) for enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa: I. cephalosporins and aztreonam [^1155TXPe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Widespread resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cephalosporin and monobactam antibiotics due to extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) has resulted in the need for reassessment of the interpretative criteria (breakpoints) established for these agents more than 2 decades ago. Following extensive evaluation, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recently adopted and published new breakpoints for these agents for use in clinical laboratories and provided updated recommendations for use of the ESBL screening test. This paper summarizes the background and supportive rationale for new interpretative criteria for cephalosporins and aztreonam for testing Enterobacteriaceae.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance on the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa) [^115269oF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial-resistant infections are commonly encountered in US hospitals and result in significant morbidity and mortality. This guidance document provides recommendations for the treatment of infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa).

Methods

A panel of 6 infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated common questions regarding the treatment of ESBL-E, CRE, and DTR-P. aeruginosa infections. Based on review of the published literature and clinical experience, the panel provide recommendations and associated rationale for each recommendation. Because of significant differences in the molecular epidemiology of resistance and the availability of specific anti-infective agents globally, this document focuses on treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections in the United States.

Results

Approaches to empiric treatment selection, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are briefly discussed. The majority of guidance focuses on preferred and alternative treatment recommendations for antimicrobial-resistant infections, assuming that the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility testing results are known. Treatment recommendations apply to both adults and children.

Conclusions

The field of antimicrobial resistance is dynamic and rapidly evolving, and the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections will continue to challenge clinicians. This guidance document is current as of 17 September 2020. Updates to this guidance document will occur periodically as new data emerge. Furthermore, the panel will expand recommendations to include other problematic gram-negative pathogens in future versions. The most current version of the guidance including the date of publication can be found at www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/amr-guidance/.

### Detection of ESBL-producingcomplex with VITEK 2 system and screening cutoffs for implementing confirmatory tests [^115bV67Y]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

EUCAST suggests screening for ESBL producers when the inhibition zone for the 10 µg disk is ≤ 21 mm. For our Ko C strains, this approach showed 91.7% Se, 73.3% Sp, and 47.8% PPV. In contrast, a slightly higher cutoff of ≤ 22 mm could offer 100% Se, although the decrease of Sp and PPV may raise the number of ESBL-CTs of ~4%–5% (Table 3). With regard to the CLSI, the CAZ disk (30 µg) cutoff is set at ≤ 22 mm, resulting in a very low accuracy for our collection of strains (61.1% Se, 94.3% Sp). We note that only by using a ≤ 29 mm cutoff, a 100% Se could be reached, but with poor Sp and PPV (66.0% and 39.3%, respectively) (Table 3). This observation was also supported by Fujita et al. who reported CAZ (30 µg) inhibition diameters for the CTX-M producers of 24 and 26 mm, while those for non-ESBL-positive strains were > 22 mm in ~60% of the cases (File S2).

Overall, we propose screening cutoffs of ≤ 22 and ≤ 30 mm for the EUCAST and CLSI CAZ disks for Ko C, respectively. However, we underline that the use of the 30 µg CLSI disk with the ≤ 30 mm cutoff would imply testing ~70% more Ko C strains (Table 4). This lower performance of the CLSI disk was already noted for the ESBL confirmatory CDT executed in the present analysis (see above; Tables 1 and 2).

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^11515DY3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) — cefepime: The panel suggests avoiding cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis or cUTI and for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if cefepime tests susceptible; however, if cefepime was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis due to an organism later identified as ESBL-E and the patient improves, no change or extension of therapy is necessary. Rationale includes that ESBLs commonly hydrolyze cefepime, cefepime MIC testing may be inaccurate and/or poorly reproducible with commercial AST methods, clinical trials comparing cefepime with a carbapenem for ESBL-E bloodstream infections have not been conducted, and for these reasons the panel suggests avoiding cefepime for invasive ESBL-E infections.

### Modified CLSI extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) confirmatory test for phenotypic detection of ESBLs among enterobacteriaceae producing various β-lactamases [^117C8PPw]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

The worldwide dissemination of Enterobacteriaceae producing AmpC β-lactamases and carbapenemases makes difficult the phenotypic detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), as they may be masked by these additional enzymes. A modification of the CLSI ESBL confirmatory test was developed and evaluated in a comparative study for its ability to successfully detect ESBLs among Enterobacteriaceae producing various carbapenemases (Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase [KPC], VIM, NDM, and OXA-48) and plasmidic or derepressed AmpCs. The modified CLSI ESBL confirmatory test was performed with cefotaxime and ceftazidime disks with and without clavulanate, on which both boronic acid (BA) and EDTA were dispensed. A total of 162 genotypically confirmed ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae isolates (83 carbapenemase/ESBL producers, 25 AmpC/ESBL producers, and 54 ESBL-only producers) were examined. For comparison, 139 genotypically confirmed ESBL-negative Enterobacteriaceae isolates (94 of them possessed carbapenemases and 20 possessed AmpCs) were also tested. The standard CLSI ESBL confirmatory test was positive for 106 of the 162 ESBL producers (sensitivity, 65.4%) and showed false-positive results for 4 of the 139 non-ESBL producers (specificity, 97.1%). The modified CLSI ESBL confirmatory test detected 158 of 162 ESBL producers (sensitivity, 97.5%) and showed no false-positive results for non-ESBL producers (specificity, 100%). The findings of the study demonstrate that the modified CLSI ESBL confirmatory test using antibiotic disks containing both BA and EDTA accurately detects ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae regardless of the coexistence of additional β-lactam resistance mechanisms.

### Evaluation of updated interpretative criteria for categorizing Klebsiella pneumoniae with reduced carbapenem susceptibility [^114Xkpwe]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

We studied the accuracy of various susceptibility testing methods, including the 2009, 2010, and updated 2010 CLSI recommendations, to identify Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems associated with different mechanisms of resistance. Forty-three wild-type (WT) strains, 42 extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers, 18 ESBL producers with outer membrane porin protein loss (ESBL/Omp strains), and 42 blaKPC-possessing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) isolates were evaluated. Imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEM), ertapenem (ERT), and doripenem (DOR) were tested by broth microdilution (BMD), Etest, and disk diffusion (DD), and the modified Hodge test (MHT) was performed using IPM and MEM disks. Results were interpreted according to original as well as recently updated interpretative criteria. MHT was positive for all 42 KPC-Kp isolates and 10 of 18 ESBL/Omp strains and therefore had poor specificity in differentiating between KPC-Kp and ESBL/Omp isolates. Based on the updated CLSI standards, phenotypic susceptibility testing by BMD and DD differentiated most carbapenem-susceptible from carbapenem-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae isolates without the need for MHT, while the Etest method characterized many KPC-Kp isolates as susceptible, and breakpoints may need to be lowered for this method. However, both the original and updated CLSI criteria do not adequately differentiate between isolates in the KPC-Kp group, which are unlikely to respond to carbapenem therapy, and those in the ESBL/Omp group, which are likely to respond to carbapenem therapy if MICs are within pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets. Further studies are required to determine if there is a clinical need to differentiate between KPC-Kp and ESBL/Omp groups.

### Multicenter evaluation of the BD Phoenix CPO detect test for detection and classification of carbapenemase-producing organisms in clinical isolates [^114XsyAb]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative bacteria can be mediated by at least two mechanisms. One involves expression of cephalosporinases (such as AmpC β-lactamase) or extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), with a simultaneous accumulation of mutations in genes that code for outer membrane porins, which decrease cell wall permeability to carbapenem antibiotics or increased efflux pump activity. Alternatively, Gram-negative bacteria (including Enterobacterales, and) can produce carbapenemase enzymes which hydrolyze carbapenems. These organisms are often referred to as carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs). Carbapenemases are members of the Ambler molecular class A, B, and D β-lactamase enzymes.

Current recommendations from both the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) state that carbapenemase testing may be important for epidemiology and infection control purposes to inform containment strategies (e.g. in hospitals or during outbreaks). Carbapenem susceptibility test results of a MIC or disk diffusion method should guide antimicrobial selection for treatment purposes. While both phenotypic and genotypic tests are utilized to determine the presence of CPOs, each has advantages and limitations. Genotypic tests (e.g. nucleic acid amplification tests) can detect the presence of different genes and have a relatively fast turnaround time; however, they are costly and are generally targeted toward genes coding for the most common carbapenemases. Phenotypic assays, which often require more hands-on time, have the advantage of being able to detect previously unidentified carbapenemases, although they may fail to detect some CPOs that express carbapenemase enzymes at low levels.

### What's new in antibiograms? Updating CLSI M39 guidance with current trends [^115KgX1z]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

A vast amount of antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) data is generated from routine testing in diagnostic laboratories for the primary purpose of guiding clinicians in antimicrobial therapy decisions for their patients. However, there is additional value for these data when they are compiled at the local, regional, national, and global levels. Cumulative AST data can be used to prepare antibiograms at the individual health care facility level. These reports can be used to gain insight into appropriate empirical therapy options prior to the availability of AST results on an individual patient's isolate. Different types of cumulative AST data reports can also be compiled at the regional, national, and global levels to estimate susceptibility rates in geographic regions, document trends in evolving microbial populations, and recognize the appearance and spread of emerging antimicrobial resistance threats. The first CLSI M39 Guideline for Analysis and Presentation of Cumulative AST Data was published in 2000. Since that time, there have been changes to AST and reporting recommendations as well as the introduction of advanced informatics technologies to analyze and present data. The 5th edition of M39 has taken into consideration these changes to assist those who analyze, present, and utilize routine antibiograms and other types of cumulative AST data reports as well as those who design information systems for the capturing and analyzing of AST data. Furthermore, antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have expanded considerably, and uses of the antibiogram by ASPs have been addressed. This minireview will remind users of the basic recommendations for analysis and presentation of antibiograms and provide new suggestions to enhance these reports.

### Detection of ESBL-producingcomplex with VITEK 2 system and screening cutoffs for implementing confirmatory tests [^114JW2tg]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In this context, the EUCAST and the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommend ESBL screening cutoffs for CRO, CTX, CAZ, and cefpodoxime (CPD) that are identical for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and other Enterobacterales; the CLSI also indicates the use of ATM. However, these approaches could not offer the best screening performance for specific species such as those belonging to the Ko C. For instance, by using the EUCAST criteria, Platteel et al. showed that the positive predictive value of the ESBL screening (i.e. CTX and/or CAZ MICs > 1 µg/mL) was 95% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 76% for E. coli, but only 27% for K. oxytoca (Ko).

Phenotypic detection of ESBL- Ko C strains can also be achieved using more rapid commercial automated AST systems. In particular, the VITEK 2 platform (bioMérieux) offers the option to use the Advanced Expert System (AES) software (bioMérieux) to interpret the results of AST cards and add comments about the possible mechanism(s) of antibiotic resistance. The analytic capacity of the AES is based on a large database that contains > 3,500 phenotypes and > 30,000 MIC distributions. However, no specific study focusing on the ability of the VITEK 2/AES to detect ESBL- Ko C strains has been performed so far. Until now, information on this matter can be retrieved only from several older studies that tested mixed collections of Enterobacterales in which the number of Ko strains was small and their molecular characterization rather limited.

Here, a well-characterized collection of 44 Ko C strains was used to test the ability of the VITEK 2 with and without using the AES to detect a subgroup of isolates producing ESBLs. We also analyzed the CRO, CPD, CAZ, CTX, and ATM phenotypic results and proposed specific Ko C screening cutoffs (MIC and disk inhibition zone diameters) that provided high sensitivity, but also reduced the number of unnecessary ESBL-CTs.

### Multi-centre evaluation of a phenotypic extended spectrum β-lactamase detection guideline in the routine setting [^113XiFPj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the routine setting performance of a guideline for phenotypic detection of extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) in Enterobacteriaceae, recommending ESBL confirmation with Etest or combination disc for isolates with a positive ESBL screen test (i.e. cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime MIC > 1 mg/L or an automated system ESBL warning). Twenty laboratories submitted 443 Enterobacteriaceae with a positive ESBL screen test and their confirmation test result (74%Escherichia coli, 12%Enterobacter cloacae, 8%Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3%Proteus mirabilis, 2%Klebsiella oxytoca). Presence of ESBL genes was used as reference test. Accuracy of local phenotypic ESBL detection was 88%. The positive predictive value (PPV) of local screen tests was 70%, and differed per method (Vitek-2: 69%, Phoenix: 68%, disc diffusion: 92%), and species (95%K. pneumoniae-27%K. oxytoca). A low PPV (3%) was observed for isolates with automated system alarm but third-generation cephalosporin MICs < 2 mg/L. Local ESBL confirmation had a PPV and negative predictive value (NPV) of 93% and 90%, respectively. Compared with centrally performed confirmation tests, 7% of local tests were misinterpreted. Combination disc was more specific than Etest (91% versus 61%). Confirmation tests were not reliable for P. mirabilis and K. oxytoca (PPV 33% and 38%, respectively, although NPVs were 100%). In conclusion, performance of Etests could be enhanced by education of technicians to improve their interpretation, by genotypic ESBL confirmation of P. mirabilis and K. oxytoca isolates with positive phenotypic ESBL confirmation, and by interpreting isolates with a positive ESBL alarm but an MIC < 2 mg/L for cefotaxime and ceftazidime as ESBL-negative.

### Major updates to FDA-recognized clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoints are a win for the fight against antimicrobial resistance [^1127XTBC]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

These challenges are complex. Clinical laboratorians should advocate for their patients, ensuring clinicians and policy makers are aware of the challenges of AMR and AST in the United States. Ongoing close collaboration between the FDA and CLSI is important, although governmental funding cuts may limit the FDA staff's availability for this work. AMR is a healthcare crisis, and all parties must work with an eye to collaboration and compromise to ensure patients can be cared for optimally and safely in the United States and globally.

### Impact of CLSI and EUCAST breakpoint discrepancies on reporting of antimicrobial susceptibility and AMR surveillance [^111GNvQW]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Our results are supported by a literature search (see Fig. S1, Table S1) which identified 20 articles whose main objective was comparing susceptibility interpretation between CLSI and EUCAST. Nineteen out of 20 articles reported significant discrepancies in one or more pathogen–antimicrobial combination, nearly always due to a reduction in susceptibility rates and/or increase in resistance rates when applying more restrictive EUCAST breakpoints. A notable exception was a study from Indiathat reported higher meropenem and imipenem susceptibility rates in urinary E. coli isolates using EUCAST breakpoints, underlining the lack of alignment between the two systems even for such important combinations. A trend of reduced susceptibility and/or higher resistance rates with EUCAST breakpoints was evident in the additional 53 articles where both EUCAST and CLSI breakpoints were used for susceptibility interpretation, many of which were reports of AMR surveillance data.

In conclusion, discrepancies in clinical breakpoints between CLSI and EUCAST significantly impact susceptibility interpretation of clinical isolates, with generally lower susceptibility rates when EUCAST guidelines are used. This has implications not only for antibiograms at institutions switching between the two AST systems, but for broader AMR surveillance initiatives comparing data within and between countries using different systems or over the time period during which a change in methodology is implemented. Globally harmonized clinical breakpoints are urgently needed.

### Evaluation of phenotypic tests to detect extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella oxytoca complex strains [^11525qQx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions.

Standard antimicrobial susceptibility profiles for Ko C strains can raise some suspicion of ESBL production. However, a clear distinction between ESBL- Ko C and hOXY- Ko C strains is difficult. With our strain collection, such distinction was achieved only by implementing the FEP/FEP-CL CDT or the DDST-30, whereas all gradient strip- and BMD-based confirmatory tests (regardless of the specific cephalosporin used) did not perform well. It is important to note that the FEP/FEP-CL CDT is not suggested by the CLSI, while the EUCAST indicates it only to detect the ESBL production among the group 2(species expressing chromosomal AmpC genes). Moreover, the DDST with CAZ, FEP and ATM disks is proposed by the EUCAST, but clear indications about the distance with the AMC disk and the concentration of antibiotics is not yet provided.

The CDT with CAZ/CAZ-CL disks may also be implemented as confirmatory tests, but production of OXY variants with potent activity against CAZ (e.g. OXY-2–5) can affect its specificity. In this context, it is worth underlining that the true prevalence of these CAZ-resistant hOXY- Ko C strains that may generate phenotypic results identical to those of the CTX-M producers is not known.

In conclusion, the approach to detect contemporary ESBL- Ko C strains should not consist on the use of standard gradient strip- or BMD-based confirmatory tests. In contrast, we suggest the simultaneous implementation of FEP/FEP-CL and CAZ/CAZ-CL CDTs or, alternatively, the DDST-30 including at least CAZ, FEP and ATM disks. The use of CAZ (10 μg) and CAZ-CL (10/10 μg) EUCAST-recommended disks seems to perform better than those suggested by the CLSI (30 μg and 30/10 μg, respectively). However, further specific and comparative studies should address this aspect.

### Overview of changes in the clinical and laboratory standards institute performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing: M100 32nd and 33rd editions [^116g1wqo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aminoglycoside P. aeruginosa breakpoints differ among breakpoint setting organizations. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), CLSI, and EUCAST each have different P. aeruginosa breakpoints for amikacin and tobramycin. Gentamicin P. aeruginosa breakpoints still exist for FDA and USCAST, while they do not for CLSI and EUCAST. The various breakpoints, or the lack thereof, are indicative of difficulties in setting breakpoints for aminoglycosides. Laboratories should discuss these issues with their clinical providers, infectious diseases pharmacists, and other healthcare providers, review applicable treatment guidelines released by professional organizations, and together determine approaches to testing and reporting of aminoglycosides for P. aeruginosa.

Plazomicin received FDA approval in 2018 for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections in adults. It was developed to treat infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. Its structure protects it from degradation by most aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. Plazomicin has little added activity compared to other aminoglycosides against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. and thus, there are no breakpoints for those organisms. MIC and disk diffusion breakpoints for plazomicin and Enterobacterales (excluding the Morganellaceae family, which includes Proteus, Providencia, and Morganella spp.) were published in the M100 33rd edition. Isolates of the Morganellaceae family display elevated MICs against plazomicin, which extend beyond the wild type.

### Piperacillin / tazobactam susceptibility test interpretive criteria for enterobacterales: recommendations from the United States committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing [^115GceKr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

(See the Editorial Commentary by Humphries on pages 1363–5.)

Piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) is recommended as a first-line treatment for Enterobacterales infections. Despite its wide-scale use, there has been considerable debate on its role for infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC-producing Enterobacterales. Data indicate that 15%–20% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. in the United States are third-generation cephalosporin-nonsusceptible (3GC-NS), a phenotypic marker of ESBL expression, and that a majority of these isolates harbor CTX-M enzymes. Although tazobactam is a potent inhibitor of most CTX-M enzymes, TZP has variable in vitro activity against ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. The reduced TZP susceptibility against ESBL-producing Enterobacterales is multifactorial but driven in large part by the copresence of other β-lactamases. Concerns have also been raised regarding the use of TZP for Enterobacterales (eg, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Klebsiella aerogenes) that have a moderate to high likelihood of clinically significant AmpC production, given that tazobactam does not efficiently inhibit these enzymes.

The in vitro susceptibility testing interpretive criteria (STIC) for TZP against Enterobacterales were recently updated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) (Tables 1 and 2). The United States Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (USCAST) also recently convened to review TZP STIC for Enterobacterales. While USCAST appreciates the expertise of these organizations, USCAST arrived at different TZP STIC for Enterobacterales. Here, we explain our recommendations (Table 1), the rationale behind them, and the future research that is needed to further inform these STIC. Of note, USCAST did not discuss the optimal method for incorporating their proposed TZP STIC across clinical microbiologic laboratories in their deliberations. USCAST recognizes that many laboratories use obsolete breakpoints for a variety of reasons and recommends that clinicians work with their microbiologic departments to ensure the most clinically appropriate STIC are used for interpreting TZP susceptibility results.

### Detection of ESBL-producingcomplex with VITEK 2 system and screening cutoffs for implementing confirmatory tests [^114FSpAe]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Screening cutoffs to perform ESBL-CTs

In order to limit the use of superfluous ESBL-CTs for Ko C isolates in routine clinical laboratories, we analyzed the MICs obtained in BMD or with VITEK 2 for CRO, CPD, CAZ, CTX, and ATM against our 44 strains. Furthermore, the same antibiotics were also tested by disk diffusion according to the EUCAST and CLSI criteria (Tables 1 and 2). Results of each method and drug were stratified in cutoffs and depicted in Table 3.

TABLE 3
Exploring ceftriaxone, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam cutoffs to limit the use of unnecessary ESBL-CTs for Ko C strains a

Based on our data, we proposed alternative screening cutoffs to perform the ESBL-CTs for Ko C strains (Table 4). To do so, we also considered previous investigations from which data about MICs or inhibition zone diameters for Ko C strains was available (File S1). Notably, we defined the possible Ko C cutoffs based on the following aspects. First, the screening cutoffs were selected to guarantee 100% Se and a higher Sp/PPV. Second, conservative cutoffs for the disk diffusion method were designated to avoid possible subjective reading variances (e.g. ± 1 mm). Third, we considered the differences between the BMD and VITEK 2 methods (i.e. in terms of results obtained and MIC ranges tested (File S2) to propose homogeneous cutoffs for each cephalosporin and ATM.

### An improved extended-spectrum-β-lactamase detection test utilizing aztreonam plus clavulanate [^112p74LK]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical laboratories test for extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) for epidemiological and infection control purposes and also for the potential of cephalosporins to cause therapeutic failures. Testing can be problematic, because the CLSI does not recommend the testing of all producers of ESBLs and also falsely negative results may occur with isolates that coproduce AmpC. Boronic acid-supplemented tests can enhance ESBL detection in AmpC producers. Because aztreonam inhibits AmpCs, a study was designed to compare ESBL detection by the CLSI disk test (CLSI), a boronic acid-supplemented CLSI disk test (CLSI plus BA), and an aztreonam plus clavulanate disk test (ATM plus CA). The study tested 100 well-characterized Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Seventy produced TEM, SHV, or CTX-M ESBLs, with 15 coproducing an AmpC and 11 coproducing a metallo-β-lactamase. Thirty ESBL-negative isolates were also tested. Tests were inoculated by CLSI methodology and interpreted as positive if an inhibitor caused a zone diameter increase of ≥ 5 mm. The percentages of ESBL producers detected were as follows: ATM plus CA, 95.7%; CLSI plus BA, 88.6%; and CLSI, 78.6%. When AmpC was coproduced, the sensitivities of the tests were as follows: ATM plus CA, 100%; CLSI plus BA, 93.3%; and CLSI, 60%. ATM plus CA also detected an ESBL in 90.1% of isolates that coproduced a metallo-β-lactamase. Falsely positive tests occurred only with the CLSI and CLSI plus BA tests. Overall, the ATM plus CA test detected ESBLs more accurately than the CLSI and CLSI plus BA tests, especially with isolates coproducing an AmpC or metallo-β-lactamase.

### Current trends in culture-based and molecular detection of extended-spectrum-β-lactamase-harboring and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae [^113Q4gE5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

The ever-expanding role of extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL)-harboring and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in causing serious infections poses a grave public health threat because these organisms also tend to be multidrug resistant, for which very few (if any) antibiotic options remain available. Rapid detection of such panresistant organisms offers one of the best solutions to improve patient screening and hospital infection control practices as well as curb inappropriate antibiotic use. This review discusses and compares primarily the current state-of-the-art culture-based and molecular methods that are commercially available for detection or screening of ESBL-harboring and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.

### Changing bacteriology of abdominal and surgical sepsis [^113RLt5m]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on recent changes in epidemiological aspects of bacteria-induced intra-abdominal infections (IAIs), including the dominant pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, and emerging resistance phenotypes.

Recent Findings

Enterobacteriaceae species, including Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, remain the major pathogens contributing to abdominal sepsis, although Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii have recently become common causes of hospital-acquired IAIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, especially those that produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), has increased worldwide, although the distribution of those organisms varies from region to region. Furthermore, recent changes in interpretive breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) have resulted in a marked increase in the reported rates of resistance among Gram-negative bacilli to carbapenems, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Besides, routine detection and reporting of ESBL phenotypes for clinical isolates have not been recommended after following new interpretive breakpoints. More studies are needed to investigate the impacts of these changes on therapeutic strategies and epidemiological surveillance. In addition, pathogens carrying New Delhi metallo-β-lactamases (NDMs), K. pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs), and other carbapenemases show extended resistance to currently available antibiotics and rapid transfer between species and countries. Although some of these pathogens are still susceptible to tigecycline and colistin, rates of resistance to these two agents are rising.

Summary

Abdominal sepsis due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, especially ESBL producers, and international and interspecies spreading of metallo-β-lactamase raise key therapeutic problems.

### Detection of ESBL-producingcomplex with VITEK 2 system and screening cutoffs for implementing confirmatory tests [^117DVayY]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Screening cutoffs using CTX

Although CTX is historically proposed by both EUCAST and CLSI to screen for suspicious ESBL producers, the two VITEK cards implemented in the present study do not test for this substrate. Using the BMD method, the common EUCAST/CLSI cutoff (> 1 µg/mL) for CTX assured 100% Se, but Sp and PPV were 73.3% and 47.8%, respectively. On the other hand, increasing the cutoff to > 4 µg/mL could offer 100% Se, 94.3% Sp, and 84.6% PPV (~23% of unnecessary ESBL-CTs saved) for our collection of Ko C strains (Table 3). Of note, the great majority of the hOXY- and WT- Ko C strains described in previous studies demonstrated CTX MICs of ≤ 2 µg/mL (File S2). Therefore, we believe that a MIC of CTX > 4 µg/mL represents an ideal cutoff that can be implemented to screen for suspicious ESBL- Ko C strains (Table 4).

When tested against our strains collection, the EUCAST CTX disk (5 µg) screening cutoff set at ≤ 20 mm resulted in 100% Se, but only 62.3% Sp and 35.5% PPV. On the other hand, a cutoff of ≤ 12 mm could offer 100% Se, 89.2% Sp, and 73.3% PPV. This lower cutoff could also decrease the number of ESBL-CTs to ~35% (Table 3). Concerning the 30 µg CTX disk, the CLSI recommends a ≤ 27 mm cutoff that performed relatively well with our tested strains (100% Se, 78.6% Sp, and 55% PPV). However, a ≤ 22 mm cutoff not only could assure 100% Se, but also excellent Sp and PPV (94.3% and 84.6%, respectively) (Table 3). In this context, Fujita et al. reported inhibition diameters of 15 and 18 mm for the two CTX-M producers, while > 22 mm for 67% of the non-ESBL-positive strains (File S2). Overall, when testing Ko C strains, we propose ESBL screening cutoffs of ≤ 12 and ≤ 22 mm for the EUCAST and CLSI CTX disks, respectively (Table 4).

### Overview of the epidemiological profile and laboratory detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamases [^115Rd2gz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are plasmid-mediated bacterial enzymes that confer resistance to a broad range of beta-lactams. They are descended by genetic mutation from native beta-lactamases found in gram-negative bacteria, especially infectious strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. Genetic sequence modifications have broadened the substrate specificity of the enzymes to include third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftazidime. Because ESBL-producing strains are resistant to a wide variety of commonly used antimicrobials, their proliferation poses a serious global health concern that has complicated treatment strategies for a growing number of hospitalized patients. Another resistance mechanism, also common to Enterobacteriaceae, results from the overproduction of chromosomal or plasmid-derived AmpC beta-lactamases. These organisms share an antimicrobial resistance pattern similar to that of ESBL-producing organisms, with the prominent exception that, unlike most ESBLs, AmpC enzymes are not inhibited by clavulanate and similar beta-lactamase inhibitors. Recent technological improvements in testing and in the development of uniform standards for both ESBL detection and confirmatory testing promise to make accurate identification of ESBL-producing organisms more accessible to clinical laboratories.

### Innovative approaches in phenotypic β-lactamase detection for personalised infection management [^116o568a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae present a significant therapeutic challenge. Current developments in phenotypic diagnostics focus primarily on rapid minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. There is a requirement for rapid phenotypic diagnostics to improve antimicrobial susceptibility tests (AST) and aid prescribing decisions. Phenotypic AST are limited in their ability to characterise beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in detail. Despite advances in rapid AST, gaps and opportunities remain for developing additional diagnostic approaches that facilitate personalised antimicrobial prescribing. In this perspective, we highlight the state-of-the-art in beta-lactamase detection, identify gaps in current practice, and discuss barriers for innovation within this field.

### Susceptibility of extended-spectrum-β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae according to the new CLSI breakpoints [^113PM8Ex]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

In 2010 the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) lowered the susceptibility breakpoints of some cephalosporins and aztreonam for Enterobacteriaceae and eliminated the need to perform screening for extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and confirmatory tests. The aim of this study was to determine how many ESBL-producing strains of three common species of Enterobacteriaceae test susceptible using the new breakpoints. As determined with the CLSI screening and confirmatory tests, 382 consecutive ESBL-producing strains were collected at Huashan Hospital between 2007 and 2008, including 158 strains of Escherichia coli, 164 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 60 of Proteus mirabilis. Susceptibility was determined by the CLSI agar dilution method. CTX-M-, TEM-, and SHV-specific genes were determined by PCR amplification and sequencing. bla(CTX-M) genes alone or in combination with bla(SHV) were present in 92.7% (354/382) of these ESBL-producing strains. Forty-two (25.6%) strains of K. pneumoniae harbored SHV-type ESBLs alone or in combination. No TEM ESBLs were found. Utilizing the new breakpoints, all 382 strains were resistant to cefazolin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, while 85.0 to 96.7% of P. mirabilis strains tested susceptible to ceftazidime, cefepime, and aztreonam, 41.8 to 45.6% of E. coli strains appeared to be susceptible to ceftazidime and cefepime, and 20.1% of K. pneumoniae were susceptible to cefepime. In conclusion, all ESBL-producing strains of Enterobacteriaceae would be reported to be resistant to cefazolin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone by using the new CLSI breakpoints, but a substantial number of ESBL-containing P. mirabilis and E. coli strains would be reported to be susceptible to ceftazidime, cefepime, and aztreonam, which is likely due to the high prevalence of CTX-M type ESBLs.

### Detection of ESBL-producingcomplex with VITEK 2 system and screening cutoffs for implementing confirmatory tests [^112pQfoG]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Screening cutoffs using CPD

The MIC screening cutoffs for CPD set by EUCAST and CLSI differ substantially (> 1 and > 4 µg/mL, respectively). By implementing the BMD method with our collection of 44 Ko C strains, both limits assured 100% Se, but low Sp (~64%–72%) and PPV (~37%–46%). On the other hand, a cutoff of > 16 µg/mL could offer 100% Se, 91.7% Sp, and 78.6% PPV (Table 3). Of note, previous surveys involving ESBL- and hOXY- Ko C strains have shown CPD MICs of ≥ 8 µg/mL (range: 8 to > 64 µg/mL) and ≤ 4 µg/mL (range: 1 to 4 µg/mL), respectively (File S2).

Nevertheless, since the highest concentration tested by the VITEK AST-N242 card is 8 µg/mL, we suggest an ESBL screening cutoff for CPD of > 4 µg/mL for Ko C strains (Table 3). This cutoff is identical to that currently set by CLSI, but it may save an additional ~14%–27% of the confirmatory tests for Ko C strains if also applied by EUCAST (Table 4).

EUCAST and CLSI indicate CPD screening cutoffs for the 10 µg disk of ≤ 20 mm and ≤ 17 mm, respectively. Our analysis showed that these cutoffs generated 100% Se, but low Sp (~64%–66%) and PPV (~37%–39%). In contrast, a limit of ≤ 8 mm could have assured 100% Se, 94.3% Sp, and 84.6% PPV (Table 3). In this context, Fujita et al. noted that the CPD inhibition diameters for the two CTX-M producers were ≤ 8 mm, while those for non-ESBL-positive strains were ≥ 12 mm in 92% of the cases (File S2). As a result, we propose that a CPD screening cutoff of ≤ 10 mm may be appropriate when testing Ko C strains. This lower limit may assure 100% Se, 91.7% Sp, 78.6% PPV, and a reduction of the ESBL-CTs of ~32%–36% when compared to the current EUCAST and CLSI screening criteria (Table 4).

### Innovative approaches in phenotypic β-lactamase detection for personalised infection management [^1131XRZW]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Studies demonstrate that poor or inaccurate ESBL detection methods can lead to treatment failure. With the lack of readily available genotypic methods, the focus should be on developing rapid phenotypic detection and quantification methods that could provide additional information to the clinician. For example, in current practice, most ESBL and AmpC infections are treated with carbapenems. Carbapenem-sparing options are being explored to prevent the emergence of CRE. In response to the challenge posed by CRE, novel beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-relebactam, have been developed. Given the diverse antimicrobial effect exhibited by these different combinations against various CRE strains, the ability to accurately detect carbapenemases is essential for tailoring effective treatment strategies. Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors could be a suitable alternative to carbapenems to treat less serious infections such as UTIs. For example, bacteria producing a low level of beta-lactamase enzyme may be able to be treated with beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors instead of a carbapenem. In addition, alternative agents such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin could potentially be used to treat these infections, but there is limited efficacy and safety data available.

Improving beta-lactamase detection methods may help mitigate the development and impact of AMR on human health. Current AST methods have limitations (Fig. 2), including static results (MIC) that overlook dynamic changes in pathogen susceptibility and challenges in detecting emerging or low-level resistance. Phenotypic detection methods like broth microdilution and disc diffusion assays are widely used for their simplicity and cost-effectiveness but often require extended incubation times and can be affected by the presence of multiple resistance mechanisms, leading to false positives or negatives. In contrast, genotypic methods such as PCR and WGS offer faster results and precise identification of resistance genes but are costly, require specialised equipment and expertise, and may not reflect gene expression and phenotype accurately. Emerging AST technologies may face regulatory challenges during implementation and integration with existing infrastructure. Choosing the appropriate method depends on the clinical context, resource availability, and the need for accurate and timely detection of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.

### Detection of ESBL-producingcomplex with VITEK 2 system and screening cutoffs for implementing confirmatory tests [^117CnXnS]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The VITEK 2 equipped with the AES performed poorly, whereas VITEK 2 alone followed by the CLSI ESBL screen and confirmatory tests yielded a reliable methodology to distinguish between ESBL- Ko C and hOXY- Ko C. In this context, we suggest the use of the CTX/CTX-CL and CAZ/CAZ-CL CDT ESBL-CTs, with no preferences between CLSI- or EUCAST-recommended and differently loaded disks as long as there are no specific studies for Ko C strains demonstrating any possible difference in their analytic performance.

Nevertheless, this overall strategy also presents two drawbacks: it increases the turnaround time for the final report and implies a high number of unnecessary ESBL-CTs, thus affecting the workload for the laboratory technicians and overall diagnostic costs. In order to solve the latter issue, this study also revised the screening cutoffs for CRO, CPD, CAZ, CTX, and ATM to negate unnecessary ESBL-CTs for Ko C strains. These cutoffs assured 100% Se and higher Sp/PPV compared to the current CLSI/EUCAST screening criteria when implemented with our Ko C collection. However, the proposed cutoffs were obtained from testing only 44 strains, which, although well-defined, may lack the statistical power to ensure optimal results. Therefore, our findings should be validated and verified using larger and well-characterized KoC collections producing a broader range of ESBL and OXY β-lactamases.

IDSA 2023 ESBL-E uncomplicated cystitis — aminoglycoside and fosfomycin considerations are as follows: Treatment with a single IV dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative treatment option for uncomplicated ESBL-E cystitis, and a single IV dose is generally effective for uncomplicated cystitis, with minimal toxicity, but robust clinical trial data are lacking. Susceptibility of E. coli to fosfomycin is not routinely tested by most clinical microbiology laboratories but E. coli resistance to fosfomycin remains rare in the United States, and among gram-negative species, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints are only available for E. coli for fosfomycin. Fosfomycin is not suggested for the treatment of infections caused by K. pneumoniae and several other gram-negative organisms, which frequently carry fosA hydrolase genes that may lead to clinical failure. A randomized open-label trial indicated that a single dose of oral fosfomycin is associated with higher clinical failure than a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin for uncomplicated cystitis, and although this trial was not limited to E. coli cystitis, in a subgroup analysis exclusively of E. coli infections, outcomes remained poor in the fosfomycin group.

Beta-lactamase enzyme detection methods

Accurate and timely identification of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is crucial to support appropriate antimicrobial management, prevent onward transmission, and support public health surveillance. Various methods are used to detect beta-lactamase enzymes in clinical laboratories and can be broadly grouped into phenotypic or genotypic methods (Table 2). Phenotypic methods include double disc, gradient strip, and broth dilution testing. These methods are relatively simple, cost-effective, and can detect a broad range of resistance mechanisms. However, they may be time-consuming and less specific, sometimes failing to distinguish between different beta-lactamases.

Table 2
Overview of ESBL detection methods

Genotypic methods include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Despite their accuracy and speed, genotypic methods are more expensive and may miss novel or uncommon resistance mechanisms not included in the assay design. Genotypic methods do not provide information on the amount of beta-lactamase enzyme being produced and its potential impact on antimicrobial susceptibility.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases: implications for the clinical microbiology laboratory, therapy, and infection control [^111zatby]. The Journal of Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing gram-negative bacilli are a growing concern in human medicine today. When producing these enzymes, organisms (mostly K. pneumoniae and E. coli) become highly efficient at inactivating the newer third-generation cephaloporins (such as cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). In addition, ESBL-producing bacteria are frequently resistant to many classes of non-beta-lactam antibiotics, resulting in difficult-to-treat infections. This review gives an introduction into the topic and is focused on various aspects of ESBLs; it covers the current epidemiology, the problems of ESBL detection and the clinical relevance of infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms. Therapeutic options and potential strategies for dealing with this growing problem are also discussed in this article.

This part of the study also highlighted two important aspects. First, a screening CRO and/or CAZ MIC cutoff of > 1 µg/mL (EUCAST/CLSI criteria) implied a high number of unnecessary ESBL-CTs for Ko C strains (n = 22), which mainly belonged to the hOXY group (n = 21) (Table 2).

Second, the CLSI-recommended CDT with CAZ/CAZ-CL (30/30–10 µg disks) had an inferior performance when compared to the corresponding EUCAST assay (10/10–10 µg disks) testing the same 33 Ko C strains (i.e. 64.7% Se and 95.7% Sp vs. 100% Se and 95.7% Sp, respectively) (Tables 1 and 2). On this matter, studies that compared the EUCAST- and CLSI-recommended CDTs to distinguish between ESBL- Ko C and hOXY- Ko C had not been previously performed. Nevertheless, testing Enterobacterales (n = 236 of which 17 were Ko), Polsfuss et al. also showed that the disk approximation method with the EUCAST 10 µg CAZ disk detected slightly more ESBL producers than when using the CLSI CAZ 30 µg disk (i.e. 86.4% Se and 98.3% Sp vs. 84.7% Se and 98.3% Sp, respectively).

### Prevalence of newer β-lactamases in gram-negative clinical isolates collected in the United States from 2001 to 2002 [^1178K46J]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Newer beta-lactamases such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), transferable AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases are associated with laboratory testing problems of false susceptibility that can lead to inappropriate therapy for infected patients. Because there appears to be a lack of awareness of these enzymes, a study was conducted during 2001 to 2002 in which 6,421 consecutive, nonduplicate clinical isolates of aerobically growing gram-negative bacilli from patients at 42 intensive care unit (ICU) and 21 non-ICU sites across the United States were tested on-site for antibiotic susceptibility. From these isolates, 746 screen-positive isolates (11.6%) were referred to a research facility and investigated to determine the prevalence of ESBLs in all gram-negative isolates, transferable AmpC beta-lactamases in Klebsiella pneumoniae, and carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae. The investigations involved phenotypic tests, isoelectric focusing, beta-lactamase inhibitor studies, spectrophotometric assays, induction assays, and molecular analyses. ESBLs were detected only in Enterobacteriaceae (4.9% of all Enterobacteriaceae) and were found in species other than those currently recommended for ESBL testing by the CLSI (formerly NCCLS). These isolates occurred at 74% of the ICU sites and 43% of the non-ICU sites. Transferable AmpC beta-lactamases were detected in 3.3% of K. pneumoniae isolates and at 16 of the 63 sites (25%) with no difference between ICU and non-ICU sites. Three sites submitted isolates that produced class A carbapenemases. No class B or D carbapenemases were detected. In conclusion, organisms producing ESBLs and transferable AmpC beta-lactamases were widespread. Clinical laboratories must be able to detect important beta-lactamases to ensure optimal patient care and infection control.

### Detection of ESBL-producingcomplex with VITEK 2 system and screening cutoffs for implementing confirmatory tests [^1161rqVt]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Screening cutoffs using CRO

As shown in Table 3, implementation of the common CRO EUCAST/CLSI cutoff (MIC > 1 µg/mL) with the BMD method assured 100% Se, but only 61.1% Sp and 34.4% PPV when tested against our 44 Ko C strains. In contrast, a cutoff of > 8 µg/mL could retain 100% Se, but increasing Sp and PPV to 78.6% and 55%, respectively. We also noted that other authors reported CRO MICs for the CTX-M-producing Ko C strains of ≥ 8 µg/mL, whereas those of the non-ESBL-positive strains were in great part < 4 µg/mL (File S2). Finally, a cutoff of > 8 µg/mL for the screening of Enterobacteriaceae was also suggested by Huang et al.

Nevertheless, a CRO cutoff of > 8 µg/mL was appropriate only for the VITEK AST-N390 card, whereas for the AST-N242 card, the best cutoff was > 4 µg/mL (Table 3). Therefore, we propose that the CRO MIC ESBL screening cutoff for Ko C strains should be set at > 4 µg/mL. According to our data, this conservative cutoff may assure 100% Se, ~62%–69% Sp, and less performed ESBL-CTs (~7%–11%) when compared to the current EUCAST/CLSI criteria (Table 4).

Concerning the disk diffusion method, EUCAST and CLSI suggest CRO screening cutoffs for the 30 µg disk of ≤ 22 mm and ≤ 25 mm, respectively. For our collection, these cutoffs demonstrated 100% Se, but low Sp (~59%–61%) and PPV (33%). In contrast, a cutoff of ≤ 15 mm could have guaranteed 100% Se, 78.6% Sp, and 55% PPV (Table 3).

Unfortunately, data regarding Ko C strains and disk diffusion susceptibility such as that of CRO is lacking. Only Fujita et al. reported that two strains producing CTX-Ms had CRO inhibition diameters of 10 and 12 mm (File S2). Consequently, we advise a cautionary cutoff of ≤ 16 mm that may guarantee 100% Se, 73.3% Sp, and 47.8% PPV for Ko C strains (also saving ~25% of the superfluous ESBL-CTs) (Table 4).

### Rapid and visual identification of β-lactamase subtypes for precision antibiotic therapy [^115L3L1S]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The detection accuracy of the sensor results was validated by the Kirby-Bauer paper dispersion method (K-B method) for AST and RT-PCR verification recommended by the 2021 version of the CLSI Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. The results of the K-B method show that cephalothin tablets, cephalothin/clavulanic acid tablets, cefoxitin tablets, and meropenem tablets, which have been treated with the patient body fluids, exhibit varying degrees of inhibitory effects on E. coli. According to the 2021 edition of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, an inhibition zone diameter of the cephalothin disk less than 22 mm is indicative of a positive result for BSBL, while that of the cefotaxime/clavulanic acid disk larger than the cephalothin group for 5 mm indicates a positive result for ESBL. Further, the positive results for AmpC and carbapenemase in the samples are respectively indicated by cefoxitin and meropenem disk inhibition zone diameters of less than 18 mm and 19 mm. A total of 4 samples were found to be positive for BSBL, 20 for ESBL, 10 for AmpC, 34 for carbapenemase, and 32 samples were negative for β -lactamase, consistent fully with the results obtained by the BSV sensor (Supplementary Fig. 42 and Supplementary Table 5). Additionally, 96% of the RT-PCR results were in accordance with the BSV sensor results. Due to the fact that the primer sequences for TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1 are included in both TEM and SHV, the 4 BSBL-positive samples (labeled patients NO.18, NO.36, NO.42, and NO.56 with red) might also be mistakenly detected as ESBL-positive (Fig. 5D).

ESBL-PE isolation and confirmation

Standard culture methods in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines were applied for detection of ESB-PE in the clinical samples. Chromogenic screening agar plates (chromID ESBL, bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France) were used for bacterial culture and isolation of ESBL-PE of the screening samples. For the blood samples, incubation of aerobic and anaerobic blood culture flasks was performed with the Bact/ALERT® 3D and VIRTUO® system (both from bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France) either with charcoal or raisins. In all cases species identification was done by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) or Vitek 2 TM System (bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France). The Vitek 2 TM System was also used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Testing for ESBL production in all isolates was based on the detection of resistance to cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime or aztreonam. Phenotypic confirmation of the ESBL test results was conducted by Etest® strips (bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) using cefotaxime, ceftazidime or cefepime, each tested with and without clavulanic acid, or with ROSCO disks (Rosco, Taastrup, Denmark). As our study was performed over a time period of ten years, the specific breakpoints applied changed over time. From 01/2008 to 05/11, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints were interpreted according to the guidelines of the CLSI, and from 06/11 to 12/2028 breakpoints were interpreted according to the respectively current version of the EUCAST guidelines, ranging from version 1.3 to 8.1. Isolates were confirmed as ESBL-producers when they displayed resistance to at least two of the three tested substances. Indeterminate results were further evaluated using the Eazyplex® SuperBug CRE panel (amplex, Gars Bahnhof, Germany) specific for the detection of ESBL genes of the CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-9 groups. If these genes (selected based on our local epidemiology) were not present, isolates were considered ESBL-negative.

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) bloodstream infection — carbapenem preference and extrapolation: In those with clinical isolates available for retesting, 30-day mortality occurred in 9% vs 4% in the piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem arms, respectively, and although the 95% confidence interval ranged from −1% to 11%, the panel still suggests carbapenem therapy as the preferred treatment of ESBL-producing bloodstream infections. Comparable clinical trial data are not available for ESBL-E infections from other body sites, but the panel suggests extrapolating evidence for ESBL-E bloodstream infections to other common sites of infection, and suggests extending the findings to imipenem-cilastatin and ertapenem, with the latter limited to patients with normal serum albumin and patients who are not critically ill.

### Can we use imipenem and meropenem vitek 2 MICs for detection of suspected KPC and other-carbapenemase producers among species of enterobacteriaceae? [^116JG2tq]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

Imipenem and meropenem Vitek 2 MICs were evaluated for a panel of 104 Enterobacteriaceae for identification of carbapenemase producers. The sensitivity and specificity values for the new CLSI interpretative criteria (CLSI document M100-S20-U, 2010) were 98% and 83% for imipenem and 76% and 83% for meropenem, respectively. We propose an algorithm that is highly sensitive (98%) and specific (94%) for carbapenemase screening based on the combined use of imipenem and meropenem MICs.

### Comparison of disk diffusion, etest and VITEK2 for detection of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae with the EUCAST and CLSI breakpoint systems [^113jC48c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare CLSI and EUCAST MIC and disk diffusion carbapenem breakpoints for the detection of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. K. pneumoniae strains with known KPC (n = 31) or VIM (n = 20) carbapenemases were characterized by disk diffusion (Oxoid) and Etest (bioMérieux) vs. imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem, and with VITEK2 (bioMérieux, five different cards). Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) testing was performed with VITEK2 (bioMérieux), ESBL combination disks (Becton Dickinson) and the ESBL Etest (bioMérieux). With CLSI and EUCAST MIC breakpoints, respectively, 11 and seven of the strains were susceptible to imipenem, 12 and eight to meropenem, and seven and none to ertapenem. The EUCAST epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF) values for meropenem and ertapenem identified all carbapenemase producers, whereas the imipenem ECOFF failed in five strains. All carbapenemase producers were detected with EUCAST disk diffusion breakpoints for ertapenem and meropenem, and four strains were susceptible to imipenem. CLSI disk diffusion breakpoints characterized 18 (imipenem), 14 (meropenem) and three (ertapenem) isolates as susceptible. When cards with a single carbapenem were used, detection failures with VITEK2 were four for imipenem, none for meropenem and one for ertapenem. Cards containing all three carbapenems had one to two failures. With ESBL combination disks, 21/31 KPC producers and 2/20 VIM producers were positive. With VITEK2, no VIM producers and between none and seven KPC producers were ESBL-positive. All carbapenemase producers were detected with the meropenem MIC ECOFF, or the clinical EUCAST breakpoint for ertapenem. EUCAST disk diffusion breakpoints for meropenem and ertapenem detected all carbapenemase producers. VITEK2 had between none and four failures in detecting carbapenemase producers, depending on the antibiotic card.

Bacterial Isolates and Phenotypic Detection of ESBLs

Nonduplicate K. pneumoniae clinical isolates were recovered from patient specimens during January 2005–July 2012 at the clinical microbiology laboratory of Westchester Medical Center. These included 208 bla KPC -negative non- K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (non-KPC) ESBL-producing or third-generation cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates and 228 KPC (bla KPC -positive)–producing K. pneumoniae isolates. In addition, 163 nonduplicate ESBL-producing E. coli clinical isolates from the same period were also analyzed for comparison. Isolates were randomly selected to span the entire study year with an approximately equal number of isolates per quarter; only 1 isolate from each patient was chosen and tested. The center is a 643-bed academic tertiary-care medical center in Westchester County, New York. The Institutional Review Board of New York Medical College approved this study.

The bacterial isolates were identified and evaluated for antimicrobial drug susceptibility with the MicroScan WalkAway 96 system (Siemens, Sacramento, CA, USA). ESBL production was phenotypically confirmed by a double-disk or broth microdilution method for suspected ESBL isolates according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The antimicrobial drug susceptibility of CTX-M–producing K. pneumoniae isolates against selected antimicrobial drugs was also assessed with standardized CLSI disk diffusion and Etest methods. Bacterial isolates were refrigerated on nutrient agar slants or were frozen (−80°C) in MicroBank cryovials containing 20% glycerol (Pro-Lab Diagnostics, Round Rock, TX, USA). For antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing of frozen isolates, fresh subcultures were used per CLSI guidelines.

### Detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamases by using boronic acid as an ampC β-lactamase inhibitor in clinical isolates of Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli [^115CSkpA]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

We evaluated highly sensitive methods using boronic acid (BA) to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production. A total of 182 clinical isolates of Klebsiella spp. (n = 118) and Escherichia coli (n = 64) were analyzed: 62 harbored only ESBLs, 80 harbored both ESBLs and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (pAmpCs), and 40 harbored only pAmpCs. The CLSI confirmatory test detected all isolates that produce only ESBLs but detected 85% of isolates that produce both enzymes. When a ≥ 5-mm increase in the zone diameter of either the cefotaxime (CTX) or the ceftazidime (CAZ) disk in the presence of both clavulanic acid (CA) and BA was considered to be a positive result, the test detected all isolates that harbor ESBLs (± pAmpCs) but showed frequent false-positive results (50%) for isolates that produce only pAmpCs. Meanwhile, when a ≥ 3-mm increase in the zone diameter of either the CTX/BA or the CAZ/BA disk in the presence of CA was considered to be a positive result, the test also detected all isolates that harbor ESBLs (± pAmpCs) and showed less frequent false-positive results (5%) in isolates that produce only pAmpCs. The latter new interpretive guideline has enhanced detection of ESBLs in clinical isolates of Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli and allowed detection of an ESBL even when potentially masked by a pAmpC.

### Evaluation of the vitek-2 extended-spectrum β-lactamase test against non-duplicate strains of enterobacteriaceae producing a broad diversity of well-characterised β-lactamases [^1144JWQ2]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

The Vitek-2 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) test was assessed using a collection of 94 ESBL-positive and 71 ESBL-negative non-duplicate isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. These isolates produced a wide diversity of well-characterised beta-lactamases, including 61 different ESBLs, two class A carbapenemases and various species-specific beta-lactamases. ESBL detection was performed using (i) the conventional synergy test as recommended by the Comité de l'Antibiogramme de la Société Française de Microbiologie, (ii) the CLSI phenotypic confirmatory test for ESBLs, and (iii) the Vitek-2 ESBL test. For Escherichia coli and klebsiellae, the sensitivity/specificity values were 97.3%/96.9% for the synergy test, 91.8%/100% for the CLSI phenotypic confirmatory test, and 91.8%/100% for the Vitek-2 ESBL test. For other organisms, the sensitivity/specificity values were 100%/97.4% for the synergy test, 90.5%/100% for the CLSI phenotypic confirmatory test, and 90.5%/100% for the Vitek-2 ESBL test. The Vitek-2 ESBL test seemed to be an efficient method for routine detection of ESBL-producing isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, including isolates producing AmpC-type enzymes.

### Prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases in isolates of the Enterobacter cloacae complex from German hospitals [^112TTXMU]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

In 2002, 119 isolates of the Enterobacter cloacae complex were collected randomly from 11 German laboratories nationwide. Antibiotic susceptibilities were tested by disk-diffusion tests according to CLSI guidelines, and MICs were determined using Etests. PCRs were performed to amplify all TEM and SHV, and most CTX-M and OXA beta-lactamase genes. PCR products were sequenced to identify the precise extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) types. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) and PM/PML Etests were used to confirm production of the respective ESBLs. According to susceptibility tests and CLSI criteria, 49 (40%) isolates were resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Seven (5.8%) isolates were positive in at least one of the PCR assays. Sequencing identified production of TEM-1 beta-lactamase genes by three (2.9%) isolates, and ESBL genes of the CTX-M and SHV beta-lactamase families by five (4.2%) isolates. IEF confirmed the production of beta-lactamases in the expected pI ranges of the respective ESBLs, and four of the five ESBL-producers were detected using the PM/PML Etest. All ESBL-producing isolates showed co-resistance to sulphonamides.

Clinical implications of beta-lactamase detection methods on clinical practice

Managing infections with beta-lactamase-producing organisms is challenging due to increased bacterial resistance resulting in higher mortality rates. It is common to find single isolates that express multiple beta-lactamase enzymes, further complicating treatment options.

Clinicians may benefit from identifying the specific beta-lactamase enzymes produced by an organism to inform treatment decisions. However, genotypic testing is uncommon in most laboratories and typically reserved for difficult cases or epidemiological surveillance. Instead, beta-lactamase production can be inferred from phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility data and existing detection methods. The inference of beta-lactamase type is not always reliable as the spectrum of activity of the different enzyme classes often overlaps. For example, MBLs demonstrate broad-spectrum beta-lactamase activity, including carbapenemase activity, but are susceptible to monobactams. Nonetheless, this characteristic is not often clinically useful, as most MBL producers also produce ESBL, which results in monobactam resistance.

Of all the methods described, no purely quantitative methods for beta-lactamase detection are available. Current beta-lactamase quantification methods are used to measure the level of beta-lactamase (ESBL, AmpC, carbapenemase) gene expression or the abundance of beta-lactamase genes in bacterial isolates. Methods to quantify beta-lactamase gene production in clinical isolates could provide valuable supplementary information about susceptibility to guide treatment decisions and could be useful to monitor antibiotic resistance. Gene quantity does not always correlate directly with gene expression and enzyme activity. For example, in the case of the M43 K. pneumoniae strain, although it harbours a SHV gene that would be detected genotypically, this gene is not phenotypically expressed. In clinical practice, many factors can influence antimicrobial susceptibility, including porin loss and increased efflux. Although beta-lactamase quantification should not replace established AST methods, it may provide additional information to help inform the clinician. For example, Enterobacter cloacae (E.cloacae) can have strong permeability defects as well as derepressed AmpC expression. Both mechanisms are responsible for reduced antimicrobial susceptibility, but routine AST cannot always clearly and rapidly differentiate these mechanisms. The quantification of beta-lactamase activity in response to different beta-lactam exposure alongside standard AST may provide greater phenotypic information to support clinical and laboratory decision-making.

### Evaluation of an accelerated protocol for detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures [^114nXPws]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

We evaluated a protocol for the accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in gram-negative bloodstream pathogens. Two hundred eighty-three blood culture bottles were subjected to direct ESBL testing by inoculating samples directly from blood culture bottles onto agar plates containing cefotaxime and ceftazidime disks, with and without clavulanate. Standard ESBL testing in accordance with the NCCLS guidelines after subculturing on agar plates was performed in parallel. Results of the direct ESBL testing were reported 2.3 days sooner and were comparable to those of the standard NCCLS method with sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 100, 98, 94, and 100%, respectively.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^111YfRgF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance — cefepime for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production states: "Cefepime is suggested for the treatment of infections caused by organisms at moderate risk of significant AmpC production (ie, E. cloacae complex, K. aerogenes, and C. freundii)". For isolates in the susceptible dose-dependent range, dosing is defined as "2 grams every 8 hours, infused over 3 hours" for "MICs 4–8 µg/mL". Although effective for AmpC-E, cefepime "remains suboptimal against infections caused by ESBL-E", illustrated by a Taiwan study where "89% of E. cloacae isolates with cefepime MICs of 4–8 µg/mL… were ESBL-producing", in which "all 10 patients… died within 30 days", whereas "none of the 6 patients… died within 30 days" when ESBL was absent. U.S. data show ESBL gene prevalence varies — among E. cloacae, "3% contained a blaCTX-M gene", and in older Pittsburgh data "15 of 45 (33%)… produced SHV-type ESBLs" with "no association" to cefepime MIC. In a Baltimore series, ESBL genes were found in "22% of K. aerogenes (4/18), 14% of E. cloacae (7/51), and in no C. freundii (0% [0/106])", and "none of the ESBL-producing isolates had cefepime MICs of 4–8 µg/mL". Overall, "Available data do not suggest there is a clear association between cefepime susceptible dose-dependent MICs (ie, MICs of 4–8 µg/mL) and ESBL production".

Fig. 1
Current workflow in clinical settings, highlighting ongoing advancements.

The figure illustrates the current diagnostic workflow for infection identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) in hospitalised patients. Upon patient admission, clinical evaluation and sample collection are initiated. The conventional diagnostic pathway includes initial microscopy and culture, colony selection and pathogen identification, subculture for purity, and AST taking 48–72 h for completion, including data analysis and final AST results. Advancements are being made in rapid diagnostics, including rapid multiplex PCR for pathogen identification and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene detection, which takes around 24 h. Rapid identification and AST using pre-incubated blood cultures (RAST) can provide results in about 30 h. In addition, rapid phenotypic AST, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) quantification, takes approximately 48 h. These integrated approaches aim to reduce diagnostic time and enable more timely and targeted treatment decisions, improving patient outcomes in clinical settings.

### Establishing clinical and laboratory standards institute M45 antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods and breakpoints forother than [^114514dk]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

POPA are intrinsically resistant to several beta-lactam agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotetan, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, and ertapenem) and may develop multidrug-resistant phenotypes that contribute to difficulty in effectively managing infections caused by these pathogens. As such, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is required to guide successful treatment of infections. Furthermore, the acquisition of carbapenemases, more specifically metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs), among these organisms indicates its role as a potential reservoir and contributor to further spread of carbapenem-resistance among gram-negative organisms if left undetected.

Currently, the CLSI non-Enterobacterales (nE) breakpoints (BPs) are used to interpret AST results for non-fastidious, glucose non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli without specific BPs, including POPA. There are numerous limitations to using the CLSI nE BPs, including the following: (i) these breakpoints have not been revised since their initial publication, (ii) only minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) BPs are available, and (iii) agents with BPs in the table may be inappropriate for treatment of POPA infections (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Furthermore, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recognize any CLSI nE BPs. Thus, most U.S. laboratories must rely on laboratory-developed tests when performing AST for POPA clinical management. Data supporting the use of commercial or automated AST systems for POPA are limited. Altogether, the limitations of available BPs and AST methodologies present significant uncertainty with regard to the clinical validity of AST results for POPA and raise patient safety concerns. In contrast to the CLSI, The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) has established BPs for Pseudomonas species, which can be applied to both P. aeruginosa and non- aeruginosa species, with the exception of novel beta-lactam combination agents and meropenem meningitis BPs that are limited to P. aeruginosa.

The primary objective of this study was to establish tentative MIC and disk diffusion breakpoints for POPA for inclusion in the forthcoming 4th Edition of the CLSI M45 document. The secondary objective was to determine genomic correlates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and to evaluate the modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM) for detection of carbapenemase production among POPA.

### A novel flow cytometric assay for rapid detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamases [^116G69iZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

The rapid detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is a challenge for most clinical microbiology laboratories because inaccurate identification of ESBL producers has important clinical implications for both antibiotic treatment and infection control. The aim of our study was to develop a rapid detection assay of ESBL producers based upon flow cytometric analysis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing followed by molecular characterization of bla(TEM), bla(SHV) or bla(CTX-M) genes was performed on clinical isolates (41 ESBL positive and 20 ESBL negative) and isolates expressing well-characterized beta-lactamases, including ESBLs (n = 13), plasmid AmpCs (n = 3), oxacillinases (n = 5) and carbapenemases (n = 3). Additionally, two ATCC strains recommended by CLSI for susceptibility testing were used as controls. The flow cytometry analysis protocol involved an incubation of bacterial cells with different concentrations of ceftazidime (1, 2 and 4 mg/L) and cefotaxime (4, 8 and 16 mg/L) for 1 and 2 hours, in the presence and absence of clavulanic acid; subsequently, cells were stained with the fluorescent dye Bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol [DiBAC(4) (3)], a lipophilic anion able to diffuse across depolarized membranes. Additionally, CFU counts were performed. Susceptible isolates displayed increased fluorescence after 1 hour of incubation; conversely, the increase of the depolarized population was only observed after incubation with clavulanic acid associated with ceftazidime or cefotaxime in ESBL producers. An excellent correlation was obtained between the number of non-depolarized bacteria quantified by flow cytometry and by conventional CFU assays. A novel, accurate and fast flow cytometric assay is available to detect the presence of ESBLs.

### Antimicrobial resistance trends in urine Escherichia coli isolates from adult and adolescent females in the United States from 2011 to 2019: rising ESBL strains and impact on patient management [^116byfri]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Minimum Inhibitory Concentration Breakpoints (Secondary Analysis)

The primary analysis was based on susceptibility results reported by each institution; however, the CLSI minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) interpretive breakpoints for several antibiotics changed during the study period (Supplementary Table 1). It was not clear when new breakpoints were adopted by laboratories for cefazolin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin; therefore, a secondary analysis was performed based on changes in the MIC interpretive standards for E. coli to cefazolin (2014 and 2019), cefepime (2014), levofloxacin (2019), and ciprofloxacin (2019) over the study period. The secondary analysis was conducted only among isolates with available MIC values for these antibiotics, to further understand how the breakpoint changes and variation in implementation of new breakpoints potentially affected the primary analysis results.

Trends in resistance were assessed using the most recent MIC breakpoints for E. coli isolates (susceptible/intermediate/ resistant [SIR]) to: cefazolin (≤ 16/–/ ≥ 32), cefepime (≤ 2/4–8 [susceptible dose-dependent]/ ≥ 16), ciprofloxacin (≤ 0.25/0.5/ ≥ 1), and levofloxacin (≤ 0.5/1/ ≥ 2)[21]. Isolates were excluded from this analysis when the MIC breakpoint data were either not reported or when the current interpretive criteria could not be applied to the original MIC (eg, original MIC lying outside of the specific SIR category using current breakpoints and therefore deemed non-evaluable). Isolates were further excluded if they came from healthcare institutions where > 50% of the isolates were deemed nonevaluable, in order to avoid the potential for overestimation of nonsusceptible prevalence.

### Duration of contact precautions for acute-care settings [^113hB2fL]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Duration of contact precautions — scope and definitions — clarifies that the document does not provide recommendations regarding indications for the use of contact precautions (CP) and is intended for acute-care hospitals that already use CP, addressing when and under what circumstances CP may be discontinued; colonization is defined as the isolation of the organism from a nonsterile site in the absence of symptoms of infection. For multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDR-E), MDR-E is considered ESBL-producing (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant (CRE), or MDR-E defined by resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics, and the guidance does not address Pseudomonas aeruginosa or members of the Acinetobacter baumannii complex. For microbiology and testing, FDA-cleared tests were reviewed; routine culture methods have varying sensitivity and may not detect all phenotypes of MRSA, VRE, and MDR-E, and molecular testing for C. difficile is not addressed.

The incidence of aztreonam and cephalosporin susceptibility, determined using the revised CLSI breakpoints, for extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates was evaluated. Our analysis showed that results for aztreonam and/or ≥ 1 cephalosporin were reported as susceptible or intermediate for 89.2% of ESBL-producing E coli isolates (569/638 isolates) and 67.7% of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates (155/229 isolates).

### Prevalence of CTX-M β-lactamases in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania [^112abSGc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

CTX-M beta-lactamases were thought to be rare in the United States, but a recent study in Texas showed that up to 70% of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-containing members of the Enterobacteriaceae family were CTX-M positive (J. S. Lewis, M. Herrera, B. Wickes, J. E. Patterson, and J. H. Jorgensen, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 51:4015–4021, 2007). We used PCR to detect CTX-M in all 291 extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria isolated in our laboratory during 2007. Thirty (48%) Escherichia coli isolates, 6 (3%) Klebsiella sp. isolates, and 7 (100%) Proteus mirabilis isolates tested were CTX-M positive, with 15% of all Enterobacteriaceae tested being positive. The E. coli CTX-M groups were I (57%), IV (37%), II (3%), and not groupable (3%); three of the group IV isolates were positive for CTX-M-18, and three of the group I isolates were positive for CTX-M-15. One of seven positive P. mirabilis isolates was in group II, with the remainder being positive for a CTX-M-25-like beta-lactamase; and 33% of the Klebsiella sp. isolates were in group I or IV, with the remainder not being in groups I to IV. CTX-M-producing bacteria were isolated from urine (n = 13), blood (n = 13), wounds (n = 12), and the respiratory tract (n = 4). All 31 CTX-M-positive isolates tested for the presence of ESBL were confirmed to produce ESBLs by the use of tests recommended by the CLSI. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of the CTX-M-positive isolates showed that six P. mirabilis isolates were clonal and that there were seven different E. coli clusters. Five of seven P. mirabilis isolates were from blood cultures. The CLSI tests for the confirmation of ESBL production reliably detect these isolates if both cefotaxime and ceftazidime are tested, but only about half would be classified as a possible CTX-M producers on the basis of the antibiogram alone. A new panprimer set increases the ability to detect CTX-M-producing strains. CTX-M-positive bacteria are common in our geographic region, are often invasive, and, with the exception of P. mirabilis, are multiclonal.

### Integrating forecast probabilities in antibiograms: a way to guide antimicrobial prescriptions more reliably? [^114Wuq3Z]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) assigns pathogens to "susceptible" or "resistant" clinical categories based on clinical breakpoints (CBPs) derived from MICs or inhibition zone diameters and indicates the likelihood for therapeutic success. AST reports do not provide quantitative measures for the reliability of such categorization. Thus, it is currently impossible for clinicians to estimate the technical forecast uncertainty of an AST result regarding clinical categorization. AST error rates depend on the localization of pathogen populations in relation to CBPs. Bacterial species are, however, not homogeneous, and subpopulations behave differently with respect to AST results. We addressed how AST reporting errors differ between isolates with and without acquired drug resistance determinants. Using as an example the beta-lactams and their most important resistance mechanisms, we analyzed different pathogen populations for their individual reporting error probabilities. Categorization error rates were significantly higher for bacterial populations harboring resistance mechanisms than for the wild-type population. Reporting errors for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam in Escherichia coli infection cases were almost exclusively due to the presence of broad-spectrum- and extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing microorganisms (79% and 20% of all errors, respectively). Clinicians should be aware of the significantly increased risk of erroneous AST reports for isolates producing beta-lactamases, particularly ESBL and AmpC. Including probability indicators for interpretation would improve AST reports.

### Antimicrobial susceptibility among Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex and enterobacteriaceae collected as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial [^114VQV3D]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative pathogens collected from the nine census regions of the United States.

Methods

Isolates were collected from 76 centers between January 2004 and September 2005. In vitro activity was assessed using CLSI guidelines and CLSI or FDA interpretive criteria.

Results

The lowest overall antimicrobial susceptibilities for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex isolates (n = 851) were detected in the Middle Atlantic and East South Central regions. Overall, 29.3% of A. calcoaceticus-baumannii complex isolates were multidrug-resistant (resistant to ≥ 3 antimicrobial classes). Tigecycline (2 microg/mL) had the lowest MIC90 against this organism. Imipenem, tigecycline, and levofloxacin had low MIC90s (0.25–4 microg/mL) against Enterobacter spp. (n = 1557), although the MIC90 for levofloxacin was elevated for East South Central region isolates (≥ 16 microg/mL). Susceptibility to levofloxacin among the E. coli isolates (n = 1785) ranged from 71.7% (Pacific) to 88.5% (New England). The prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (126/1460) varied from 1.7% of isolates (Pacific) to 21.2% (Middle Atlantic). ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae MICs were lowest for imipenem and tigecycline.

Conclusions

Antimicrobial susceptibility varies among the census regions of the United States. The broad-spectrum in vitro activity of tigecycline may make it a suitable candidate for use in the empiric treatment of serious infections.

### Evaluation of piperacillin-tazobactam disks using contemporary enterobacterales isolates suggests the need for disk potency optimization [^117AiVLh]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

When CLSI revised TZP breakpoints in 2021, disk diffusion correlates were established using historical disk-to-MIC data from the 1992 CLSI agenda book when TZP was first evaluated (620 isolates) along with data from a 2004 study on ESBL-producing isolates (n = 632). A major limitation of those data is that the incidence of the OXA-1 resistance mechanism in these historical isolates is unknown, and no disk breakpoint could be developed that met all CLSI M23 acceptance criteria (3.3% VME and 17.3% MIN were found). Since the publication of the CLSI breakpoints, clinical laboratories have anecdotally reported challenges with the use of DD as a reference method for the implementation of the revised TZP breakpoints on commercial antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) systems. We sought to investigate if a lower disk mass may be better able to detect the subtle low-level resistance seen in many contemporary Enterobacterales. Our findings highlight the need for further optimization of TZP disk potency. In particular, the 100/10 µg disk potency failed to adequately distinguish susceptible and not-susceptible isolates, especially those harboring bla OXA-1 (Fig. 2A; Tables 3 and 4). While the EUCAST disk of 30/6 µg performed better than the 100/10 disk, errors were still above the tolerance limits defined by CLSI (Table S4). Our preliminary assessment of alternative disk potencies demonstrated that a 20/5 µg disk yielded lower errors than either the CLSI or EUCAST disk when compared to CLSI MIC breakpoints (Table S4). Furthermore, the 20/5 µg disk yielded the best separation between susceptible isolates and isolates harboring bla OXA-1 (Tables 3 and 4). However, performance still did not meet CLSI M23 criteria, and investigation of even lower piperacillin disk potencies (e.g. in the > 5 to < 20 µg range) may be needed. In phase 2 of the study, the 20/3 µg disk performed similarly to the 20/5 µg disk with an average zone diameter difference between the WT and NWT strains of 9.25 and 9.33 mm, respectively (Table S3). Thus, the 20/3 and 20/4 µg TZP disk potencies could also be further evaluated in the future.

### Comparison of Phoenix and VITEK 2 extended-spectrum-β-lactamase detection tests for analysis of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella isolates with well-characterized β-lactamases [^113MwkHg]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

The VITEK 2 and Phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) detection systems, which comprise confirmatory tests and expert systems, were evaluated for their ability to discriminate between 102 well-characterized strains of ESBL-positive or -negative Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca. At least 38 distinct ESBLs were included. The strains were chosen to include some known to cause false-positive and false-negative CLSI ESBL confirmatory test results. Therefore, enzyme characterizations, rather than CLSI tests, were the reference methods for the Phoenix and VITEK 2 evaluations. A third arm of the study was conducted with the Phoenix test using two normally inactive expert rules intended to enhance ESBL detection, in addition to using the currently available software. The Phoenix ESBL confirmatory test and unmodified expert system exhibited 96% sensitivity and 81% specificity for ESBL detection. Activation of the two additional rules increased sensitivity to 99% but reduced the specificity to 58%. The VITEK 2 ESBL confirmatory test exhibited 91% sensitivity, which was reduced to 89% sensitivity by its expert system, while its specificity was 85%. Many of the expert system interpretations of both instruments were helpful, but some were suboptimal. The VITEK 2 expert system was potentially more frustrating because it provided more inconclusive interpretations of the results. Considering the high degree of diagnostic difficulty posed by the strains, both ESBL confirmatory tests were highly sensitive. The expert systems of both instruments require modification to update and enhance their utility.

### Accuracy of carbapenem nonsusceptibility for identification of KPC-possessing enterobacteriaceae by use of the revised CLSI breakpoints [^111QXZoW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

Using the updated 2010 CLSI carbapenem breakpoints for the Enterobacteriaceae, nonsusceptibility to ertapenem and imipenem predicted the presence of bla(KPC) poorly, especially among Escherichia coli and Enterobacter species. In regions where KPC-producing bacteria are endemic, testing for nonsusceptibility to meropenem may provide improved accuracy in identifying these isolates.

### Detection of ESBL-producingcomplex with VITEK 2 system and screening cutoffs for implementing confirmatory tests [^1136Gypv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

VITEK 2 system without the AES

The same 44 coded Ko C strains were shipped by the IFIK to the Alberta Precision Laboratories (APL; Calgary, Canada) using swabs with transport medium (Transystem, Copan).

Fresh colonies (overnight) on blood agar plates (Dalynn Biologicals) were used to perform the ASTs implementing the VITEK AST-N390 card on a VITEK 2 apparatus and employing the CLSI criteria. The species ID (i.e. Ko) was manually entered into the instrument. ATCC strains E. coli 25922 and K. quasipneumoniae 700603 were used as quality controls.

At the APL, the AES of VITEK 2 is not routinely implemented. On the other hand, Ko C strains showing a VITEK 2 MIC > 1 µg/mL for CRO and/or CAZ (i.e. CLSI ESBL screening criteria) are tested for ESBLs on MH agar plates (Oxoid) with the CLSI-recommended CTX/CTX-CL (30/30–10 µg) and CAZ/CAZ-CL (30/30–10 µg) CDTs (MAST Group). Results of each CDT are interpreted as ESBL-positive according to the CLSI criteria. One positive result is sufficient to define the Ko C strain as ESBL-positive. Strains that tested negative for ESBLs are reported as hOXY- Ko C.

Disk diffusion assays

At the IFIK, disk diffusion analyses for CRO (30 µg EUCAST/CLSI disk; Bio-Rad), CPD (10 µg EUCAST/CLSI disk; Bio-Rad), CAZ (10 µg EUCAST disk; Liofilchem), CTX (5 µg EUCAST disk; Liofilchem), and ATM (30 µg EUCAST/CLSI disk; Bio-Rad) on MH agar plates (Oxoid) were also performed. Assays were repeated twice, leading to consistent results. On the other hand, at the APL, a single disk diffusion assay (MAST Group) for CAZ (30 µg CLSI disk), CTX (30 µg CLSI disk), and ATM (30 µg EUCAST/CLSI disk) was performed.

### Detection of ESBL-producingcomplex with VITEK 2 system and screening cutoffs for implementing confirmatory tests [^112acRWa]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Bacteria belonging to the Klebsiella oxytoca complex (Ko C) are responsible for numerous types of infections, including those being hospital-acquired. These pathogens produce the chromosomally encoded and non-transmissible class A OXY-type β-lactamases (formerly named K1) that are expressed at different levels according to the genetic asset of their promoter region. Produced at low level, wild-type (WT) OXYs confer resistance to penicillins, whereas their overexpression guarantees hydrolysis of extended-spectrum β-lactams: efficient for ceftriaxone (CRO) and aztreonam (ATM), partial for cefotaxime (CTX), and weak for ceftazidime (CAZ). However, OXY variants capable of hydrolyzing CAZ at high levels (e.g. OXY-2–5, OXY-2–15) have also been reported.

Ko C isolates may also acquire multidrug resistance plasmids carrying clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) such as the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs; mainly of CTX-M type) that significantly limit our therapeutic options to a few antibiotics (e.g. to carbapenems). Therefore, identification of ESBL-producing Ko C is of clinical and public health importance, since these strains are difficult to treat, have the potential to cause hospital outbreaks, and possess the ability to exchange ESBL genes via conjugation of their plasmids with other bacterial species.

Recently, we have shown that standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is unable to discriminate between Ko C strains producing ESBLs (ESBL- Ko C) and hyperproducing OXYs (hOXY- Ko C). ESBL and OXY β-lactamases are inhibited by clavulanate (CL); therefore, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)-based ESBL confirmatory tests (ESBL-CTs) failed to distinguish between ESBL and those hyperproducing OXY Ko C strains (i.e. high false-positive rates). On the other hand, the combined-disk tests (CDTs) and the double-disk synergy test (DDST) performed according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines demonstrated high accuracy.

### Detection of ESBL-producingcomplex with VITEK 2 system and screening cutoffs for implementing confirmatory tests [^116g2QsH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Klebsiella oxytoca complex (Ko C) are important nosocomial pathogens that can be reservoirs of transmissible extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes. Therefore, it is essential for clinical microbiology laboratories to distinguish between Ko C producing ESBLs (ESBL- Ko C) and those hyperproducing the natural OXY-type β-lactamases (hOXY- Ko C). We investigated the abilities of VITEK 2 with and without using the Advanced Expert System (AES) to detect ESBL producers among 44 well-characterized Ko C strains (including 11 ESBL- Ko C and 21 hOXY- Ko C). VITEK 2/AES showed 100% sensitivity (Se) and 64.7% specificity (Sp), whereas the VITEK 2 coupled by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) ESBL confirmatory tests (ESBL-CTs; i.e. disk-combination tests) showed 100% Se and 97.5% Sp to detect ESBL- Ko C. We also analyzed Ko C-specific screening cutoffs for ceftriaxone (CRO), cefpodoxime (CPD), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotaxime (CTX), and aztreonam (ATM) to negate unnecessary ESBL-CTs. As a result, we propose the following screening cutoffs (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] and inhibition zone diameter): CRO, > 4 µg/mL and ≤ 16 mm; CPD, > 4 µg/mL and ≤ 10 mm; CAZ, > 1 µg/mL and ≤ 22 mm (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing [EUCAST] disk)/ ≤ 30 mm (CLSI disk); CTX, > 4 µg/mL and ≤ 12 mm (EUCAST disk)/ ≤ 22 mm (CLSI disk); ATM, > 1 µg/mL and ≤ 28 mm. Notably, all suggested cutoffs could assure 100% Se and high Sp/positive predictive values for our 44 Ko C strains. In conclusion, the AES performed poorly, while VITEK 2 with the CLSI ESBL-CTs yielded a reliable methodology to distinguish ESBL- Ko C from hOXY- Ko C. This study also proposed revised screening cutoffs for detecting ESBL- Ko C and reducing the unnecessary use of ESBL-CTs.

IMPORTANCE

Species within the Klebsiella oxytoca complex (Ko C) are emerging clinical pathogens of increasing concern. These bacteria can acquire plasmid-mediated ESBL genes, seriously complicating antibiotic treatment and overall management of infected patients. Differentiating ESBL-producing from non-ESBL-producing Ko C isolates is therefore crucial. However, this task presents significant challenges for clinical laboratories. In this work, we showed that the automated VITEK 2 system equipped with its AES fails to differentiate the two groups of Ko C isolates. In contrast, VITEK 2 alone followed by the ESBL screen and phenotypic confirmatory tests provides accurate differentiation. Since this latter approach increases the diagnostic workload, we also proposed new screening cutoffs for key cephalosporins that may reduce the current high number of unnecessary confirmatory tests.

### Practical approach for reliable detection of ampC β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae [^114tAHzB]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

In this prospective study all Enterobacteriaceae isolates (n = 2,129) recovered in the clinical microbiology laboratory during October 2009 to April 2010 were analyzed for AmpC production. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) cefoxitin and cefotetan susceptibility breakpoints and CLSI critical ESBL diameters were used to screen for potential AmpC producers. In total, 305 isolates (211 potential AmpC producers and 94 AmpC screen-negative isolates as a control group) were further analyzed by multiplex PCR for the detection of plasmid-encoded ampC beta-lactamase genes and by ampC promoter sequence analysis (considered as the gold standard). Cefoxitin and cefotetan were assessed as primary screening markers. The sensitivities of cefoxitin and cefotetan for the detection of AmpC production were 97.4 and 52.6%, respectively, and the specificities were 78.7 and 99.3%, respectively. As a phenotypic confirmation test, the Etest AmpC and the cefoxitin-cloxacillin double-disk synergy method (CC-DDS) were compared. The sensitivities for the Etest AmpC and the CC-DDS method were 77.4 and 97.2%, respectively, and the specificity was 100% for both methods. The results of the Etest AmpC were inconclusive for 10 isolates. With the CC-DDS method 2 inconclusive results were observed. Based on this study, we propose a comprehensive diagnostic flow chart for the detection of AmpC production consisting of a simple phenotypic screening and a single phenotypic confirmation test with inconclusive results being resolved by molecular analysis. For the proposed flow chart using (i) cefoxitin as a screening marker for AmpC production, (ii) the CC-DDS method as phenotypic confirmation, and (iii) molecular methods in case of inconclusive results, the sensitivity and specificity for AmpC detection would have been 97.4 and 100%, respectively, with respect to the studied isolates. The phenotypic methods used in the AmpC algorithm are simple to perform and easy to implement in the diagnostic laboratory.

### Detection of CTX-M-type extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBLs) by testing with microScan overnight and ESBL confirmation panels [^114ume4y]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have emerged as the most common type of ESBL globally, their incidence easily surpassing those of SHV and TEM ESBLs in most locales. This study compared the performance of two MicroScan dried panels with CLSI reference broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods on a collection of genetically characterized ESBL-producing isolates. These included 64 Enterobacteriaceae isolates that produced CTX-M8, -14, -15, or -16 according to PCR and sequencing of the bla gene, 17 isolates that produced a SHV or TEM ESBL, and 19 that produced both CTX-M and SHV ESBLs. Each isolate was tested by a frozen reference microdilution panel, the MicroScan ESbetaL plus confirmation panel, and a routine dried panel containing streamlined ESBL confirmation dilutions (MicroScan Neg MIC panel type 32) that included cefotaxime and ceftazidime tested alone or with a fixed concentration of 4 microg/ml of clavulanate. Each isolate was also tested by the standard CLSI double-disk confirmation tests. The disk diffusion method detected all ESBL-producing isolates, the frozen reference panel detected 90% of isolates (10 out of 100 could not be analyzed because of off-scale MICs that exceeded the clavulanate combination concentrations in the panel), the ESbetaL plus panel detected 98% (1 missed and 1 off scale), and the streamlined ESBL panel detected 95% (5 off scale). Very high MICs for a few strains that produced SHV or both CTX-M and SHV ESBLs precluded noting the required three twofold-dilution differences with clavulanate needed to confirm an ESBL primarily in the reference panel and the Neg type 32 panel.

### Antimicrobials increase travelers' risk of colonization by extended-spectrum betalactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae [^1169trVY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Identification of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase–Producing Enterobacteriaceae– Positive Strains

The swabs were cultured for 24 hours at 35°C on ESBL and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) agars (CHROMagar, bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). No growth of Enterobactericeae was detected on KPC agar. The putative ESBL-producing strains were identified using the automated VITEK GN system (bioMérieux), and genotypes were determined as described elsewhere. The susceptibilities were tested with the VITEK 2 AST-N153 or AST-N184 card (bioMérieux) using the broth microdilution method and following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. In addition, disc susceptibility tests were performed according to the criteria of the CLSI M100-S17, using Mueller Hinton agar (Oxoid, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cambridge, United Kingdom); the double-disk synergy (Oxoid) test was used for cefotaxime (30 µg), ceftazidime (30 µg), and cefpodoxime (30 µg) alone or with clavulanic acid (10 µg) combinations.

Follow-up of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase–Producing Enterobacteriaceae in Clinical Samples

To spot laboratory-confirmed clinical ESBL-PE infections, a survey was conducted for the ESBL(+) group using the Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory (HUSLAB) database. This database covers approximately 90% of all ESBL-PE findings in clinical samples in the district (personal communication, Martti Vaara, HUSLAB).

Statistics

Univariate analyses were conducted using SPSS 19.0.0.1 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois). For categorical variables, χ 2 test, Fisher exact test, or binary logistic regression analysis was used; for continuous variables, binary logistic regression analysis was used. Risk factors with a P value < .2 in the univariable model were chosen for further analysis by the multivariable model with binary logistic regression; of the strongly correlating risk factors, only 1 was picked. When the variables were selected for the final model, the Akaike information criteria were used. Values missing in the risk factors were taken into account by multiple imputations, reducing possible biases and efficiency loss. This involved assuming "missingness at random". Multivariable analyses were carried out with SPSS 21.0.0.1 (SPSS Inc.).

### Rapid detection of ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae in blood cultures [^112AAQAT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The Study

During November 2012–May 2013, we studied a single blood culture positive for GNB from each of 245 patients hospitalized at the Bicêtre hospital, a 950-bed hospital located in a suburb of Paris. Positivity of blood cultures was detected by using the BacT/Alert system (bioMérieux, La Balme-les-Grottes, France). After obtaining Gram stain results, we tested the blood cultures positive for GNB directly for 1) ESBL-E by using the ESBL NDP test, and 2) species identification by using the MALDI-TOF MS technique.

We adapted the protocol of the ESBL NDP test for detection of the ESBL-E from blood cultures (Technical Appendix). The detailed MALDI-TOF MS protocol using the VITEK MS system (bioMérieux) is described in Detailed Methods in the Technical Appendix.

We performed antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) by the disk diffusion method using bacterial colonies grown from blood cultures according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommendations. The same MALDI-TOF technology and the API Gram negative Identification product (bioMérieux) were used for confirmatory identification of bacteria. AST results, obtained 48 h after blood cultures were identified as positive, were interpreted according to the CLSI breakpoints, as updated in 2014. MIC of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime were determined on Muller-Hinton (MH) agar and MH agar supplemented with 4 μg/mL of tazobactam (final concentration).

We used the double-disk synergy test (DDST) for the phenotypic detection of ESBL producers, according to the CLSI recommendations. For each sample, 1 disk contained cefotaxime, ceftazidime, or cefepime, and a second disk contained ticarcillin and clavulanate. The DDST was also performed on MH agar plates (bioMérieux) containing cloxacillin (150 mg/L) to inhibit cephalosporinase activity of natural producers of those inducible cephalosporinases. Because the DDST was performed in parallel to the AST, results were obtained 48 h later. The DDST was considered to be the reference standard for the detection of ESBL-E.

### Effect on antimicrobial resistance of a policy restricting over-the-counter antimicrobial sales in a large metropolitan area, S ã o paulo, Brazil [^117WDsvZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Susceptibility Testing

For E. coli, we performed susceptibility testing for cephalothin, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole using a VITEK 2 automated system (bioMérieux,) according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI;) criteria. For the analysis, we assumed nonsusceptible strains to be resistant. Because CLSI changed breakpoints for ceftriaxone in 2010, we considered the phenotypic detection of extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) during the study period to investigate the association between third-generation cephalosporin resistance and antimicrobial sales. We considered E. coli isolates susceptible to amoxicillin if MIC ≤ 8 for ampicillin. For S. pneumoniae, we determined susceptibility to erythromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole by disk-diffusion (OXOID). To determine penicillin and ceftriaxone susceptibility, we screened for oxacillin susceptibility using disk diffusion according to CLSI guidelines. For isolates found resistant to any drug by disk diffusion, we determined MIC by broth microdilution to confirm susceptibility status.

### Evaluation of carbapenemase screening and confirmation tests with enterobacteriaceae and development of a practical diagnostic algorithm [^113TMv7m]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Reliable identification of carbapenemase-producing members of the family Enterobacteriaceae is necessary to limit their spread. This study aimed to develop a diagnostic flow chart using phenotypic screening and confirmation tests that is suitable for implementation in different types of clinical laboratories. A total of 334 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates genetically characterized with respect to carbapenemase, extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), and AmpC genes were analyzed. A total of 142/334 isolates (42.2%) were suspected of carbapenemase production, i.e., intermediate or resistant to ertapenem (ETP) and/or meropenem (MEM) and/or imipenem (IPM) according to EUCAST clinical breakpoints (CBPs). A group of 193/334 isolates (57.8%) showing susceptibility to ETP, MEM, and IPM was considered the negative-control group in this study. CLSI and EUCAST carbapenem CBPs and the new EUCAST MEM screening cutoff were evaluated as screening parameters. ETP, MEM, and IPM with or without aminophenylboronic acid (APBA) or EDTA combined-disk tests (CDTs) and the Carba NP-II test were evaluated as confirmation assays. EUCAST temocillin cutoffs were evaluated for OXA-48 detection. The EUCAST MEM screening cutoff (< 25 mm) showed a sensitivity of 100%. The ETP APBA CDT on Mueller-Hinton agar containing cloxacillin (MH-CLX) displayed 100% sensitivity and specificity for class A carbapenemase confirmation. ETP and MEM EDTA CDTs showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for class B carbapenemases. Temocillin zone diameters/MIC testing on MH-CLX was highly specific for OXA-48 producers. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the Carba NP-II test were 78.9, 100, 100, and 98.7%, respectively. Combining the EUCAST MEM carbapenemase screening cutoff (< 25 mm), ETP (or MEM), APBA, and EDTA CDTs, and temocillin disk diffusion on MH-CLX promises excellent performance for carbapenemase detection.

Reference identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

Reference identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed at the reference laboratory. Identification was performed by conventional biochemical testing; for isolates identified as Acinetobacter spp. polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the blaOXA-51 gene for identification of A. baumannii species.

Each retrieved isolate confirmed as belonging to one of the four key GNB species underwent testing with a standardized panel of 12 to 16 antibiotics, according to the identified species. Antibiotics were included in these panels if 1) they were listed as priority pathogen-antibiotic combinations in GLASSor 2) they belonged to the group A or B antibiotics of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100 S27 guidelineand were of local clinical relevance. The disk diffusion method was conducted following the M100 CLSI guideline valid at the time of testing, and results were interpreted using 2021 CLSI breakpoints, except for fosfomycin against P. aeruginosa and tigecycline, for which the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testingand the U.S. Food and Drug Administrationbreakpoints were used, respectively. Colistin susceptibility testing was performed only for carbapenem-resistant isolates, using both colistin agar spotand disk elution methods and applying 2021 CLSI breakpoints. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was assessed only for E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) using the double disk method. Escherichia coli American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12453 strains were used for quality control. All antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed once per isolate, except in the case of out-of-range quality control results, in which case a second test was performed using the entire panel of antibiotics. Resistance to an antibiotic class was defined as resistance to at least one tested antibiotic of the corresponding class (i.e. ceftriaxone or ceftazidime for 3GC; ciprofloxacin for fluoroquinolones; amikacin or gentamicin for aminoglycosides; meropenem, imipenem, or ertapenem for carbapenems). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was defined as acquired nonsusceptibility (intermediate or resistant) to at least one antibiotic in three or more antibiotic classes. Difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR) was defined as combined nonsusceptibility (intermediate or resistant) to all tested beta-lactam antibiotics (including carbapenems) and ciprofloxacin.

### The cost-effectiveness of ESBL detection: towards molecular detection methods? [^1172mnDv]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Correct detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is crucial for infection control and antibiotic choice. We performed a study to determine the cost-effectiveness of phenotypical testing, which can be inaccurate, and genotypical tests, which are considered to be more reliable but also more expensive. All patients that had been in isolation in the Amphia hospital because of the detection of ESBL according to the ESBL Etest were included in the survey. All strains were retested using the double disk confirmation test (DDCT) and a genotypical method. This was a commercially available microarray (Check-Points). Discordant results were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. In total 174 patients were included. In 24 of 174 (14%) patients, ESBL carriage could not be confirmed with the microarray. This was verified with PCR and sequencing. The mean duration of isolation was 15days, adding up to a total number of isolation days of 2571. False-positive results according to the microarray resulted in a total of 279days of unnecessary isolation for the Etest and 151days for the DDCT. Using Etest to detect the presence of ESBL results in a false-positive outcome in 14% of the cases. This results in unnecessary isolation of patients, which can be omitted by using a genotypic method.

FIG 1
Workflow for identification and susceptibility testing of microorganisms in positive blood cultures.

Rapid detection of clinically important resistance mechanisms was performed on colonies (including those growing on cultures for at least 5 h) by a chromogenic assay (βLACTA test [BLT]; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) for the detection of resistance to third-generation cephalosporin (3GCR), mostly mediated by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) inspecies other than natural AmpC producers, and by the PBP2a culture colony test (PBP2a; Alere, Scarborough, ME, USA) for the detection of methicillin-resistant(MRSA) amongstrains. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed by the automated Vitek2 system (bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France) for staphylococci (AST-P610 cards), enterococci (AST-P586 cards), and(AST-N236 cards) and by the disk diffusion method for Gram-negative nonfermenters and for all other bacteria using CLSI guidelines. The methicillin resistance phenotype in staphylococci was inferred from a result of resistance to cefoxitin, while vancomycin resistance in enterococci was suspected on the basis of a result of nonsusceptibility to vancomycin. The carriage of ESBL- and/or of carbapenemase-encoding genes in Gram-negative bacterial isolates with suspicious resistance phenotypes (according to CLSI interpretative guidelines) was confirmed by in-house multiplex PCR assays targeting major ESBLs and carbapenemases, followed by amplicon sequencing. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were tested for vanA and vanB genes using the Xpert vanA / vanB kit on the GeneXpert platform (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
