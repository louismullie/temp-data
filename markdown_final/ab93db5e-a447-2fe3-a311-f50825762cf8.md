## Question

What is the ICD-10 code for pruritus ani?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10 code for pruritus ani. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the exact ICD-10-CM code from a reliable coding source. Then, I should verify whether there are any alternative or more specific codes that might apply. Next, I will check for any nuances in ICD-10-CM that could affect code selection, such as laterality or etiology. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically grounded answer with the correct code and a brief justification.

> Let me first confirm the code from a dependable source. Find-A-Code lists the ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for pruritus ani as L29.0, which is the specific code for anal itching, and this aligns with the L29 pruritus category structure in ICD-10-CM [^4c71f79e].

> Wait, let me verify whether there are any alternatives I should consider. The L29 series includes L29.3 for anogenital pruritus, unspecified, which could be used if the location is not specified or if both perianal and genital involvement are present without a more specific site, but when the location is clearly the anus, L29.0 is the most precise choice [^4c71f79e].

> I should double-check whether ICD-10-CM requires any additional characters for specificity. Unlike some ICD-10-CM codes that mandate laterality or additional detail, pruritus ani under L29.0 does not require extra digits beyond the decimal and zero, so L29.0 is complete as-is for billing and documentation purposes [^4c71f79e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical implications of the code itself. While the code is straightforward, pruritus ani has a broad differential including primary irritant or hygiene-related causes and secondary causes such as hemorrhoids, fissures, infections, inflammatory dermatoses, and rarely malignancy; accurate coding should still be paired with appropriate evaluation and documentation of suspected etiologies when relevant [^7c09f9da] [^a31b5cf5].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for pruritus ani is L29.0 [^4c71f79e].

---

The ICD-10 code for pruritus ani is **L29.0** [^4c71f79e]. This code is used for anal itching and should be selected when the perianal itch is the primary diagnosis. If the itch is part of a broader anogenital involvement without a more specific site, use **L29.3** (anogenital pruritus, unspecified) [^4c71f79e]. Accurate coding supports appropriate management and follow-up for this common, often multifactorial condition [^a31b5cf5].

## ICD-10 code for pruritus ani

The specific ICD-10-CM code for pruritus ani is **L29.0** [^4c71f79e]. This code is part of the L29 category, which covers various forms of pruritus, including pruritus ani, pruritus scroti, and pruritus vulvae [^4c71f79e].

---

## Clinical description and etiology

Pruritus ani is characterized by **itching of the perianal skin** [^7c09f9da], which may be intermittent or constant, and can significantly impact quality of life [^f0a8a607]. The condition can be classified as primary (idiopathic) or secondary to underlying causes such as:

- **Fecal soiling or poor hygiene**: Common primary contributors [^7c09f9da].
- **Anorectal conditions**: Hemorrhoids, anal fissures, fistulas, and condyloma acuminatum [^a31b5cf5].
- **Infections**: Pinworms, fungal infections, bacterial infections, and sexually transmitted infections [^7c09f9da].
- **Dermatologic conditions**: Psoriasis, contact dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, and lichen planus [^notfound].
- **Systemic diseases**: Diabetes mellitus, liver disease, and renal failure [^notfound].
- **Medications**: Antibiotics, chemotherapeutic agents, and topical anesthetics [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A thorough clinical evaluation is essential to identify underlying causes and guide management. The diagnostic approach typically includes:

- **History**: Detailed assessment of hygiene practices, dietary habits, medication use, and associated symptoms such as bleeding, discharge, or pain [^a31b5cf5].
- **Physical examination**: Inspection of the perianal region for skin changes, lesions, fissures, hemorrhoids, or signs of infection [^a31b5cf5].
- **Laboratory tests**: Stool examination for parasites, cultures for infections, and blood tests to evaluate systemic conditions [^notfound].
- **Anoscopy or colonoscopy**: Indicated if structural abnormalities or malignancy are suspected [^a31b5cf5].

---

## Treatment strategies

Management of pruritus ani focuses on identifying and treating the underlying cause, along with symptomatic relief. Common treatment strategies include:

- **Hygiene measures**: Gentle cleansing with water, avoiding harsh soaps, and using soft toilet paper or wipes [^a31b5cf5].
- **Topical medications**: Low-potency corticosteroids, barrier creams, and topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus) for refractory cases [^a31b5cf5].
- **Dietary modifications**: Reducing intake of potential irritants such as coffee, tea, alcohol, chocolate, and spicy foods [^notfound].
- **Treatment of underlying conditions**: Addressing hemorrhoids, fissures, infections, or systemic diseases [^a31b5cf5].
- **Patient education**: Emphasizing the chronic nature of the condition and the importance of adherence to treatment and hygiene measures [^f0a8a607].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Pruritus ani is often a chronic condition with a relapsing course. Persistent scratching can lead to **skin thickening (lichenification)**, excoriations, and secondary infections. Rarely, chronic pruritus ani may be associated with malignancy, such as squamous cell carcinoma of the anus, particularly in patients with long-standing symptoms unresponsive to conservative therapy [^d08a2ade].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10 code for pruritus ani is **L29.0** [^4c71f79e]. This code is essential for accurate documentation, billing, and epidemiological tracking of this common condition. Effective management requires a comprehensive approach, addressing both symptomatic relief and underlying causes to improve patient outcomes and quality of life [^a31b5cf5].

### Clinical features of colorectal cancer before diagnosis: a population-based case-control study [^8b87014e]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

The large number of variables that were eligible for multivariable analysis (because of the liberal 10% threshold employed at the univariable stage) raises the possibility of false positive associations. The exhaustive, structured, approach to the multivariable analyses should have identified such influences. In the final model, there was a manageable number of variables, all with very strong evidence of associations both in terms of magnitude and statistical significance. All of the variables in the final multivariable model have been reported with colorectal cancer before. However, in observational epidemiology, residual confounding and false positives can never be entirely ruled out.

Symptoms

The level of risk above which investigation is appropriate depends on the viewpoints of the patient, the doctor and the health care organisation. The choice of a threshold level for referral has considerable resource implications, with a lower threshold level requiring greater provision of investigative services. The percentage of colorectal cancers found in two reports of referrals to 2 week clinics was 9.4 and 16%. This suggests that the Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer – if they were used by the referring doctors – have a high specificity, but possibly at the cost of a low sensitivity. Our positive predictive values may be a better guide. We consider a risk of 2% or more justifies investigation, though many would argue for a lower threshold.

The positive predictive value of rectal bleeding was 2.4%. This is less than the 3.3 and 7% reported from two previous primary care reports, although these studied only 9 and 27 cancers, respectively. In patients aged under 70, the positive predictive value was 1.4%. Rectal bleeding occurred in 4.2% of controls over 2 years, a remarkably similar finding to the 2.1% of the normal population in 1 year previously reported. This also suggests that retrospective use of primary care records, as in this study, is not associated with an important loss of data. These figures largely support current UK Referral Guidelines, which suggest investigation of patients over 60 with persistent rectal bleeding, unaccompanied by local anal symptoms. The ICPC code nearest in meaning to the umbrella term 'local anal symptoms' has a slightly different definition, that of anal/rectal pain. Thus, we were unable to study if local anal symptoms (which includes other symptoms such as itching) do indeed reduce the risk that rectal bleeding is due to cancer, although anal/rectal pain did not appear to do so.

### Pruritus ani: diagnosis and treatment [^7c09f9da]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Pruritus ani is a common condition with multiple causes. Primary causes are thought to be fecal soiling or food irritants. Secondary causes include malignancy, infections including sexually transmitted diseases, benign anorectal diseases, systemic diseases, and inflammatory conditions. A broad differential diagnosis must be considered. A reassessment of the diagnosis is required if symptoms or findings are not responsive to therapy. The pathophysiology of itching, an overview of primary and secondary causes, and various treatment options are reviewed.

### Pruritis ani [^f0a8a607]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2026). Medium credibility.

Pruritus ani is characterized by severe itching of the perianal skin. It may be intermittent, constant, acute, or chronic. In 75% of cases an underlying cause is identified, and correction will often lead to significant improvement in symptoms. Treatment focuses on correcting the underlying cause, education on anorectal hygiene, identification and avoidance of triggers, and symptom management. Early and frequent discussion of expectations can help to protect the physician-patient relationship and guide treatment. This article will serve to outline the etiologies, diagnostic workup, and therapeutic modalities essential to the treatment of pruritus ani.

### Management of common benign anorectal disease: what all physicians need to know [^19945b92]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Benign anorectal conditions produce anal pain, rectal bleeding, or discharge from the perianal region, which are highly prevalent symptoms in the general population. Hemorrhoidal disease, anal fissure, perianal abscess, proctalgia syndromes, and pruritus anii are the most common clinical disorders. Well-trained physicians, irrespective of their specialty, can treat most of these disorders and refer them to a specialist in proctology only when necessary. The aim of this review is to provide a practical guide to the management of benign anorectal disorders in terms of their initial management and the criteria for specialist referral.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Itch and pruritus: what are they, and how should itches be classified? [^c223f3f3]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Itch and pruritus are two terms for the same thing. In this essay I will argue that casting about for a distinction between them creates only confusion. Once that matter is settled, it is still necessary to come up with a clinical classification for itches of different types. No system yet proposed, including the one that will be suggested here, is perfect.

### Prevalence of undiagnosed monkeypox virus infections during global mpox outbreak, United States, June-September 2022 [^ef303ff3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Retrospective Molecular Testing

During the study period, MPXV testing was performed for 1,196 patients (median age 30 [IQR 19–46] years); 656 (54.8%) were men. The most common specimen collection sites were arm (24.8%; n = 297), anogenital (18.6%; n = 222), leg (10.1%; n = 121), and unspecified (14.2%; n = 170). The ICD-10-CM codes accompanying specimens were broadly categorized as disorder of the genitals, herpes-related lesions, pruritus, cellulitis, skin conditions, vaginitis, high-risk sexual behavior, mpox, miscellaneous, and not defined. A total of 67 (5.6%) specimens tested positive for MPXV DNA (Figure 1). The dates that the positive specimens had been obtained corresponded to the increase in mpox epidemic curve in the United States (Figure 2). Most MPXV-positive specimens were associated with skin conditions, including ICD-10-CM codes R21 (rash and other nonspecific skin eruption), L98.9 (disorder of skin and subcutaneous tissue, unspecified), L08.89 (other specified local infections of the skin and subcutaneous tissue), and disorders of the genital regions including N48.5 (ulcer of the penis) (Table 3). Among those categories, all specimens with ICD-10-CM codes corresponding to signs/symptoms of pruritis, cellulitis, and vaginitis tested negative for MPXV; no positive specimens were from women. Among the 67 MPXV-positive specimens, 5 (7.3%) ICD-10-CM codes were classified under sexual behavior that places someone at increased STI/HIV risk and 4 (5.8%) under herpes-related lesions. Of the 67 positive specimens, 15 (20.3%) were among 74 specimens that were originally submitted for testing of other infectious organisms but after negative results had been submitted for MPXV testing at provider request.

### Diagnosis and treatment of perianal Crohn disease: NASPGHAN clinical report and consensus statement [^7b1de0bd]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

Perianal Crohn disease (PCD) — definition, symptoms, and inflammatory bowel disease context — is defined as inflammation at or near the anus with lesions including tags, fissures, fistulae, abscesses, or stenosis, and symptoms that include pain, itching, bleeding, purulent discharge, and incontinence of stool; within the broader inflammatory bowel disease spectrum that includes Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, the incidence in the United States is 70 to 150 cases per 100,000 individuals.

### Diagnosis and treatment of perianal Crohn disease: NASPGHAN clinical report and consensus statement [^a6f8b3c9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

Perianal Crohn disease — clinical presentation in children — Manifestations of PCD fall into 3 distinct categories: tissue destruction (anal fissures, tags, deep ulcers), fistulae and abscesses (often multiple and complex), and rectal stricture. The spectrum is variable, with some having relatively mild disease and others experiencing a severe, destructive, debilitating course leading to constipation, fecal incontinence, recurrent infections and sepsis, compromise of sexual function, significantly diminished quality of life, and, in some cases, a diverting colostomy or ileostomy. Even in its most severe form, PCD can be surprisingly painless, and children and adolescents are often reticent to volunteer information about bowel habits, drainage, or anal pruritus; it is therefore extremely important to ask direct questions. Skin tags may cause cosmetic concerns but are not frequently associated with pain unless inflamed. Despite the absence of pain in some children, functional impairments and social implications are often significant.

### Acute infectious proctitis in adolescents [^d380ab7f]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of acute proctitis requires understanding who is at risk, being aware of symptoms, and leveraging a thorough sexual history with appropriate risk stratification to make the diagnosis. Cases have been concentrated in adolescents (ages 15–19 years), young adults (ages 20–24 years), men and transgender women who have sex with men, and those with a history of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Black adolescents experience a disproportionately high number of cases of proctitis due to an intersection of concentrated cases in sexual networks and delayed screening/diagnosis due to health care access barriers. Signs and symptoms include purulent discharge, bleeding, pain, tenesmus, pruritus, diarrhea or constipation, weight loss, or fever. Multisite sexually transmitted infection testing should be offered based on risk stratification (eg, history of condomless anal sex, oral intercourse, number of sex partners). Further management includes promotion of barrier protection and preexposure prophylaxis, routine surveillance, partner notification, and routine access to preventive immunizations.

### Benign anorectal conditions: evaluation and management [^a31b5cf5]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Common anorectal conditions include hemorrhoids, perianal pruritus, anal fissures, functional rectal pain, perianal abscess, condyloma, rectal prolapse, and fecal incontinence. Although these are benign conditions, symptoms can be similar to those of cancer, so malignancy should be considered in the differential diagnosis. History and examination, including anoscopy, are usually sufficient for diagnosing these conditions, although additional testing is needed in some situations. The primary treatment for hemorrhoids is fiber supplementation. Patients who do not improve and those with large high-grade hemorrhoids should be referred for surgery. Acutely thrombosed external hemorrhoids should be excised. Perianal pruritus should be treated with hygienic measures, barrier emollients, and low-dose topical corticosteroids. Capsaicin cream and tacrolimus ointment are effective for recalcitrant cases. Treatment of acute anal fissures with pain and bleeding involves adequate fluid and fiber intake. Chronic anal fissures should be treated with topical nitrates or calcium channel blockers, with surgery for patients who do not respond to medical management. Patients with functional rectal pain should be treated with warm baths, fiber supplementation, and biofeedback. Patients with superficial perianal abscesses not involving the sphincter should undergo office-based drainage; patients with more extensive abscesses or possible fistulas should be referred for surgery. Condylomata can be managed with topical medicines, excision, or destruction. Patients with rectal prolapse should be referred for surgical evaluation. Biofeedback is a first-line treatment for fecal incontinence, but antidiarrheal agents are useful if diarrhea is involved, and fiber and laxatives may be used if impaction is present. Colostomy can help improve quality of life for patients with severe fecal incontinence.

- age at the time of diagnosis/index date [± two years]

- sex

- encounter type [ambulatory (clinic) visit, Emergency Department, or inpatient]

- diagnosis month [± 6 months]

- enrolled months after index date [± 2 months]

The Elixhauser system for capturing prognostically significant comorbidities was used for both the case and control groups. To be included in the case–control analysis, patients had to have 12 months of continuous enrollment data available just prior to the first AF diagnosis date.

The prescription drugs are identified in the database by National Drug Code (NDC) identifiers, and all prescription drugs dispensed within one week of the initial diagnosis were captured for each AF patient. Procedures associated with AF were identified using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes.

One limitation of the database is that it does not capture prescription medications that have to be formulated by compounding pharmacists because compounded medications do not have specific NDC codes and because these products are not a part of the insurance benefit covered by the health plan. The commercial 0.4% product (Rectiv®) was not available during the study period. However, discussions with local pharmacists confirmed that some AF patients during the study period were prescribed the 2% nitroglycerin ointment with instructions to either provide it to the compounding pharmacist to dilute to 0.2% or 0.4%, or for the patient to mix it with topical lidocaine or other products prior to application. Therefore, we assumed that all prescriptions for the topical 2% nitroglycerin product dispensed at the time of an AF visit were intended for the treatment of AF. All drugs that were dispensed to cases within one week of the index date, and all procedures associated with AF diagnoses, were captured and cross-referenced to find any patients with AF who may have been missed by the initial search.

### Causes and management of pruritus ani [^a2cf9843]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Summary

A 48-year-old healthy man presented to the office reporting a long-standing history of anal pruritus. He had tried various over-the-counter creams without much success. Besides an anal fissure in the past, which responded to nitroglycerin ointment, his medical history was unremarkable. On physical examination, he was found to have grade I hemorrhoids and mild fecal smearing on perianal skin. Recent colonoscopy and laboratory work ordered by the primary care provider were normal. He was counseled on common inciting agents and local irritants and was advised on hygiene, diet modification, and stool-bulking agents. The colorectal surgeon recommended that the patient keep a journal about his symptoms, foods, and household chemicals used. He was seen twice more over the course of 6 months to pinpoint the cause of his pruritus. A short-course trial of topical steroid, barrier cream, and topical tacrolimus was not helpful. A biopsy of perianal skin was performed and was unrevealing. Eventually, given the persistence of symptoms, it was decided that he would undergo methylene blue injection to address his pruritus (Fig. 1). The procedure consisted of several intradermal and subcutaneous injections of 10mL of 1% methylene blue combined with 7.5mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with adrenaline (1/100,000) and 7.5mL 0.5% lidocaine. After the methylene blue injection, the severity of his symptoms improved, but pruritus still persisted. A methylene blue injection of the same concentration was repeated in 3 months with complete resolution of symptoms.

### The epidemiology and treatment of anal fissures in a population-based cohort [^a1e0378c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

The patients included in this retrospective historical cohort analysis were enrolled in one regional healthcare system based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA. Utilization data from this system are routinely de-identified and collected into an electronic database maintained by the Lovelace Clinic Foundation, a non-profit organization that specializes in health services research. All healthcare utilization and outpatient pharmacy fills for all members are captured by this database, regardless of where the utilization occurs. The system had an average annual enrollment of over 220,000 during the 7-year study period (January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2011). This project was approved and monitored by an independent human research review board (Ethical and Independent Review Services® 12072-01c).

For study inclusion, patients were required to have one or more visits or procedures during the study period associated with an ICD-9 diagnosis code of 565.0 (anal fissure). The date of the first visit associated with a 565.0 diagnostic code is referred to as the date of first diagnosis; these patients are referred to as incident AF cases. Patients may be an incident AF case only one time, and all of their subsequent visits are considered evidence of either continuation of the initial lesion or recurrence of AF. Persons who had follow-up visits for AF 12 weeks or more after the initial visit were defined as having chronic or recurrent AF. All cases had to be 6 years of age or older at the time of diagnosis for inclusion in the study.

The incidence of AF during the study period was calculated by comparing the number of incident AF cases diagnosed to the total person-years at risk within each age, sex, or ethnicity category. Patients could enroll or disenroll from the health plan in the middle of a calendar year, or otherwise not have a full 12 months of time at risk of developing AF, which creates a risk of bias that might be introduced by variable enrollment periods. Therefore, to reduce this bias, the incidence in person-years was calculated by comparing the number of AF cases occurring during a calendar year by the total person-months of enrollment during that period divided by 12.

Case–control matching was used to help identify comorbidities associated with anal fissures. Each anal fissure case was matched to 3 similar patients who did not have anal fissure. The matching criteria included:

### Birth position and obstetric anal sphincter injury: a population-based study of 113 000 spontaneous births [^790bbff6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Exposures

The midwife reported birth position in the medical record system within the next hours after birth. The recording system allowed the midwife to choose between seven different positions which (translated from Swedish) were; sitting, lithotomy, lateral, standing on knees, supine squatting, and standing. If another birth position was used it was documented using free text under the heading of "Other:… " All births on the birth seat and in all fours position were collected from this heading. Remaining births in free text were sorted into appropriate birth positions if possible. The residual 166 births that were not understandable were collapsed with 583 births that did not have any information on birth position into the birth position category "unknown". There were no specific criteria for each position; the midwife freely decided which heading she/he judged to best describe the birth position used by the woman. The collected data does not reveal level of elevation of the head of the bed. In the present investigation, we used the following categories of birth position: a) sitting, b) lithotomy, c) lateral, d) standing on knees, e) birth seat, f) supine, g) squatting, h) standing or i) all fours. The most frequently used birth position was sitting, which was used as reference category.

Outcome measurements

The primary outcome was obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS). Cases were defined by having both a Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) code (i.e. a surgical code for suturing of OASIS) in combination with a definition by the midwife or the obstetrician by a checkbox in the obstetric electronic case notes and/or International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) code for sphincter injury. The DRG code used was MBC33 and the following ICD-10 codes: O702, O702C, O702D, O702X (grade III which involve the anal sphincter complex) and O703 (grade IV, which extend to the rectal mucosa).

### Epidemiology of prurigo nodularis in england: a retrospective database analysis [^53e5de81]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Prurigo nodularis, alternatively known as nodular prurigo, is a chronic disease characterized by multiple hyperkeratotic nodules and papules. These lesions are severely pruritic, and are typically symmetrically distributed along a patient's extremities. At present, the mechanisms underlying prurigo nodularis remain poorly understood. Continuous itching itself is believed to trigger prurigo nodularis, and this behaviour is often routed to dermatological, systemic, infectious or psychiatric disorders. However, in many cases, no underlying condition is identified. Prurigo nodularis has a major impact on patient quality of lifeand appears to affect a disproportionate number of female patients. Presentation at clinic has been reported to occur most often between the ages of 51 and 65 years.

Prurigo nodularis is classified as a rare disease by the National Institutes of Health Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD)and National Organization for Rare Diseases (NORD). In the UK, the prevalence of prurigo nodularis is unknown as there are no studies describing the epidemiology of the condition. In the USA, prevalence estimates range from 3.6 to 14.8 per 10 000 population, whereas in the European context, rates of between 0.65 and 11.1 per 10 000 population have been reported.

In addition to natural variation, this relatively wide range of estimates is partly due to differences in case definition and the representativeness of the study populations. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM), used extensively in the USA until 2015, did not have a specific diagnostic code for prurigo nodularis. Therefore, studies using this classification based their definition on the ICD‐9‐CM code 698.3 (lichenification and lichen simplex chronicus), and consequently overestimated the prevalence, as other conditions that appear under this umbrella term would have been included. One studyattempted to assign the proportion of prurigo nodularis cases that are likely to be captured by this code, but such methods are somewhat arbitrary and subject to bias of clinical setting. In addition, previous prevalence estimates have been derived from either distinct age‐defined subsets of the population, specific healthcare settings, or from data sources derived from insurance‐based sources, which have inherent demographic biases and are therefore not representative of the underlying population.

### Pathway to acquire new ICD-10 codes pertinent to new wound care technology [^86c72eff]. Advances in Wound Care (2018). Low credibility.

New technologies are continually developed for the wound care market. This article provides an overview of the process for obtaining a new or revised ICD-10-Clinical Modification and/or ICD-10-Procedure Coding System code. Manufacturers, providers and researchers often forget that this process can be lengthy and must be included in product development timelines. An example of timelines required for implementation of new 2020 ICD-10 codes is provided in the article. In addition, the article provides insight into the appropriate individuals, within a manufacturing organization or consulting firm, who may be able to assist with evaluating whether pertinent ICD-10 diagnosis or procedure codes exist within the ICD-10 coding system or whether an application must be submitted for one or more new/revised ICD-10 codes.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Psychogenic itch [^f813168f]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psychogenic itch is a diagnosis that is (too) frequently proposed by physicians, but patients diagnosed with psychogenic itch are (too) rarely referred to psychiatrists. Only 62 references containing the key word "psychogenic itch" could be obtained from PubMed in July 2017. Psychogenic itch is also known as psychogenic pruritus, somatoform pruritus, functional itch disorder, or functional pruritus, but "psychogenic itch" is the most commonly used denomination.

In this review, data on itch will be first provided. Then epidemiology and definition, as well as differential diagnosis and inclusion in classifications will be discussed. Physiopathological and psychopathological points of view will be debated. Finally, the consequences of psychogenic itch and its management will be exposed.

### How did episiotomy rates change from 2007 to 2014? Population-based study in France [^7a3f6471]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

In this population-based retrospective cohort study, we included all hospital discharge abstracts for all deliveries in France from 2007 to 2014. Diagnoses were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and procedures according to the French Common Classification of Medical Procedures (CCMP).

Population

All hospital discharge abstracts mentioning the codes Z37 ("outcome of delivery") of the ICD-10 were selected. In France, Z37 codes are considered the most reliable and exhaustive to select hospital deliveries. All vaginal deliveries were examined, but we especially focused on non-operative vaginal deliveries (the related codes are described in the Additional file 1).

Variables

In the present study, the outcome of interest was episiotomy, which was defined by one code in the CCMP (JMPA006). The quality of hospital discharge abstracts regarding episiotomy has been validated thanks to a French validation study. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, no validity studies have used national data to study episiotomy in non-operative vaginal deliveries.

The explanatory variables concerned the characteristics of the women and the characteristics of birth environment. At the maternal level, we considered the known risks factors for episiotomy: maternal age, parity (primiparous women were women who gave birth for the first time), gestational age (available only since 2010), multiple pregnancy, epidural analgesia, non-reassuring fetal heart rate, breech vaginal delivery, newborn weight > 4000 g (for single pregnancies, linkage with the birth abstract reliable only since 2013). We also considered severe perineal tear: third degree (injury to the anal sphincter complex) and fourth degree (injury to the perineum involving the anal, or sphincter complex and anal epithelium). Variables retained for the environment were the year of delivery, and department (French regions are divided into geographical departments).

### Itch as a patient-reported symptom in ambulatory care visits in the United States [^4b8dcf99]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

European studies have shown that itch is a widespread symptom, yet little is known about its frequency in the United States.

Objective

We sought to describe ambulatory care visits to clinicians in the United States for which itch was coded as a patient symptom.

Methods

This study uses retrospective data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 1999 through 2009.

Results

Itch was coded as a symptom for an average of 7 million visits per year or approximately 1% of all outpatient visits, which was nearly 40% of the number of visits for the symptom of low back pain. Patients seen in visits for itch were more likely to be black or Asian than other patients (20% vs 14%). They were also more likely than other patients to receive a new medication (68% vs 36%) and were over twice as likely to receive 2 or more new medications (31% vs 14%).

Limitations

Secondary data sets may not optimally capture patient reports and some of the procedures or medications may have been ordered for reasons other than itch.

Conclusion

Visits to clinicians for itch represent a sizeable proportion of ambulatory care visits in the United States, and research on the epidemiology, treatments, and causes of itch should be a priority.

### Evaluating the accuracy of hemorrhoids: comparison among specialties and symptoms [^cbddb91f]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A large proportion of patients with anorectal complaints are referred to colorectal surgeons with the label of hemorrhoids.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to review presenting symptoms and frequency of accurate diagnosis, as well as to analyze determinants of misdiagnosis to guide educational endeavors.

Design

This was a retrospective study.

Settings

The study was conducted at a tertiary care academic center.

Patients

The charts of patients referred to a colorectal clinic with the diagnosis of hemorrhoids from January 1, 2012, to January 1, 2017, were reviewed.

Main Outcome Measures

The accuracy of the referring provider's diagnosis of hemorrhoids was measured.

Results

Review of charts identified 476 patients with the referral diagnosis of hemorrhoids. The most common presenting symptoms were bleeding (63%; n = 302), pain (48%; n = 228), and protrusion (39%; n = 185). Anal examination (ie, external inspection and/or digital internal examination) was documented in only 48%. The hemorrhoid diagnostic accuracy was 65% (n = 311). Among patients with incorrect hemorrhoid diagnoses (35%; n = 169), actual diagnosis was anal fissure (34%), skin tag (27%), and hypertrophied papilla (6%). One rectal and 2 anal carcinomas were found (0.63%). Compared with general practitioners, gastroenterologists had 86% higher odds of correct diagnosis (OR = 1.86 (95% CI, 1.10–3.10); p = 0.02), whereas the gynecologists had 68% lower odds of correct diagnosis at the time of referral (OR = 0.32 (95% CI, 0.10–0.80); p = 0.02). On multivariable analysis, referring specialty was not predictive of accurate diagnosis. Patients presenting with protrusion had 73% higher odds of accurate diagnosis (OR = 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1–2.7); p = 0.02), whereas patients presenting with pain (OR = 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1–2.5); p = 0.03) or pruritus (OR = 2.5 (95% CI, 1.2–5.0); p = 0.008) were more likely to be misdiagnosed.

Limitations

This is a retrospective study. Not all of the charts contained all data points. The number of patients may limit the power of the study to detect some differences.

Conclusions

A variety of anorectal complaints are diagnosed as hemorrhoids by providers who have initial contact with the patients. Educational programs directed toward improving physician knowledge can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and earlier initiation of appropriate care. Presenting symptoms other than protrusion lead to higher rate of misdiagnosis by a referring physician. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A847.

### Psychogenic itch [^d17dd387]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The IFSI uses the term "somatoform pruritus". European guidelines for itch favor the phrase "somatoform itch", which is convenient for easier international use and avoids the word "psychogenic". In any case, all of these words pertain to pruritus with psychological factor(s) as the main cause. Some major international classifications do not give precise definitions (see below) but situate psychogenic itch within groups of diseases, which could also be helpful. Because "psychogenic itch" remains the more commonly used term, we will use it in this review.

Psychogenic itch is not an idiopathic pruritus (pruritus of unknown origin), and it is not an elimination diagnosis. To assess the diagnosis, it is necessary to determine both negative (no somatic cause) and positive criteria (clinical characteristics, association with psychological disorders, or stressful life events). The FPDG proposed 10 diagnostic criteria (3 compulsory and 7 optional) in its definition(Table 1). Hence, the diagnosis of FID is possible in the presence of the three compulsory criteria and at least three out of seven of the optional ones. These criteria were validated by an international study that found that the effects of psychotropic drugs and psychotherapies were less able to discriminate FID from other itch diagnoses.

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for functional itch disorder (or psychogenic pruritus) from the French Psychodermatology Group (previously published in Acta Derm. Venereol. 2007;87:341–4)

Psychogenic itch may accompany other psychiatric conditions like depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorders, psychoses, and substance use.

### The hospitalization burden of inflammatory bowel disease in China: a nationwide study from 2013 to 2018 [^af35ac26]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria

We included all discharge records from patients with a diagnosis of IBD in the database, with ICD-10 codes K50.x for CD and K51.x for UC accordingly. The indeterminate colitis (ICD code K52.3) was not included in this study. We excluded discharge records lacking patient identification. All admission records with less than 24 h discharge were also excluded in order to avoid overestimation of hospitalization rate including biologics use and iron supplement. For patients with repeated admissions, we excluded those with a diagnosis of non-IBD [such as intestinal tuberculosis (ICD-10 code A18.3) or intestinal Behçet's disease (ICD-10 code M35.2)] at the last discharge of the study period. Details of the selection process are presented in Figure 1. This manner allowed all IBD-related cases been included.

Figure 1.
The flowchart of selection process.

Variables and definition

Extracted variables included sex, age, location of residency (provincial level), and insurance type (rural or urban, encompassing employees' basic medical insurance or citizens' basic medical insurance as urban citizens or new rural cooperative medical care as rural residence). Surgical rates (comprising bowel resection, intestinal anastomosis, fistulation, and repair of intestinal perforation; bowel resection was subsequently analyzed separately), proportion of intestinal complications (obstructions including intestinal constriction, intussusception, volvulus, impaction, ileus, other unspecified intestinal obstructions, stenosis of rectum, and postoperative intestinal obstruction; penetration including fistula, abscess, perforation of intestine, and post-operation intestinal fistula), and perianal lesions (including anal abscess and anal fistula) based on ICD code classification were used to describe the disease burden in hospitalized IBD patients. The disease location and behavior according to the Montreal Classification was not analyzed in this study due to lack of such information in ICD coding system. The ICD coding is verified in other studies to use in identification of surgeries and complications diagnosis in IBD patients. Other variables of hospitalization burden included length of stay (LOS), total charges per person year, and proportion of hospital charges covered by the national insurance program. Records without corresponding items of data were excluded from the study subsets. The demographic information of the first discharge during January 2013 and December 2018 for each individual was used as the patients' demographic features in this study, whereas the diagnosis at the last discharge was used as the diagnostic label for the patient if a change in diagnosis and evolution of the disease course occurred.

### Fistula-in-ano: an uncommon cause of chronic vulvar symptoms [^563d38aa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Rectal and anal fistulae are frequently missed diagnoses. Symptoms of fistula-in-ano may mimic other chronic vulvar conditions.

Cases

Three patients presented with chronic symptoms including nonhealing ulcer, pruritus, dyspareunia, and discharge for 6–18 months. High clinical suspicion and rectal examination with concomitant perineal probing was useful in making a diagnosis. Once the diagnosis of fistula-in-ano was made, surgical correction was successful.

Conclusion

When evaluating persistent vulvar problems, the clinician's differential diagnoses should include less common causes. The goals of treatment for fistula-in-ano should be to eliminate the nidus of infection and to preserve the anal sphincter during the repair.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Prevalence of undiagnosed monkeypox virus infections during global mpox outbreak, United States, June-September 2022 [^cd5b4403]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Retrospective Molecular Testing

During the multinational outbreak that began in 2022, mpox was diagnosed by nonvariola orthopoxvirus- and MPXV-specific real-time PCR tests of lesion swab samples. Before an mpox-specific diagnosis code (B.04) was established, clinical diagnoses and testing were documented with ICD-10-CM codes representing broad symptoms of infection, which were used as a surveillance tool for early identification of potentially undiagnosed infections similar to other diseases. To evaluate the presence of MPXV within specimens received for other testing, CDC partnered with HealthTrackRx, a private laboratory that receives specimens from a variety of clinics across the United States for infectious disease testing. During June 1–September 2, 2022, CDC deidentified and tested lesion swab specimens associated with ICD-10-CM codes for genital lesions, herpes simplex virus infection, inflammation of the genital region, skin rash, and others that may overlap with symptoms of mpox (Appendix 2) for presence of MPXV DNA by using a clade II–specific PCR. After June 27, 2022, HealthTrackRx validated its own mpox clade II–specific assay and continued to test specimens for MPXV that fit the ICD-10-CM codes (Appendix 2). No specimens were excluded; only basic demographic and geographic data and pertinent ICD-10-CM codes that may be associated with mpox were available from the initial test request from the submitting clinician. No information about sexual history was included.

EARLY DIAGNOSIS

Vaginal Cancer

We found no studies of the predictive value of symptoms for vaginal cancer or its precursors. Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia is predominantly asymptomatic. Vaginal cancers are more commonly symptomatic and may present with vaginal bleeding, unexplained vaginal discharge, pain, palpable mass, or other nonspecific symptoms. In most studies, painless vaginal bleeding was the most common symptom.

Vulvar Cancer

We found no studies of the predictive value of symptoms for vulvar cancer or its precursors. Most patients with vulvar cancer present with at least one symptom such as pain, pruritus, or a visible lesion. Sixty percent of vulvar cancers are diagnosed without distant spread, likely because of the symptomatic nature of these lesions. Symptoms of vulvar precancers are similar but less severe. Nonhealing vulvar ulcers carry particularly high risk. In one study of nonhealing ulcers, 63% were diagnosed with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, and 36% had at least HSIL.

Anal Cancer

We found no studies of the predictive value of symptoms for anal cancer or its precursors. Forty-five percent of patients with anal cancer are diagnosed with localized disease and 34% with regional disease. Most studies on anal cancer symptoms are quite old, published well before the beginning of our search window. One contemporary study noted that rectal bleeding was the most frequent presenting symptom (64.6%), followed by noticing a lump (34%), pain (32.6%), perianal itch (15%), and tenesmus (13.9%). Other symptoms included altered bowel habits, diarrhea, thinner feces, mucous, and an inguinal mass.

### Accuracy of obstetric laceration diagnoses in the electronic medical record [^3d0bbb81]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Patient safety data including rates of obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI) are often derived from hospital discharge codes. With the transition to electronic medical records (EMRs), we hypothesized that electronic provider-entered delivery data would more accurately document obstetric perineal injury than traditional billing/diagnostic codes.

Methods

We evaluated the accuracy of perineal laceration diagnoses after singleton vaginal deliveries during one calendar year at an American tertiary academic medical center. We reviewed the entire hospital chart to determine the most likely laceration diagnosis and compared that expert review diagnosis (ExpRD) with documentation in the EMR delivery summary (EDS) and ICD-9 diagnostic codes (IDCs).

Results

We retrospectively selected 354 total delivery records. OASI complicated 56 of those. 303 records (86%) were coded identically by the EDS and IDCs. Diagnoses from the IDCs and the EDS were mostly correct compared with ExpRD (sensitivity = 96%, specificity = 100%). There was no systematic over- or under-diagnosis of OASI for either the EDS (p = 0.070) or the IDCs (p = 0.447). When considering all laceration types the EDS was correct for 21 (5.9%) lacerations that were incorrect according to the IDCs. Overall, the EDS was more accurate (p < 0.05) owing to errors in IDC minor laceration diagnoses.

Conclusions

Electronic medical record delivery summary data and EMR-derived diagnostic codes similarly characterize OASI. The EDS does not improve OASI reporting, but may be more accurate when considering all perineal lacerations. This assumes that providers have correctly identified and categorized the lacerations that they record in the EMR.

Differential diagnoses

The diagnosis of clinical or suspected scabies (levels B or C) requires that conditions other than scabies are considered less likely. Given the nonspecific nature of itch and the morphologically varied lesions of scabies, there are numerous differential diagnoses. A comprehensive list, including common and rare conditions, is shown in Table 4, and further detail is given in Appendix S7 (see Supporting Information). The ability to recognize these conditions will depend on the expertise of the examiner. Dermoscopy may also be useful for differentiating causes.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^7cb0ab4c]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal margin with pruritus ani of long duration [^d08a2ade]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Anal margin is an unusual location for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). On rare occasions, anal margin carcinoma is the cause of pruritus ani.

Objective

To describe a case of SCC of the anal margin with pruritus ani of long duration.

Results

A 52-year-old man had been aware of perianal itching for over 10 years. Examination of the perianal area revealed a reddish, eroded, hard nodule that was 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm in size located in the 3 o'clock position. The histopathologic diagnosis was well-differentiated SCC. The nodule was totally excised with a 1-cm margin. No recurrence or metastases were observed for 7 months.

Conclusion

When pruritus ani does not respond to conservative therapy and when symptoms have existed for a long time, we should suspect the presence of malignancy.

### Global skin disease morbidity and mortality: an update from the global burden of disease study 2013 [^ae36aef2]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods

The analyses were carried out by the team members of the Institute of Health Metrics and international skin experts with an interest in dermatoepidemiology. The following skin conditions were selected based on available data, standardized disease definitions, and prevalence: dermatitis (including the common varieties of eczema: atopic, seborrheic, and contact dermatitis), psoriasis, cellulitis, pyoderma, scabies, fungal skin diseases, viral skin diseases, acne vulgaris, alopecia areata, pruritus, urticaria, decubitus ulcer, malignant skin melanoma, and keratinocyte carcinoma (including basal and squamous cell carcinomas). An additional category, "other skin and subcutaneous diseases", encompasses the remainder of miscellaneous skin conditions. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and ICD-10 codes were used to define each of the 15 skin disease categories (eTable 1 in the Supplement).

The initial step in the GBD estimation strategy was a thorough investigation of the world literature using PubMed and Google Scholar for data on the incidence, prevalence, remission, duration, severity, and mortality risk (only applicable for selected skin diseases) of the 15 skin conditions. Data were extracted by age, time period, and with information defining uncertainty (standard error, confidence interval, or numerator/denominator). Searches were performed in English and Spanish languages for the years 1980 through 2013. Data were extracted from more than 4000 sources including systematic reviews, surveys, population-based disease registries, hospital inpatient data, outpatient data, and cohort studies. Most incidence data for certain skin diseases were obtained from 3 medical record sources: (1) inpatient data from Europe, Latin America, and the United States, (2) outpatient data predominantly from the United States, and (3) in the case of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, registry data where it included keratinocyte carcinoma, for example, Northern Ireland Cancer Registry, 2010 (see eTable 2 in the Supplement for all GBD 2013 skin disease data sources).

Methods

Study design and population

Electronic health records between 1 January 2006 and 30 March 2018 from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) HIV clinic (locally known as 1917 Clinic) were reviewed. The UAB 1917 Clinic is the largest HIV clinic in the state of Alabama with extensive regional catchment and referral network, as previously described. The prospective clinic cohort has collected more than 7000 patients' sociodemographic, behaviour, comorbidities, medications, vital signs, laboratory results and corresponding dates. Data were obtained by query of the cohort's electronic database using MS SQL Server 2008.

For the primary trend analysis, eligible patients were who: (1) visited the clinic at least twice for receiving primary HIV care during the 12-year study period and (2) were at least 18 years old at HIV diagnosis. CD4 trajectories were modelled based on the estimates from at least three CD4 examinations and restricted to those with at least three longitudinal CD4 measurements. Instead of using billing code such as ICD-9 code, the RISC database has established a standard clinical 'problem' sheet that collects and documents all diagnoses derived from patient medical charts recorded by the care providers. In our case, HAUD diagnoses were identified by the 1917 Clinic health providers and initially abstracted through the RISC database. Primary clinical manifestations of symptomatic HAUD include painful anogenital ulcers, dysuria, fever, dysuria, tender local inguinal lymphadenopathy and headache. Per the protocol, serological HSV tests are not required for the purpose of diagnosing symptomatic HAUD. This also corresponds to the current HAUD preventive strategies. Further, HAUD cases were verified by reviewing medical charts. For those patients who started receiving care from the HIV clinic before 1 January 2006, medical records were reviewed for up to prior 1 year, if available. Individuals with prevalent HAUD at baseline and/or during the 1 year prior (for those with medical records as described above), were excluded from the study. Thus, we were confident that eligible study participants were condition-free at baseline and that only incident conditions were identified during the follow-up period. Potential recurrent and refractory HAUD cases immediately linked to the cases identified during the follow-up would also be avoided in the context. All study participants were followed up until the first HAUD diagnosis (cases) or last clinical visit (HAUD-free controls). This present study was approved by the UAB Institutional Review Board.

ICD-10-CM
- The diagnosis classification system developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for use in all U. S. health care treatment settings. Diagnosis coding under this system uses a different number of digits and some other changes, but the format is very much the same as ICD-9-CM. The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services has mandated industry-wide adoption of ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS code sets by Oct. 1, 2011. ICD-10-CMS will affect all components of the healthcare industry. Ambulatory surgery centers will not be affected by ICD-10-PCS unless they are utilizing ICD-9-CM volume 3 for inpatient procedures. The two major changes in the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM code sets are structure and detail. The codes will move from a numeric five-character size to an alphanumeric seven-character size. At current count, there are approximately 17, 000 ICD-9-CM codes and the possibility of 155, 000 ICD-10-CM/PCS codes.

The codes are far more specific which will allow for greater accuracy. Thank you for choosing Find-A-Code, please Sign In to remove ads.

### Validation of international classification of disease ninth revision codes for atopic dermatitis [^aca6865e]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Evaluation of large-scale data sets is needed to better understand the epidemiology, cost, and burden of atopic dermatitis (AD). We sought to validate the use of ICD-9-CM codes for identifying AD.

Methods

Patients from a large metropolitan quaternary care medical center with a diagnostic code of either 691.8 (AD) or 692.9 (eczema and contact dermatitis) were queried. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, Hanifin & Rajka (H&R) and United Kingdom Working Party (UKWP) criteria. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values (PPV) of the codes were calculated.

Results

Of 43 278 patients identified with associated ICD-9 codes of 691.8 or 692.9, 519 and 253 with 691.8 and 692.9 were randomly selected for chart review. There was extensive overlap: 34.3% had ≥ 1 occurrences of 691.8 and 692.9 and 25.6% had multiple occurrences of both codes. Among patients with ≥ 1 occurrence of 691.8, 29.9% and 30.8% met the H&R and UKWP criteria, respectively. Similarly, among patients with ≥ 1 occurrence of 692.9, 33.7% and 32.2% met the H&R and UKWP criteria. Increased PPV was associated with concomitant diagnoses of asthma, hay fever, and food allergy and increased disease severity.

Conclusions

In the outpatient setting, the ICD-9-CM codes 691.8 and 692.9 alone have poor PPV. Incorporation of diagnoses of asthma, hay fever, and food allergy improves PPV and specificity. In the inpatient setting, a primary discharge diagnosis of 691.8 had excellent PPV. Although ICD-10 has been adopted in Europe and more recently in the USA, the same systematic errors would likely occur unless providers standardize their coding.

### Which patients with chronic pruritus are presented for psychological assessment by their dermatologists? Results from a consecutive sample [^bdf4e0d8]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

, Chronic pruritus (CP) is a frequent symptom that poses special diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for dermatologists. To identify the causes underlying CP, a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment is necessary. 1, 2 CP can impair quality of life and can be associated with clinically relevant depression and anxiety levels; also, psychiatric comorbidity can be present independent of CP, but it may affect its dermatological management. 1, 3, 4 However, not all patients with CP undergo a psychological assessment. It remains unclear which individual variables should suggest a referral for a psychological assessment by a patient's dermatologist. We sought to investigate this relationship in a large sample of patients with CP attending the Center for Chronic Pruritus (KCP) at the University of Münster. Between 2007 and 2016, data from 6374 consecutive in‐patients with CP were entered into the database.

At the KCP, patients undergo extensive diagnostics and complete a set of questionnaires on a mobile electronic device: a patient itch questionnaire (Münster NeuroDerm questionnaire), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 5 and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). 6 All patient data are transferred into the electronic patient records and, if the patient consents, into a research database. 7 The local ethics committee approved the study (2007‐413‐f‐S), which was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

We used this database to identify patients who were referred for a psychological assessment and compared their dermatological and patient‐reported data to those of other patients with CP. The results of the consultations were extracted from the documentation of the Department of Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, where patients with CP were examined by physicians with a specialization in psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy. Based on a 1‐h semistructured clinical interview, a diagnosis according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)‐10, chapter F is given if the respective diagnostic criteria are applicable.

### Imprecise coding in allergic contact dermatitis: a register-study from Northern Finland between years 1999 and 2022 [^53bbfbe7]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective patient registry‐based study performed in the OUH in Northern Finland. The OUH Department of Dermatology provides specialist dermatology care for a population of 416 000. It is the only hospital department of its kind in the Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District (NOHD). All patient records that featured either of the ICD‐10 codes L23.8 (ACD due to other agents) or L23.9 (ACD, unspecified cause) between 1999 and 2022 were extracted from the medical records database and included in the study. Study data were collected, checked and managed manually by the authors JK, TL, JM and MS using REDCap electronic data capture tools. From the selected records, the following variables were collected: the number of uses of each code per year, whether the code was used to record the primary diagnosis of the visit and the main reasons for the use of the code.

Data are presented as numbers of cases and percentages, and means, standard deviation (SD) and range, and as proportions for categorical variables.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^9d2fadcf]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### Patient symptomatology in anal dysplasia [^2d24bfd1]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

High-resolution anoscopy (HRA) is becoming increasingly advocated as a method of screening for anal dysplasia in high-risk patients.

Objective

To describe, through HRA findings, the association between patient symptomatology and anal dysplasia among patients at high risk for anal dysplasia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted of data from a prospectively maintained HRA database on all patients undergoing HRA with biopsy from November 1, 2011, to March 13, 2014, at a tertiary care HRA clinic. Data included demographics, medical history and comorbidities, HIV status and related measures (CD4 cell counts, HIV viral load, and use of highly active antiretroviral therapy), sexual orientation (when available), patient symptoms at initial presentation, physical examination findings, anal Papanicolaou (Pap) smear findings.

Main Outcomes and Measures

High-resolution anoscopy diagnosis of high- vs low-grade dysplasia or no dysplasia.

Results

One hundred sixty-one HRA biopsy specimens (mean [SEM], 1.77 [0.11] biopsy specimens per patient) were obtained from 91 patients (mean [SEM] age, 45.7 [1.2] years; 61 men [67%]; 47 black patients [52%]; and 70 human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients [77%]). Twenty-seven patients (30%) had high-grade dysplasia, 26 had low-grade dysplasia (29%), and 38 had no dysplasia (42%). The majority of patients (63 [69%]) were asymptomatic (anal pain, 11 [12%]; bleeding, 14 [15%]; and pruritus, 10 [11%]). Forty-one patients (45%) presented with anal pain (odds ratio, 5.25; 95% CI, 1.44–21.82; P = 0.02), and patients with either high- or low-grade dysplasia were more likely to present with anal lesions on physical examination compared with patients without dysplasia (odds ratio, 4.34; 95% CI, 1.78–11.20; P = 0.002). Multivariable analysis suggested that anal pain was independently associated with high-grade dysplasia (odds ratio, 6.42; 95% CI, 1.18–43.3; P = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

Anal dysplasia is a silent disease that is frequently asymptomatic. However, patients with anal pain, anal lesions, and other high-risk factors are at increased risk of having high-grade anal dysplasia. These patients may benefit from routine screening with HRA.

### Anal sphincter laceration at vaginal delivery: is this event coded accurately? [^1067ae29]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the error rate for discharge coding of anal sphincter laceration at vaginal delivery in a cohort of primiparous women.

Methods

As part of the Childbirth and Pelvic Symptoms study performed by the National Institutes of Health Pelvic Floor Disorders Network, we assessed the relationship between perineal lacerations and corresponding discharge codes in three groups of primiparous women: 393 women with anal sphincter laceration after vaginal delivery, 383 without anal sphincter laceration after vaginal delivery, and 107 after cesarean delivery before labor. Discharge codes for perineal lacerations were compared with data abstracted directly from the medical record shortly after delivery. Patterns of coding and coding error rates were described.

Results

The coding error rate varied by delivery group. Of 393 women with clinically recognized and repaired anal sphincter lacerations by medical record documentation, 92 (23.4%) were coded incorrectly (four as first- or second-degree perineal laceration and 88 with no code for perineal diagnosis or procedure). One (0.3%) of the 383 women who delivered vaginally without clinically reported anal sphincter laceration was coded with a sphincter tear. No women in the cesarean delivery group had a perineal laceration diagnostic code. Coding errors were not related to the number of deliveries at each clinical site.

Conclusion

Discharge coding errors are common after delivery-associated anal sphincter laceration, with omitted codes representing the largest source of errors. Before diagnostic coding can be used as a quality measure of obstetric care, the clinical events of interest must be appropriately defined and accurately coded.

### Lifestyle and reproductive risk factors associated with anal cancer in women aged over 50 years [^4629f4ef]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Materials And Methods

The Million Women Study is a population-based prospective study, which recruited women via the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme from 1996 to 2001. The study was established to examine the association between menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer, and to investigate associations between lifestyle, reproductive and hormonal risk factors, and other health outcomes.

Women were invited to participate in the study via a postal questionnaire, which was distributed with their usual breast-screening invitation. Full details of the study design and methods are described in detail elsewhere. About 1.3 million women returned a completed questionnaire. Participants gave written consent for use of their questionnaire data for research, and for ongoing linkage to nationally held registry and health data. The Study has Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee approval (97/01).

The main analysis excluded participants if they had breast or any other invasive cancer registered prior to recruitment, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision; ICD-10 C44). Self-reported data from the recruitment and subsequent resurvey questionnaire were used to define most exposures; exposures were not updated. Deprivation index was calculated using post-code and 1991 census data.

Million Women Study participants are flagged on the UK National Health Service Central Registers, which provide the study team with regularly updated information on incident cancers and deaths. Cases of incident anal cancer are those coded as C21 'malignant neoplasm of anus and anal canal' according to the (ICD-10). Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3) is routinely captured by the UK cancer registry as an in situ cancer: CIN 3 registrations (ICD-10 D06) that occurred prior to recruitment were also identified from the cancer registry data.

Risk factors with sufficient numbers of cases in exposed and unexposed women were also examined separately for the two most common histological subtypes of anal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. These were identified using ICDO-3 (ICD for Oncology version 3) morphology codes. Squamous tumours included the following ICDO-3 codes: M80810/3, M8070/3, M8071/3, M8072/3, M8083/3, M8094/3, M8123/3, and M8124/3. Adenocarcinomas included codes M8140/3, M8210/3, M8263/3, M8480/3, and M8481/3.

### Disease burden of primary biliary cholangitis and associated pruritus based on a cross-sectional US claims analysis [^e4a87670]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design and data source

This retrospective, cross-sectional study used de-identified US administrative data from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Medicare Supplemental Database. This database provides a nationally representative sample of insured individuals living in the USA and includes information on inpatient and outpatient medical data and outpatient prescription drug data.

Claims and prescriptions were evaluated during a 12-month observation period (1 January to 31 December 2017) to record the occurrence of events of interest. The reference date was 1 January 2017. The 12-month period immediately prior to this was defined as the lead-in period, during which cases and baseline characteristics were identified.

Eligibility criteria

Eligible patients were required to be at least 18 years of age at reference date with uninterrupted enrolment, including pharmacy and medical benefits, during the lead-in period and throughout the entire observation period, and at least one record of any type during the lead-in period, both for cases and non-cases, to ascertain patients were active in the healthcare system. No exclusion criteria were employed.

Analysis populations

Prevalent PBC cases were identified using 2020 International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes for PBC (K74.3). These cases formed the PBC population, defined as individuals with at least two claims for PBC during the full study period, of which at least one had to occur during the lead-in period. This approach was informed by an earlier validation study, which reported that the optimal algorithm to identify PBC cases in administrative data included the use of at least two PBC-related codes, with a sensitivity of 94% and a positive predictive value of 73%. A subset of the PBC population, hereafter referred to as the PBC-pruritus subpopulation, was identified using the same criteria for PBC; however, individuals were additionally required to have at least one claim for pruritus during the lead-in period. As no ICD-10-CM code exists for PBC-specific pruritus, these patients were identified using a general pruritus code (ICD-10 L29 (pruritus, unspecified)). The non-case populations (ie, comparator populations) were identified as those not meeting the case definition (ie, with no ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for PBC or no PBC-pruritus at any time prior to 31 December 2016).

Chronic itching can be frustrating for patients and providers, and patients are not always willing to accept that their psychiatric health has an impact on their skin. Psychogenic pruritus is defined as itch not related to dermatologic or systemic causes. When a patient presents with pruritus, regardless of the presumed cause, the standard work-up should include a thorough history, dermatologic examination, and laboratory examinations or biopsies as needed. If no medical source is found, the provider must work in partnership with the patient to explore other causes and that may include acknowledging and treating underlying psychiatric conditions.

### Midterm complications after primary obstetrical anal sphincter injury repair in France [^2dc9d4a4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Study population

We first searched for inpatient stays of women having a diagnosis of OASI (O70.2, and 070.3 codes) and a procedure of OASI suture (JMCA003, and JMCA001 code), from January 2013 to December 2021. For each woman, we only kept the first patient stay matching the inclusion criteria. Then, we excluded patient stays without any diagnosis of delivery (Z37 code). We also excluded patient stays without any procedure of delivery (JQGA002, JQGA003, JQGA004, JQGA005, JQGD001, JQGD002, JQGD003, JQGD004, JQGD005, JQGD007, JQGD008, JQGD010, JQGD012, and JQGD013 codes). The next step was the exclusion of inpatient stays with cesarean section procedures (JQGA002, JQGA003, JQGA004, and JQGA005 codes). We excluded inpatient stays with a medical termination of pregnancy or in utero fetal demise (Z371, Z373, Z374, Z376, Z377, Z3710, Z3711, Z3730, Z3731, Z3740, and Z3741 codes). At the end, we excluded women aged less than 10 or more than 75 years old.

Then, all data from the available hospital stays (during the index stay and following ones) of these women were extracted (nonprofit or for-profit hospitals, medicine surgery or obstetrics). It should be noted that, if a women encountered two OASIS during the study period, she would be included only once, at the first OASI diagnosis and repair.

### School, supervision and adolescent-sensitive clinic care: combination social protection and reduced unprotected sex among HIV-positive adolescents in South Africa [^ea53c5c4]. AIDS and Behavior (2017). Low credibility.

Measures

Unprotected sex at last sexual intercourse was measured as no condom use at most recent sexual encounter. It was dichotomised as: '1 = unprotected sex' and '0 = abstinence or protected sex'. Adolescents were coded as STI symptomatic if they reported having at least one of the following four STI symptoms: genital sores/warts, burning whilst urinating, genital itching/redness, or anal itching/soreness/bleeding, in the last 6 months, following WHO guidelines for syndromatic diagnosis of STIs. Adolescent pregnancy among girls was defined as ever having been pregnant before or during data collection, measured using an item from the National Survey of HIV and Risk Behaviour Amongst Young South Africans.

Socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, home language, housing situation, urban/rural location) were measured using items from South Africa's Census. Housing was coded as 1 = informal if the adolescent lived in a hut, rondavel (traditional home), or a shack, and 0 = formal if they lived in a brick/concrete house or apartment. Orphanhood status was coded as death of either mother or father or both.

HIV-Related Factors

Mode of infection was assessed following similar studies and modelling from Southern Africa: adolescents were coded as vertically-infected if they had started ART prior to age 12 or if they had been on treatment for more than 5 years, based on the year of widely available ART access in the study area. Adolescent's knowledge of their own HIV-positive status was determined through a stepwise process: initially healthcare providers' report, followed by confirmation by caregiver during the consent process. Additional checks on adolescent knowledge of own HIV-status were conducted using a screening on recent health and medication-taking histories to avoid unintentional disclosure. Adolescents who did not know their own HIV-positive status responded to a questionnaire on 'illness' and 'medication' instead of 'HIV' and 'antiretrovirals', respectively. Most recent viral loads were extracted from patient records for a random sub-sample (n = 266, 25%). Participants with viral load counts > 1000 copies/ml were coded as reporting virological failure using WHO standards.

### In-hospital costs associated with chronic constipation in Belgium: a retrospective database study [^d8850502]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

Population selection

The study population was selected in two steps. As a first step, hospital stays were selected based on ICD-9 diagnostic codes. Because there is no specific code in the ICD-9 nomenclature for chronic constipation, the code corresponding to constipation (564.0) was used. All adult patients (age ≥ 20 years) having that code as a principal diagnosis were retained. Due to the coding of age by ranges and the unavailability of exact ages in the HDD, 'adult' had to be defined according to the closest available age range (20 years and older).

Concomitant diagnoses (i.e. at the time of constipation-related hospitalization) corresponding to constipation-related complications were also retrieved for these patients. The constipation-related complications retained for this analysis were 'anal fissure and fistula' (ICD-9 diagnosis code 565), 'fecal impaction' (560.39), 'impaction of intestine' (560.30), 'rectal prolapse' (569.1), 'hemorrhoids' (455), or 'peri-anal thrombosis' (453.8). 'Intestinal obstruction' (560, excluding 560.30 and 560.39) was not included as ICD-9 coding does not allow obstruction resulting from constipation to be distinguished from obstruction resulting from another organic cause such as stenosis. Adult patients having constipation as a secondary diagnosis but in combination with a primary diagnosis corresponding to one of the above-mentioned constipation-related complications were also included in the study population.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Disease burden of primary biliary cholangitis and associated pruritus based on a cross-sectional US claims analysis [^e2727c63]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

We observed a low (~7%) prevalence of pruritus in the overall PBC population. This is inconsistent with the published literature that reports approximately 50% of patients are affected at any given point after a PBC diagnosis and up to 75% are affected by it over the course of their disease. The lower prevalence of pruritus we observed may indicate that pruritus is under-reported in observational electronic healthcare databases. It is also possible that physicians may have prescribed a treatment for pruritus, without recording a pruritus diagnosis (discussed further below). The low prevalence of pruritus also highlights the possibility that pruritus remains under-recorded, and diagnosis may be limited to patients with more severe presentations. Nevertheless, the prevalence of pruritus was still significantly higher in the PBC population compared with non-cases.

A key finding of this study is the increased comorbid medical burden for patients with PBC and pruritus relative to non-cases, particularly for comorbidities with a major impact on HRQoL such as psychiatric conditions (depression or anxiety) as well as fatigue and sleep-related issues. The magnitude of difference in the prevalence of these conditions was greater in the PBC-pruritus subpopulation compared with broader PBC group; for example, fatigue was up to two-fold higher in the PBC-pruritus subpopulation and 1.5-fold higher in the broader PBC population versus non-cases. These findings are in agreement with a recently published review of the literature, which concluded that pruritus, fatigue, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders are the most frequently reported symptoms that patients with PBC experience, and these symptoms have a considerable negative impact on their HRQoL. However, it should be emphasised here that comparisons between the PBC population and the PBC-pruritus subpopulation are reported only for illustrative purposes, as any apparent differences between iSPRs may be attributable to differences in population structure of the two samples; however, the age-sex structure of the PBC and PBC-pruritus groups was broadly similar. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that our conclusion that patients with PBC and pruritus have an increased comorbid medical burden may be influenced by the fact that patients with more severe presentations of pruritus may have received the L29 code for pruritus (as noted above).

### Anal adenocarcinoma: case report, literature review and comparative survival analysis [^0302e12e]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Methods

We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result (SEER18) database to identify patients with anal or rectal malignant neoplasms aged 20 years or older between 2000 and 2016. The SEER database includes data from 18 population-based registries covering approximately 26% of US patients with cancer. We used a combination ICD10 (C20.9, C21.0 and C21.1) and ICD-O-3 histological codes to identify cases of anal adenocarcinoma, rectal adenocarcinoma and anal squamous carcinoma. We excluded cases where the data on stage, grade, histology were missing and cases with more than one primary malignancy. We used the SEERStat software (V.8.1.5) to collect covariates including age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, sex, race, primary cancer site, tumour stage and grade, survival in months, cause of death, marital status, surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatments.

We compared survival using the Mantel-Haenszel Log-Rank Test. Relative HRs for death in the 5-year period following diagnosis were estimated with Cox proportional hazards. The independent effect of cancer type was assessed using a Cox model adjusted for covariates identified above. Data were analysed using SAS V.9.4 and R. The p value for significance was set at < 0.01 for a two-sided test.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### The use of core descriptors from the ENiGMA code study in recent literature: a systematic review [^458fe42b]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

The heterogeneity in data quality presented in studies regarding Crohn's anal fistula (CAF) limit extrapolation into clinical practice. The ENiGMA collaborators established a core descriptor set to standardize reporting of CAF. The aim of this work was to quantify the use of these descriptors in recent literature.

Method

We completed a systematic review of PubMed and the Cochrane Library, extracting publications from the past 10years specific to the clinical interventions and outcomes of CAF, and reported in line with PRISMA guidance. Each article was assessed for inclusion of ENiGMA descriptors. The median number of descriptors per publication was evaluated along with the overall frequency of each individual descriptor. Use of ENiGMA descriptors was compared between medical and procedural publications.

Results

Ninety publications were included. The median number of descriptors was 15 of 37; 16 descriptors were used in over half of the publications while 17 were used in fewer than a third. Descriptors were more frequently used in procedural (n = 16) than medical publications (n = 14) (p = 0.031). In procedural publications, eight descriptors were more frequently used including Faecal incontinence, Number of previous fistula interventions, Presence and severity of anorectal stenosis and Current proctitis. Medical publications were more likely to include Previous response to biological therapy and Duration and type of current course of biological therapy.

Conclusion

With many descriptors being used infrequently and variations between medical and procedural literature, the colorectal community should assess the need for all 37 descriptors.

### Inadequate response, treatment patterns, health care utilization, and associated costs in patients with ulcerative colitis: retrospective cohort study based on German claims data [^561fa43e]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Prolonged use of CS was assumed if at least 2 outpatient CS prescriptions had been observed during the observable follow-up period after the index date.

Ulcerative colitis–related hospitalizations were defined by any inpatient admission with a primary diagnosis of UC (ICD-10 code: K51.-) or UC-related complications. Ulcerative colitis–related surgeries were identified by respective inpatient and outpatient procedure codes (codes used are provided in Supplemental Table 1).

Additional end points included HCRU and SAEs leading to hospitalizations. HCRU was assessed in terms of the number of inpatient stays and related hospitalization days, the number of days absent from work, and the number of outpatient visits ordered by general practitioners (GPs), gastroenterologists, and other specialists, approximated by counted dates of invoiced codes according to the uniform evaluation scheme (Einheitlicher Bewertungsmaßstab [EBM] code). An item was defined as a UC-related HCRU if the claim was directly related to UC (ie, hospitalizations with UC as main diagnosis, outpatient visits with a documented UC diagnosis, and days absent from work due to UC). Regarding UC-related hospitalizations, the frequency of specific surgeries (ileal pouch anal anastomosis [IPAA; OPS 5–45], rectal procedure [OPS 5–46], anal procedure [OPS 5–48], and others [OPS 5–49]) was separately reported. Serious adverse events related to UC were assessed as events leading to hospital admission based on the documented main diagnosis code (ICD-GM-10) during the induction phase (first 90 days after start with an advanced therapy) and the maintenance phase (starting at 90 days after index date). Only the most frequent events are reported in this article, including anemia, primary infections, opportunistic infections, skin conditions, and rectal or anal abscesses.

### Updating allergy and / or hypersensitivity diagnostic procedures in the WHO ICD-11 revision [^ffa2aa8c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

The classification of allergy and/or hypersensitivity conditions for the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 provides the appropriate corresponding codes for allergic diseases, assuming that the final diagnosis is correct. This classification should be linked to in vitro and in vivo diagnostic procedures. Considering the impact for our specialty, we decided to review the codification of these procedures into the ICD aiming to have a baseline and to suggest changes and/or submit new proposals. For that, we prepared a list of the relevant allergy and/or hypersensitivity diagnostic procedures that health care professionals are dealing with on a daily basis. This was based on the main current guidelines and selected all possible and relevant corresponding terms from the ICD-10 (2015 version) and the ICD-11 β phase foundation (June 2015 version). More than 90% of very specific and important diagnostic procedures currently used by the allergists' community on a daily basis are missing. We observed that some concepts usually used by the allergist community on a daily basis are not fully recognized by other specialties. The whole scheme and the correspondence in the ICD-10 (2015 version) and ICD-11 foundation (June 2015 version) provided us a big picture of the missing or imprecise terms and how they are scattered in the current ICD-11 framework, allowing us to submit new proposals to increase the visibility of the allergy and/or hypersensitivity conditions and diagnostic procedures.

### Which patients with chronic pruritus are presented for psychological assessment by their dermatologists? Results from a consecutive sample [^8628d692]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Of the patients referred for a psychological assessment, 427 (76.3) were diagnosed with at least one diagnosis according to ICD‐10, chapter F. The most frequent diagnosis was 'psychological/psychosomatic co‐factors in pruritus' (F54) in 318 patients (74.5%), followed by depression (F32‐F33‐F34) (131 patients, 30.7%), adjustment disorder (F43.2) (76 patients, 17.8%), dissociative or somatoform disorder or hypochondria (F44‐F45) (48 patients, 11.2%), anxiety or compulsive disorder (F40‐F41‐F42) (28 patients, 6.6%), psychosis (F2) (9 patients, 2.1%) and other (73 patients, 17.1%). In total, 191 patients (44.7%) fulfilled criteria for more than one psychiatric/psychosomatic diagnosis.

The high percentage of psychiatric/psychosomatic diagnoses demonstrates that the dermatologist's assessment of a need for psychological referral was supported in three‐quarters of the patients. There are, however, limitations to this approach. We lack information regarding the psychiatric morbidity of the patients with CP who had not been referred for a psychological assessment and of those who originally refused a referral. Another limitation is the large amount of missing data, this impairs validity and generalisability of our results. We cannot exclude that this was as a result of the use of electronic devices, perhaps because of less acceptance by patients. On the other hand, only the use of these electronic screening devices made it possible to calculate and transfer the scores for psychological burden (DLQI and HADS) instantly to the dermatologists.

The main factors associated with a referral were female sex, number of comorbidities, chronic scratch lesions and psychological burden. It has previously been established that women with CP have more scratch lesions and a higher burden. 8 The high number of somatic comorbidities is likely because the patients with CP had a mean age of 60 years and multimorbidity is common in higher age groups. Whether the reasons for underrepresentation of male patients with CP for psychological referral might be because of their tendencies to underreport psychological burden and/or a reluctance to accept psychological referral or because dermatologists having a greater awareness of psychological problems in women cannot be deduced from our data.
