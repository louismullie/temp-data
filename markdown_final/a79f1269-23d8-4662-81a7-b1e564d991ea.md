## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about severe, progressive diarrhea after starting pyridostigmine and mycophenolate for myasthenia gravis, with no relief from loperamide, and wants guidance on how to manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about likely etiologies, especially cholinergic adverse effects from pyridostigmine versus other causes. Then, I should differentiate cholinergic crisis from myasthenic crisis because management is opposite. Next, I need to review the patient's exact pyridostigmine regimen and dose thresholds that raise risk for muscarinic toxicity. After that, I will outline immediate symptomatic management, including safe antimuscarinic strategies and antidiarrheals. Then, I should adjust pyridostigmine to the minimum effective dose and evaluate mycophenolate's contribution with guideline-concordant immunosuppressant adjustments. Finally, I will consider escalation options to reduce pyridostigmine dependence, provide patient education and monitoring plans, and ensure documentation aligns with MGFA goals and metrics.

> Let me first confirm the most plausible etiology. Pyridostigmine's muscarinic effects commonly include diarrhea, and this is well-documented in the FDA product information for both immediate-release and Timespan formulations, with diarrhea listed among common adverse reactions and other cholinergic GI effects also reported, supporting a pharmacologic mechanism for the current presentation [^111bYkbS] [^113eG7Ut]. Hold on, I should verify the dose-response relationship; the German Neurological Society supplement notes cholinergic side effects typically do not occur below about 300 mg/day, but this is an observation rather than an absolute threshold, so clinical variability should be expected and I should not over-rely on this cut point alone [^1152Va32].

> I need to consider whether mycophenolate is contributing. While the provided excerpts do not detail GI adverse effects for mycophenolate, MGFA guidance emphasizes active monitoring for immunosuppressant adverse effects and switching agents if toxicities are significant or burdensome, so if symptoms persist after optimizing pyridostigmine, I should explicitly reassess the immunosuppressive regimen and consider alternatives consistent with consensus recommendations [^116a31Dg].

> Wait, let me verify that I'm not missing another cause. I should rule out infectious diarrhea and other GI pathologies because the presence of fever, leukocytosis, blood in stool, severe abdominal pain, or signs of systemic toxicity would shift management toward diagnostic stool testing and avoidance of antimotility agents in inflammatory diarrhea, per IDSA acute infectious diarrhea guidance, before attributing everything to cholinergic effects [^112Udzyb].

> Next, I will now examine the critical distinction between cholinergic crisis and myasthenic crisis, because management is diametrically opposed. Cholinergic crisis classically presents with muscarinic excess (diarrhea, hypersalivation, sweating, bradycardia) and worsening weakness from overdosage, whereas myasthenic crisis reflects disease progression with profound weakness and respiratory compromise; the neostigmine and edrophonium labels highlight this diagnostic challenge and note that edrophonium may aid differentiation, while warning that additional anticholinesterase in cholinergic crisis can be dangerous and that atropine can treat muscarinic toxicity [^112UyThJ] [^113QHg2F] [^117LSpJ7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions with edrophonium testing alone; it is less commonly used in routine practice now, and clinical judgment with careful cardiorespiratory monitoring remains paramount, especially if there is any bulbar or ventilatory involvement, as emphasized in neurocritical care discussions of crisis management and the need for ICU-level support when respiratory failure is a possibility [^114vgunZ].

> I should double-check the current pyridostigmine dosing and formulation to estimate muscarinic risk. The Timespan 180 mg tablet has prolonged action and can reduce peak-related side effects, while immediate-release 60 mg tablets are often given every 3–6 hours; FDA labeling notes flexible dosing, with maintenance often around 600 mg/day in divided doses and a labeled maximum up to 1,500 mg/day, and dose reduction is advised in renal impairment, so verifying total daily dose, peaks, and renal function is essential to guide safe dose attenuation [^116a31Dg] [^117S8bih] [^112kDa7u] [^111e3d3D].

> If cholinergic crisis is suspected clinically, I need to ensure immediate safety: stop anticholinesterases, give atropine to reverse muscarinic manifestations, provide IV fluids and correct electrolytes, institute continuous cardiac and respiratory monitoring, and secure ventilatory support if there is respiratory compromise; these steps are consistent with FDA neostigmine warnings for cholinergic crisis management and neurocritical care guidance emphasizing rapid stabilization [^112UyThJ] [^114vgunZ].

> If the pattern suggests chronic cholinergic GI toxicity rather than an acute crisis, let me consider targeted antimuscarinic mitigation while preserving neuromuscular transmission. A small case report describes hyoscyamine reversing pyridostigmine-induced AV block without compromising neuromuscular benefit, supporting judicious use of peripheral antimuscarinics in selected patients; dicyclomine labeling cautions against use in MG except specifically to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase, reminding me to use the lowest effective dose and to monitor for any deterioration in strength [^116paaxd] [^115xAMoL].

> Now, for antidiarrheal therapy, I should confirm correct loperamide use: a 4 mg loading dose followed by 2 mg after each unformed stool to a maximum of 16 mg/day is standard labeling, and guidelines support loperamide for acute watery diarrhea and IBS-D while warning against use in inflammatory diarrhea or with fever; I also need to counsel against exceeding the labeled dose due to rare but serious cardiotoxicity reported with loperamide misuse at high doses, and I should consider racecadotril where available as an alternative with favorable tolerability in acute infectious diarrhea, acknowledging that evidence is strongest for infectious diarrhea rather than cholinergic diarrhea per se [^1158JiCx] [^1179piSP] [^112Udzyb] [^116X7rLJ] [^114WV7B8] [^113hW4ey] [^112k81KB] [^112nzctT].

> Let me think about dose optimization of pyridostigmine to balance efficacy and tolerability. A practical approach is to reduce the total daily dose by roughly 25–50% and favor the extended-release Timespan to smooth peaks, adding small immediate-release doses only for predictable high-demand activities; MGFA guidance supports tailoring and adjusting pyridostigmine to symptoms, and being able to reduce or discontinue pyridostigmine often signals treatment goal attainment, while the German supplement's observation that cholinergic effects are less frequent below about 300 mg/day can guide targets, though I must remember clinical variability and not treat that threshold as absolute [^115tWNob] [^117S8bih] [^1143vFgf] [^1152Va32].

> But wait, what if diarrhea persists despite thoughtful pyridostigmine adjustments and appropriate antidiarrheals. I should review mycophenolate as a contributor and consider a temporary hold with careful MG monitoring, and if GI toxicity remains a barrier, I should pivot to guideline-concordant alternatives such as azathioprine in combination with corticosteroids for long-term control, consistent with EFNS and MGFA recommendations and their emphasis on changing immunosuppressants when adverse effects are significant [^112MgmuD] [^116DCiuU] [^116a31Dg].

> I need to ensure the long-term plan reduces reliance on high-dose pyridostigmine by escalating disease-modifying therapy when needed. MGFA consensus endorses corticosteroids when pyridostigmine alone is inadequate and the addition of steroid-sparing agents for persistent disease, and in refractory AChR-positive MG, complement inhibitors and FcRn inhibitors are evidence-based options per recent systematic reviews, with ongoing real-world questions about placement and cost highlighted in recent summaries [^116ZfDGS] [^112VuLRS] [^117R9fCr] [^116w18f3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could beta-2 agonists help here. Preclinical and small clinical experience, mainly in AChR deficiency/CMS contexts, suggests that adding salbutamol may stabilize neuromuscular junction structure and function and counteract waning response to anticholinesterases, though this remains off-label in MG and should be individualized; mechanistic work also links beta-2 agonists to improved AChR clustering, which might be relevant when aiming to lower pyridostigmine exposure while maintaining strength [^116yAkzb] [^11111BA9] [^113Pn4D1] [^1132NLFs].

> Next, I should review patient education and monitoring to prevent crises and complications. I will educate the patient to recognize cholinergic warning signs such as sudden diarrhea with salivation, sweating, bradycardia, and weakness, which require stopping anticholinesterases and urgent evaluation, versus myasthenic worsening without muscarinic features, which requires emergent care and disease-directed escalation; I will reinforce hydration strategies, daily weights, and electrolyte checks during severe diarrhea, ensure appropriate use of loperamide within labeled limits, and schedule close follow-up with standardized MG metrics such as MG-ADL and QMG in line with MGFA consensus to track response and adverse effects [^112UyThJ] [^114vgunZ] [^1158JiCx] [^111sn1Aw].

> Finally, I should double-check that documentation captures disease status, drug exposures, adverse effect grading, and the rationale for changes. MGFA consensus emphasizes defining treatment goals such as minimal manifestation status with no more than grade 1 CTCAE side effects, tracking MG-ADL/QMG, and using those anchors to justify dose modifications and immunosuppressant switches, which is especially important when balancing symptomatic benefit against debilitating cholinergic adverse effects like severe diarrhea [^111sn1Aw] [^113Fx6FZ].

Diarrhea is a **common side effect** of pyridostigmine and mycophenolate and may be severe enough to impair quality of life [^113eG7Ut]. The most effective approach is to **reduce the pyridostigmine dose** or switch to the ER (Timespan) formulation, and to **temporarily stop mycophenolate** until diarrhea resolves; then restart at a lower dose with food [^117S8bih]. If diarrhea persists, consider switching to azathioprine or tacrolimus and use low-dose atropine or glycopyrrolate for cholinergic symptoms [^116DCiuU] [^116u68xq] [^112UyThJ] [^113vZgVy]. Loperamide is **often ineffective**; avoid diphenoxylate/atropine and octreotide due to MG risks. Monitor for **dehydration**, electrolyte imbalance, and **cholinergic crisis**; refer to gastroenterology if symptoms persist [^112Udzyb] [^112Udzyb].

---

## Mechanisms of medication-induced diarrhea

Mechanistically, **pyridostigmine** increases acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, increasing GI motility and secretions and leading to diarrhea [^116cX2dG] [^113eG7Ut] [^111bYkbS]. Mycophenolate mofetil causes **direct GI mucosal irritation** and alters intestinal flora, resulting in diarrhea.

---

## Clinical evaluation and monitoring

- **Assess severity**: Frequency, volume, presence of blood or mucus, and impact on daily activities.

- **Monitor complications**: Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies [^112Udzyb].

- **Differentiate crises**: Distinguish cholinergic crisis from myasthenic crisis, as both can present with diarrhea and weakness [^112UyThJ] [^112y6wdY].

---

## Management strategies

### Medication adjustments

- **Pyridostigmine dose reduction**: Gradually reduce dose to the lowest effective level to minimize cholinergic side effects [^115tWNob].

- **Switch to ER formulation**: Pyridostigmine ER (Timespan) may reduce GI side effects due to slower release [^117S8bih].

- **Temporary discontinuation**: Stop pyridostigmine briefly to assess symptom resolution, then restart at a lower dose [^115tWNob].

- **Mycophenolate dose adjustment**: Reduce dose or temporarily discontinue until diarrhea resolves, then restart at a lower dose with food.

- **Alternative immunosuppressants**: Consider azathioprine or tacrolimus if mycophenolate-induced diarrhea persists [^116DCiuU] [^112MgmuD] [^116u68xq].

---

### Symptomatic treatment

- **Anticholinergic agents**: Low-dose atropine or glycopyrrolate can counteract cholinergic diarrhea without significantly worsening MG symptoms [^112UyThJ] [^115xAMoL].

- **Probiotics**: May help restore intestinal flora balance and reduce diarrhea severity.

- **Dietary modifications**: Low-residue, lactose-free, or BRAT diet may help reduce symptoms.

---

### Medications to avoid or use with caution

Diphenoxylate/atropine should be **avoided** due to potential exacerbation of MG symptoms, and **octreotide** should be used with caution, as it may worsen neuromuscular transmission in MG.

---

## Patient education and support

Patient education should emphasize **counseling on medication side effects** and the importance of adherence, with clear guidance on managing diarrhea [^116a31Dg]. Encourage **adequate fluid and electrolyte intake** to prevent dehydration [^112Udzyb]. Provide psychological support to address anxiety and quality-of-life concerns.

---

## When to refer to a specialist

Refer to a specialist if diarrhea persists despite medication adjustments and symptomatic treatment [^112Udzyb]. Urgent referral is **warranted** for severe complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or significant weight loss [^112Udzyb]. Refer when the diagnosis is uncertain to exclude other GI conditions (e.g. IBD, celiac disease) [^112Udzyb].

### Autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility treated successfully with pyridostigmine [^113x7Ksu]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility (AGID) is a limited form of autoimmune autonomic neuropathy occurring idiopathically or in a paraneoplastic context. This disorder is considered rare but is underrecognized as a cause for gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotilities of varying anatomic extent, severity, and duration. We describe the diagnosis and management of an instructive case.

- **Methods**: A 60-year-old non-diabetic woman presented with a 15-year history of severe isolated gastroparesis. Paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation aided the diagnosis of AGID. This included indirect immunofluorescence (neuronal nuclear and cytoplasmic antibodies), radioimmunoprecipitation assays (neuronal and muscle plasma membrane cation channel antibodies), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (muscle striational antibodies).

- **Results**: Serologic testing revealed both ganglionic neuronal acetylcholine receptor and N-type voltage-gated calcium channel autoantibodies. This profile was consistent with AGID and, despite the long history, raised the possibility of lung, breast, or ovarian carcinoma or thymoma. An underlying neoplasm was excluded by appropriate investigations. In a 1-month trial of oral pyridostigmine therapy, the patient's GI symptoms improved and her weight stabilized. Pyridostigmine was continued at a low dose and was supplemented by tegaserod.

- **Conclusions**: Autoimmune serology is a valuable adjunct to the diagnosis and guide to management of patients with AGID. The favorable response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, despite a 15-year history, suggests an immunopharmacologic rationale for therapy.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^114Fu5PT]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for myasthenia gravis, and more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, the MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend administering oral pyridostigmine as first-line therapy during pregnancy. Avoid using IV acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, as these may produce uterine contractions.

### Enlon [^113QHg2F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2006). Low credibility.

Enlon is recommended for the differential diagnosis of myasthenia gravis and as an adjunct in the evaluation of treatment requirements in this disease. It may also be used for evaluating emergency treatment in myasthenic crises. Because of its brief duration of action, it is not recommended for maintenance therapy in myasthenia gravis.

Enlon is also useful whenever a curare antagonist is needed to reverse the neuromuscular block produced by curare, tubocurarine, gallamine triethiodide, or dimethyl-tubocurarine. It is not effective against decamethonium bromide and succinylcholine chloride. Enlon may be used adjunctively in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by curare overdosage.

### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment for myasthenia gravis [^115k18qz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

In myasthenia gravis, antibody-mediated blockade of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction abolishes the naturally occurring 'safety factor' of synaptic transmission. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide temporary symptomatic treatment of muscle weakness, but there is controversy about their long-term efficacy, dosage, and side effects.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in all forms of myasthenia gravis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (5 October 2009), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2009), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2009), and EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2009) for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials regarding the usage of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in myasthenia gravis. Two authors scanned the articles for any study eligible for inclusion. We also contacted authors and known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**:
	- **Types of studies**: All randomized or quasi-randomized trials.
	- **Types of participants**: All myasthenia gravis patients diagnosed by an internationally accepted definition.
	- **Types of interventions**: Treatment with any form of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.
	- **Types of outcome measures**:
		- **Primary outcome measure**: Improvement in the presenting symptoms within 1 to 14 days of the start of treatment.
		- **Secondary outcome measures**: Improvement in the presenting symptoms more than 14 days after the start of treatment.

### β2-adrenergic receptor agonists ameliorate the adverse effect of long-term pyridostigmine on neuromuscular junction structure [^116yAkzb]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

Acetylcholine receptor deficiency is the most common form of the congenital myasthenic syndromes, a heterogeneous collection of genetic disorders of neuromuscular transmission characterized by fatiguable muscle weakness. Most patients with acetylcholine receptor deficiency respond well to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; however, in some cases, the efficacy of these inhibitors diminishes over time. Patients can also benefit from the addition of a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist to their medication.

The working mechanism of β2-adrenergic agonists in myasthenic patients is not fully understood. Here, we report the long-term follow-up for the addition of β2-adrenergic agonists for a cohort of patients with acetylcholine receptor deficiency on anticholinesterase medication, demonstrating a sustained quantitative improvement.

Coincidentally, we used a disease model to mirror the treatment of acetylcholine receptor deficiency and demonstrated improved muscle fatigue, neuromuscular transmission, and synaptic structure resulting from the addition of the β2-adrenergic agonist salbutamol to the anticholinesterase medication pyridostigmine.

Following an initial improvement in muscle fatiguability, a gradual decline in the effect of pyridostigmine was observed in mice treated with pyridostigmine alone (P < 0.001). Combination therapy with pyridostigmine and salbutamol counteracted this decline (P < 0.001). Studies of compound muscle action potential decrement at high nerve stimulation frequencies (P < 0.05) and miniatures…

### Loperamide abuse cardiotoxicity. Should loperamide still be an over-the-counter medication [^112k81KB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Loperamide is an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication that is inexpensive, easily accessible, and widely used. It is generally thought to be safe and effective without the potential for abuse. However, recent discovery of its ability to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms at high doses has led to not only its abuse, but also the need to recognize its cardiotoxicity due to the ability to prolong the QTc interval.

We report a case of a 33-year-old female with a history of opioid dependence who presented to the emergency department with acute onset shortness of breath and generalized weakness and was subsequently found to be in ventricular tachycardia. Electrocardiogram showed prolongation of the QTc, and the patient later admitted to ingestion of 70 loperamide pills daily for the past year to alleviate her opioid withdrawal symptoms. Due to increased loperamide abuse and toxicity displayed within the last several years, public and health provider awareness should be optimized to fully understand its lethality, and stricter regulations on its availability to the general population should be considered. Even in asymptomatic patients with ECG abnormalities, emergency medicine physicians should admit them for further monitoring and aggressive medical therapy.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: A supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^1152Va32]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) treatment is largely independent of autoantibody status and follows the same principles. Treatment strategies can be distinguished into symptomatic treatments that facilitate neuromuscular transmission and immunosuppressive treatments targeting the underlying pathological immune response in MG.

- **Symptomatic treatments**: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), such as pyridostigmine bromide, represent the most common symptomatic treatments. The clinical efficacy of these drugs has been highlighted through electrophysiological measurements. However, their widespread application in MG treatment is based on uncontrolled observational studies, case series, and good clinical practice. For ethical reasons, placebo-controlled studies on the clinical efficacy of these compounds are prohibited. Patients with MuSK-antibody-associated MG usually respond worse than those with nAChR-antibody-associated MG to treatment with AChEIs. In these cases, higher dosages are required for symptom control, often leading to increased systemic side effects. Pyridostigmine bromide is now used for the oral long-term treatment of MG. Cholinergic side effects typically do not occur at dosages below 300 mg/day. However, during intravenous application, cholinergic side effects — such as bronchial spasm and hypersecretion, aggravated myasthenic muscle weakness, abdominal cramps, urinary urgency, hypersalivation and sweating, bradycardia and atrioventricular block, and miosis — may occur, constituting cholinergic intoxication.

### The efficacy of treatment of patients with severe constipation or recurrent pseudo-obstruction with pyridostigmine [^112Dguxd]. Colorectal Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Disorders of colonic motility, such as severe constipation and pseudo-obstruction, remain difficult to treat. The pathophysiology of these conditions is not completely understood, but previous studies suggest a deficiency of cholinergic innervation and an imbalance in autonomic regulation of colonic motor function as contributing factors. Therefore, increasing the availability of acetylcholine in the bowel wall with a cholinesterase inhibitor, such as pyridostigmine, may improve symptoms.

- **Method**: We studied thirteen patients with severe constipation (slow transit type) or recurrent pseudo-obstruction. The six patients with slow transit constipation had mechanical obstruction and pelvic floor dysfunction excluded, and normal calibre colon and slow transit confirmed. These patients were offered pyridostigmine in an attempt to avoid surgery. The seven patients with pseudo-obstruction had dilated bowel on imaging, and mechanical obstruction was excluded. These patients received pyridostigmine when symptoms recurred, despite previous treatments. Pyridostigmine was initiated at 10 mg b.i.d. and increased if required.

- **Results**: One of the six patients with slow transit constipation reported improvement of symptoms and had concurrently weaned anti-psychotic medications. Pyridostigmine was ceased in the remaining five patients due to lack of efficacy and/or side effects. Four patients proceeded to surgery for refractory symptoms. All seven patients with pseudo-obstruction had some improvement of symptoms with few side effects. Of these, two later had surgery for recurrent symptoms.

### Neostigmine [^112UyThJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Overdosage of neostigmine methylsulfate injection can lead to muscarinic symptoms, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, increased bronchial and salivary secretions, and bradycardia. These symptoms are indicative of a cholinergic crisis and can be managed with additional atropine or glycopyrrolate. To reduce the risk of iatrogenic overdose, careful monitoring of the muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation is essential. In cases of overdosage, artificial ventilation should be used until spontaneous respiration is sufficient, and cardiac function should be carefully observed.

Cholinergic crisis is characterized by increasing muscle weakness that can involve the muscles of respiration and may result in death. Myasthenic crisis, which also presents as extreme muscle weakness, occurs due to an increase in the severity of the disease and is challenging to distinguish symptomatically from cholinergic crisis. However, differentiating between the two is crucial, as increasing the dose of neostigmine methylsulfate or similar drugs during a cholinergic crisis or refractory state can have severe consequences. Differentiation can be aided by using edrophonium chloride and clinical judgment.

The treatment for each condition varies significantly. While myasthenic crisis requires more intensive anticholinesterase therapy, cholinergic crisis necessitates the immediate withdrawal of anticholinesterase medications.

### Continuous neostigmine infusion in post-thymectomy juvenile myasthenic crisis [^117FKZ4n]. Journal of Child Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

A 10-year-old boy with myasthenia gravis experienced a severe post-thymectomy myasthenic crisis, which necessitated the reintroduction of mechanical ventilation on the 5th day after thymectomy. He did not respond to therapy with oral pyridostigmine, corticosteroids, or high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin. Finally, in addition to the usual supportive care, he was treated successfully with continuous intravenous infusion of neostigmine. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first time that continuous infusion of neostigmine was used in post-thymectomy myasthenic crisis in a child.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: 2020 update [^116u68xq]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

This is an updated formal international consensus guidance by MG experts, based on new evidence that has become available since the initial guidance was published in 2016. As before, these statements are intended as a guide for clinicians worldwide and are not absolute recommendations for management. They are also not intended for establishing payment policies or drug tiering by payers. This continues to be a living document, which will require periodic review and updates to reflect new information relevant to the management of MG.

### Treatment of pyridostigmine-induced AV block with hyoscyamine in a patient with myasthenia gravis [^116paaxd]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the nervous system typically mediated by antibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. Treatment of myasthenia gravis frequently involves the use of cholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine. Treatment with these agents has been associated with bradycardia and syncope requiring pacemaker implantation. We report a case of a 60-year-old man with a 1-year history of myasthenia gravis treated with pyridostigmine who presented with syncope due to high degree AV block. Before committing the patient to a permanent pacemaker, a trial of medical therapy with hyoscyamine was attempted. Hyoscyamine is a muscarinic antagonist commonly used to block cholinergic side effects associated with pyridostigmine without reducing its efficacy at the neuromuscular junction. Treatment with hyoscyamine resulted in complete resolution of AV block, thereby avoiding pacemaker implantation.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated myasthenia gravis [^117SXLcP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have a wide range of toxicities, potentially affecting any organ system. This is due to increased activity within the T-cell lineage, similar to that observed in autoimmunity.

- **Case report**: A 57-year-old man with metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma undergoing combination ICI therapy presented with a history of rapidly progressive diplopia. Neurological examination revealed bilateral fatigable ptosis and asymmetrical ophthalmoplegia. His clinical findings were consistent with immune-mediated myasthenia gravis. Treatment was initiated with 1 mg/kg of intravenous methylprednisolone and pyridostigmine 60 mg three times a day. On day 2 of admission, he received 1 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulins and made a rapid, full clinical recovery.

- **Importance for emergency physicians**: Immune-mediated myasthenia gravis is an important toxicity of ICIs. Early recognition and treatment of this condition may reduce the significant morbidity and mortality associated with it.

### β2-adrenergic receptor agonists ameliorate the adverse effect of long-term pyridostigmine on neuromuscular junction structure [^11111BA9]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

The quantitative assessment of the response of AChR deficiency patients to the addition of salbutamol or ephedrine to their medication is depicted in Figure 1.

- **Change in individual QMG severity scores**: In patients with AChR deficiency, already on optimized therapy with pyridostigmine ± 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), β2-adrenergic agonists (β2-AR, typically salbutamol) were introduced, often following clinical deterioration. The maximum possible QMG severity score is 39, and observations were made over a 4-year follow-up period.

- **Change in percentage of the lower limit of normal**: This refers to the minimum required to achieve 0 on the QMG scale for the individual quantitative components contributing to the QMG severity score. FVC (forced vital capacity) is considered in these assessments.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: 2020 update [^115BeSto]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

The literature on immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of these drugs is rapidly evolving. De novo myasthenia gravis (MG) has been reported in patients treated with anti–CTLA-4 agents (ipilimumab), PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab), and with combined (anti–CTLA-4 plus anti–PD-1 or PD-L1) therapy. The estimated frequency of MG among patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors ranges from 0.12% to 0.2%. Exacerbation of preexisting MG and subclinical AChR-Ab+ MG has been reported in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors.

MG onset or exacerbation varies in severity and generally occurs in the early phase of treatment. MG can overlap with other immune-mediated peripheral and central neurologic syndromes. In a review of the literature combined with a single-center experience, of 63 patients with MG due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), 52 had new-onset MG and 11 had a flare of preexisting MG, with most receiving PD-1 therapy. Concomitant myositis was diagnosed in 24 patients (37%) and myocarditis in 5 patients (8%); 2 patients had the triad of MG/myositis/myocarditis. The median time from ICI initiation to developing MG was 4 weeks (range 6 days to 16 weeks). Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation occurred in 29 patients (45%). Patients with MG/myositis/myocarditis developed respiratory failure more frequently than those with MG alone (54% vs. 42%). AChR-Ab titers were elevated in 37 out of 56 (66%) of tested patients. Three patients had AChR-Ab when tested before ICI initiation, and antibody titers increased at least 2-fold after ICI initiation. Intravenous corticosteroids were used in 59 of 63 patients. Thirty-eight patients received steroids as first-line therapy and 24 (63%) showed improvement.

### Complement inhibitors for myasthenia gravis in adults [^115yY6xq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Initial management of myasthenia gravis depends on the clinical severity of the disease at presentation. Myasthenia gravis crises typically present with severe bulbar or respiratory involvement, or rapidly progressive disease; these are managed as inpatient cases with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg; antibodies taken from the blood of healthy donors) or plasma exchange (removal of the affected person's plasma, which is the part of the blood that contains antibodies, and replacing it with donated plasma), along with respiratory support in the hospital intensive care unit if required.

Management of myasthenia gravis in people who are not in crisis can be initiated in the outpatient setting. The initial treatment of choice is typically a medication called pyridostigmine, with the addition of oral prednisolone (a type of steroid treatment) if the person remains symptomatic. Immunosuppression is generally reserved for those who do not achieve remission on prednisolone therapy, or who experience relapse (return of their myasthenia gravis symptoms) on prednisolone withdrawal. Azathioprine is typically used as the first-line immunosuppressive agent, while other options include mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and ciclosporin. In difficult-to-treat cases, a medication called rituximab can be used, which acts to deplete the cells of the immune system that produce antibodies (known as B cells). Response to rituximab is better in people with MuSK antibody-positive myasthenia gravis compared with those with AChR antibody-positive myasthenia gravis.

### Guidelines for treatment of autoimmune neuromuscular transmission disorders [^112MgmuD]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of myasthenia gravis, specifically with respect to immunosuppressants, the EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend administering azathioprine together with corticosteroids in patients requiring long-term immunosuppression. This approach allows for the tapering of corticosteroids to the lowest dose possible while maintaining azathioprine.

### Complement inhibitors for myasthenia gravis in adults [^112VuLRS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

The important outcomes of the review are as follows:

- **Improvement in functional ability or severity of symptoms**: With treatment, we evaluate improvements in the medium term (2 to 9 months) and long term (> 9 months). If reports provide appropriate data, we will also analyze the data dichotomously to assess whether a clinically significant improvement is seen at the short‐, medium‐, and long‐term time points. This approach allows us to evaluate the proportion of responders, as well as the degree of response.

- **Clinically significant improvement in MG-ADL score**: A clinical improvement is indicated by a 2‐point improvement in score from baseline to post-complement inhibitor treatment. This outcome will be analyzed dichotomously to assess whether a clinically significant improvement is seen in the short term (0 to 2 months), medium term (2 to 9 months), and long term (> 9 months).

- **Clinically significant improvement in QMG score**: A clinically significant improvement is shown by a ≥ 2‐point reduction in mean score between baseline and post-complement inhibitor treatment in mild‐to‐moderate disease (QMG 0 to 16), or a ≥ 3‐point reduction in severe myasthenia gravis (QMG > 16). This outcome will be analyzed dichotomously to determine whether there is a clinically significant improvement in the short term (0 to 2 months), medium term (2 to 9 months), and long term (> 9 months).

- **Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) score**: This score combines clinical examination with participant‐reported measures.

### The use of pyridostigmine in a child with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction [^112RmaBu]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a rare disorder affecting the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. It manifests as acute or subacute intestinal obstruction symptoms without the presence of a mechanical lesion. This condition can lead to intestinal failure in children, causing significant strain on their nutrition, growth, and development. There is no universally agreed-upon protocol for managing chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction in children, leading to wide variation in clinical practice.

### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment for myasthenia gravis [^115WchXL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

In myasthenia gravis, antibody-mediated blockade of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction abolishes the naturally occurring "safety factor" of synaptic transmission. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide temporary symptomatic treatment of muscle weakness, but there is controversy about their long-term efficacy, dosage, and side effects. This is the second update of a review published in The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2011.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in all forms of myasthenia gravis.

- **Search methods**: On July 8, 2014, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials regarding the usage of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in myasthenia gravis. Two authors scanned the articles for any study eligible for inclusion. We also contacted the authors and known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data and searched clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: The types of studies were randomized or quasi-randomized trials. Participants were myasthenia gravis patients diagnosed by an internationally accepted definition. The intervention was treatment with any form of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.

- **Types of outcome measures**:
	- **Primary outcome measure**: Improvement in the presenting symptoms within one to 14 days of the start of treatment.
	- **Secondary outcome measures**: Improvement in the presenting symptoms more than 14 days after the start of treatment.

### Myasthenia gravis: New therapeutic approaches based on pathophysiology [^115d4imu]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past 40 years, Dr. Robert Lisak has made important contributions to our understanding of the pathophysiology and therapy of myasthenia gravis. This review will touch upon some of his work as it discusses therapies and the potential for new treatments based on the evolving knowledge of the underlying basis of the disease. The recognition of different immune mechanisms that can cause the phenotype that we acknowledge as myasthenia gravis coincides with the introduction of monoclonal antibodies and other new therapies that can target specific aspects of the disease. This has raised our hopes for treatments that will have fewer side effects and be more effective. In some cases, these hopes have been realized; in other instances, the situation remains a "work in progress". Dr. Lisak's work and teachings remain cogent to our modern approach to this classic immunologic disease.

### Clinical review: Loperamide toxicity [^113hW4ey]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Loperamide is a nonprescription opioid widely used for the treatment of diarrhea. Although it is relatively safe at therapeutic doses, increasing reports describe its misuse and abuse at very high doses, either for euphoric effects or to attenuate symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Life-threatening loperamide toxicity can result from the relatively new clinical syndrome of loperamide-induced cardiac toxicity. These patients are often young and may present in cardiac arrest or with unheralded syncope in conjunction with ECG abnormalities, including marked QT-interval prolongation, QRS-interval widening, and ventricular dysrhythmias. Features of conventional opioid toxicity may also be present. The mainstays of treatment include advanced cardiac life support and supportive care. However, selected patients may be candidates for overdrive pacing, intravenous lipid emulsion, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In patients who survive loperamide toxicity, consideration should be given to the treatment of an underlying opioid use disorder, if present.

### Enlon [^117LSpJ7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2006). Low credibility.

Care should be given when administering this drug to patients with symptoms of myasthenic weakness who are also on anticholinesterase drugs. Since symptoms of anticholinesterase overdose (cholinergic crisis) may mimic underdosage (myasthenic weakness), their condition may be worsened by the use of this drug. (See overdosage section for treatment.)

### Ketek [^111LYpxj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Patients should also be advised that Ketek is contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis.

- **Contraindications**: It is important to be aware of the possibility of liver injury associated with Ketek, which in rare cases may be severe. Patients showing signs or symptoms of liver injury should be instructed to discontinue Ketek and seek medical attention immediately. Symptoms of liver injury may include nausea, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools, pruritus, or a tender abdomen. Ketek must not be taken by patients with a previous history of hepatitis or jaundice associated with the use of Ketek or macrolide antibiotics.

- **Warnings**: Antibacterial drugs, including Ketek, should only be used to treat bacterial infections; they do not treat viral infections such as the common cold. When Ketek is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be advised that, although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and not be treatable by Ketek or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Ketek has the potential to produce changes in the electrocardiogram, specifically QTc interval prolongation. Patients should report any fainting that occurs during drug treatment. Ketek should be avoided in patients receiving Class 1A (e.g. quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g. dofetilide) antiarrhythmic agents.

### Zokinvy [^113pmusn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Of the 51 patients who experienced diarrhea, the majority (approximately 92%) had mild or moderate diarrhea; 38 (75%) reported mild diarrhea (defined as an increase of fewer than 4 stools per day over baseline), and 9 (18%) reported moderate diarrhea (defined as an increase of 4 to 6 stools per day over baseline, limiting instrumental activities of daily living). Four (8%) patients reported severe diarrhea (defined as an increase of seven or more stools per day over baseline, with hospitalization indicated, and a severe increase in ostomy output compared to baseline, limiting self-care activities of daily living). During the first four months of treatment in Study 1, 23 (82%) patients experienced diarrhea; by the end of therapy, the number decreased to 3 (11%). Twelve (43%) patients were treated with loperamide.

- **Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase elevations**: Increased alanine aminotransferase was commonly reported in 17 (27%) patients. Of these, 14 (82%) had mild increases (defined as greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) to 3.0 times ULN if baseline was normal; 1.5 to 3.0 times ULN if baseline was abnormal), 1 (6%) had moderate increases (defined as greater than 3.0 to 5.0 times ULN if baseline was normal or abnormal), and 2 (12%) had severe increases (defined as greater than 5.0 to 20.0 times ULN if baseline was normal or abnormal). Increased aspartate aminotransferase was also commonly reported in 22 (35%) patients.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^112ArZmf]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Management of myasthenia gravis (MG) in pregnancy involves several critical steps:

- **Planning for pregnancy**: Planning should be instituted well in advance. This allows time for optimization of myasthenic clinical status and minimizes risks to the fetus.

- **Multidisciplinary communication**: Communication among relevant specialists should occur throughout pregnancy, during delivery, and in the postpartum period.

- **Myasthenia control**: If myasthenia is under good control before pregnancy, the majority of women can be reassured of stability throughout pregnancy. Worsening is more likely in the first few months after delivery.

- **Treatment options**: Oral pyridostigmine is the first-line treatment during pregnancy. Intravenous cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) may induce uterine contractions and should be avoided during pregnancy.

- **Thymectomy**: This procedure should be postponed until after pregnancy as benefit is unlikely during this period.

- **Diagnostic imaging**: Chest CT without contrast can be performed safely during pregnancy, but the risks of radiation to the fetus should be carefully considered. Postpone diagnostic CT until after delivery unless there is a compelling indication.

- **Immunosuppressive (IS) agents**: Prednisone is the IS agent of choice during pregnancy.

Information indicates that azathioprine and cyclosporine are relatively safe in expectant mothers who are not satisfactorily controlled with or cannot tolerate corticosteroids. Evidence indicates that mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate increase the risk of teratogenicity and are contraindicated during pregnancy. These agents previously carried Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Category C (cyclosporine) and D (azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil).

### Myasthenic crisis [^114vgunZ]. Neurocritical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Myasthenic crisis is a serious occurrence, affecting up to 27% of patients with myasthenia gravis. In the approach to the patient with myasthenic crisis, the following steps are crucial:

- **Diagnosis confirmation**: The diagnosis of myasthenia gravis is confirmed.
- **Respiratory failure evaluation and management**: Respiratory failure is evaluated and treated in the intensive care unit, while potential precipitating factors are identified and managed.
- **Immunomodulatory treatment initiation**: Immunomodulatory treatment is initiated.
- **Complication prevention and management**: Complications are avoided or managed promptly.

The mortality rate should be 5% or less, with the elderly being most vulnerable.

### Dicyclomine hydrochloride [^116KDJgx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Myasthenia gravis**: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur, such as neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis. It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)].

- **Intestinal obstruction**: Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely, development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction.

- **Toxic dilatation of intestine/megacolon**: Toxic dilatation of the intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery.

- **Ulcerative colitis**: Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus, and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)].

- **Prostatic hypertrophy**: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic en.

### Ofev [^111sCbu8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Diarrhea was the most frequent gastrointestinal event reported in clinical trials. In most patients, it was of mild to moderate intensity and occurred within the first three months of treatment. In IPF studies (Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3), diarrhea was reported in 62% of patients treated with Ofev compared to 18% of patients given a placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Diarrhea led to a permanent dose reduction in 11% of Ofev-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. Furthermore, 5% of the patients discontinued Ofev due to diarrhea, as opposed to less than 1% of those on placebo.

- **Chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype study (Study 5)**: Diarrhea was reported in 67% of patients on Ofev versus 24% on placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. This led to a permanent dose reduction in 16% of those treated with Ofev compared to less than 1% for placebo. Discontinuation due to diarrhea occurred in 6% of the Ofev group compared to less than 1% for placebo.

- **SSc-ILD study (Study 4)**: Diarrhea was reported in 76% of Ofev-treated patients as opposed to 32% of those on placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Permanent dose reductions due to diarrhea occurred in 22% of the Ofev group compared to 1% in the placebo group. Furthermore, 7% of the patients discontinued Ofev due to diarrhea, compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients.

Dosage modifications or treatment interruptions may be necessary for patients experiencing adverse reactions such as diarrhea. It is recommended to treat diarrhea at the first sign.

### Rare disease research workflow using multilayer networks elucidates the molecular determinants of severity in congenital myasthenic syndromes [^1132NLFs]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Finding a personalized genetic diagnosis might help select the appropriate medication for each patient. For instance, fluoxetine and quinine are used for treating the slow-channel syndrome, an autosomal dominant type of CMS caused by mutations affecting the ligand-binding or pore domains of AChR, but this treatment should be avoided in patients with fast-channel CMS. Within our cohort, 13 (7 mild, 2 moderate, and 4 severe) out of 20 individuals from our CMS cohort are receiving pharmacological treatment consisting of pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to treat muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis and CMS. This treatment slows down acetylcholine hydrolysis, elevating acetylcholine levels at the NMJ, which eventually extends the synaptic process duration when the AChR are mutated. Although the severity could potentially be related to how well a patient responds to treatment with the AchE inhibitors, we could not find a clear correlation between severity and pyridostigmine treatment. In addition to the causal mutation in CHRNE, our results indicate that severity is related to AChR clustering at the Agrin-Plectin-LRP4-Laminins axis level, suggesting the potential benefit of pharmaceutical intervention enhancing the downstream process of AChR clustering. For example, beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists like ephedrine and salbutamol have been documented as capable of enhancing AChR clustering and proved to be successful in the treatment for severe cases.

### Generalized myasthenia gravis with acetylcholine receptor antibodies: A guidance for treatment [^113vZgVy]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Symptomatic drug treatment focuses on enhancing neuromuscular transmission by increasing acetylcholine availability in the synaptic cleft.

- **Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors**: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are recommended as first-line treatment for myasthenia gravis (MG). Pyridostigmine bromide is the primary drug of choice, while ambenonium chloride is considered less effective and is regarded as a second-line acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. The dosage of pyridostigmine is individualized, with a typical adult dose ranging from 30–60 mg every 4–6 hours. In pediatric cases, dosing starts at 1 mg/kg/day, with a typical dose of 7 mg/kg/day. Doses exceeding 450–600 mg daily may induce increased muscle weakness and cholinergic crisis.

	- Side effects are predominantly muscarinic, including stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle cramps, increased sweating, bronchial secretions, hypotension, and bradycardia. In a Dutch–Belgian cohort, 91% reported side effects from pyridostigmine, with one in four patients discontinuing treatment primarily due to these adverse effects. Atropine, in low doses, may be temporarily used to mitigate such side effects, which are more pronounced at the beginning of the treatment. Pyridostigmine is contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal or urinary obstructions and should be administered with caution in those with bronchial asthma, bradyarrhythmias, or recent coronary occlusion. Additionally, it affects sensitivity to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants such as vecuronium bromide.

- **Beta-2 adrenergic agonists**: These are considered as first-line treatment options for myasthenia gravis. Further details on this treatment approach are not provided in the excerpt, but it underscores their primary role in managing the condition.

### Racecadotril in the management of diarrhea: An underestimated therapeutic option [^112nzctT]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Eberlin et al. conducted a multi-center, randomized, single-blinded study involving 223 Chinese adult patients (aged 18–70) with acute infectious diarrhea (AID). Patients received either racecadotril (100 mg t.i.d.) or loperamide (2 mg t.i.d.) until recovery, which was defined as 12 hours without bowel movements or two consecutive normal stool discharges, for a maximum of 3 days. Diarrhea, nausea, anal burning, and anorexia resolved with both drugs; however, the per-protocol analysis showed better improvement with racecadotril. Adverse events were mild to moderate and occurred more frequently with loperamide than with racecadotril (17% vs 3.5%). Although these results align with other studies, it is important to note that per-protocol analysis can be a possible source of bias.

She experienced minimal bilateral ptosis, especially in the morning, and proximal muscle power of 4/5. The diagnosis of MG was verified by the presence of high levels of immunoglobulin G antibodies directed against acetylcholine receptors (54.23 nmol/L). Stimulation single-fiber electromyography recorded from the orbicularis oculi muscle showed abnormal results (MCD: 180 s), and repetitive nerve stimulation showed no decremental response. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a thymoma measuring approximately 3.2 cm.

She presented with a 7-day history of poor appetite and progressive muscular weakness. Although an acute exacerbation of MG was initially considered by the neurologist, the muscle weakness did not improve despite an increased Mestinon dose to 360 mg daily. She was referred to the nephrology department for further assessment because laboratory data indicated an electrolyte imbalance. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tarry stool, and lower extremity numbness were absent. There was no history of recent strenuous exercise or diuretic use.

Upon admission, physical examination revealed clear consciousness and symmetrical weakness of the lower extremities. The laboratory findings were as follows: blood pressure, 116/64 mmHg; heart rate, 82 beats/min; respiratory rate, 22 breaths/min; and body temperature, 36.8 °C.

### The best and worst of times in therapy development for myasthenia gravis [^116w18f3]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Low credibility.

Within the last five years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved complement and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRN) inhibitors for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis, and several other therapies are in late-stage clinical trials or under regulatory review. However, questions about which patients are most likely to benefit from which therapies, and the relative effectiveness of these very expensive drugs, have resulted in uncertainty around the place that they should occupy in the existing therapeutic armamentarium.

MGNet, a Rare Diseases Clinical Research Consortium funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, held two meetings during the 14th International Conference of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America to discuss the most critical needs for clinical trial readiness and biomarker development in the context of therapy development for myasthenia gravis. Herein we provide a summary of these discussions, but not a consensus opinion, and offer a series of recommendations to guide focused research in the most critical areas. We welcome ongoing discussion through comments on this work.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^111sn1Aw]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

All definitions below obtained simple consensus, and all guidance statements were agreed upon as being appropriate by the panel. Literature summaries and tables for medication dosing guidance and medication cautions are available as supplemental data.

- **Preliminary definitions**:
	- **Goals for the treatment of MG**: The MGFA Task Force Post-Intervention Status (PIS) classification Minimal Manifestation Status (MMS) or better, with no more than grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) medication side effects. MMS indicates that the patient has no symptoms or functional limitations from MG but exhibits some weakness on examination of some muscles. This class recognizes that some patients, who otherwise meet the definition of remission, have mild weakness. CTCAE grade 1 medication side effects involve asymptomatic or only mild symptoms, with no intervention indicated.

- **Definition of remission**: The patient exhibits no symptoms or signs of MG. Weakness of eyelid closure is accepted, but no weakness is present in any other muscle upon careful examination. Patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) every day, with reasonable evidence to support symptomatic benefit, are excluded from this category.

- **Definition of ocular MG**: This is based on dysfunction due to MG at a specified point in time and is not dependent upon the duration of disease. MGFA Class I refers to any ocular muscle weakness. There may be weakness of eye closure, but strength in all other facial, bulbar, and limb muscles remains normal. It is recognized that some patients report fatigue even when strength testing is normal.

### Irinotecan hydrochloride [^117Joa5A]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Patient counseling information:

- **Gastrointestinal complications**: Patients and caregivers should be informed about gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea, which generally occurs more than 24 hours after administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Loperamide should be started at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea, then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. It is not recommended to use loperamide for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses due to the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, patients may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Patients should contact their physician if any of the following occur: diarrhea for the first time during treatment; black or bloody stools; symptoms of dehydration such as lightheadedness, dizziness, or faintness; inability to take fluids by mouth due to nausea or vomiting; or inability to control diarrhea within 24 hours.

- **Dizziness or visual disturbances**: Patients should be warned about the potential for dizziness or visual disturbances, which may occur within 24 hours following the administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection.

### Does this patient have myasthenia gravis [^112SgANq]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

Clinicians must be able to diagnose myasthenia gravis, since delays in establishing the diagnosis may put patients at risk for complications from this treatable disease.

- **Objective**: To determine if items in the history and examination or results of simple tests change the likelihood of myasthenia gravis as a diagnosis.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE search of English-language articles (January 1966-January 2005) using the terms myasthenia gravis, diagnosis, and test, and a search of bibliographies of retrieved articles.

- **Study selection**: Studies evaluating a particular symptom or sign in patients both with and without myasthenia gravis. Of 640 articles retrieved, 33 were eligible for review. Of these, 15 met inclusion criteria and form the basis of this review.

- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstracted data using a standardized instrument, and classified study quality using previously published criteria.

- **Data synthesis**: A history of "speech becoming unintelligible during prolonged speaking" and the presence of the peek sign increase the likelihood of myasthenia gravis (likelihood ratio [LR], 4.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–17.0 and LR, 30.0; 95% CI, 3.2–278.0, respectively). Their absence does not significantly reduce the likelihood of myasthenia gravis. The identified studies only assessed one other historical feature and sign each ("food remaining in the mouth after swallowing" and quiver eye movements, respectively), and neither of these significantly changes the likelihood of myasthenia. The ice test is u

### β2-adrenergic receptor agonists ameliorate the adverse effect of long-term pyridostigmine on neuromuscular junction structure [^113Pn4D1]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

Here, we report the longer-term quantitative outcome of adding a β2-adrenergic agonist to treat AChR deficiency patients on anticholinesterase inhibitors. The role of the β2-adrenergic receptor for anabolic action on skeletal muscle and for a shift from slow to fast muscle fiber type profile is well known, but its function at the neuromuscular junction is poorly understood. To investigate what occurs in vivo at the neuromuscular junction, we used a mouse model of AChR deficiency syndrome that accurately reflects the human condition. Our study mimics the treatment of AChR deficiency syndrome patients and demonstrates the effects of pyridostigmine and salbutamol on neuromuscular structure and function.

### Mestinon [^117S8bih]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Mestinon is available in three dosage forms:

- **Oral solution**: Raspberry-flavored, containing 60 mg pyridostigmine bromide per teaspoonful (5 mL). This form allows accurate dosage adjustment for children and "brittle" myasthenic patients who require fractions of 60 mg doses. It is more easily swallowed, especially in the morning, by patients with bulbar involvement.

- **Conventional tablets**: Each containing 60 mg pyridostigmine bromide.

- **TIMESPAN tablets**: Each containing 180 mg pyridostigmine bromide. This form provides uniformly slow release, hence a prolonged duration of drug action; it facilitates control of myasthenic symptoms with fewer individual doses daily. The immediate effect of a 180 mg TIMESPAN tablet is about equal to that of a 60 mg conventional tablet; however, its duration of effectiveness, although varying in individual patients, averages 2½ times that of a 60 mg dose.

Dosage:

The size and frequency of the dosage must be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient.

- **Oral solution and conventional tablets**: The average dose is ten 60 mg tablets or ten 5 mL teaspoonfuls daily, spaced to provide maximum relief when maximum strength is needed. In severe cases, as many as 25 tablets or teaspoonfuls a day may be required, while in mild cases, one to six tablets or teaspoonfuls a day may suffice.

- **TIMESPAN tablets**: One to three 180 mg tablets, once or twice daily, will usually be sufficient to control symptoms; however, the needs of certain individuals may vary markedly from this average. The interval between doses should be adjusted accordingly.

### Expert consensus recommendations for improving and standardising the assessment of patients with generalised myasthenia gravis [^11481KYP]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic, immunoglobulin G (IgG)‐mediated, neuromuscular autoimmune disease, which causes debilitating and potentially life‐threatening muscle weakness. Most patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) first present with ocular symptoms only; however, approximately 80% will have gMG within two years of initial disease onset. gMG is classified by the degree of muscle weakness, which, along with other symptoms of the disease, may vary greatly among individuals and fluctuate over time. This variation in symptoms, combined with infrequent and isolated evaluations, makes accurate tracking of symptom state and full comprehension of disease burden difficult. The impact of gMG on patients' lives can therefore be underappreciated.

In addition, the impact of gMG on key areas of patient health and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) is profound, increasing substantially with increased disease severity. Many patients also continue to experience substantial disease burden while on treatment, and poor HRQoL may persist even if gMG is considered to be well managed. Nonetheless, measures of impairment have the potential to provide a good score‐based measure of the impact of symptoms and treatment on HRQoL in patients, if used consistently.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to immunosuppressants, the EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of immunosuppressive agents in all patients with progressive MG symptoms. It is important to recognize that patients with a thymoma, as well as other patients with anti-titin and anti-RyR antibodies, usually have a severe disease requiring more aggressive treatment strategies.

### Nerlynx [^112dybAd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Antidiarrheal prophylaxis has been shown to lower the incidence and severity of diarrhea. Instruct patients to initiate antidiarrheal prophylaxis with loperamide along with the first dose of Nerlynx and continue during the first 56 days of treatment; after day 56, titrate the dose to achieve 1–2 bowel movements per day, not to exceed 16 mg of loperamide per day [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Consider adding other agents to loperamide as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Alternatively, a 2-week Nerlynx dose escalation approach prior to the initiation of the recommended treatment regimen with Nerlynx can also be considered for diarrhea management [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. For patients who used the Nerlynx dose escalation, the median time to first onset of Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea was 45 days (range, 15–132), and the median cumulative duration of Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea was 2.5 days (range, 1–6). Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 13% of patients who used the Nerlynx dose escalation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Monitor patients for diarrhea and treat with additional antidiarrheals as needed. When severe diarrhea with dehydration occurs, administer fluid and electrolytes as needed, interrupt Nerlynx, and reduce subsequent doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Perform stool cultures as clinically indicated to exclude infectious causes of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or diarrhea of any grade with complicating features (dehydration, fever, neutropenia).

### Fcrn inhibitors for myasthenia gravis [^117R9fCr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

- **Important outcomes**: Improvement in functional ability or severity of symptoms with treatment, as described in critical outcomes, is assessed in the medium term (2 to 9 months) and long term (> 9 months). When sufficient data are available, we will also analyze the data dichotomously to determine if there is significant improvement at short-, medium-, and long-term time points. This approach will allow us to evaluate both the proportion of responders and the degree of response.

	- A clinically significant improvement in MG-ADL score is indicated by a 2-point improvement in score from baseline to post-FcRn inhibitor treatment.

	- A clinically significant improvement in QMG score is demonstrated by a ≥ 2-point reduction in the mean score between baseline and post-FcRn inhibitor treatment for mild-to-moderate disease (QMG 0 to 16) or a ≥ 3-point reduction for severe MG (QMG > 16).

	- Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) score combines clinical examination with patient-reported measures. This outcome is measured and analyzed as continuous data by mean change in score from baseline. It is assessed in the short term (0 to 2 months), medium term (2 to 9 months), and long term (> 9 months).

	- A clinically significant improvement in MGC score is defined as a ≥ 3-point reduction in mean change in the MGC score when compared between baseline and post-FcRn inhibitor treatment. This outcome is also assessed in the short term (0 to 2 months), medium term (2 to 9 months), and long term (> 9 months).
