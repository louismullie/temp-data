## Question

How often to get troponins in nstemi

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often to get troponins in NSTEMI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are diagnosing NSTEMI in the emergency department versus monitoring an established NSTEMI in the hospital. Then, I should verify the guideline-endorsed algorithms for high-sensitivity troponin, including the 0/1-hour and 0/2-hour pathways and the observe-zone strategy. Next, I will consider special populations and assay-specific nuances, and finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with safety checks and contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. In suspected NSTEMI, the diagnostic task is to obtain serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) measurements to detect a dynamic rise or fall, because NSTEMI is defined by a significant change in troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile in the appropriate clinical context, whereas in established NSTEMI, serial troponins are used to track infarct evolution and risk, not to make the initial diagnosis [^2878aa48] [^031276d3].

> Now, I should verify the core algorithms. The 2023 ESC guidelines recommend serial hs-cTn using either a 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour protocol to rule in or rule out NSTEMI, with the 0/1-hour pathway preferred when available, and the 0/2-hour pathway as an alternative. Both require an initial hs-cTn on presentation and a second measurement at 1 or 2 hours, interpreted with assay-specific cutoffs and delta criteria to classify patients into rule-out, observe, or rule-in categories [^2878aa48] [^100bf180] [^d07607a6].

> Wait, let me verify the observe-zone management, because that is where timing often gets extended. If the 0/1-hour algorithm places a patient in the observe zone, a third hs-cTn at 3 hours is recommended to clarify diagnosis; importantly, emerging data suggest that extending the third sample beyond 3 hours can be safe and may improve sensitivity, though this is a pragmatic adaptation rather than a guideline mandate, so I should be cautious and align with local protocols [^eef644dc] [^44af80fd] [^2621f96e].

> I need to check special populations and assay nuances. In older adults, chronic kidney disease, and those with baseline troponin elevation, diagnostic performance can be reduced and baseline elevations may blunt delta changes, so I should consider lower delta thresholds or longer intervals in some cases, and always interpret results in clinical context. Sex-specific 99th percentiles can increase detection in women, which may influence both baseline interpretation and deltas [^538a2abd] [^24d623f5] [^b03b1895].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single universal interval. For patients who present very early, within 3 hours of symptom onset, the troponin kinetics may not yet show a rise, so even with 0/1-hour algorithms, a third sample at 3–6 hours is reasonable if clinical suspicion remains high, whereas in late presenters, a single hs-cTn below the assay's limit of detection with a nonischemic ECG can safely exclude MI in many low-risk patients, though I should confirm assay-specific performance before relying on a single value [^23f8f6af] [^08e3a962] [^b273270a].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For undifferentiated chest pain with suspected NSTEMI, obtain hs-cTn on arrival and repeat at 1 hour if using the 0/1-hour pathway, or at 2 hours if using the 0/2-hour pathway. If the patient is in the observe zone or symptoms began within 3 hours, obtain a third sample at 3 hours, and if logistics delay the third draw, extending to 6 hours can be acceptable in some programs without compromising safety, provided clinical reassessment continues. For established NSTEMI, repeat troponin every 6–8 hours until peak or until the trajectory is clear, then taper to daily if stable, recognizing that the clinical utility is in trend analysis rather than a single value [^2878aa48] [^44af80fd] [^b273270a].

> But wait, what if resources or staffing constrain strict timing? I should double-check that real-world flexibility is supported. Observational validations show that extending the third sample beyond 3 hours maintains safety and can improve classification, and ED policies emphasize that accelerated pathways reduce length of stay but require reliable follow-up and clinical judgment to avoid missed events, so I should document rationale when deviating from ideal intervals [^44af80fd] [^63732fa8] [^98639a4b].

> I should confirm that my plan aligns with contemporary North American guidance as well. The 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP guideline endorses serial hs-cTn at 1–2 hours with a clinical decision pathway, and for conventional troponin, 0 and 3–6 hours is acceptable, reinforcing that the frequency depends on the assay generation and the chosen algorithm, with the overarching principle of serial testing to capture rise or fall rather than a single static value [^0e9d0f7a].

> In summary, I need to ensure the cadence matches the algorithm and the patient. Use 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour hs-cTn protocols for diagnosis, add a 3-hour sample if in the observe zone or if symptoms are very early, extend to 6 hours pragmatically when needed, and for confirmed NSTEMI, repeat every 6–8 hours until the peak is established or the trend is clear, then transition to daily checks as clinically indicated, always integrating ECG, symptoms, and risk scores to guide disposition and therapy [^2878aa48] [^44af80fd] [^b273270a].

For suspected NSTEMI, obtain **high-sensitivity troponin at presentation and repeat at 1–2 hours** [^2878aa48] using the ESC 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour algorithms [^100bf180] to enable rapid rule-in/rule-out [^d07607a6]. If the 0/1-hour algorithm places the patient in the observe zone, **repeat at 3 hours** [^eef644dc] to clarify diagnosis. For conventional troponin, obtain samples at 0 and 3–6 hours [^0e9d0f7a]. After a confirmed NSTEMI, repeat troponin every 6–8 hours until peak or for 24–48 hours, then daily until stable. Adjust frequency for renal impairment, baseline elevation, or very early presentation, and always interpret results with clinical context and ECG [^031276d3].

---

## Initial troponin measurement

Obtain **high-sensitivity troponin immediately at presentation** [^c1519bae]; if hs-cTn is unavailable, use conventional troponin [^0e9d0f7a].

---

## Serial troponin measurements for diagnosis

### High-sensitivity troponin assays

- **ESC 0/1-hour algorithm**: Preferred; obtain hs-cTn at 0 and 1 hour [^2878aa48]; high sensitivity and NPV enable rapid rule-out/rule-in [^d07607a6].
- **ESC 0/2-hour algorithm**: Alternative; obtain hs-cTn at 0 and 2 hours [^100bf180]; similar safety and efficacy [^26960d3d].
- **Observe zone**: If 0/1-hour results are inconclusive, repeat at 3 hours [^eef644dc] to resolve diagnosis [^2621f96e].

---

### Conventional troponin assays

For conventional troponin, obtain samples at **0 and 3–6 hours** [^0e9d0f7a]; this interval balances sensitivity and specificity for NSTEMI detection [^bb0bdf41].

---

## Frequency of troponin measurements after confirmed NSTEMI

After confirmed NSTEMI, **repeat troponin every 6–8 hours** until peak or for 24–48 hours, then daily until stable; this supports risk stratification and detection of reinfarction [^d0b578d3].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Baseline elevation is common; interpret deltas cautiously and consider longer intervals or adjusted thresholds [^538a2abd] [^24d623f5].
- **Early presenters**: If symptoms are < 3 hours, consider a third measurement at 3–6 hours to mitigate the troponin-blind period [^23f8f6af] [^b273270a].
- **Persistent symptoms**: Repeat troponin if symptoms persist or evolve, even after initial rule-out [^0e9d0f7a].

---

## Clinical implications of troponin frequency

Frequent troponin testing enables **early diagnosis**, risk stratification, and timely intervention; higher troponin levels correlate with worse outcomes and may guide invasive strategy [^1afa2e90] [^d18ed792].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Troponin frequency** |
|-|-|
| Suspected NSTEMI (hs-cTn) | 0 and 1–2 hours (ESC 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour algorithms) |
| Observe zone (hs-cTn) | Repeat at 3 hours |
| Suspected NSTEMI (conventional cTn) | 0 and 3–6 hours |
| Confirmed NSTEMI | Every 6–8 hours until peak or 24–48 hours, then daily |
| Early presenters (< 3 hours) | Consider third measurement at 3–6 hours |
| Renal impairment | Adjust intervals/thresholds as needed |

---

The recommended troponin frequency in NSTEMI is **guided by assay type and clinical context**: hs-cTn at 0 and 1–2 hours [^2878aa48], with a 3-hour repeat if needed; conventional cTn at 0 and 3–6 hours [^0e9d0f7a]; and after confirmation, every 6–8 hours until peak or 24–48 hours, then daily. Adjust for renal function, early presentation, and persistent symptoms, and always integrate with ECG and clinical judgment [^031276d3].

### Increasingly sensitive troponin assays: is perfect the enemy of good? [^68013192]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

For over 20 years, cardiac troponin has been the gold standard biomarker for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with acute chest pain. 1 Refinement in assay technology led to the development of high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs‐cTn) assays able to measure troponin concentrations in a least 50% of healthy individuals with high precision (coefficient of variation of ≤ 10%) at the 99th percentile. 2 When compared with conventional troponin assays, hs‐cTn assays improve the speed and accuracy of myocardial infarction (MI) diagnosis, 3 rule out MI more efficiently, reduce costs, 3, 4 and identify a greater number of patients at high risk for future cardiovascular events. 5 hs‐cTn assays are now used globally, frequently embedded within several validated algorithms for ruling in or out non–ST‐segment–elevation MI (NSTEMI). 6 These algorithms have attempted to find the perfect balance of sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing NSTEMI while maintaining efficiency.

Notably, there are important distinctions among hs‐cTn assays. Although all hs‐cTn assays are expected to measure troponin in at least 50% of healthy adults, substantial differences in sensitivity and precision may exist between assays at low troponin concentrations. With this in mind, several preclinical assays have been developed that have remarkable low‐end sensitivity able to measure troponin concentrations in > 99% of healthy individuals with 10% analytical variation at concentrations < 1 ng/L. 7 Whether hs‐cTn assays with this degree of sensitivity and precision could improve clinical outcomes when compared with other less sensitive hs‐cTn assays has been relatively unexplored; in theory, greater sensitivity might improve negative predictive value, but at the expense of specificity. Thus, clinical data evaluating hs‐cTn assays with such sensitivity are crucial.

In a multicenter cohort study of 17 384 ED patients with chest pain risk stratified with a HEART pathway incorporating conventional vs high-sensitivity troponin level, the high-sensitivity troponin group showed a higher rate of acute myocardial infarction diagnosis during the ED visit and a lower rate of AMI diagnosis within 30 days after the visit, along with lower rates of admission, stress testing, and revascularization. Mortality was rare and similar across groups. Meaning This study suggests that a high-sensitivity troponin HEART pathway may be associated with earlier detection of AMI and improved resource use.

Importance Patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain are routinely risk stratified for major adverse cardiac events using the HEART score pathway, which incorporates clinical features, risk factors, electrocardiography findings, and initial serum troponin testing.

### Cardiac troponin assays with improved analytical quality: a trade-off between enhanced diagnostic performance and reduced long-term prognostic value [^1f6b0a19]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical suspicion of non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is a frequent cause of hospital admission, 1 and cardiac troponin (cTn, T, or I) measurement is a cornerstone in evaluation of these patients. 2 Approximately 40% of patients are "early presenters", 3, 4 and accurate detection of low cTn concentrations for immediate rule‐out of NSTEMI may therefore have clinical utility. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends that patients with a detectable baseline cTn concentration undergo serial testing. Based on the baseline and delta concentrations obtained, such cases can be classified as rule‐out, observation, or rule‐in for NSTEMI. 2 A few limitations apply when troponin‐based algorithms are used for rule‐out of NSTEMI, for example, the suboptimal analytical sensitivity (unavailability to provide measurable concentrations in all healthy individuals) and large analytical imprecision (reproducibility of sequential measurements) at low troponin concentrations, which could produce a false low delta value leading to an inappropriate rule‐out. Improved analytical sensitivity and precision of these assays might facilitate algorithms with higher specificity allowing for admission rule‐out in all individuals with low concentrations regardless of time from symptom onset and greater reliability of deltas allowing for rule‐out in subjects with high normal or increased baseline concentrations.

Risk Stratification

Acute Coronary Syndrome Population

In AMI, troponin not only serves a diagnostic purpose but also can be useful for prognosis. The earlier‐generation assays showed troponin is a strong prognostic marker for cardiovascular death and recurrent ischemic events in both non–ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and STEMI. – The new high‐sensitivity assays share this prognostic ability. In a single‐center study of nearly 1000 patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain, troponin measured with a high‐sensitivity assay was a more robust predictor of cardiovascular death at 1‐year follow‐up than the conventional troponin assay. The same authors also evaluated whether a delta high‐sensitivity troponin level between presentation and 2 hours later would provide prognostic information but found that the absolute value was superior to the delta value at 2 hours for prognostication of cardiovascular death at 1 year.

The prognostic information gained from troponin not only can give clinicians information on risk but also may help to guide therapy, although these management strategies have only been studied with standard‐sensitivity troponin assays. Troponin can be a useful measure for assigning patients to higher‐level monitoring, such as the cardiac care unit or telemetry. Previous research used standard sensitivity troponin as one of several factors that might direct triage to an invasive strategy for NSTEMI. Indeed, its use has also been suggested as part of clinical risk scores to influence timing of cardiac catheterization for NSTEMI patients. Troponin levels also have been associated with a benefit of more aggressive medical antiplatelet therapy, specifically for glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Further investigation is needed to provide thresholds by which high‐sensitivity assays might also be used to guide therapeutic strategies.

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^5b82d05f]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Despite the prognostic implications of troponin levels in ACS, current guidelines for urgent revascularization in NSTEMI patients do not incorporate this biomarker in their decision‐making process regarding treatment. In our study, we have demonstrated an association between hs‐cTnI levels upon admission and overall survival in patients diagnosed with NSTEMI. Furthermore, we identified a subgroup that is at a heightened risk of mortality according to their initial hs‐cTnI level. Interestingly, this association becomes less significant when early reperfusion strategy is considered. These findings may suggest that initial hs‐cTnI levels could be an additional factor when determining reperfusion strategies in NSTEMI patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to investigate the impact of early reperfusion strategies on mortality in NSTEMI patients categorized by their initial presenting troponin levels.

Table 2
Overview on the performance of fast rule-out strategies based on single and serial blood draw at 0 hour/1 hour

For patients not meeting the criteria for single troponin testing, the interval between serial measurements should be long enough to overcome the troponin-blind period that is typically seen following the early hour(s) of an MI. Validated algorithms that allow for an earlier detection of an MI with re-testing using a hs assay after 1, 2 or 3 hours instead of 6–9 hours that were recommended with less-sensitive troponin assays. At this stage, the algorithms are used to predict either a low probability (rule-out) or a high probability (rule-in) of a diagnosis of MI on follow-up and do not use the 99th percentile upper limit of normal. They use lower thresholds and concentration changes optimised to rule-out MI with a sensitivity of > 99% or higher thresholds to rule-in with a specificity of > 75%. When diagnosis is uncertain, patients are classified to an intermediate risk zone and subsequent testing is recommended.

Serial testing of troponin is also required to detect a relevant rise or fall, a key principle to discriminate acute from chronic myocardial injury. Serial testing of troponin within 3 hours after the initial blood sample helps to establish an earlier diagnosis (rule-in) of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), provided an hs-cTn assay is being used. Several strategies exist, with the 2020 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on NSTE-ACSrecommending the 0-hour to 1-hour algorithm in preference to the 0-hour to 3-hour algorithm. The 0-hour to 2-hour algorithm is recommended as an alternative. Faster diagnostic algorithms seem to perform reliably in patients with pre-existing structural heart disease, chronic kidney disease and older adults, although proportion of patients who qualify for early rule-out MI decline, due to the high prevalence of chronic elevation of troponin.

### The CRP troponin test (CTT) stratifies mortality risk in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) [^df1938b8]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

The C‐reactive protein (CRP)‐troponin‐test (CTT) comprises simultaneous serial measurements of CRP and cardiac troponin and might reflect the systemic inflammatory response in patients with acute coronary syndrome. We sought to test its ability to stratify the short‐ and long‐term mortality risk in patients with non‐ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Methods

We examined 1,675 patients diagnosed with NSTEMI on discharge who had at least two successive measurements of combined CRP and cardiac troponin within 48 h of admission. A tree classifier model determined which measurements and cutoffs could be used to best predict mortality during a median follow‐up of 3 years [IQR 1.8–4.3].

Results

Patients with high CRP levels (> 90th percentile, > 54 mg/L) had a higher 30‐day mortality rate regardless of their troponin test findings (16.7% vs. 2.9%, p < 0.01). However, among patients with "normal" CRP levels (< 54 mg/L), those who had high troponin levels (> 80th percentile, 4,918 ng/L) had a higher 30‐day mortality rate than patients with normal CRP and troponin concentrations (7% vs. 2%, p < 0.01). The CTT test result was an independent predictor for overall mortality even after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities (HR = 2.28 [95% CI 1.56‐3.37], p < 0.01 for patients with high troponin and high CRP levels).

Conclusions

Early serial CTT results may stratify mortality risk in patients with NSTEMI, especially those with "normal" CRP levels. The CTT could potentially assess the impact of inflammation during myocardial necrosis on the outcomes of patients with NSTEMI and identify patients who could benefit from novel anti‐inflammatory therapies.

### The CRP troponin test (CTT) stratifies mortality risk in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) [^26f443ae]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Elevated cardiac troponin is a hallmark of non‐ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The definition of NSTEMI includes several clinical entities, such as type 1 MI, type 2 MI, and myocardial injury. Distinguishing between these entities is challenging, and differentiating between them bears substantial implications on patient management and prognosis. Thus, definitive diagnostic tests aimed at better stratifying risk at the onset of NSTEMI development are needed.

A rapid increase in C‐reactive protein (CRP) concentrations early in the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with worse outcomes and cardiac dysfunction. We recently described a simple diagnostic approach for identifying STEMI patients at increased risk for worse outcomes, the "CRP Troponin Test (CTT)", which is comprised of simultaneous serial measurements of both CRP and cardiac troponin during admission. However, the clinical application of this approach in patients with NSTEMI has not yet been studied.

Systemic and vascular inflammation play a key role in the development of ACS in addition to precipitating illnesses, such as infection, respiratory disease, and kidney injury.CRP is an acute phase reactant. Analyzing its concentrations in relation to circulating cardiac troponin, which implicates myocardial necrosis, might help identify "inflammatory prone" patients who demonstrate an excessive inflammatory response during an MI.

We, therefore, sought to determine the association between early CTT results to short‐ and long‐term mortality rates in patients with NSTEMI. We also aimed to characterize patients according to their inflammatory response as measured by the CTT during the first 48 h of admission.

### Small changes in troponin T levels are common in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and are linked to higher mortality [^d0fedc78]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the extent of change in troponin T levels in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Background

Changes in cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels are required for the diagnosis of NSTEMI, according to the new universal definition of acute myocardial infarction. A relative change of 20% to 230% and an absolute change of 7 to 9 ng/l have been suggested as cutoff points.

Methods

In a clinical setting, where a change in cTnT was not mandatory for the diagnosis of NSTEMI, serial samples of cTnT were measured with a high-sensitivity cTnT (hs-cTnT) assay, and 37 clinical parameters were evaluated in 1,178 patients with a final diagnosis of NSTEMI presenting < 24 h after symptom onset.

Results

After 6 h of observation, the relative change in the hs-cTnT level remained < 20% in 26% and the absolute change < 9 ng/l in 12% of the NSTEMI patients. A relative hs-cTnT change < 20% was linked to higher long-term mortality across quartiles (p = 0.002) and in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio: 1.61 [95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 2.21], p = 0.004), whereas 30-day mortality was similar across quartiles of relative hs-cTnT change.

Conclusions

Because stable hs-TnT levels are common in patients with a clinical diagnosis of NSTEMI in our hospital, a small hs-cTnT change may not be useful to exclude NSTEMI, particularly as these patients show both short-term and long-term mortality at least as high as patients with large changes in hs-cTnT.

Comparator Algorithms

According to current recommendations, patients are eligible for early discharge or further investigations for ACS based on the troponin results. 2 The algorithms encompass an initial review of the admission sample in patients who present more than 3 hours after symptom onset. If the concentration is below the LOD of the troponin assay, the patient is eligible for "rule‐out" and may be discharged if the electrocardiogram and/or the clinical symptoms suggest a lower likelihood of ACS. The remaining patients undergo serial sampling at 1‐hour intervals. Based on the baseline and delta values obtained, patient status is established as "rule‐out", "observation", or "rule‐in" for NSTEMI. Again, ruled‐out patients may be discharged if the clinical suspicion of ACS is low, those who are ruled in may go directly to cardiac angiography and eventually invasive treatment, and those in the observation group undergo diagnostic follow‐up. We compared the recommended ESC (cTnT and cTnI (Abbott)) algorithms 2 and those suggested by Body et al 14 and Neumann et al 15 to the novel algorithms described in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 1
Single Sample Rule‐Out of NSTEMI

Table 2
Serial 0/1 Hour Algorithms for Rule‐Out and Rule‐In of NSTEMI

Development of Novel Algorithms

The novel cTnI (sgx) rule‐out algorithms were defined based on the following hierarchy of criteria: diagnostic sensitivity for NSTEMI ≥ 99.0%, as previously described, 24 and the maximum possible specificity. Sensitivity was preferred over negative predictive value as the criterion because sensitivity is independent of disease prevalence and applicable in chest pain cohorts with higher and lower prevalences compared with our cohort. Applicable concentrations for the rule‐in algorithms were based on the following criteria: diagnostic specificity for NSTEMI ≥ 95% (< 5% rule‐in of patients with non‐NSTEMI) and a simultaneously maximized sensitivity for NSTEMI. Specificity was considered preferable to positive predictive value because specificity is independent of prevalence.

We chose the preferred algorithms based on the number of ruled‐out and ruled‐in patients who would give a sensitivity and specificity corresponding to the prespecified criteria. "Direct rule‐out" was defined as rule‐out regardless of time since symptom onset. Diagnostic performance was calculated with and without early presenters, defined as patients with < 3 hours since symptom onset.

### Peak troponin T in STEMI: a predictor of all-cause mortality and left ventricular function [^a89a5894]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease contributes substantially to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent epidemiological data from the Global Burden of Disease study estimates that approximately 9 million deaths were attributed to ischaemic heart disease in 2017, making it the leading cause of global mortality, a position it has retained for greater than two decades.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) assays have been recognised for improving diagnostic accuracy in the early detection of acute myocardial infarction and for their potential in risk stratification for patients with acute coronary syndromes. Several studies have demonstrated worse clinical outcomes with higher troponin levels in patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). However, the clinical significance of peak troponin levels in patients following STEMI is less certain and requires further research. Most previous studies on the prognostic value of cardiac troponins in patients with STEMI derived from prospective clinical trials, often with highly selective inclusion/exclusion criteria or small sample size, thus not reflecting the entire spectrum of STEMI presentations in daily practice. Other studies focused on admission levels of troponin or values at specific time points instead of peak values. In this study we aimed to characterise the predictive value of peak hs-cTnT levels in relation to all-cause mortality and left ventricular function in a real-world cohort of patients with STEMI.

### Diagnosis of unstable angina pectoris has declined markedly with the advent of more sensitive troponin assays [^b8a1d833]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Since the arrival of the universal definition of myocardial infarction more sensitive troponin assays have been developed. How these occurrences have influenced the proportions and clinical features of the components of acute coronary syndrome have not been studied prospectively in unselected hospital patients.

Methods

During 2010 we evaluated all patients in whom cardiac troponin I had been measured at a single university hospital. The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]) was established in cases of a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin I together with cardiac ischemic features. Patients with unstable chest discomfort and cardiac troponin I values below the decision limit of myocardial infarction were diagnosed as having unstable angina pectoris. The definition of acute coronary syndrome included unstable angina pectoris, NSTEMI, and STEMI. Mortality data were obtained from the Danish Civil Personal Registration System.

Results

Of 3762 consecutive patients, 516 had acute coronary syndrome. Unstable angina pectoris was present in 7%, NSTEMI in 67%, and STEMI in 26%. The NSTEMI patients were older, more frequently women, and had more comorbidities than patients with unstable angina pectoris and STEMI. At median follow-up of 3.2 years 195 patients had died: 14% of unstable angina pectoris, 45% of NSTEMI, and 25% of STEMI patients. Age-adjusted log-rank statistics revealed differences in mortality: NSTEMI vs unstable angina pectoris (P = 0.0091) and NSTEMI vs STEMI (P = 0.0045).

Conclusions

The application of the universal definition together with the use of a contemporary troponin assay seems to have reduced the proportion of patients with unstable angina pectoris to the benefit of patients with NSTEMI. Despite this, NSTEMI patients have a sustained higher mortality than patients with STEMI.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^085e82c4]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Emergency department antiplatelet timing in NSTEMI — study selection and clinical question are defined: One hundred twenty articles were identified, thirty-three were selected for further review, and 3 Class I, 2 Class II, and zero Class III studies were included; the question asks whether in patients with NSTEMI with a positive troponin test result emergency physicians should give additional antiplatelet agents as soon as diagnosis is made versus deferring to admission or cardiology evaluation, with "immediate" defined as shortly after diagnosis while the patient remains under ED physician care.

### Resolving the observe zone: validation of the ESC 0 / 3-hour and the APACE criteria for NSTEMI triage [^44af80fd]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Fourth, in 2012, an opinion paper from the Study Group on Biomarkers in Cardiology of the ESC Working Group had proposed an extension of the time interval from 3 hours to 6 hours for retesting of hs-cTn as an option if hs-cTn concentrations were not available at 3 hours. However, there is no clinical evidence on the performance, effectiveness and safety of the modified 0/3-hour algorithm. Our findings support that the 0/3-hour algorithm may be applied safely even if time intervals are longer and may be of particular help in real-world settings where timing of serial measurements is not supervised and clinical circumstances may cause time delays. Extending the time interval for a third troponin measurement is expected to improve sensitivity and NPV, as longer intervals allow for greater troponin changes to accumulate, enhancing differentiation between acute and chronic troponin elevations. This concept is well supported by troponin kinetics, as myocardial injury typically leads to a progressive rise in troponin over several hours, with peak sensitivity occurring between 6 and 12 hours after symptom onset. However, despite its high clinical plausibility, the impact of extending sampling times beyond 3 hours had not been systematically validated prior to this study. Our findings confirm the safety of extended sampling intervals, demonstrating that a delay beyond 3 hours does not negatively impact patient outcomes. This finding is very important for the vast majority of EDs that are not using a supervised timing of serial troponin measurements, and FU blood draws are usually considerably longer than the proposed intervals, including a tolerance time of 10 min. In real-world ED settings, strict adherence to fixed troponin sampling times is often impractical due to logistical constraints, patient-specific factors and workflow priorities. These results support a more flexible, pragmatic approach to troponin-based triage in clinical practice. Furthermore, our findings highlight the need to develop clinical decision support tools that help guide the selection of the most appropriate diagnostic algorithm based on the actual sampling time used. Fears for overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis of MI are unsubstantiated as longer time intervals would rather increase sensitivity and specificity of serial troponin testing, as late increases of hs-cTn have been reported in a considerable proportion of patients. The issue of late occurrence of relevant concentration changes was also pointed out by Hammarsten et al, showing that 14% of patients with confirmed NSTEMI presenting with already elevated troponin at admission will show a relative change of < 20% within 6 hours. Thus, the extension of the sampling interval will rather improve the diagnosis.

### The meaning of elevated troponin I levels: not always acute coronary syndromes [^7f4bb14d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Troponin elevation can be caused by etiologies other than acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Our hypothesis was that elevated troponins occur more frequently in non-ACS cases but that ACS cases (type 1 ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] and type 1 non-STEMI [NSTEMI]) have significantly higher troponin elevations.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional cohort analysis of a random subset of all patients with elevated troponins (defined as ≥ 0.06 ng/mL) over a 1-year period from July 2013 to June 2014. The first positive troponin I and the peak were used in this study. All included patients had medical record reviews looking for whether our cardiologists or hospitalists attributed the elevated troponin to an ACS (NSTEMI or STEMI) or non-ACS cause. Non-ACS causes were categorized as infection, cancer, renal diseases, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, trauma, cardiac arrest, neurologic disease, hypertension, or other. Data were extracted by 2 investigators on the cause of the elevated troponin. Three sessions to educate data extractors were arranged and methods of data extraction discussed, then a 5% sample was reevaluated by the other extractor to determine interrater agreement measures. Parametric data were evaluated with t test and analysis of variance. Dichotomous variables were compared using χ(2) test. Troponin data were evaluated using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U. A logistic regression model was created with variables selected a priori to evaluate the predictive ability of these variables in differentiating ACS vs non-ACS causes of elevated troponin.

Results

We evaluated 458 randomly selected patients from 1317 unique cases of all patients with initial elevated troponins at least 0.06 mg/mL during the study period. There was 84% interrater agreement in the 5% sampling. Seventy-nine percent had a non-ACS cause of elevated troponin, and the average initial positive troponin I level was significantly lower in the non-ACS cases (0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08–0.37) than those with documented STEMI (10.2; 95% CI, 0.75–20.1) or NSTEMIs (0.4; 95% CI, 0.13–1.7). In the non-ACS group, the median initial troponin was 0.14 ng/mL (0.08–0.37 ng/mL). Peak troponin levels were highest in STEMI, next NSTEMI, and lowest in non ACS causes. The most frequent subgroups in the non-ACS group were non-ACS cardiovascular, infectious, renal, or hypertensive causes. In a linear regression model adjusting for age and sex, higher troponin levels had higher odds of being related to ACS causes (adjusted odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2–1.6) than non-ACS causes.

Conclusion

The etiology for most initial elevated troponin I levels in a randomly selected population is the result of non-ACS causes. As initial + troponin levels increased, they were more likely associated with ACS causes than with non-ACS causes. Average initial + and peak troponin values were highest in STEMIs, next highest in NSTEMIs, and lowest overall in non-ACS causes.

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^d18ed792]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Timely reperfusion within 120 min is strongly recommended in patients presenting with non‐ST‐segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with very high‐risk features. Evidence regarding the use of high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs‐cTn) concentration upon admission for the risk‐stratification of patients presenting with NSTEMI to expedite percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thus potentially improve outcomes is limited.

Methods

All patients admitted to a tertiary care center ICCU between July 2019 and July 2022 were included. Hs‐cTnI levels on presentaion were recorded, dividing patients into quartiles based on baseline hs‐cTnI. Association between initial hs‐cTnI and all‐cause mortality during up to 3 years of follow‐up was studied.

Results

A total of 544 NSTEMI patients with a median age of 67 were included. Hs‐cTnI levels in each quartile were: (a) ≤ 122, (b) 123–680, (c) 681–2877, and (d) ≥ 2878 ng/L. There was no difference between the initial hs‐cTnI level groups regarding age and comorbidities. A higher mortality rate was observed in the highest hs‐cTnI quartile as compared with the lowest hs‐cTnI quartile (16.2% vs. 7.35%, p = .03) with hazard ratio (HR) for mortality of 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23–5.4; p = .012) in the unadjusted model, and HR of 2.06 (95% CI: 1.01–4.79; p = .047) with adjustment for age, gender, serum creatinine, and significant comorbidities.

Conclusions

Patients with NSTEMI and higher hs‐cTnI levels upon admission faced elevated mortality risk. This underscores the need for further prospective investigations into early reperfusion strategies' impact on NSTEMI patients' mortality, based on admission troponin elevation.

Diagnosis of NSTEMI is also less straightforward than that of STEMI, which can be identified rapidly based on an electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement. The identification of patients with NSTEMI is often delayed owing to the frequent lack of definitive ECG changes and uncertainty about the definition of NSTEMI with regard to elevated cardiac troponin levels. 42 Implementation of high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin assays will lead to an increase in the diagnosis of NSTEMI. 44 Age, sex, comorbidities, and in‐hospital management strategies (eg, PCI or medical management) may also influence decisions in patients with NSTEMI regarding prescription at discharge. 28, 45

2.2 Physician guideline implementation

Another challenge for the treatment of patients with NSTEMI is the underestimation of the high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk in these patients, which contributes to the suboptimal use of treatments and is suggestive of barriers to guideline implementation. 31, 41

In the ACS II Canadian registry, the most common reason for not choosing an invasive treatment strategy in patients with NSTEMI was an underestimation of ischemic risk by physicians, even though a large proportion of these patients were at intermediate to high risk according to their Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score. 46, 47 Results from the registry also showed weak correlations between risk assessment by physicians and TIMI and Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk scores, 48 which are recommended for guiding treatment decisions for patients with NSTEMI in international guidelines. 13, 15

### Diagnosis of myocardial infarction using troponin I algorithm… [^82e30677]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Therefore, current European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend the use of high-sensitivity troponin assays on admission and after 3 hours. A value above the 99th percentile of the specific assay and a relative rise or fall is the recommended cutoff for a diagnosis of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 6, 7 Recent studies suggest that AMI can be diagnosed earlier than 3 hours, when values below the 99th percentile are used as cutoff values. To identify NSTEMI, the following algorithms based on troponin I levels were considered: 1 hour after admission a value higher than 6 ng/L combined with an increase or decrease of at least 12 ng/L from the admission value was defined to identify NSTEMI; and 3 hours after admission a value higher than 6 ng/L combined with an increase or decrease of at least 12 ng/L from the admission value was defined as NSTEMI.

When we used the 1-hour algorithm with 2 consecutive measurements of troponin I levels, the NPV for NSTEMI type 1 after 1 hour was 99. 8%; after 3 hours,
100. 0%. In the first validation cohort, which included a 2-hour diagnostic algorithm for 1748 individuals, 249 NSTEMIs were observed. The NPV directly after admission was 99. 6% and improved to
99. 7% after 2 hours. Using the rule-in algorithm, we observed a PPV of 81. 5%. The 1- and 3-hour algorithms using a cutoff value of 6 ng/L resulted in lower mortality than the 99th percentile cutoff, and mortality using the 1-hour algorithm was identical to that of the 3-hour algorithm. Patients diagnosed as having NSTEMI by our algorithm had a significantly higher mortality. Highest mortality was observed in the gray-zone group.

This group of patients with continuously elevated but stable troponin levels, which are not necessarily related to coronary disease, requires thorough monitoring and reevaluation.

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^24ea832c]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Bagai et al. showed that there is a differential relationship between the magnitude of peak troponin elevation and long‐term mortality in ACS patients treated with and without revascularization. Our findings also suggest better prognosis after revascularization regarding the association between initial hs‐cTnI levels and mortality, although this was not the aim of our study and it was not powered for that. The association between initial hs‐cTnI levels and mortality, and the lower mortality rate in revascularized patients, imply that initial hs‐cTnI levels may be useful in determining the need for urgent revascularization in NSTEMI patients. Current NSTEMI guidelines advise revascularization within 120 min in patients with very high‐risk characteristics, regardless of the level of cardiac biomarkers. However, based on our results and previous important studies, initial hs‐cTnI may further contribute to the decision‐making process for urgent revascularization among NSTEMI patients, to reduce the higher mortality rates that we have observed in NSTEMI patients with high baseline hs‐cTnI levels.

4.1 Study limitations

Our study has several limitations: (1) The study was conducted in a single tertiary‐care ICCU, resulting in a relatively small study population of 544 patients. Nevertheless, we included all‐comers in a real‐life setting. (2) Our analysis was based on overall mortality rather than cardiovascular mortality. Though mortality statistics in Israel closely resemble those of the European Union, where cardiovascular death is the second most prevalent cause of death following cancer.(3) There may be unmeasured clinical variables that could explain our observations, including the time elapsed between symptom onset to hs‐cTnI testing, details regarding coronary angiography beyond the culprit vessel, including lesion description and the exact type of stents employed in the PCI group. (4) While independent associations have been demonstrated, causality could not be established due to study design; hence, the superiority of one treatment modality over another is not supported by our findings.

### Prospective validation of the 0 / 1-h algorithm for early diagnosis of myocardial infarction [^d07607a6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The safety of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 0/1-h algorithm for rapid rule-out and rule-in of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) has been questioned.

Objectives

This study aimed to validate the diagnostic performance of the 0/1-h algorithm in a large multicenter study.

Methods

The authors prospectively enrolled unselected patients in 6 countries presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of NSTEMI. Final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists. Hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI blood concentrations were measured at presentation and after 1 h. Safety of rule-out was quantified by the negative predictive value (NPV) for NSTEMI, accuracy of rule-in by the positive predictive value (PPV), and overall efficacy by the proportion of patients triaged towards rule-out or rule-in within 1 h.

Results

Prevalence of NSTEMI was 17%. Among 4,368 patients with serial hs-cTnT measurements available, safety of rule-out (NPV 99.8%, 2,488 of 2,493), accuracy of rule-in (PPV 74.5%, 572 of 768), and overall efficacy were high by assigning three-fourths of patients either to rule-out (57%, 2,493 to 4,368) or rule-in (18%, 768 to 4,368). Similarly, among 3,500 patients with serial hs-cTnI measurements, safety of rule-out (NPV 99.7%, 1,528 of 1,533), accuracy of rule-in (PPV 62.3%, 498 of 800), and overall efficacy were high by assigning more than two-thirds of patients either to rule-out (44%, 1,533 of 3,500) or rule-in (23%, 800 of 3,500). Excellent safety was confirmed in multiple subgroup analyses including patients presenting early (≤ 3 h) after chest pain onset.

Conclusions

The ESC 0/1-h algorithm using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI is very safe and effective in triaging patients with suspected NSTEMI. (Advantageous Predictors of Acute Coronary Syndromes Evaluation [APACE]; NCT00470587; and Biomarkers in Acute Cardiac Care [BACC]; NCT02355457).

Diagnosis

The diagnostic end point was NSTEMI during the index hospitalization. The adjudicating process has been described earlier, 17 but briefly, 2 independent cardiologists adjudicated the final diagnosis based on all available clinical, routine laboratory (including cTnT at admission and at 3 and 8–12 hours from admission), electrocardiogram, ultrasound, and imaging findings, including cardiac computed tomographic angiography and conventional angiography. A third adjudicator resolved disagreements. Specific diagnostic criteria were predefined for 22 different medical conditions based on guidelines that were available during planning of the study (see Data S1). NSTEMI was defined according to the third universal definition for myocardial infarction (MI), including a significant rise and fall of cTn with at least 1 value above the 99th percentile combined with symptoms of ischemia, electrocardiogram changes, and image evidence of loss of viable myocardium or intracoronary thrombus. 19 Delta values of 20% (baseline cTnT concentration > 14 ng/L) or 50% (baseline cTnT concentration ≤ 14 ng/L) in serial cTnT measures were regarded as significant, as suggested by the ESC in 2012. 17, 19 Since 2012, several studies have found a significantly lower 99th percentile concentration of cTn for women compared with men, 20, 21, 22 but knowledge of sex‐specific cutoffs for women regarding diagnosing NSTEMI is partial because of a lack of data on pathophysiology. 23 Consequently, we chose to apply a common cutoff for all patients.

Follow‐Up and Prognostic End Points

Follow‐up data were collected through the Norwegian Patient Register and Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. The prognostic end point was a composite of all‐cause mortality and subsequent nonfatal MI (all MIs after the index NSTEMI). Patients were followed until an end point occurred or until a median follow‐up time of 723 days after inclusion (ranging from 4 to 900 days).

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^3cb50efc]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Timely reperfusion within 120min is strongly recommended in patients presenting with non-ST-segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with very high-risk features. Evidence regarding the use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentration upon admission for the risk-stratification of patients presenting with NSTEMI to expedite percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thus potentially improve outcomes is limited.

Methods

All patients admitted to a tertiary care center ICCU between July 2019 and July 2022 were included. Hs-cTnI levels on presentaion were recorded, dividing patients into quartiles based on baseline hs-cTnI. Association between initial hs-cTnI and all-cause mortality during up to 3 years of follow-up was studied.

Results

A total of 544 NSTEMI patients with a median age of 67 were included. Hs-cTnI levels in each quartile were: (a) ≤ 122, (b) 123–680, (c) 681–2877, and (d) ≥ 2878ng/L. There was no difference between the initial hs-cTnI level groups regarding age and comorbidities. A higher mortality rate was observed in the highest hs-cTnI quartile as compared with the lowest hs-cTnI quartile (16.2% vs. 7.35%, p = .03) with hazard ratio (HR) for mortality of 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23–5.4; p = .012) in the unadjusted model, and HR of 2.06 (95% CI: 1.01–4.79; p = .047) with adjustment for age, gender, serum creatinine, and significant comorbidities.

Conclusions

Patients with NSTEMI and higher hs-cTnI levels upon admission faced elevated mortality risk. This underscores the need for further prospective investigations into early reperfusion strategies' impact on NSTEMI patients' mortality, based on admission troponin elevation.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: sorting through type 1 vs other types [^cb2264c0]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

2 CLASSIFICATION OF MI

Clinically, MI is defined by the presence of acute myocardial injury, as detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers (eg, cardiac troponins [cTn]) presenting with symptoms of myocardial ischemia with an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), imaging, or angiographic findings. 5

2.1 Diagnosis of NSTEMI

The diagnosis of NSTEMI is covered in extensive detail elsewhere, including European and US clinical practice guidelines. 1, 3 In summary, in NSTEMI, a 12‐lead ECG may show a depressed ST‐segment or T‐wave insertion, whereas in STEMI, an ECG shows persistent (> 20 minutes) ST‐segment elevation or new left bundle‐branch block. 1, 2, 3 Cardiac troponin testing, in combination with an ECG, has become an essential tool for accurately diagnosing MI and is mandatory for patients showing characteristics of an NSTEMI on ECG. 1, 3 The Cardiac troponin test enables distinction between NSTEMI and unstable angina and therefore is an important aid in risk stratification and treatment decisions. 3

Cardiac troponin is a specific cardiac structural protein associated with myocyte injury of any type. 7, 8 Although elevated blood Cardiac troponin is not specific to acute coronary events, Cardiac troponin testing is highly sensitive in detecting small amounts of myocardial necrosis. 7 In a study examining the utility of high‐sensitivity Cardiac troponin assays, more high‐risk patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with unspecified chest pain were identified and admitted to the hospital than when conventional Cardiac troponin assays were used. 9 This improved triage was associated with a reduction in major adverse cardiac events among patients directly discharged from the ED. 9 The corresponding increase among patients who were admitted to hospital reflected the higher risk among this population. 9

NSTEMI is characterized by Cardiac troponin values that follow a specific pattern, comprising an acute rise followed by a gradual fall, which is consistent with the patient's clinical presentation and ECG changes. 1, 3

### Invasive versus non-invasive management of older patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (SENIOR-NSTEMI): a cohort study based on routine clinical data [^acfcd5c4]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Informatics Collaborative was established to facilitate the sharing and routine reuse of clinical data for translational research. Data for this study were obtained from five collaborating hospitals hosting NIHR Biomedical Research Centres (Imperial College Healthcare, London; University College Hospital, London; Oxford University Hospitals, Oxford; King's College Hospital, London; and Guys & St Thomas' Hospital, London) in the UK, which were all tertiary centres with emergency departments.

We defined the target trial as comparing patients who had invasive management for NSTEMI (defined as coronary angiography with or without subsequent revascularisation within 3 days of peak troponin concentration) with patients who did not receive such invasive management. We followed all included patients from the time of their peak troponin concentration until death or censoring in April, 2017.

Eligible patients were 80 years old or older when they underwent troponin measurements and were diagnosed with NSTEMI between 2010 (2008 for University College Hospital) and 2017. Only the first episode of hospital care with troponin measurements was eligible. Classification of NSTEMI was made on the basis of the assigned International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems discharge codes (I21.4; acute subendocardial myocardial infarction). Patients with a concurrent primary diagnosis of an acute illness associated with possible oxygen supply-and-demand mismatch were excluded.

We used the target trial to minimise bias by starting follow up at the time of peak troponin; ensuring that early deaths did not influence the definition of the intervention group, to avoid immortal time bias; excluding patients with a high probability of being assigned to one of the treatment groups (patients included in a trial must be eligible to receive each treatment); using regression models that included the propensity score to control confounding; and doing intention-to-treat analyses, in which patients who received invasive intervention after the first three days were analysed in the non-invasive management group. This study was approved by the London-South East Research Ethics Committee (REC reference: 16/HRA/3327).

Background

High sensitivity troponin assays have become widespread for emergency department evaluation of acute chest pain. We assessed if a high sensitivity troponin under the 99th percentile upper reference limit drawn at 6 h or greater from symptom onset could safely rule out acute coronary syndrome in patients who did not meet the rapid rule-out strategy.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective study examining emergency department patients with chest pain who did not meet rapid-rule out criteria and were admitted for further evaluation. Among these admitted patients, we assessed the rate of clinically relevant adverse cardiac events (death, cardiac or respiratory arrest, STEMI, or life-threatening arrhythmia) and NSTEMI in patients with high sensitivity troponin less than the 99th percentile value obtained after at least 6 h of chest pain.

Results

Out of 1187 patients admitted, we found 30 clinically relevant adverse cardiac events, all of which occurred in patients admitted for another compelling reason or ischemic ECG. 36 patients had an NSTEMI, of which 33 were identified with high sensitivity troponin greater than 99th percentile upper reference limit within 6 h of chest pain onset. This left 0 clinically relevant adverse cardiac events and 3 NSTEMI among the 429 patients with high sensitivity troponin less than the 99th percentile at 6 h and nonischemic ECG and no other compelling reason for admission.

Conclusion

This study assessed patients with chest pain with high sensitivity troponin values between 3 ng/L and the 99th percentile upper reference limit after 6 h of chest pain and found that they have a low rate of clinically relevant adverse cardiac events and NSTEMI.

### Invasive versus non-invasive management of older patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (SENIOR-NSTEMI): a cohort study based on routine clinical data [^18121411]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Previous trials suggest lower long-term risk of mortality after invasive rather than non-invasive management of patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), but the trials excluded very elderly patients. We aimed to estimate the effect of invasive versus non-invasive management within 3 days of peak troponin concentration on the survival of patients aged 80 years or older with NSTEMI.

Methods

Routine clinical data for this study were obtained from five collaborating hospitals hosting NIHR Biomedical Research Centres in the UK (all tertiary centres with emergency departments). Eligible patients were 80 years old or older when they underwent troponin measurements and were diagnosed with NSTEMI between 2010 (2008 for University College Hospital) and 2017. Propensity scores (patients' estimated probability of receiving invasive management) based on pretreatment variables were derived using logistic regression; patients with high probabilities of non-invasive or invasive management were excluded. Patients who died within 3 days of peak troponin concentration without receiving invasive management were assigned to the invasive or non-invasive management groups based on their propensity scores, to mitigate immortal time bias. We estimated mortality hazard ratios comparing invasive with non-invasive management, and compared the rate of hospital admissions for heart failure.

Findings

Of the 1976 patients with NSTEMI, 101 died within 3 days of their peak troponin concentration and 375 were excluded because of extreme propensity scores. The remaining 1500 patients had a median age of 86 (IQR 82–89) years of whom (845 [56%] received non-invasive management. During median follow-up of 3.0 (IQR 1.2–4.8) years, 613 (41%) patients died. The adjusted cumulative 5-year mortality was 36% in the invasive management group and 55% in the non-invasive management group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.55–0.84). Invasive management was associated with lower incidence of hospital admissions for heart failure (adjusted rate ratio compared with non-invasive management 0.67, 95% CI 0.48–0.93).

Interpretation

The survival advantage of invasive compared with non-invasive management appears to extend to patients with NSTEMI who are aged 80 years or older.

### Resolving the observe zone: validation of the ESC 0 / 3-hour and the APACE criteria for NSTEMI triage [^42c7b4c3]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

However, at present, there is no consensus on the criteria that are needed to optimally discriminate between an acute and a chronic troponin elevation within the OZ. In addition, no evidence exists on the performance, effectiveness and safety of a modification of the 0/3-hour algorithm in the not uncommon setting in real-world practice where the third blood sample had been collected more than 3 hours after the baseline sample. A measurement of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) at 6 hours instead of 3 hours had already been proposed in the past in an opinion paper from the Study Group on Biomarkers in Cardiology of the ESC Working Group on Acute Cardiac Careto permit a diagnosis if hs-cTn is not available at 3 hours.

Therefore, the present substudy of the RAPID-CPU (High Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin T assay for rapid Rule-out - Chest Pain Unit) registry had two objectives: First, to compare the performance, effectiveness and safety of the two different validated algorithms for the triage of patients in the OZ, and second, to test whether an extension of the time interval to the third troponin measurement beyond 3 hours is effective and safe.

### Incidence and 1-year prognostic of unstable angina after high-sensitivity troponin assessment [^40d1e562]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Unstable angina (UA) is defined as myocardial ischaemia at rest or with minimal effort in the absence of acute cardiomyocyte injury and necrosis. UA is usually considered as a separate entity with distinct characteristics from non‐ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and a different pathophysiology, with platelet thrombus predominating and no detectable myonecrosis. UA is diagnosed when there are new or worsening symptoms of ischaemia or when there is a change in symptoms, with or without ischaemic changes on the ECG and a non‐elevated (below the 99th percentile) high‐sensitive troponin (hs‐cTn) concentrations with cut‐off concentrations which are assay specifics. When hs‐cTn is negative, a third measurement at 3 h and an echocardiogram are proposed if there is a strong clinical suspicion of coronary pathology. UA may also be considered when hs‐cTn ≥ 99th percentile but mildly elevated and without significant rise between 2 dosages performed within 1 and 3 h after the first one. Among unselected patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the introduction of ultrasensitive troponin measurement in place of standard troponin assays resulted in an increase in the sensitivity of detection of myocardial necrosis and a consequent decrease in the diagnosis of UA in favour to NSTEMI. The 2017 and the updated 2023 European guidelines for the management of NSTE‐ACS recommend an invasive strategy during hospital admission for NSTEMI whereas individual assessment is proposed for UA including delayed coronary angiography or a non‐invasive functional test depending on the clinical suspicion, without a precise strategy proposed. In terms of prognosis, numerous studies or registries showed lower 1‐year mortality, but a similar rate of non‐fatal infarction compared with NSTEMI, whereas numerous studies were performed before the use of hs‐cTn as a screening test and/or with absence of objective criteria for the diagnosis of UA. Indeed, previous studies showed heterogeneity of patients with the diagnostic of UA and those with normal angiography or non‐significant coronary stenosis may include patients with misdiagnosis.

This study aimed to prospectively evaluate clinical characteristics and 1 year prognostic of a contemporary population of patients with UA defined according to guidelines and associated with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) within a non‐selected population of patients admitted in the emergency department of cardiology for ACS.

### National trends in emergency department care processes for acute myocardial infarction in the United States, 2005 to 2015 [^e7a69a56]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

An increase in the incidence of ED visits for NSTEMI may be explained by a number of factors as well. The study period saw widespread adoption of rapid troponin testing in the ED, in keeping with evolving definitions of AMI relying on ischemic symptoms, ECG findings, and troponin measurement. 37, 38 Increasing use of troponin testing may have led to an increase in the number of cases qualifying as an NSTEMI diagnosis, even though elevations in serum troponin may arise from a variety of clinical conditions other than AMI. Indeed, prior work prospectively evaluating definitions of AMI that rely on troponin measurement demonstrated that the application of these criteria results in large increases in observed rates of myocardial infarction. 39 The observed increase in incidence of ED visits for NSTEMI could also reflect a true epidemiologic trend, as recent data has indicated a shift toward AMI occurring among younger demographic groups. 40 Finally, from a clinical diagnosis perspective, the diagnosis of NSTEMI often relies on serial biomarker measurements conducted during hospitalization — data that the NHAMCS, which only addresses ED care delivery, does not contain, and which may actually have led to undercounting of NSTEMI cases.

Our study also provides real‐world insights into the timeliness of ED AMI care. Recent work in a clinical registry has demonstrated that efforts aimed at regionalizing STEMI care — efforts that involve EMS, ED providers, and hospital systems — have resulted in a nationwide decrease in median first medical contact‐to‐device time. 7 In focusing on a longer and more recent time period, our study expands upon these findings, demonstrating decreases in ED length of stay for patients with STEMI as well. Among the subset of patients with STEMI sent for cardiac catheterization directly from the ED, median ED length of stay decreased dramatically, likely indicating the success of efforts to streamline ED STEMI care processes. Importantly, we observe these trends among the cohort of patients with STEMI who arrived by EMS as well those who did not.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study population

All patients diagnosed with NSTEMI who were admitted to a tertiary care intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) at Shaare Zedek Medical Center between July 2019 and July 2022 were prospectively recruited.

The diagnosis of NSTEMI was based on symptoms of myocardial ischemia, new ECG ischemic changes, and a rising and/or falling pattern of high‐sensitivity troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL, according to the ESC guidelines for ACS.

2.2 Data collection

Data were anonymously documented in the ICCU by the local coordinator and prospectively submitted into an electronic case report form. Data were checked for accuracy and out‐of‐range values by the coordinating unit. Demographic data, presenting symptoms, comorbid conditions, and physical examination were systematically recorded. Laboratory, imaging, angiographic results, and clinical course data were collected as well.

Patients were followed for up to 3 years after presentation. Patients were divided into four quartiles according to their hs‐cTnI level on admission. The first quartile served as the reference group. Hs‐cTnI assay was determined in a central laboratory (ARCHITECT STAT hs‐cTnI immunoassay) with a 99th percentile reference level of 17 ng/L for females and 35 ng/L for males. Invasive and pharmacologic treatments were in accordance with the European Society of Cardiology guidelines for ACS.

The Institutional Review Board approved the study based on strict maintenance of participants' anonymity by de‐identifying during database analysis. No individual consent was obtained. Moreover, the authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. No funding was applied to the study. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.

2.3 Study outcomes

The primary outcome was all‐cause mortality with a follow‐up time of up to 3 years. The overall mortality rate was determined from the Israeli Ministry of Internal Affairs.

### Resolving the observe zone: validation of the ESC 0 / 3-hour and the APACE criteria for NSTEMI triage [^2621f96e]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin tests have enhanced early myocardial infarction diagnosis, yet many patients still land in the observe zone (OZ). Guidelines suggest a 3-hour troponin measurement for those in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 0/1 hour-algorithm's OZ, but evidence on extended troponin testing times and their impact on diagnostic accuracy and outcomes remains sparse.

Methods

Patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome were consecutively enrolled in a single-centre observational study. The triage protocol allowed an optional third troponin measurement at 3 hours or later to evaluate the performance and safety of two validated triage algorithms used to resolve the OZ.

Results

Of the 4605 patients, 948 were triaged to the OZ (20.6%). The prevalence of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) within the OZ was 7.2%. 212 patients (22.3% of OZ patients) had a third troponin measurement and were included in the comparative analysis. For diagnosing NSTEMI, the ESC 0/3-hour criteria showed lower sensitivity (69.4%) than the criteria defined in the Advantageous Predictors of Acute Coronary Syndromes Evaluation (APACE) study (86.1%, p = 0.053), with both having high negative predictive value (93.5% vs 87.5%, p = 0.339). By definition, the ESC 0/3-hour algorithm categorises all patients into rule-in or rule-out, eliminating the need for an OZ, whereas 55.6% of patients remained in the OZ with the APACE criteria. Mortality rates in the OZ were similar across different timing protocols, with 30-day rates of 0.78% for third blood draws within 210 min (n = 128) and 1.19% for those over 210 min (n = 84); 3-year rates were 5.51% and 4.82%, confirming the safety of extended sampling.

Conclusions

Although the ESC 0/3-hour criteria have a lower sensitivity than the APACE criteria, it is by definition more effective because it does not leave patients in the OZ. Extending the timing for the third troponin measurement beyond 3 hours proves to be effective and safe, supporting its implementation in clinical practice.

3 The ACS Spectrum

In advancing the science and implementation, the 2023 Guidelines offer a conceptual approach of five items: think A.C.S. at the initial assessment, think invasive management, think antithrombotic therapy, think revascularization, and think secondary prevention. To further explain the thinking A.C.S. at the initial evaluation of patients with suspected ACS, "A" relates to an abnormal ECG (performing an ECG urgently to assess for evidence of ischemia or other abnormalities), "C" considers the clinical context and other available investigations, and "S" for stable, performing an examination to assess whether the patient is clinically and vitally stable.

The guidelines (Figure 1) graphically explore the spectrum of clinical presentations such that the patient may initially have had chest pain, but at presentation either has minimal or no symptoms; to the patient with increasing chest pain or other symptoms; to the patient with persistent chest pain or symptoms; to the patient with cardiogenic shock or acute heart failure; and finally, the patient who presents with a cardiac arrest. The ECG may be normal at presentation, may have ST segment depression as potentially an NSTEMI, or may have ST segment elevation leading to the immediate diagnosis of STEMI. If the high‐sensitivity troponin is not elevated, the resultant diagnosis is unstable angina, but the characteristic rise and fall of high‐sensitivity troponin does not differentiate between NSTEMI and STEMI.

### Comparison of the prognostic value of peak creatine kinase-MB and troponin levels among patients with acute myocardial infarction: a report from the acute coronary treatment and intervention outcomes network registry-get with the guidelines [^350498dc]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although peak creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) and troponin levels have been correlated with mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the independent prognostic implications of these markers have not been compared.

Hypothesis

We hypothesized that in patients with AMI, peak troponin levels (as compared to peak CK-MB levels) would have greater prognostic value.

Methods

We examined AMI patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ACTION Registry-GWTG (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With The Guidelines) with CK-MB and troponin I levels recorded, excluding patients who were transferred in or out. Peak marker levels, standardized by the local laboratory upper limit of normal and assay standard deviation, were fitted into the previously validated ACTION Registry-GWTG mortality model to compare prognostic value.

Results

Between January 2007 and March 2009, 16 009 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 26854 non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients were identified. Peak marker ratios were directly associated with in-hospital mortality in both STEMI and NSTEMI patients. Peak CK-MB had slightly greater discrimination compared with peak troponin I in predicting mortality in both STEMI (model C-statistic 0.881 vs 0.877, P = 0.011) and NSTEMI (C-statistic 0.831 vs 0.824, P = 0.001) patients.

Conclusions

Both peak CK-MB and peak troponin I levels are independently associated with in-hospital mortality in this large contemporary database of AMI patients treated in routine practice. Peak marker values slightly improved model performance in prognosticating in-hospital mortality; the incremental value was higher with CK-MB than with troponin I. These findings may help to guide future risk stratification algorithms and contribute to more efficient use of serial cardiac marker measurements in clinical practice.

Abstract

Background

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin tests have enhanced early myocardial infarction diagnosis, yet many patients still land in the observe zone (OZ). Guidelines suggest a 3-hour troponin measurement for those in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 0/1 hour-algorithm's OZ, but evidence on extended troponin testing times and their impact on diagnostic accuracy and outcomes remains sparse.

Methods

Patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome were consecutively enrolled in a single-centre observational study. The triage protocol allowed an optional third troponin measurement at 3 hours or later to evaluate the performance and safety of two validated triage algorithms used to resolve the OZ.

Of the 4605 patients, 948 were triaged to the OZ (20.6%). The prevalence of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) within the OZ was 7.2%. 212 patients (22.3% of OZ patients) had a third troponin measurement and were included in the comparative analysis.

Conclusions

Although the ESC 0/3-hour criteria have a lower sensitivity than the APACE criteria, it is by definition more effective because it does not leave patients in the OZ. Extending the timing for the third troponin measurement beyond 3 hours proves to be effective and safe, supporting its implementation in clinical practice.

### Influence of age and renal function on high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [^538a2abd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Concerns have been raised about the performance of highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays to accurately detect acute myocardial infarction (AMI), particularly in non-ST segment elevation (NSTEMI), in elderly patients, and in patients with renal failure. We evaluated whether increased age and low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alter diagnostic performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (HScTnT). In a prospective multicentric study, HScTnT levels were measured blindly at presentation in patients with acute chest pain. Three hundred and sixty-seven patients were enrolled, including 84 patients ≥ 70 years. Final diagnosis was AMI for 57 patients (16%) and NSTEMI for 43 patients (12%). NSTEMI was more frequent in elderly patients (p = 0.008). Sensitivity and specificity of HScTnT > 14 ng/L at admission for AMI were 96% and 51% in patients ≥ 70 years versus 91% (NS) and 88% (p < 0.0001) in younger patients; the same observations were done for the diagnosis of NSTEMI. Given an HScTnT > 53.5 ng/L for the diagnosis of AMI and NSTEMI, respective sensitivities were 87% and 84% and respective specificities were 87% and 87% in elderly patients. Using a cutoff at 35.8 ng/L (for AMI) or 43.2 ng/L (for NSTEMI), sensitivities were 94% and 92%, and specificities were 86% and 88% in patients with low eGFR. Older age, but not low eGFR, was an independent predictive factor of an elevated HScTnT at admission (odds ratio 2.2 [1.2–3.9], p = 0.007). In conclusion, adapted thresholds of HScTnT are required for an accurate diagnosis of AMI/NSTEMI in patients aged ≥ 70 and in those with low eGFR.

### Invasive versus non-invasive management of older patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (SENIOR-NSTEMI): a cohort study based on routine clinical data [^55e3845c]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcome was the number of hospital admissions for heart failure during follow-up. In post-hoc analyses we examined new hospital admissions for bleeding, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and further invasive management. Bleeding was defined as minor or major bleeding. Vital status was ascertained using the national Patient Demographic Service, which incorporates national death registry information and local notifications. We could only ascertain heart failure admission using electronic health record data in the hospital where their initial NSTEMI diagnosis was made.

Statistical analysis

In a randomised trial, follow-up starts at the time that treatment strategies are assigned. In the absence of such assignment, follow-up in patients who do not undergo invasive management is consistent with both treatment strategies for the first 3 days. Classification of patients who die within 3 days of peak troponin concentration without invasive management to the comparison group can cause an immortal time bias because some patients could have had invasive management had they not died. To limit such bias, patients who died within 3 days of peak troponin concentration were excluded from the initial modelling steps, then included separately.

Propensity scores (patients' estimated probability of receiving invasive management) were derived using logistic regression, for patients who did not die within 3 days of peak troponin concentration. The final propensity score model was based on backwards stepwise selection, with a p value threshold of 0.2. We considered the following pretreatment variable groups: patient demographics, blood test results, cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, respiratory disease, neurological disease, psychiatric disease, other comorbidities, and markers of frailty. The Comorbidity Domain of the Frailty Index was calculated as a score ranging between 0 and 1. All the variables considered and those selected into the propensity score model are listed in the appendix (pp 9–10). Non-linear relationships were modelled using smoothing splines. Analyses used the first measurement of each haematological and biochemical blood test during the hospital care episode, except for troponin concentration for which the peak measurement was used.

### Ability of minor elevations of troponins I and T to predict benefit from an early invasive strategy in patients with unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction: results from a randomized trial [^1afa2e90]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Cardiac troponins I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) are useful for assessing prognosis in patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI). However, the use of cardiac troponins for predicting benefit of an invasive vs conservative strategy in this patient population is not clear.

Objective

To prospectively test whether an early invasive strategy provides greater benefit than a conservative strategy in acute coronary syndrome patients with elevated baseline troponin levels.

Design

Prospective, randomized trial conducted from December 1997 to June 2000.

Setting

One hundred sixty-nine community and tertiary care hospitals in 9 countries.

Participants

A total of 2220 patients with acute coronary syndrome were enrolled. Baseline troponin level data were available for analysis in 1821, and 1780 completed the 6-month follow-up.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive (1) an early invasive strategy of coronary angiography between 4 and 48 hours after randomization and revascularization when feasible based on coronary anatomy (n = 1114) or (2) a conservative strategy of medical treatment and, if stable, predischarge exercise tolerance testing (n = 1106). Conservative strategy patients underwent coronary angiography and revascularization only if they manifested recurrent ischemia at rest or on provocative testing.

Main Outcome Measure

Composite end point of death, MI, or rehospitalization for acute coronary syndrome at 6 months.

Results

Patients with a cTnI level of 0.1 ng/mL or more (n = 1087) experienced a significant reduction in the primary end point with the invasive vs conservative strategy (15.3% vs 25.0%; odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40–0.73). Patients with cTnI levels of less than 0.1 ng/mL had no detectable benefit from early invasive management (16.0% vs 12.4%; OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.89–2.05; P < .001 for interaction). The benefit of invasive vs conservative management through 30 days was evident even among patients with low-level (0.1–0.4 ng/mL) cTnI elevation (4.4% vs 16.5%; OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.08–0.69). Directionally similar results were observed with cTnT.

Conclusion

In patients with clinically documented acute coronary syndrome who are treated with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, even small elevations in cTnI and cTnT identify high-risk patients who derive a large clinical benefit from an early invasive strategy.

A direct rule‐out algorithm using < 2 ng/L as the cutoff showed a diagnostic sensitivity > 99%, in accordance with the prespecified criteria (Table 1). The 0/1 hour algorithm was developed in a similar way by calculating the number of NSTEMIs ruled out at different admission and delta value concentrations combined (see Tables S4 and S5). The optimal rule‐out algorithm was a baseline cTnI (Sgx) concentration < 10 ng/L and a delta value of < 3 ng/L (Table 2). This algorithm did not rule out any patients with NSTEMI and consequently had a sensitivity of 100%, with a corresponding specificity of 89%. Of note, this decision threshold is higher than the 99th percentile of the assay.

If 8.67 ng/L was used as the baseline concentration in the algorithm, the resulting sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 87%. Regarding rule‐in, the optimal algorithm showed a specificity of 97% using a baseline concentration of ≥ 70 ng/L or a delta value of ≥ 5 ng/L (Table S5 and Table 2) as cutoffs. An alternative algorithm using a lower baseline concentration of ≥ 30 ng/L or a delta value of ≥ 5 ng/L showed similar (within 95% CIs) specificity and sensitivity.

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^d45cd532]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The main findings of our study are (a) we have demonstrated that in patients presenting with NSTEMI, elevated baseline hs‐cTnI levels were associated with increased risk of 3‐year all‐cause mortality, (b) there was a dose–response relationship between baseline hs‐CTnI and mortality with highest risk of mortality observed in patients with highest baseline hs‐cTnI levels, and (c) even after adjusting the baseline hs‐cTnI mortality association for potential confounders, initial high hs‐cTnI levels remained an independent predictor of all‐cause mortality.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the association between hs‐cTnI levels upon hospital admission and long‐term overall survival in patients diagnosed with NSTEMI. Prior studies that have examined the association between initial troponin levels and mortality have included patients with a broader range of diagnoses, encompassing all types of acute myocardial infractionor patients presenting with chest pain. Another significant distinction between our study and previous ones is our focus on examining troponin levels at presentation, as opposed to peak troponin levels or changes in troponin during admission course, which has been linked to adverse clinical outcomes and mortality.

Our first finding further supports the conclusions of Antman et al. regarding the role of troponin level upon hospital admission and short‐term mortality in ACS patients. The identification of a higher‐risk subgroup with hs‐cTnI levels greater or equal to 2878 ng/L is very intriguing, as this subgroup did not exhibit any distinctive baseline characteristics or complications. We hypothesized that the heightened risk of mortality in those patients is likely a result of later changes that occur in the myocardium of NSTEMI patients, such as remodeling, which is related to elevated risk of death. Hence, there were no between‐group differences in the short‐term period. In a large observational study comprising 4123 patients with non‐ST‐segment elevation ACS, Kontos et al. demonstrated a gradual rise in cardiac mortality as peak cTnI levels increased at 30‐day and 6‐month follow‐up intervals. Our results are consistent with these findings. However, our aim was to investigate specifically the association between initial cTnI levels and mortality over a longer follow‐up period. From a clinical perspective, our results might have greater clinical implications due to the dynamic nature of ACS patients.

### Novel criteria for the observe-zone of the ESC 0 / 1h-hs-cTnT algorithm [^eef644dc]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommend a 3h cardiac troponin determination in patients triaged to the observe-zone of the ESC 0/1h-algorithm; however, no specific cutoff for further triage is endorsed. Recently, a specific cutoff for 0/3h high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) change (7 ng/L) was proposed, warranting external validation.

Methods

Patients presenting with acute chest discomfort to the emergency department were prospectively enrolled into an international multicenter diagnostic study. Final diagnoses were centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists applying the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction, on the basis of complete cardiac workup, cardiac imaging, and serial hs-cTnT. Hs-cTnT concentrations were measured at presentation, after 1 hour, and after 3 hours. The objective was to externally validate the proposed cutoff, and if necessary, derive and internally as well as externally validate novel 0/3h-criteria for the observe-zone of the ESC 0/1h-hs-cTnT-algorithm in an independent multicenter cohort.

Results

Among 2076 eligible patients, application of the ESC 0/1h-hs-cTnT-algorithm triaged 1512 patients (72.8%) to either rule out or rule in NSTEMI, leaving 564 patients (27.2%) in the observe-zone (adjudicated NSTEMI prevalence, 120/564 patients, 21.3%). The suggested 0/3h-hs-cTnT-change of < 7 ng/L triaged 517 patients (91.7%) toward rule-out, resulting in a sensitivity of 33.3% (95% CI, 25.5–42.2), missing 80 patients with NSTEMI, and ≥ 7 ng/L triaged 47 patients toward rule-in (8.3%), resulting in a specificity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8–99.2). Novel derived 0/3h-criteria for the observe-zone patients ruled out NSTEMI with a 3h hs-cTnT concentration < 15 ng/L and a 0/3h-hs-cTnT absolute change < 4 ng/L, triaging 138 patients (25%) toward rule-out, resulting in a sensitivity of 99.2% (95% CI, 96.0–99.9), missing 1 patient with NSTEMI. A 0/3h-hs-cTnT absolute change ≥ 6 ng/L triaged 63 patients (11.2%) toward rule-in, resulting in a specificity of 98% (95% CI, 96.2–98.9) Thereby, the novel 0/3h-criteria reduced the number of patients in the observe zone by 36%s and the number of type 1 myocardial infarction by 50%. Findings were confirmed in both internal and external validation.

Conclusions

A combination of a 3h-hs-cTnT concentration (< 15 ng/L) and a 0/3h absolute change (< 4 ng/L) is necessary to safely rule out NSTEMI in patients remaining in the observe-zone of the ESC 0/1h-hs-cTnT-algorithm. Registration: URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT00470587.

Troponin testing in suspected myocardial ischemia — assay definition and variability states that elevated or abnormal troponin levels are defined as exceeding the 99th percentile cutoff point for each specific assay and highlights substantial variability across studies in troponin I versus T, high sensitivity versus standard conventional troponin, and bedside point-of-care versus lab-based testing.

Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction

As the name states, NSTEMI is myocardial infarction in which the elevation — or for that matter, depression — of ST segments is not significantly different from normal and thus the reason that the condition is not identified in patients presenting with chest pain. Typically, chest-pain patients without significantly abnormal ST elevation are monitored, potentially for hours, until other tests confirm the presence of acute infarction (eg, elevated troponin levels). There are several explanations that account for the absence of abnormal ST elevation in acute MI. These include numerous possibilities: that the infarcts may be relatively small; that the location of the infarcts may be in locations only weakly sensed by the lead fields of the standard 12-lead ECG; or that the infarct is slowly developing. Importantly, this does not mean that the QRS and ST-T waves of the ECG do not change dynamically during the infarct's time course. At the cellular level, acute ischemia results in changes in action potential amplitude, duration, triangularization or sloping of the plateau, and even reduction in action potential (AP) upstroke velocity in affected cells. Consequently, the ECG shows a dynamic progression of changes in ST level and slope as well as T wave amplitude and morphology, in addition to widening of the QRS as a consequence of conduction slowing — all with different time course and magnitude. In NSTEMI all of these may be present although much more subtly than in ST-segment myocardial infarction, in which the ST segments show definitive elevation. Thus, any method that is sensitive to and quantitates these changes in QRS and ST-T waveform should greatly improve the sensitivity of the test for infarction as well as drastically reduce the time required to diagnose the syndrome.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^c985dc08]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

The introduction of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing into clinical practice has transformed the assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department. Most patients can be discharged using accelerated diagnostic pathways that do not require hospital admission for peak cardiac troponin testing. These pathways are not recommended for patients with ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, but given that interpretation is dependent on experience, there is a risk patients could be inappropriately assessed.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Baseline characteristics

A total of 665 patients with NSTEMI were screened; of them, 27 were excluded due to missing data, and 94 were excluded due to loss of follow‐up. Hence, the final study population included 544 patients. The mean age was 68 (± 11) years old and 122 (22%) were female. Patients' characteristics are present in Table 1. Three hundred and fifty (64%) patients suffered from hypertension, 233 (43%) from DM, 342 (63%) from dyslipidemia, 184 (34%) patients were active smokers, and 39 (7%) patients had previous MI.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics.

3.2 Hs‐cTnI levels at presentation

Hs‐cTnI levels in each quartile were: (a) ≤ 122, (b) 123–680, (c) 681–2877, and (d) ≥ 2878 ng/L. The median initial hs‐cTnI level was 680 ng/L (range 0–150 008 ng/L). There were no differences regarding age or comorbidities between the four initial hs‐cTnI level quartiles. Prevalence of male gender, higher peak level of hs‐cTnI during admission, and C‐reactive protein (CRP) were greater in the fourth quartile than in the first quartile (Table 1). Stratifying NSTEMI patients based on gender resulted in distinct cutpoints. In male patients, the cutpoints were as follows: (a) ≤ 217, (b) 218–698L, (c) 699–3276, and (d) ≥ 3277 ng/L. Conversely, female patients exhibited lower values, as anticipated, with the following cutpoints: (a) ≤ 100, (b) 101–612, (c) 613–2449, and (d) ≥ 2450 ng/L.

### Unstable angina pectoris with myocardial injury versus myocardial infarction in the era of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin [^f463dcbb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

It is unknown whether outcomes in patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP) and myocardial injury are different from outcomes in patients with non-ST-segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with low peak concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT). This study aimed to compare the prognosis in patients with UAP and evidence of myocardial injury, with prognosis in patients with NSTEMI and different peak hs-cTnT concentrations. All visits to 7 different emergency departments in Sweden from December 9, 2009 to December 31, 2016 were identified (n = 5,225,075). We included all hospitalized patients with hs-cTnT > 14 ng/L and a diagnosis of UAP or NSTEMI, with ≥ 2 hours-cTnT measurements. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events, in patients with NSTEMI categorized according to peak hs-cTnT concentrations, compared with patients with UAP. Altogether, 11,944 patients were included, of whom 1,253 (10%) received a diagnosis of UAP. During a median follow-up of 3.0 years (interquartile [IQR] 1.6 to 4.7), 3,297 patients died. There was no difference comparing patients with NSTEMI with peak hs-cTnT of 15 to 49 ng/L to patients with UAP, with regards to long-term cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.15; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.56), but the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction was higher in patients with NSTEMI (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.00), and the risk of heart failure hospitalization slightly lower (HR 0.80, 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.99). In conclusion, patients with UAP and myocardial injury have a similar risk of death after discharge, but a lower risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and a marginally higher risk of heart failure, compared with patients with NSTEMI with moderately elevated hs-cTnT levels.

### Clinical utility of ventricular repolarization dispersion for real-time detection of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in emergency departments [^a0972828]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Every day, more than 2500 Americans suffer an ischemic coronary event, and more than 1400 of them will die of subsequent complications. This makes acute myocardial infarction (MI) the leading cause of death in the United States; reducing damage associated with MI is a critical step in addressing the issue. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an integral part of MI detection and treatment, with immediate decisions about acute coronary interventions based on the presence or absence of ST elevation (STE). Treatment guidelines for acute and ongoing care are based on ECG categorization of STEMI and non-STEMI (or NSTEMI).–Treatment strategy in NSTEMI is debatable, with growing evidence suggesting long-term benefit with appropriate early invasive strategy (< 2 hours) in selected high-risk NSTEMI patients (ie, high ischemic burden). However, there are currently no precise ECG patterns that can detect or quantify such ischemic burden in NSTEMI, and NSTEMI can only be recognized by a clinical scenario combined with the presence of serum biomarkers of myocardial necrosis (ie, troponin). A specific ECG marker of ischemia in the absence of STE would have the potential to improve the speed and accuracy of detecting NSTEMI and selecting proper candidates for immediate revascularization.

### Acute coronary syndromes [^26863a0d]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Although substantial progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndromes, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death globally, with nearly half of these deaths due to ischaemic heart disease. The broadening availability of high-sensitivity troponin assays has allowed for rapid rule-out algorithms in patients with suspected non-ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for 12 months following an acute coronary syndrome in most patients, and additional secondary prevention measures including intensive lipid-lowering therapy (LDL-C < 1.4 mmol/L), neurohormonal agents, and lifestyle modification, are crucial. The scientific evidence for diagnosis and management of acute coronary syndromes continues to evolve rapidly, including adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted all aspects of care. This Seminar provides a clinically relevant overview of the pathobiology, diagnosis, and management of acute coronary syndromes, and describes key scientific advances.

### Diagnostic accuracy of baseline troponin and troponin change for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction complicated with heart failure [^24d623f5]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

In our cohort, diagnosis of acute MI was done in a similar proportion among patients with and without diagnostic criteria of HF (table 2).

Patients with HF and higher BNP levels showed more severe markers of myocardial dysfunction, corroborated by a lower LVEF, higher prevalence of fluid congestion at the chest X-ray and lower eGFR (table 1).

Our analysis confirmed that patients with HF and higher BNP values present with higher baseline TnI levels and that baseline Tn testing was less accurate in identifying patients with MI in the overall population and especially in those with higher degrees of HF (table 3).

On the other hand, absolute and relative changes in TnI were accurate in predicting MI in this group, but a smaller relative change in TnI compared with those with less severe and without HF was observed. A possible explanation could be that in patients with HF, the already increased values of Tn at baseline may mask the change in Tn due to the MI. On this basis, caution should be advised, particularly in judging small relative changes in Tn in those with acute HF.

The findings from the analyses remained consistent even following adjustments for primary confounding factors and determinants of BNP levels, such as age, gender and eGFR. Stratification based on a history of HF and CAD was also undertaken and gave consistent results.

Furthermore, we found that the best cut-off for specificity and sensitivity of Tn change to discriminate MI in patients with more severe HF was lower than those without HF (table 3).

Similarly, a previous report analysing the diagnostic accuracy of a Tn algorithm for non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) in patients with chronic kidney disease, which is another condition that may increase baseline Tn, showed that specificity to detect NSTEMI was reduced in patients with renal failure and suggested the use of different cut-off values to improve the accuracy of NSTEMI identification.

Investigational hs-cTn Measurements

Blood samples for determination of hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI were collected into tubes containing potassium EDTA (as an anticoagulant) or serum gel (as a clot activator) at presentation to the ED and serially thereafter. Serial sampling was discontinued when a patient was discharged or transferred to the catheter laboratory for treatment. After centrifugation, samples were either analyzed directly or frozen at −80°C until they were assayed in a blinded fashion in a dedicated core laboratory.

According to the manufacturer, the hs-cTnT assay (Elecsys 2010 high-sensitivity troponin T, Roche Diagnostics) has a 99th percentile concentration of 14 ng/L with a corresponding coefficient of variation of 10% at 13 ng/L. Limit of blank and limit of detection have been determined to be 3 ng/L and 5 ng/L. None of the hs-cTnT measurements in this analysis were affected by the 2010 to 2012 calibration shift. –

The hs-cTnI assay (ARCHITECT High Sensitive STAT Troponin I, Abbott Laboratories) has a 99th percentile concentration of 26.2 ng/L with a corresponding coefficient of variation of < 5% and a limit of detection of 1.9 ng/L. –

Distributions of the latest study blood samples according to time since ED presentation and time since chest pain onset are listed in.

ESC hs-cTn 0/1-Hour Algorithm

Recent studies have highlighted fundamental differences in mortality risk, pathophysiology, and benefit from early coronary angiography and intense dual-antiplatelet therapy between patients with NSTEMI and patients with true unstable angina (not including patients with small NSTEMIs missed by conventional cTn assays). Accordingly, the immediate task in the ED is to detect NSTEMI. Thus, the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm was designed to detect NSTEMI. The diagnosis of unstable angina is based on clinical assessment, ECG, and rule-out of NSTEMI in the ED, as well as cardiac imaging performed either in-hospital or on an outpatient basis.

The ESC hs-cTn 0/1-hour algorithm, which should always be used in conjunction with all clinical information available, including the ECG, triages patients presenting with suspected NSTEMI toward rule-out, observe, and rule-in based on assay-specific levels of hs-cTn obtained at presentation and after 1 hour. The assay-specific cutoff levels were derived in diagnostic studies enrolling unselected patients with mostly normal renal function.–

Adjudication of the final diagnosis

Adjudication of the final diagnosis was performed centrally in the core laboratory according to current guidelines and the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction, as previously reported in detail. To address the uncommon but previously described phenomenon of discrepant results for hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI and the corresponding possible underestimation of the true performance of hs-cTnI-based algorithms using an adjudication based partly on serial hs-cTnT measurements, we performed a second adjudication using serial hs-cTnI blood concentrations from study samples, which was used for all hs-cTnI-based analyses. The most common reasons for missing samples after 1 hour or later were: 1) very early discharge; 2) early transfer to the catheterization laboratory or coronary care unit; 3) diagnostic procedures around the time window that precluded blood draws; and 4) patient refusal to undergo further blood sampling for the study. Additional information regarding the central diagnostic adjudication, blood samplings, laboratory methods, and follow-up can be found in the Supplemental Methods.

Clinical endpoints

The primary diagnostic endpoint was AMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] or non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]) at presentation to the ED, stratified by history of cancer. When assessing the diagnostic performance of hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI and the ESC 0/1-hour hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI algorithms, the diagnostic endpoint was NSTEMI (types 1 and 2) at presentation to the ED, as in the case of STEMI, hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI concentrations are usually not required for its early diagnosis.

### Effectiveness of the GRACE risk score according to troponin elevation in patients admitted with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome: a post hoc analysis of the UKGRIS parallel group cluster randomised controlled trial [^adb9bb36]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Troponin elevation in the context of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) is associated with high risk of adverse clinical events, including recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure and death. The management of patients with NSTEACS is guided by their estimated risk of future ischaemic events, with observational studies showing that failure to follow guideline recommendations is associated with excess mortality. Accordingly, risk stratification using the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) Risk Score (GRS) to guide the management of patients with NSTEACS is advocated in clinical guidelines.

The Australian GRACE Risk Intervention Study (AGRIS) trial, which randomised 2318 patients with either ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome or NSTEACS to GRS use or standard care, found that implementation of the GRS was associated with an increase in early invasive treatment, especially for NSTEACS but not other aspects of care, and the intervention was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in death or MI at 12 months. In the UK GRACE Risk Score (UKGRIS) randomised controlled trial, implementation of the GRS compared with standard care did not improve adherence to guideline-recommended management or reduce cardiovascular events at 12 months in patients admitted with suspected NSTEACS.

Troponin elevation in the context of suspected NSTEACS may signify non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI), and in this population, the implementation of GRS could impact adherence to guideline-recommended management and outcomes. As part of the planned analysis for the first coprimary outcome measure, we performed subgroup analyses, of which one (elevated troponin on admission) significantly modified the effect of randomisation to GRACE in increasing uptake of care processes. Here, we report a post hoc analysis according to troponin elevation and extend the routine healthcare data outcomes capture to at least 24 months from the date of randomisation.

3 ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH NSTEMI

The treatment‐risk paradox in patients with NSTEMI is a global problem that is influenced by the four "P" factors discussed in this paper: p atient characteristics, p hysician guideline implementation, p rocedure availability, and p olicy. There are several approaches that can be used to help address these challenges for the treatment of patients with NSTEMI.

It is noteworthy to mention that the definition of non‐ST‐segment elevation ACS refers to both patients with NSTEMI and patients with unstable angina. This definition highlights the heterogeneity of patient characteristics and the wide variation in risk in these patients. For patients with NSTEMI who experience chest pain coupled with elevated serum troponin levels and stenosis, but no ST‐segment elevation on the ECG, a potent P2Y 12 inhibitor should be the preferred antiplatelet treatment for all patients; except for those at very high bleeding risk or with other contraindications. In contrast, patients with a diagnosis of unstable angina who present with chest pain, without elevated troponin levels or ischemic ECG changes, are a heterogeneous group that requires confirmation of the presence of coronary artery disease with appropriate risk stratification and treatment.

The ESC 0/1-hour protocol was used in the emergency department (ED) as the default protocol after June 2016. The time for the second and eventually third troponin measurements was not supervised. In addition, a third blood draw among patients triaged into the OZ was not mandatory per 2015 ESC Guidelines on NSTE-ACS, and the number and timing of serial measurements were executed at the discretion of the treating physician. In clinical routine, hs-cTnT was measured using the Roche fifth-generation Elecsys hs-cTnT (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) on a COBAS 411 or a COBAS E601 analyser. The limit of blank and the limit of detection (LoD) were established at 3 and 5 ng/L (COBAS 411) or 2 and 3 ng/L (COBAS E601), respectively. In clinical routine, an LoD of 5 ng/L was applied. The coefficient of variation was determined to be 10% at a concentration of 13 ng/L based on 100 measurements. In accordance with manufacturer guidelines, a 99th percentile upper reference limit of 14 ng/L was applied. Sex-specific cut-offs were not used in this analysis. Troponin values were reported to one decimal place in our retrospective analysis. An MI was ruled out if the initial hs-cTnT was below the LoD (5 ng/L) in patients presenting more than 3 hours after the onset of symptoms, or in the presence of an initial hs-cTnT < 12 ng/L and a concentration change < 3 ng/L. Patients were classified as 'rule-in' if the initial hs-cTnT was greater than or equal to 52 ng/L, or in the presence of a concentration change of 5 ng/L or more. As classification algorithms were used with respect to sampling time, the ESC 0/2-hour protocol was applied if the second hs-cTnT measurement was taken after 2 hours. All applied rules are shown in online supplemental table S1. Patients who could not be assigned to either the rule-out or rule-in category were classified into the OZ. The final diagnosis was made by the treating physician based on the third universal definition of myocardial infarction (UDMI) and all available clinical information. For research purposes, all diagnoses were readjudicated by two cardiologists who were not involved in the initial management. In case of uncertainty, a third cardiologist was consulted.

### Relationship between peak troponin values and long-term ischemic events among medically managed patients with acute coronary syndromes [^c9700c50]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This secondary analysis of TRILOGY ACS demonstrates a novel correlation between troponin elevation and prognosis in a study sample selected for medical management of NSTE ACS. One of the strengths of our analysis is that it used data collected as part of a large, multinational, randomized trial, which enhances data consistency and eliminates bias in the assessment of overall treatment effects. Because of the large number of subjects, the results are statistically robust. However, because these results are drawn from a patient population selected for a randomized clinical trial, they may not be generalizable to the broader population of medically managed patients in general practice. Troponin values used for our analysis were collected up to 48 hours after presentation, consistent with contemporary clinical practice. It is possible that by limiting our analysis to values within 48 hours of presentation, a higher peak value could have been missed, but this rule was applied consistently to all patients. Peak troponin data within 48 hours were not available in about 25% of study participants, eliminating this group from our analysis. Although there were differences between those included or not, most were modest and would not be expected to alter the relationships we observed (Table S5). Troponin assays were not standardized across participating sites. Thus, they reflect a wide variety of individual assays with variable assay performance characteristics, and potentially varying site‐specific ULNs for the same assay. However, this reflects the state of actual clinical practice, and we attempted to account for this by normalizing the reported values using a ratio of the reported value to the ULN reported for the assay. This variability and resultant "noise" introduced would be expected to result in an underestimation of the relationship between increasing troponin level and outcomes. Additionally, it is possible that some patients with elevated troponin levels who were included in TRILOGY ACS did not have significant coronary artery disease. In this case, the true association of troponin with long‐term ischemic outcomes may have been underestimated. Of the patients who underwent angiography, however, very few had absence of obstructive coronary disease, and when we excluded those patients from our analyses, there were no differences in our findings. Although designed to evaluate medically managed patients, a small number of patients (7.1%) underwent postindex revascularization at a median of 120.5 days after the index event. Because of the infrequency of downstream revascularization in our study sample and that it occurred late relative to the time of troponin sampling, we believe the commitment to an initial medical management strategy was met and that it is unlikely that our results were significantly affected. Finally, it is possible that because we defined peak troponin using values collected within 48 hours after the index event, the true peak troponin value was missed. However, it is important to note that the impact of missing the true peak would tend to underestimate the relationship between peak troponin level and adverse outcomes. Despite its limitations, our analysis shows the prognostic importance of higher levels of troponin for long‐term outcomes among medically managed patients with NSTE ACS, even in the setting of treatment with modern, potent antiplatelet agents, and the effect is not related to the degree of platelet inhibition as assessed by the P2Y12 assay.

### Derivation and validation of ESC-0 / 1-h algorithm for high-sensitivity troponin T and I in cancer patients [^150d939a]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Blood sampling and laboratory measurements

In addition to the local hs-cTn assay used for the clinical care of the patients, additional study-specific blood samples for hs-cTnT/I measurements with serial draws from ED presentation were obtained. Serial sampling was discontinued when a patient was discharged or transferred to the catheterization laboratory for treatment. The hs-cTnT assay used the Elecsys 2010 system (Roche Diagnostics), with a limit of detection of 5 ng/L, a uniform 99th-percentile of 14 ng/L, and a coefficient of variation of < 10% at 13 ng/L. The hs-cTnI assay used the Architect system (ARCHITECT STAT high-sensitivity troponin I, Abbott Laboratories) with a limit of detection of 1.9 ng/L, a uniform 99th percentile of 26.2 ng/L, and a coefficient of variation of < 5%.

Final adjudicated diagnosis

Final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists according to current guidelines and the 4th universal definition of MI. As recommended in current ESC guidelines, the uniform 99th percentile was used for the adjudication in the primary analysis. The sex-specific 99th percentile recommended by the universal definition of myocardial infarction was used in a sensitivity analysis. The diagnostic procedures, routine clinical assessment, and the adjudication process have been described in detail previously. In order to address the uncommon but previously described phenomenon of discrepant results for hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI and the corresponding possible underestimation of the true performance of hs-cTnI-based algorithms using an adjudication-based partly-on-serial hs-cTnT measurements, we performed a second adjudication using serial hs-cTnI blood concentrations from study samples, which was used for all hs-cTnI-based analyses.

Clinical endpoints

The primary diagnostic endpoint was an adjudicated diagnosis of index NSTEMI (type 1 and 2). The primary prognostic endpoint was 5-year all-cause death, and the secondary prognostic endpoint was 5-year cardiovascular (CV) death or MI.

Follow-up

Patients were contacted at 3, 12, 24, and 60 months following discharge through telephone calls or in written form. Furthermore, details concerning the cause of death were gathered from the patient's hospital records, the family physician's documentation, and the national death registry.

### Incremental value of cardiac myosin-binding protein C for the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [^b28be03a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyC) is a cardiac-specific sarcomeric protein with faster release kinetics compared with those of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn).

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of cMyC, measured with a novel prototype automated immunoassay, with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) for the early diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Furthermore, we derived a single blood draw dual-biomarker strategy combining hs-cTn and cMyC and compared it with the hs-cTnT/I-only strategy endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis from an international prospective study recruiting adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected NSTEMI. cMyC, hs-cTnT, and hs-cTnI concentrations were measured upon ED presentation. Final diagnoses were centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists blinded to cMyC values. To compare the single- and dual-biomarker strategy, safety (defined as the sensitivity and negative predictive value for ruling out index NSTEMI) and triage efficacy (defined as the proportion of patients triaged to either rule-out or rule-in) were assessed. The diagnostic endpoint was index NSTEMI. The prognostic endpoint was 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year cardiovascular death or MI. Findings were externally validated in an independent international cohort.

Results

Among 4,735 eligible patients, 854 (18%) were diagnosed with NSTEMI. The discrimination for NSTEMI at presentation was higher for cMyC (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.943; 95% CI: 0.936–0.95) than for hs-cTnT (AUC: 0.936; 95% CI: 0.929–0.944; P = 0.008). Differences were mainly driven by patients with chest pain onset ≤ 3 hours (AUC of 0.939 [95% CI: 0.928–0.951] vs 0.921 [95% CI: 0.907–0.936], respectively; P < 0.001). The dual-biomarker strategy increased overall triage efficacy from 26.8% (hs-cTnT only) to 60.0% (hs-cTnT and cMyC), without compromising safety during the index visit. Despite identifying up to 3 times more patients for rule-out, the dual-biomarker strategy showed comparable cumulative incidences of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction at 30 days, 1 year, and 5 years. Similar results were observed with hs-cTnI and in the external validation cohort.

Conclusions

CMyC adds significant incremental value to hs-cTn values in the early diagnosis of NSTEMI, improving diagnostic discrimination and enabling more patients to be safely and immediately ruled out for NSTEMI. The single blood draw dual-biomarker strategy is particularly attractive in busy ED settings due to its simplicity and quick time-to-decision.

### Combination of copeptin and troponin assays to rapidly rule out non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in the emergency department [^3efb4076]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to analyze the diagnostic accuracy and the clinical usefulness of the combination of troponin I (cTnI) and copeptin measured at presentation with an automated assay to rapidly rule out non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in patients with suspected cardiac chest pain presenting to an emergency department (ED).

Methods

This study was an ancillary analysis of a prospective observational study. Copeptin and cTnI levels were sampled at presentation in 641 consecutive patients admitted to the ED for chest pain with onset within the last 12 hours and without ST elevation on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Copeptin was measured with an automated assay and troponin with conventional assay. The performance of a combination of cTnI and copeptin for NSTEMI diagnosis was studied, the clinical utility was assessed by multivariate analysis, and an area under the curve (AUC) calculation was used to determine accuracy.

Results

NSTEMI was diagnosed in 95 patients (15%). The sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of the combination of copeptin and cTnI measures were 90.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 88.2% to 92.7%) and 97.6% (95% CI = 96.4% to 98.7%) versus 55.3% (95% CI = 51.5% to 59.2%) and 92.8% (95% CI = 90.8% to 94.8%) with cTnI alone. The AUC of the combination of copeptin and cTnI was 0.89 (95% CI = 0.85% to 0.92%) and was significantly higher than the AUC of cTnI alone (0.77, 95% CI = 0.72% to 0.82%, p < 0.05). The patient classification was slightly improved when copeptin was added to the usual diagnostic tools used for NSTEMI management.

Conclusions

In this study, determination of copeptin, in addition to cTnI, improves early diagnostic accuracy of NSTEMI. However, the sensitivity of this combination even using a conventional troponin assay remains insufficient to safely rule out NSTEMI at the time of presentation.

5 LIMITATIONS

This is a single‐center retrospective cohort study, which carries a potential for inherent bias. Although a large tertiary care center, a larger sample size with cross‐center comparisons is needed to further validate the results. Patients with NSTEMI were included based on documented coronary angiography at the indexed visit. It is possible that patients who did not undergo angiography due to a lower risk, presence of comorbidities, or clinical status were underrepresented in this analysis.

Compared with patients with intended invasive management, patients with intended non-invasive management were older, were more often women, and more often had cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and renal and peripheral artery disease (table 1). Furthermore, they had a higher average Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) non ST-elevation myocardial infarction risk score but less often had a positive troponin test (table 1). On the basis of the intended non-invasive management, unfractionated heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and bivalirudin were used less often but fondaparinux and low molecular weight heparin were used more often. During hospital admission, the proportion of patients who had coronary angiography was less than half, percutaneous coronary intervention about a quarter, and coronary artery bypass grafting slightly more than two thirds those of the invasive cohort (table 2).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Evaluation of an Abnormal Troponin Obtained for Postoperative Surveillance — this algorithm starts with "Troponin > 99th percentile URL" and then distinguishes myocardial infarction (MI) from injury using the Universal Definition of MI. The decision node asks "Has at least 1 criterion for Universal Definition of MI been met?" with criteria including "Symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia", "New ischemic ECG changes", "Development of pathologic Q waves", "Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality", and "Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography including intracoronary imaging". If MI criteria are not met, it asks "Is the myocardial injury likely due to a nonischemic process?" and specifies that "Nonsischemic myocardial injury encompasses pulmonary embolism, sepsis, acute decompensated heart failure, or acute stroke"; if not nonischemic, classify as myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS), for which "Discussion and recognition of MINS diagnosis, including outpatient referral, is reasonable (2a)". If MI criteria are met, manage as NSTEMI or STEMI. For NSTEMI, "Patients who develop NSTEMI after NCS should receive GDMT as recommended for patients with spontaneous MI, with limitations imposed by bleeding risk and postoperative hemodynamic status (1)" and "Patients who develop NSTEMI after NCS can benefit from invasive coronary angiography after weighing bleeding and thrombotic risks based on the severity of clinical presentation (2a)"; when plaque rupture is not suspected (Type 2 NSTEMI), "Treat underlying cause of supply-demand mismatch and optimize GDMT with limitations imposed by bleeding risk and postoperative hemodynamic status". For STEMI, "Patients who develop STEMI after NCS should receive GDMT including consideration of invasive coronary angiography, balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks with severity of the clinical presentation (1)". The figure notes that evaluation "Presumes a rise and fall of troponin consistent with acute myocardial injury. Troponin may be measured using a conventional fourth-generation or a high-sensitivity assay".

3.4.5 Managing type 1 vs type 2 NSTEMI

Type 2 NSTEMI is often classified under a general NSTEMI diagnosis or misclassified as type 1, despite its presentation and underlying pathophysiology being different from those of type 1 NSTEMI. 26 It is essential that NSTEMI be classified as type 1 or type 2, based on clinical presentation, Cardiac troponin, ECG, and imaging findings, so that it can be managed appropriately. 5 Type 2 MI has heterogeneous underlying causes, often atypical features, a lack of a clear precipitating cause of the oxygen supply‐demand imbalance in some patients (eg, absence of discernible CAD), and does not usually involve atherothrombotic plaque disruption. 5 As a result, current NSTEMI guidelines may be challenging — or in some cases inappropriate — to apply in patients who are experiencing a type 2 NSTEMI, and no formal guidelines for type 2 NSTEMI are available. 21 Studies have found that compared with patients with type 1 NSTEMI, patients with type 2 NSTEMI were less likely to undergo catheterization and revascularization procedures or receive recommended secondary prevention medications at discharge, and they had higher mortality rates. 20, 26 There is therefore a need for evidence‐based diagnosis and management guidelines for NSTEMI that acknowledge the complexities of type 2 MI. 16, 20, 21, 22, 28 Consequently, a phenotype‐based approach to type 2 MI diagnosis and management across different clinical settings has been proposed (Figure 3). 50 This approach considers both the context and multiple possible underlying mechanisms of type 2 MI and recommends treatment of the cause of the oxygen supply‐demand imbalance for each patient. 50

3 EPIDEMIOLOGY

3.1 Non‐ST‐elevation MI

The incidence of NSTEMI relative to that of STEMI has increased since the 1980s. 11, 12, 13, 14 This increase in NSTEMI is likely the result of advances in medical care and technology that have facilitated the care of older patients with multiple comorbidities and, in part, the availability of high‐sensitivity Cardiac troponin assays for diagnosis of myocardial injury. 12, 14 NSTEMI currently accounts for 60%–70% of MI hospitalizations. 11, 12, 13, 14 About two‐thirds of those diagnosed with NSTEMI are men, although the proportion of women presenting with NSTEMI has increased in recent years. 11, 13

NSTEMI is more common than STEMI, although the proportion of patients with STEMI is higher for type 1 MI than type 2. 15, 16, 17, 18 A meta‐analysis of observational studies comparing type 1 and type 2 MI showed that 70.0% of the 2683 patients with type 2 MI were diagnosed with NSTEMI compared with 44.1% of 23 189 patients with type 1 MI. 19 A prospective study of consecutive patients meeting the definition of MI found that 96.7% of the 144 patients with type 2 MI had NSTEMI, compared with 67.3% of the 397 patients with type 1 MI. 18 However, it should be noted that a modified definition of type 2 NSTEMI was used that included clinical criteria relating to underlying conditions causing oxygen supply‐demand imbalance. 18

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

Patients who were admitted with a final diagnosis of ACS were screened from the Buenos Aires Cardiovascular Institute between November 2013 and March 2017. The inclusion criteria were: (a) 18 years of age or older; (b) NSTE‐ACS; and (c) coronary angiography within 3 days of admission. Patients who presented with cardiac arrest or ST‐segment elevation acute coronary syndrome were excluded. All patients provided written informed consent for participation in the study. This study was approved by the local institutional research ethics committee, and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

2.2 Study outcomes

The primary outcome was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of hs‐cTnT to predict acute TO in patients with NSTE‐ACS.

2.3 Diagnostic adjudication

The final diagnosis was adjudicated for all patients by independent cardiologists, with discrepancies resolved until a consensus was reached. NSTEMI was defined as the absence of ST‐segment elevation consistent with an infarction of ≥ 2 mm in contiguous chest leads, ST‐segment elevation with an infarction of ≥ 1 mm in two or more standard leads, or a new left bundle branch block, and the presence of positive cardiac necrosis markers.

2.4 Data collection and follow‐up

The baseline demographics, type of presentation, and hospital outcomes were recorded. All available clinic charts, (ECG, holter monitors, and cardiac imaging were reviewed. All the patients included in this study were followed‐up during hospitalization and evaluated for the presence of myocardial infarction, recurrent angina, stroke, and all‐cause mortality.

2.5 Blood sampling and laboratory methods

Venous blood samples were drawn upon arrival to the emergency department via a peripheral venous line and immediately processed. The Elecsys Troponin T‐high sensitive assay (Roche Diagnostics, Risch‐Rotkreuz, Switzerland) was used to measure hs‐cTnT concentrations with a limit of blank and limit of detection at 3 and 5 ng/L respectively, an imprecision corresponding to 10% coefficient of variation at 13 ng/L, and the 99th percentile upper reference limit from healthy individuals defined at 14 ng/L. 11

### Atherothrombotic risk stratification after acute myocardial infarction: the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction risk score for secondary prevention in the light of the French registry of acute ST elevation or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction registries [^8935c078]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Patient population

Three nationwide French registries were conducted 5 years apart over a 10‐year period (2005‐2015): FAST‐MI 2005 (NCT00673036), 13 FAST‐MI 2010 (NCT01237418), 14 and FAST‐MI 2015 (NCT02566200) 15 (Supporting Information Methods S1). The methods used for these registries have been detailed previously. 13, 14, 15 Briefly, their primary objectives were to evaluate the characteristics, management, and outcomes of AMI patients, as seen in routine clinical practice, on a country‐wide scale.

All registries consecutively included patients with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) admitted to cardiac intensive care units (ICUs) within 48 hours of symptom onset, during a specified 1‐month period (October‐December 2005, 2010, and 2015). AMI was defined by increased levels of cardiac biomarkers (troponins, creatine kinase (CK), or creatine kinase‐MB (CK‐MB)) together with either compatible symptoms or electrocardiography (ECG) changes. Patients who died soon after admission and for whom cardiac markers were not measured were included if they had signs or symptoms associated with typical ST‐segment changes. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) refusal to participate, (b) iatrogenic MIs, defined as occurring within 48 hours of any therapeutic procedure, and (c) AMI diagnosis invalidated in favor of another diagnosis. STEMI was diagnosed when ST‐elevation ≥ 1 mm was seen in at least two contiguous leads in any location on the index or qualifying ECG, or when presumed new left bundle branch block or documented new Q waves were observed. In the absence of ST‐segment elevation, patients meeting the inclusion criteria were considered to have NSTEMI. A total of 13 130 patients (52% STEMI) were included in the three surveys.

### Acute coronary syndrome screening and diagnostic practice variation [^77b32208]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In the absence of the existing acute coronary syndrome (ACS) guidelines directing the clinical practice implementation of emergency department (ED) screening and diagnosis, there is variable screening and diagnostic clinical practice across ED facilities. This practice diversity may be warranted. Understanding the variability may identify opportunities for more consistent practice.

Methods

This is a cross-sectional clinical practice epidemiology study with the ED as the unit of analysis characterizing variability in the ACS evaluation across 62 diverse EDs. We explored three domains of screening and diagnostic practice: 1) variability in criteria used by EDs to identify patients for an early electrocardiogram (ECG) to diagnose ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 2) nonuniform troponin biomarker and formalized pre-troponin risk stratification use for the diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and 3) variation in the use of noninvasive testing (NIVT) to identify obstructive coronary artery disease or detect inducible ischemia.

Results

We found that 85% of EDs utilize a formal triage protocol to screen patients for an early ECG to diagnose STEMI. Of these, 17% use chest pain as the sole criteria. For the diagnosis of NSTEMI, 58% use intervals ≥ 4 hours for a second troponin and 34% routinely risk stratify before troponin testing. For the diagnosis of noninfarction ischemia, the median percentage of patients who have NIVT performed during their ED visit is 5%. The median percentage of patients referred for NIVT in hospital (observation or admission) is 61%. Coronary CT angiography is used in 66% of EDs. Exercise treadmill testing is the most frequently reported first-line NIVT (42%).

Conclusion

Our results suggest highly variable ACS screening and clinical practice.

### Copeptin improves the diagnostic performance of sensitive troponin I-ultra but cannot rapidly rule out non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction at presentation to an emergency department [^7436fda3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We assess the performance of a single multimarker strategy, using a combination of sensitive troponin I-Ultra and copeptin assays to rule out non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) at presentation to an emergency department (ED).

Methods

A secondary analysis was carried out on 587 consecutive patients with chest pain who presented to the ED without ST elevation on ECG and were included in a single-site, prospective observational study. Samples for copeptin and combination of sensitive troponin I-Ultra assays were collected at presentation. The performance of the combination of copeptin and combination of sensitive troponin I-Ultra for NSTEMI was calculated in the whole cohort and after stratification by thrombosis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk score.

Results

NSTEMI was diagnosed in 87 patients (14.8%). The sensitivity and the negative predictive value of the combination of copeptin and combination of sensitive troponin I-Ultra were 96.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.3% to 99.3%) and 99.1% (95% CI 97.4% to 99.8%), respectively, for a cutoff level of copeptin less than 12 pmol/L. Among the 243 patients with a low TIMI score, all 8 who had an NSTEMI were detected with the combination (sensitivity 100%; 95% CI 63.1% to 100%), and 158 were a combination of sensitive troponin I-Ultra and copeptin negative and had no NSTEMI (negative predictive value 100%; 95% CI 97.7% to 100%).

Conclusion

In this study, the combination of sensitive troponin and copeptin measurements had a high sensitivity and negative predictive value for NSTEMI diagnosis, especially among subjects with a low TIMI risk score. However, the sensitivity was too low to rule out NSTEMI with a single-draw strategy at ED presentation. Future studies are needed on the low-risk TIMI group to further investigate this preliminary finding.

### Incidence and outcomes of unstable angina compared with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^8ba1a8a0]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Assess the relative incidence and compare characteristics and outcome of unstable angina (UA) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Design

Two independent prospective multicentre diagnostic studies (Advantageous Predictors of Acute Coronary Syndromes Evaluation [APACE] and High-Sensitivity Troponin in the Evaluation of Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome [High-STEACS]) enrolling patients with acute chest discomfort presenting to the emergency department. Central adjudication of the final diagnosis was done by two independent cardiologists using all clinical information including serial measurements of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn). All-cause death and future non-fatal MI were assessed at 30days and 1year.

Results

8992 patients were enrolled at 11 centres. UA was adjudicated in 8.9%(95% CI 8.0 to 9.7) and 2.8% (95% CI 2.3 to 3.3) patients in APACE and High-STEACS, respectively, and NSTEMI in 15.1% (95% CI 14.0 to 16.2) and 13.4% (95% CI 12.4 to 14.3). Coronary artery disease was pre-existing in 73% and 76% of patients with UA. At 30days, all-cause mortality in UA was substantially lower as compared with NSTEMI (0.5% vs 3.7%, p = 0.002 in APACE, 0.7% vs 7.4%, p = 0.004 in High-STEACS). Similarly, at 1year in UA all-cause mortality was 3.3% (95% CI 1.2 to 5.3) vs 10.4% (95% CI 7.9 to 12.9) in APACE, and 5.1% (95% CI 0.7 to 9.5) vs 22.9% (95% CI 19.3 to 26.4) in High-STEACS, and similar to non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP). In contrast, future non-fatal MI in APACE was comparable in UA and NSTEMI (11.2%, 95% CI 7.8 to 14.6 and 7.9%, 95% CI 5.7 to 10.2), and higher than in NCCP (0.6%, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.0).

Conclusions

The relative incidence and mortality of UA is substantially lower than that of NSTEMI, while the rate of future non-fatal MI is similar.

### Ability of minor elevations of troponins I and T to predict benefit from an early invasive strategy in patients with unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction… [^715eb9da]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context Cardiac troponins I and T are useful for assessing prognosis in patients with unstable angina and non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. However, the use of cardiac troponins for predicting benefit of an invasive vs conservative strategy in this patient population. in the primary end point with the invasive vs the conservative strategy, whereas patients with a negative troponin had similar outcomes with either treatment approach. The capacity of cTnI to predict a benefit of invasive strategy with respect to the primary end point. patients with UA/NSTEMI who should be managed with an early invasive strategy. In patients with elevated levels of troponin, the early invasive strategy using upstream GpIIb/IIIa inhibition with tirofiban reduced event rates to levels near those seen in troponin-negative patients. The benefit was a 10%.

absolute and a 39% relative reduction in risk of the primary end point at 6 months. We also demonstrate that among patients with clinically documented UA/NSTEMI even "minor" elevation of cardiac troponins confers increased risk and predicts significant benefit of an early invasive strategy. These findings were consistent between cTnI and cTnT. Thus, even low-level elevation of cardiac. troponins in patients with a good clinical history for unstable angina should be an indication for the strategy of early GpIIb/IIIa inhibition and routine invasive management. Elevated levels of cardiac troponins identify patients with UA/NSTEMI with more complicated coronary lesions, greater burden of intracoronary thrombus. of the assay in this range.

Coupled with the consistent observations with cTnT, these data indicate that troponin elevations below the level of a 10% CV may offer important prognostic information among patients with a typical clinical history of UA/NSTEMI, and support the use of a decision limit for. Cardiac troponin I and T are potent tools for risk stratification and clinical decision-making with respect to the potential benefits of early invasive management for patients with UA/NSTEMI. Even low-level elevations of cardiac troponins help identify patients who benefit from a strategy of early GpIIb/IIIa.

### Pre-hospital transthoracic echocardiography for early identification of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in patients with acute coronary syndrome [^8fe71585]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chest pain is in general the leading symptom that initiates the diagnostic measures and therapeutic interventions in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which is caused by unstable angina pectoris, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The correct treatment of myocardial infarction requires early detection and prompt transport to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) facility. Standard 12-lead echocardiography (ECG) can unequivocally detect only myocardial infarction with de novo left bundle branch block (LBBB) or ST-segment elevation, which account for approximately 35% of ACS cases. Other rather unspecific ECG changes like persistent or transient ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion can only be suggestive of NSTEMI. Patients with ACS without ST-segment elevation (NSTE-ACS) are routinely treated in a general emergency facility, and the diagnosis of NSTEMI is often delayed. The extent of the ischemic area may be the same, but the long-term prognosis of NSTEMI is worse than that of STEMI. Since patients with chest pain but without evidence of ST-segment elevation or de novo LBBB present such a heterogeneous group in terms of the etiology of the pain (e.g. pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pericardial effusions, etc.), a risk assessment and definitive diagnosis is required before initiating any more invasive therapy. Monitoring plasma levels of high-sensitivity (hs)-troponin as recommended in the 2011 and 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines has reduced the time to confirmation of NSTEMI to 1 hour. But high-risk or hemodynamically unstable NSTEMI patients would profit from an even more expedited diagnosis and consequent PCI, since this reduces mortality. In the 2011 ESC guidelines the echocardiographic examination of all patients with ACS has already been recommended to detect regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) or identify differential diagnosis. According to the fact that 12-lead ECG cannot confirm the diagnosis of NSTEMI, using pre-hospital TTE can help to detect NSTEMI on scene and thereby accelerate transportation of the patient to a primary PCI center.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^031276d3]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) definition and classification — ACS are typically caused by the disruption (rupture or erosion) of an unstable coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque with associated partial or complete coronary artery thrombosis and/or microemboli, resulting in diminished blood flow to the myocardium and subsequent myocardial ischemia. ACS includes 3 related clinical conditions that exist along a continuum of severity: (1) unstable angina, (2) non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and (3) STEMI. The initial diagnosis and classification of ACS should be based on the clinical history and symptomatology, interpretation of the ECG, and assessment of cardiac troponin (cTn). Unstable angina is defined by transient myocardial ischemia leading to diminished flow in the absence of significant myonecrosis detected by circulating troponin, whereas more prolonged or severe myocardial ischemia is diagnosed as MI with elevated biomarkers of myonecrosis. Patients with NSTEMI may have a partially occluded coronary artery leading to subendocardial ischemia, while those with STEMI typically have a completely occluded vessel leading to transmural myocardial ischemia and infarction. ACS can be dynamic, with rapid progression between unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI during presentation and initial evaluation and treatment. Other, less common causes of myocardial ischemia include coronary artery spasm, embolism, and dissection. This guideline will focus on the acute management of ACS, including unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI, presumed to result from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or plaque erosion and subsequent thrombosis, which under the Universal Definition would be classified as type 1 MI events.

### Acute coronary syndrome: diagnosis and initial management [^8907fac3]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to cardiac troponin, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurement in patients with acute chest pain and high suspicion of ACS at initial presentation and 3 hours after symptom onset.

### Change in T / QRS ratio can be a supplementary diagnostic tool in predicting coronary artery disease in patients with NSTEMI [^2d9c72d0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Changes in the electrocardiographic findings, namely the ratio T sum to QRS sum (T/QRS ratio), between the initial electrocardiogram (ECG) and the baseline ECG have rarely been investigated in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Thus, we aimed to determine whether changes in various parameters on ECG, including T/QRS ratio, can assist in distinguishing between coronary artery disease (CAD) and NSTEMI without CAD with low to moderate risk.

Methods

This retrospective study enrolled 2572 patients who presented ischemic symptoms, who were diagnosed with NSTEMI, and who underwent coronary angiography. Overall, 388 patients had prior ECG and echocardiography data available; 110 patients were included after excluding patients with other cardiac diseases except CAD. The population divided into two groups: a coronary stenosis group (n = 78); normal coronary group (n = 32) were analyzed.

Results

We found that acute dynamic change in the most deviated T/QRS ratio in each region of leads of initial ECG from those of remote/recent ECG was an extremely strong predictor of acute CAD (odds ratio, 110; p < .001) compared to that of initial serum troponin I levels, new-onset regional wall motion abnormalities, and new-onset T inversion or ST depression. T/QRS ratio change > 1.5 or < 0.5 times in injured regional leads was a significant predictor of CAD.

Conclusion

Change in the most deviated T/QRS ratio in the regional leads on initial ECG from the T/QRS ratio in the same lead on remote ECG can assist in predicting CAD risk between patients with CAD and patients with no CAD in NSTEMI.
