## Question

What are the benefits of initiating dual therapy for hypertension compared to monotherapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the benefits of initiating dual therapy for hypertension compared to monotherapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and guideline direction. Then, I should verify the magnitude of blood pressure reduction with dual therapy versus monotherapy. Next, I will examine time-to-control and the "never-catch-up" hypothesis. After that, I should assess adherence and single-pill combination advantages. I will then review safety and tolerability, including dose-related effects and what to avoid. Next, I should consider special populations and risk stratification. I will also weigh economic and population-level benefits. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and note limitations where evidence is incomplete.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and guideline direction, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from older stepped-care paradigms. Contemporary European and ACC/AHA guidance emphasize that most patients with hypertension will require more than one agent to reach targets, and they recommend initiating dual therapy in most patients, particularly when baseline blood pressure is ≥ 140/90 mmHg or when cardiovascular risk is elevated, with a strong preference for single-pill combinations to improve adherence and control [^111rJjTU] [^112GWY6k] [^1173nzWT].

> Now, I should verify the magnitude of blood pressure reduction with dual therapy versus monotherapy. A high-quality meta-analysis of 484 randomized trials shows that standard-dose monotherapy lowers systolic blood pressure by about 8.7 mmHg, whereas a dual combination at one standard dose lowers systolic blood pressure by about 14.9 mmHg, indicating an additional ~6 mmHg reduction with dual therapy, which is clinically meaningful and typically unattainable by simply doubling the dose of a single agent [^1133UAxf]. Wait, let me verify the dose-response point: doubling a single drug yields only about 1.5 mmHg more reduction, reinforcing that dual therapy's advantage is not just a dose-doubling effect but synergistic action across complementary pathways [^1133UAxf].

> Next, I should review time-to-control and the "never-catch-up" hypothesis, because delays in control may translate into worse outcomes. In PATHWAY-1, initial combination therapy achieved roughly 8–10 mmHg greater home systolic reductions over the first 16 weeks versus sequential monotherapy, and although the monotherapy arm later caught up numerically, the early advantage persisted and supports faster attainment of targets with initial dual therapy, aligning with observational signals that early blood pressure differences are linked to fewer events [^113gqDFC]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical implication: even transient periods of higher blood pressure can increase risk, so earlier control plausibly reduces events even if final pressures converge over time [^111N7KCo].

> I will now examine adherence and the role of single-pill combinations, since adherence is a key mediator of sustained control. Multiple guidelines and reviews converge on the point that SPCs reduce pill burden, improve adherence by roughly 20–30%, and are associated with better blood pressure control and persistence compared with free combinations, which is why ESH 2023 and ESC 2024 prefer SPCs at any treatment step when combination therapy is indicated [^112XTFfx] [^11475XTt] [^114kCRRQ]. Wait, let me double-check the magnitude claim: while estimates vary by study design, meta-analytic and programmatic data consistently show higher adherence with SPCs, which is the clinically relevant anchor for expecting better real-world control [^112XTFfx] [^114kCRRQ].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability, because clinicians often worry that two drugs might double adverse effects. Low-to-standard dose dual combinations generally have similar or better tolerability than maximal-dose monotherapy, partly by using lower doses of each agent and leveraging offsetting effects, such as an ACE inhibitor or ARB mitigating calcium channel blocker–related edema, and thiazide-related hypokalemia risk being balanced by RAS blockade in appropriate combinations [^114cPNrM] [^113RewBE]. Hold on, I should verify a potential pitfall: dual renin-angiotensin system blockade with ACE inhibitor plus ARB increases risks of hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction without outcome benefit and should be avoided in routine hypertension care, which is consistently advised across major guidelines [^113TaGwi] [^112GWY6k] [^113yP4FY].

> Let me consider special populations and risk stratification, because benefits may be amplified in higher-risk groups. For stage 2 hypertension or when blood pressure is more than 20/10 mmHg above target, guidelines recommend initial dual therapy, and in Black adults, starting with a thiazide-type diuretic or calcium channel blocker is emphasized, often alongside an ACE inhibitor or ARB in combination to optimize efficacy and mitigate salt sensitivity [^1173nzWT] [^1124e2kh]. I should confirm CKD guidance: in chronic kidney disease, combination therapy is commonly needed due to difficulty achieving control, but again, avoid ACE inhibitor plus ARB combinations because of harm signals [^117FCXRG] [^112GWY6k].

> I need to check the economic and population-level arguments, because system-level benefits can justify policy shifts even when individual-level outcome trials are limited. Modeling across 24 low- and middle-income countries suggests that scaling initial dual therapy, especially with SPCs, could avert hundreds of thousands of deaths over 30 years and yield favorable cost-effectiveness in many settings, with the incremental costs often modest relative to national health expenditures, supporting guideline-endorsed adoption of combination strategies [^116WPKxi] [^112foKuc]. But wait, what if local drug prices or access differ? The analyses are sensitive to cost assumptions, so country-specific assessments are prudent, yet the directionality favors SPC-based dual therapy in most modeled contexts [^116WPKxi].

> Let me synthesize the practical recommendation, and I should double-check alignment with major guidelines. For most adults with hypertension, especially those with baseline systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or elevated cardiovascular risk, initiate dual therapy with a renin-angiotensin system blocker plus either a calcium channel blocker or a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, preferably as a single-pill combination, while reserving monotherapy for select low-risk stage 1 cases or frail older adults where only modest reduction is needed [^111rJjTU] [^112GWY6k] [^1173nzWT]. I need to ensure I state what to avoid: do not combine ACE inhibitor and ARB, and tailor choices to comorbidities and patient characteristics to maximize net clinical benefit [^113TaGwi] [^112GWY6k].

> Finally, I should acknowledge limitations so we don't overstate certainty. Large, dedicated randomized outcome trials comparing initial dual therapy versus monotherapy are limited. Cochrane reviews highlight very low certainty for hard outcomes, though the blood pressure and adherence advantages are consistent and biologically plausible, and observational and modeling data support expected cardiovascular gains via faster control and improved persistence [^115Q3UvG] [^113i4TjW] [^116WPKxi]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while the absence of definitive mortality trials is a gap, the convergence of efficacy, time-to-control, adherence, and population modeling makes initial dual therapy a reasonable, guideline-supported default for most patients with hypertension [^111rJjTU] [^112GWY6k] [^1173nzWT].

Dual therapy for hypertension offers **greater BP reduction** and **faster control** than monotherapy, with a **similar or better tolerability** profile when using low-dose combinations [^114cPNrM] [^1133UAxf]. It also **improves adherence** — especially with single-pill combinations — and is recommended by major guidelines for most patients, particularly those with stage 2 hypertension or high cardiovascular risk [^112XTFfx] [^112GWY6k] [^1173nzWT]. Dual therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for achieving BP targets and may reduce cardiovascular events, though outcome trials are limited [^111N7KCo] [^113Gme7V]. Avoid dual renin–angiotensin blockade (ACEi + ARB) due to harm [^113yP4FY] [^113TaGwi].

## Clinical benefits of dual therapy

### Greater blood pressure reduction

Dual therapy lowers BP more than monotherapy, with a **dose–response relationship** showing greater SBP/DBP reductions as doses increase [^114cPNrM]. Low-dose combinations achieve larger BP reductions than standard-dose monotherapy, and **low-dose combinations** provide greater BP reduction with similar or better tolerability than higher-dose monotherapy [^114cPNrM] [^114vT1GW].

---

### Faster achievement of blood pressure targets

Initial combination therapy achieves **faster BP control** than monotherapy, reducing the time to target BP and sustaining control over time [^111N7KCo] [^111xhpHY]. Faster control is associated with **reduced cardiovascular risk**, particularly stroke and mortality [^111N7KCo].

---

### Improved adherence and persistence

Single-pill combinations (SPCs) improve **adherence** and persistence versus free combinations, supporting their use when available [^115wkfzb] [^115XyoWN]. Better adherence translates into **improved BP control** and reduced cardiovascular events [^114kCRRQ] [^111hLVPK].

---

### Reduced cardiovascular events

Although direct outcome data are limited, greater BP reduction and faster control with dual therapy are expected to **reduce cardiovascular events**, supported by meta-analyses and modeling studies [^113Gme7V] [^114xscTH]. Modeling suggests that adopting dual therapy, especially as SPCs, could **prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths** over decades in LMICs [^112foKuc].

---

## Safety and tolerability of dual therapy

- **Similar or better tolerability**: Low-dose dual therapy has similar or better tolerability than monotherapy, with fewer dose-dependent adverse effects [^114cPNrM] [^114vT1GW].

- **Fewer adverse events**: Low-dose combinations have fewer adverse events than higher-dose monotherapy, improving adherence and persistence [^115wkfzb] [^114vT1GW].

- **Avoid dual RAS blockade**: ACEi + ARB combinations increase risks of hyperkalemia, renal dysfunction, and hypotension without added benefit and should be avoided [^113yP4FY] [^113TaGwi].

---

## Guideline recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ESC/ESH 2018 | Initiate dual therapy in most patients; prefer ACEi/ARB + CCB or thiazide; consider SPCs [^112GWY6k] [^111xhpHY] |
| ESH 2023 | Initiate dual therapy in most; prefer SPCs; avoid ACEi + ARB [^111rJjTU] [^112XTFfx] [^117FCXRG] |
| ACC/AHA 2025 | Initiate dual therapy in stage 2 or high-risk stage 1; prefer SPCs; avoid ACEi + ARB [^1173nzWT] [^115wkfzb] |
| WHO 2021 | Consider initial dual therapy, especially in high-risk patients or those unlikely to achieve targets with monotherapy [^notfound] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Limited outcome data**: Direct RCT evidence on hard outcomes is limited; more trials are needed [^113i4TjW] [^115Q3UvG].

- **Patient selection**: Dual therapy is most beneficial in stage 2 hypertension, high-risk patients, or those unlikely to achieve targets with monotherapy [^1173nzWT] [^111NJokU].

- **Cost and access**: SPCs may have higher upfront costs, but improved adherence and outcomes can offset these costs over time [^113ahqv1] [^115wkfzb].

---

Dual therapy for hypertension provides **greater BP reduction**, **faster control**, and **better adherence** than monotherapy, with similar or better tolerability. It is recommended for most patients, especially those with stage 2 hypertension or high cardiovascular risk, and should be implemented thoughtfully to maximize benefits.

Discussion

The present analysis evaluating the long term efficacy and safety of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system failed to show any benefit for all cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality with dual therapy compared with monotherapy. This is the most comprehensive review of literature evaluating both the safety and outcomes of dual therapy. Although compared with monotherapy dual therapy was associated with a reduction in admissions to hospital for heart failure mainly in the cohort with heart failure, the risks of hyperkalaemia, hypotension, renal failure, and withdrawal owing to drug related adverse events were significantly increased. Given these facts it may appropriately be asked why dual therapy was and still is extensively used to treat many patients with hypertension and heart failure. With the exception of the CHARM Added trial, most if not all data making dual therapy attractive are based on evidence from surrogate endpoints.

One meta-analysisreported "encouraging" evidence that dual therapy reduced proteinuria by an incremental 20–25% compared with monotherapy. The COOPERATE studyeven showed that dual therapy with trandolapril and losartan reduced the risk of the primary endpoint (time to doubling of serum creatinine level or end stage renal disease) by 60% better than monotherapy, thereby becoming one of the most widely quoted studies by the Lancet. After such seemingly robust evidence many physicians accepted that reduction of albuminuria or proteinuria was synonymous with nephroprotection. In the CHARM Added trial, in a cohort of 2548 patients with heart failure, dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (candesartan and ACE inhibitor) significantly reduced the primary outcome of cardiovascular death or admission to hospital for worsening of heart failure. As a consequence, dual therapy became more and more used in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure resistant to treatment.

Adverse Effects

Adverse and serious effects were similar with combination therapy or monotherapy overall (Table S8). There were more reports of symptoms suggesting hypotension on combination therapy in phase 1 (combination 25.0% versus monotherapy 13.6%, P < 0.001) and on monotherapy in phase 2 (combination 11.4% versus monotherapy 18.0%, P = 0.04), but these did not result in significantly increased withdrawals due to adverse effects. Table S9 shows adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of participants on any treatment or that were significantly different between treatments. Some participants were withdrawn or discontinued or did not have sufficient data for full analysis (Table S10). Figure S2 shows a Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of time to withdrawal due to adverse event. It also shows survival to add‐on therapy in phase 3 of the study.

### Monotherapy vs combination treatments of different complexity: a meta-analysis of blood pressure lowering randomized outcome trials [^113Gme7V]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of drug combinations is recommended by hypertension guidelines for most patients because of the greater blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect compared with monotherapy. However, no evidence is available on outcome benefits of treatment strategies based on drug combinations vs. simpler treatment regimens, using data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). We evaluated drug combination therapies of different complexity.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched for BP-lowering RCTs that compared combination treatment or monotherapy vs. placebo, no-treatment or less-complex treatment. Combination treatment was considered as follows: background treatment continued during follow-up on top of the trial drug(s) of interest and drug(s) were added to the initial drug(s) of interest in the majority of the patients. Monotherapy was considered whenever pre-randomization treatment was withdrawn or absent and a single drug was administered at randomization. Complexity of treatment indicates the higher averaged number of daily medications used in the eligible RCTs.

Results

We selected 93 trials (290304 patients; follow-up, 3.9 years). The on-treatment mean number of drugs was 2.10 and 0.99 in the more and less actively treated patients, respectively. Compared with placebo, no-treatment or less-complex treatment, combination treatments of any complexity (mean number of drugs, 1.40 vs. 0.41, 2.32 vs. 0.48, 2.56 vs. 1.62 and 3.14 vs. 2.19) were associated with reduction of all or most fatal and nonfatal outcomes. There was also an increased rate of side effects leading to treatment discontinuation, although in absolute numbers the benefit usually prevailed.

Conclusion

These data provide randomized-based trial evidence that antihypertensive combination treatment up to three or more drugs is protective. The net benefit, however, may be attenuated when side effects are considered.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^115MpYMG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Most hypertensive patients do not have their blood pressure (BP) controlled by monotherapy. Yet combinations of drugs are not commonly used as initial therapy for hypertension despite studies that suggest the advantages of this approach. 1, 2, 3 Initial treatment of hypertension with combination therapy has been discouraged because of concern about excessive reduction in BP, increased side effects, and the difficulty of attributing adverse events to 1 drug. However, the alternatives also have risks and downsides. The most common practice, long recommended by guidelines, is to start with 1 drug and add another. But this could result in patients continuing to take a drug that is ineffective. Some guidelines recommend tailoring initial therapy to patient characteristics such as age and ethnicity, which may be surrogates for plasma renin status. 4, 5 An alternative is sequential monotherapy to find each patient's best monotherapy, but this takes time and endurance, during which uncontrolled hypertension is not without risk. 6

Evidence that the prompt versus delayed control of BP was of benefit came initially from the VALUE (Valsartan Antihypertensive Long‐term Use Evaluation) trial. In that study, a BP difference of −3.8 mm Hg in the first 3 months of the trial was associated with fewer cardiovascular events, particularly stroke and mortality. 7 Recent observational analyses have confirmed that delays in achieving BP control are not benign and that rapid BP control is important. 8, 9

These observations have led to recommendations in some guidelines to consider initial combination therapy in patients with BP > 160/100 mm Hg, but this practice has not been widely adopted. We thought practitioners might be persuaded by a finding that superior BP control by initial combination was sustained — indeed, this possibility was suggested by the results of the VALUE 7 and ASCOT (Anglo Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial) 10 studies. In these studies, the BP lowering in participants randomized to the less effective of 2 treatments early in the study "never caught up" with that achieved by the other group, despite the former eventually receiving more drug therapy. Furthermore, our previous study of dual therapy versus monotherapy suggested that participants who began initial dual therapy always appeared to have better BP control than the monotherapy group, perhaps because combination therapy attenuated compensatory changes induced by monotherapy. 11

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112K2Bm6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of PATHWAY‐1 (Prevention And Treatment of Hypertension With Algorithm‐based Therapy ‐ study 1) was to test the superiority of home systolic BP (HSBP) control of initial combination therapy compared with the more conventional practice of initial monotherapy. Half of the patients received combination from the start, and all participants received combination therapy after the first 4 months; this design allowed us to rigorously test the "never‐catch‐up" hypothesis. If this were true, we would find a difference in BP at 8 months despite both groups receiving the same therapy during the previous 4 months. We powered the study to detect a 4‐mm Hg difference in HSBP, as we deemed this difference would be clinically important. An important secondary objective of this design was to test the predictors (age, renin 12) of response to treatment, which predicts the response to monotherapy but not, we hypothesized, to combination therapy. Although we evidently expected the average BP response to combination therapy to be superior to the average response to monotherapy, the crossover design of phase 1 enabled us to address the question of whether personalized monotherapy achieves a BP response that is not only superior to average but also comparable to the effect of combination.

### Is it time to move to multidrug combinations? [^115b7nia]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

The clinical benefit of aggressive blood pressure (BP) control in reducing adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes is well documented. However, a majority of patients with hypertension remain poorly controlled with monotherapy and require two or more agents to achieve their target BP levels. Patients with hypertension who also have diabetes or renal disease benefit from even lower BP targets, but may be more difficult to treat and require three or more drugs to achieve control. Using two or more drugs, each at lower doses, is usually more effective and less commonly associated with adverse effects than higher doses of a single drug. With the increasing prevalence of diabetes and renal disease, the treatment of hypertensive patients with multidrug combinations will become even more common. Knowing how specific combinations can be used effectively will be an important component of the treatment strategy for hypertension.

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: do the latest trials challenge existing evidence? [^111Z3zt7]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials reported between January 1990 and August 2012 comparing dual blockers of the RAS with monotherapy, and reporting data on either long-term efficacy (≥ 1 year) or safety events (≥ 4 weeks), and with a sample size of at least 50 (68,405 patients [mean age 61 years, 71% men] and mean duration of 52 weeks) showed that although dual blockade of the RAS had seemingly beneficial effects on certain surrogate endpoints, it failed to reduce mortality and was associated with an excessive risk of AEs such as hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal failure compared with monotherapy. The results of this most comprehensive meta-analysis to date indicated the risk-benefit ratio argues against the use of dual therapy. Based on these study results, the EMA recently started a review of the risks of combining certain medicines to block separate stages of the RAS in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.

Selection of the most appropriate antihypertensive combination should be dependent on careful review of the individual patient and appropriate consideration of drug pharmacology. Existing evidence suggests that in CV high-risk patients and those with evidence of renal disease, the use of an ARB plus calcium channel blocker is the preferred combination due to superior renoprotective and CV benefits and reduced metabolic side effects in patients with concomitant metabolic disorders.

### Efficacy and safety of dual calcium channel blockade for the treatment of hypertension: a meta-analysis [^113mqVV7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Dual calcium-channel blocker (CCB) with a dihydropyridine (DHP) and a nondihydropyridine (NDHP) has been proposed for hypertension treatment. However, the safety and efficacy of this approach is not well known.

Methods

A MEDLINE/EMBASE/CENTRAL search for randomized clinical trials published on this topic from 1966 to February 2012 was performed. Efficacy outcomes of decrease in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures from baseline, changes in heart rate (HR), and adverse effects were compared between dual CCB therapy vs. DHP or NDHP. SBP, DBP, and HR were expressed as weighted mean deviation (WMD).

Results

A total of 6 studies with 153 patients were included. Dual CCB produced a significantly greater reduction in SBP (21.6 ± 9.2 mmHg) from baseline than DHP (10.3 ± 6.3 mmHg (WMD = 10.9 mmHg, P < 0.0001)) or NDHP (8.9 ± 4.2 mmHg (WMD = 14.1 mmHg, P = 0.002)). Dual CCB therapy reduced DBP from baseline more than either monotherapy (dual CCB = 17.5 ± 10.2 mmHg vs. DHP = 11.6 ± 8.7 mmHg, WMD = 5.5 mmHg, P < 0.001; and NDHP = 10.5 ± 5.6 mmHg, WMD = 5.3 mmHg, P = 0.03). Dual CCB therapy had significantly lower HR compared to DHP (P < 0.001) but was comparable to NDHP (P = 0.12) (Delta change dual CCB = -4.0 ± 3.5 vs. DHP = -2.0 ± 1.5 and NDHP = -6.0 ± 5.0 beats/min). Dual CCB therapy did not increase adverse effects.

Conclusions

Dual CCB therapy lowers blood pressure significantly better than CCB monotherapy, without an increase in adverse events. However, given the lack of long-term outcome data on efficacy and safety, dual CCB therapy should be used with restraint, if at all. Large-scale long-term trials are needed to further evaluate such a strategy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Initial combination therapy versus monotherapy — In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with a single first-line antihypertensive drug is reasonable, with dose titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve BP control.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^116prsA7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

These findings make a strong case for considering initial combination therapy to be more effective than current practice. Moreover, they are supported by prospective, double‐blind data to combat the other main factor blocking uptake of initial combination: concern about adverse events. There was no difference in the overall rate between groups. The slight excess in phase 1 of symptoms associated with better BP reduction did not lead to an excess of withdrawals from the initial combination group.

These aspects demarcate PATHWAY‐1 from the shorter term, largely commercial studies comparing components of fixed‐dose combinations, undertaken for registration of the combinations. Most of these studies used lower relative doses of one or both components than we did, and none provided participants with the opportunity to receive both components at maximal dose and to be compared both with matched patients starting on combination and with their own subsequent response to the combination. Two larger and longer term studies are sometimes cited to support the value of initial combination: the prospective cluster‐randomized STITCH (Simplified Treatment Intervention to Control Hypertension) study and retrospective Wald meta‐analysis. 19, 20 Neither, however, has led to a change in practice, probably because of the limitations imposed by cluster randomization and retrospective analysis and because neither could address the question of adverse events. The STITCH study authors considered that superior BP reduction by initial combination in their study was attributable to their use of fixed‐dose combinations (largely different from the individual drugs used in their initial monotherapy arm) and, consequently, better adherence. Our study was not intended to address this issue but incidentally appears to refute it because average HSBP of the 300 patients in the initial combination arm was virtually identical at 16 and 32 weeks (130.0 and 130.2 mm Hg, respectively) when they were receiving losartan 100 mg and HCTZ 25 mg as separate or single tablets.

### Combination therapy in hypertension: an update [^113GgoKf]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Hypertension is now considered as a part of a complex syndrome of changes in cardiac and vascular structure and function. All of the current guidelines suggest that ≥ 1 antihypertensive agent is required in most patients with hypertension to reach BP goals that will effectively reduce the cardiovascular risk. Therapy with 2 drugs separately or with fixed combinations that include agents with complementary actions. Many combinations have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcome and include a diuretic with the RAAS blocker. Choice of combination therapy depends upon the risk factors, presence of comorbidities like diabetes, renal dysfunction and the adverse effects and tailored according to individual patient.

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: do the latest trials challenge existing evidence? [^116NJemk]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Circulatory and tissue renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) play a central role in cardiovascular (CV) and renal pathophysiology, making RAS inhibition a logical therapeutic approach in the prevention of CV and renal disease in patients with hypertension. The cardio- and renoprotective effects observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) monotherapy, together with the availability of a direct renin inhibitor (DRI), led to the investigation of the potential benefits of dual RAS inhibition. In small studies, ARB and ACE inhibitor combinations were shown to be beneficial in patients with CV or renal disease, with improvement in surrogate markers. However, in larger outcome trials, involving combinations of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or DRIs, dual RAS inhibition did not show reduction in mortality in patients with diabetes, heart failure, coronary heart disease or after myocardial infarction, and was in fact, associated with increased harm. A recent meta-analysis of all major trials conducted over the past 22 years involving dual RAS inhibition has clearly shown that the risk-benefit ratio argues against the use of dual RAS inhibition. Hence, the recent evidence clearly advocates against the use of dual RAS inhibition, and single RAS inhibition appears to be the most suitable approach to controlling blood pressure and improving patient outcomes.

### The use of single-pill combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension: translating guidelines into clinical practice [^115XyoWN]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2008 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend the first-line prescription of two antihypertensive drugs in single-pill combinations (SPCs), also known as fixed-dose combinations, for the treatment of most patients with hypertension. This recommendation is based on a large amount of data, which shows that first-line treatment with SPCs supports reaching blood pressure targets rapidly and reducing cardiovascular outcome risk while keeping the therapeutic strategies as simple as possible and fostering adherence and persistence. As this approach constitutes a big shift from the stepped-care approaches that have been dominant for many years, practicing physicians have expressed concerns about using SPCs as first-line agents. In this review, we will discuss the barriers to the uptake of this recommendation. We will also offer suggestions to reduce the impact of these barriers and address specific concerns that have been raised.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116K17V8]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate therapy with a two-drug combination in most patients with HTN. Prefer combinations of a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACEi or an ARB) with a CCB or a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic. Consider using other combinations of the five major drug classes.

Patient distribution within protocol steps

Next, we needed to understand how many patients generally fall within each protocol step (i.e. the proportion that take one, two, or three medications by hypertension severity level). Since evidence on prescription behavior is published only in a small body of studies, we leveraged data from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study. It found that in 14 low-, lower-middle-, and upper-middle income countries spanning world regions, respectively, 95, 62, and 70 percent of treated patients with hypertension were administered monotherapy while the remainder in each setting took two or more medications. In lieu of nationally-specific information, we used these income group averages for countries in our analysis.

We then considered how many medications a given patient with hypertension should take considering their level of pretreatment SBP. We compared the SBP-lowering impact of medications from Wald et al. (2009) and national-level data on mean SBP levels by hypertension severity level. We found that the SBP-lowering impacts of monotherapy reported by Wald and colleagues are generally sufficient to control hypertension for individuals in the SBP 140 to < 150 mm Hg group, dual combination therapy is sufficient for adults in the SBP 150 to < 160 group, and triple combination therapy is required to reduce those in the SBP 160+ group close to, but not below, the standard control threshold.

As such, within our analysis we assumed that all persons treated for SBP 140 to < 150 mm Hg received monotherapy. In Mexico, for example, this was 47 percent of all persons with hypertension. However, from the PURE study we knew that 70 percent of the treated population with hypertension in upper-middle income countries, like Mexico, receive monotherapy. We assumed that the remaining 23 percent of the population with hypertension that were receiving monotherapy all had SBP 150+.

Respectively 5, 38, and 30 percent of treated populations with hypertension in low-, lower-middle-, and upper-middle income countries receive combination therapy (the inverse of the PURE monotherapy data). We assumed that all treated individuals with SBP 150–160 mm Hg were given two medications — since dual combination therapy was generally sufficient for adults SBP 150 to < 160 mm Hg to control SBP — and that treated individuals with SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg had an equal likelihood of receiving two or three medications.

Limitations of our model have been described elsewhere. In this analysis, national-level data was not always available. One important example is on rates of administration of monotherapy versus combination therapy — a key datapoint for examining the shift in costs and benefits that results from moving from the baseline scenario to S1. We applied income-group averages from a cross-sectional study of adults in 14 LMICs, a few of which overlapped with countries featured in this analysis (i.e. Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Bangladesh). Better surveillance and reporting is needed on this important measure.

Data on the costs of SPCs compared to their single agent pill equivalents was also limited. We assumed slightly lower costs for SPCs based on own-study data and data from recent studies comparing SPCs to their single agent equivalents. While plausible, the representativeness of that data across all countries is uncertain. Country-level analyses based on local data may be needed for country-specific decision-making.

The data that we used to inform the SBP-lowering of anti-hypertensive medications was derived from a meta-regression of over 208 published clinical trials, in which 45 percent of participants were women and 17 percent were of African-American or African-Caribbean origin. Similarly, our methods used to calculate the SBP-lowering effect of combination therapy versus monotherapy are from a meta-analysis of 42 trials, few of which included populations relevant to LMICs. Finally, our analysis assumed an additional 1.5 mm Hg lowering from use of SPCs compared to single agent equivalents, based on data from a recent meta-analysis. Effect sizes in the meta-analysis were derived from 12 studies, with three upper-middle income countries (Serbia, Turkey, and Russia) and no low- or lower-middle income countries represented. Each study individually compared the same medications or drug classes in separate pills to their SPC equivalents; however, the medications and classes that were examined in the studies were heterogeneous. As such, the effect size used in this analysis is a general estimate, rather than one specific to the medication combinations that formed the basis for our results (i.e. losartan/telmisartan, amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide). While we use evidence from these studies as the best available data, our analysis would benefit significantly from more evidence on medications that are relevant to LMICs and from more research that includes LMIC populations.

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy… [^117KUy1s]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Combination therapy is treatment with two or more agents administered separately or in a fixed-dose combination pill and is required by most patients with hypertension to reach target blood pressure. 1, 2 In many cases, combination therapy improves rates of blood pressure control and requires less time to achieve target blood pressure 1, 3, 4 with equivalent 5 or better tolerability 6 than higher-dose monotherapy. Additional benefits may include cost savings and better compliance. 4, 6–8. Patients with comorbidities may benefit from the effects of different antihypertensive medications and warrant consideration for combination therapy. For example, a patient with hypertension and diabetes, heart failure, or renal disease may benefit from the combination of a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. When monotherapy fails to achieve target blood pressure, using combination therapy is an alternative to increasing the dose of a single agent.

6, 26 Using combination therapy for initial management offers the potential to achieve target blood pressure 9 with fewer adverse effects because lower doses of each agent may be used. 7, 12 Potential economic advantages include a reduced need to switch medications and improved long-term outcomes secondary to improved blood pressure control. 30 Initial management with combination therapy should be considered in any patient whose blood pressure is greater than 20 mm Hg above systolic goal or 10 mm Hg above diastolic goal. DIABETES MELLITUS Patients with hypertension and diabetes have lower rates of blood pressure control. The calcium channel blocker-ACE inhibitor combination has demonstrated superior blood pressure lowering compared with ACE inhibitor monotherapy in patients with hypertension and diabetes. 36, 37 Renoprotection achieved in these patients by using ACE inhibitor treatment reflects the action of the ACE inhibitor and blood pressure lowering. 13 The U. K.

Prospective Diabetes Study Group found that blood pressure control was more important than tight blood glucose control at preventing cardiovascular events, and that an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker were equivalent in their benefit, although 30 percent of patients in both groups required three or more medications to control their blood pressure. Recurrent Stroke Prevention JNC-7 guidelines recommend diuretics and ACE inhibitors for secondary stroke prevention. 1 A randomized study evaluating the effectiveness of treatment with an ACE inhibitor for decreasing recurrent stroke found that treatment with an ACE inhibitor plus a diuretic significantly decreased recurrent stroke incidence. 14 The participants who received combination therapy experienced significantly greater blood pressure lowering compared with participants who received ACE inhibitor monotherapy.

### Low-dose combination therapy: the rationalization for an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker in higher risk patients [^116nxBY7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

As more high-risk hypertensives are treated and the need for more intensive antihypertensive therapy is recognized, combination therapies are increasingly used. For initial therapy, particularly for relatively low-risk patients, low-dose combinations are often appropriate. For those who require additional therapy, higher doses of combinations may provide further efficacy while minimizing dose-dependent side effects of monotherapy, thereby improving adherence to therapy. Those combination agents should provide 24-h control with one daily dose, thereby ensuring protection in the early morning hours. Combining an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker is a rational approach to treating hypertension. Not only does it provide significantly better blood pressure control than individual components used as monotherapy, it also minimizes dose-dependent side effects. Also, combining agents from different classes results in complementary mechanisms of action that provide other cardiovascular protective benefits.

### Targeting mechanisms of hypertensive vascular disease with dual calcium channel and renin-angiotensin system blockade [^114YBmR4]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with hypertension, particularly those with diabetes mellitus, are at heightened risk for cardiovascular and renal disease. Accumulated evidence indicates that the majority of hypertensive patients at high risk will require more than one antihypertensive agent to reach their blood pressure (BP) target. A reasonable strategy is to use agents with complementary mechanisms of action to enhance BP-lowering efficacy and prevent target organ damage. In experimental models, the combination of a calcium channel blocker (CCB) with an agent that blocks the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, improves measures of endothelial function, inflammation, ventricular remodelling and renal function to a greater degree than these classes given as monotherapy. In clinical trials, calcium channel/RAS blockade combination therapy has been shown to provide greater BP reductions and improve renal function in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease earlier and to a greater extent than monotherapy. In addition, dual calcium channel/RAS blockade increases arterial compliance, arterial distensibility and flow-mediated vasodilation. Expanding upon extensive research on the benefits of calcium channel blockade and RAS blockade for the prevention of vascular events and preclinical and clinical trial evidence suggests added effects of combination therapy by targeting the underlying mechanisms of hypertensive vascular disease.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111NJokU]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — rationale for initial two‑drug therapy for most patients: With the emphasis on achieving a BP target in most patients of < 130/80 mmHg, the majority of patients will require combination therapy, and initial combination therapy is invariably more effective at BP lowering than monotherapy, with even low‑dose combination therapy usually more effective than maximal dose monotherapy. Two‑drug combinations as initial therapy have been shown to be safe and well tolerated, with no or only a small increase in the risk of hypotensive episodes. Although no RCT has compared major cardiovascular (CV) outcomes between initial combination therapy and monotherapy, observational evidence indicates that shorter time to achieve BP control is associated with lower risk, and compared with initial monotherapy, starting with a two‑drug combination exhibits more frequent BP control after 1 year. Previous Guidelines acknowledged initial combination therapy for patients with grade 2 or 3 hypertension or patients at high or very high risk, and initial monotherapy was only recommended for grade 1 hypertension and low‑ or moderate‑risk patients. Some low‑ or moderate‑risk patients with grade 1 hypertension may achieve their BP target with monotherapy, but this is unlikely in those with initial SBP > 150 mmHg who would require a BP reduction of > 20 mmHg; however, in patients with high–normal BP and a high CV risk or in frail older patients, treatment initiation with monotherapy may be appropriate because only a small BP reduction may be required to achieve the BP target.

### Initial treatment with a single capsule containing half-dose quadruple therapy vs standard-dose dual therapy in hypertensive patients (QUADUAL): a randomized, blinded, crossover trial [^114FXsFy]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the most common cardio-cerebrovascular disease worldwide and often coexists with other cardiovascular risk factors, causing damage to important organs. Globally, hypertension is the leading risk factor for deaths, accounting for 10.8 million deaths in 2019, and it also places a significant economic burden on China. However, despite its prevalence and impact, the awareness, treatment, and control rates of hypertension remain suboptimal, with some data showing corresponding metrics to be as low as 50.0%, 38.1%, and 11.1%, respectively.

Current hypertension guidelines recognized the efficacy of dual combination therapy as an initial antihypertensive treatment. However, hypertension involves multiple mechanisms, and the goal of blood pressure control has become more stringent. Dual combination therapy may not be sufficient to meet the needs of patients. Several studies have investigated the use of low-dose three-drug or four-drug combinations in initial treatment, which showed promising results in terms of antihypertensive effects and safety profiles compared to monotherapy. However, these studies employed monotherapy or placebo or usual care as controls, which are not consistent with current guidelines for initial hypertension treatment or not a fixed comparison. These studies did not demonstrate whether low-dose multidrug (≥ 3) combinations were more effective than the current recommended dual combinations, and studies conducted in a predominantly Asian/Chinese population are still lacking.

Therefore, the QUADUAL trial aimed to address these gaps in research by evaluating the efficacy and safety of half-dose quadruple therapy compared to standard-dose dual therapy.

Initial combination therapy versus monotherapy — In adults with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg), initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with 2 first-line agents of different classes, ideally in a single-pill combination (SPC), is recommended to improve BP control and adherence.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^1168APub]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective — and, where appropriate, more intensive — therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of < 10, 10 to 19, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively. Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤ 120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP > 140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention — potentially with dual therapy — should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### Comparing scale up of status quo hypertension care against dual combination therapy as separate pills or single pill combinations: an economic evaluation in 24 low-and middle-income countries [^116WPKxi]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

International hypertension treatment guidelines recommend initiating pharmacological treatment with combination therapy and using fixed dose single pill combinations (SPCs) to improve adherence. However, few countries have adopted combination therapy as a form of first-line treatment and SPC uptake in low- and middle-income countries is low due in part to cost and availability. Evidence on costs and cost-effectiveness is needed as health authorities consider incorporating new recommendations into national clinical practice guidelines.

Methods

Over a 30-year time horizon, we used an Excel-based Markov cohort state-transition model to assess the financial costs (screening, treatment, program, and supply chain costs) and socio-economic outcomes (health outcomes, value of lives saved, productivity losses averted) of three antihypertensive treatment scenarios. A baseline scenario scaled treatment among adults age 30 plus while assuming continuation of the widespread practice of initiating treatment with monotherapy. Scenarios one and two scaled treatment while initiating patients on two antihypertensive medications, either as separate pills or as a SPC. Analysis inputs are informed by country-specific data, meta-analyses of the blood-pressure lowering of antihypertensive medications, and own-studies of medication costs. We compared costs, cost-effectiveness, and net-benefits across scenarios, and assessed uncertainty in a one-way sensitivity analysis.

Findings

Using dual combination therapy (with or without SPCs) as first-line treatment would increase costs relative to current practices that largely use monotherapy. Required additional annual resources averaged as much as 3.6, 0.9, and 0.2 percent of government health expenditures in the analysis' low-, lower-middle, and upper-middle income countries. However, across 24 countries, over the next 30 years, combination therapy with separate pills could save 430,000 more lives and combination therapy with SPCs could save 564,000 more lives compared to baseline treatment practices. Administration of two or more medications using SPCs generated higher net benefits in most countries (16/24) compared to the baseline scenario.

Interpretation

First line treatment employing SPCs is likely to generate higher net benefits compared to status quo treatment practices in countries with relatively higher incomes. To improve population health, national health systems would benefit from reducing structural and other barriers to the use of combination therapy and SPCs.

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy [^114BZaic]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Combination therapy of hypertension with separate agents or a fixed-dose combination pill offers the potential to lower blood pressure more quickly, obtain target blood pressure, and decrease adverse effects. Antihypertensive agents from different classes may offset adverse reactions from each other, such as a diuretic decreasing edema occurring secondary to treatment with a calcium channel blocker. Most patients with hypertension require more than a single antihypertensive agent, particularly if they have comorbid conditions. Although the Joint National Committee guidelines recommend diuretic therapy as the initial pharmacologic agent for most patients with hypertension, the presence of "compelling indications" may prompt treatment with antihypertensive agents that demonstrate a particular benefit in primary or secondary prevention. Specific recommendations include treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, beta blockers, or aldosterone antagonists for hypertensive patients with heart failure. For hypertensive patients with diabetes, recommended treatment includes diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and/or calcium channel blockers. Recommended treatment for hypertensive patients with increased risk of coronary disease includes a diuretic, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and/or calcium channel blocker. The Joint National Committee guidelines recommend beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists for hypertensive patients who are postmyocardial infarction; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease; and diuretic and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for recurrent stroke prevention in patients with hypertension.

### Comparing scale up of status quo hypertension care against dual combination therapy as separate pills or single pill combinations: an economic evaluation in 24 low-and middle-income countries [^116pEUWS]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study did not account for side effects and adverse outcomes of antihypertensive treatment. Combination therapy at low doses, and SPCs especially, are associated with fewer side effects compared to titrating initial agents to maximal doses. However, if more patients are titrated upward from initial starting doses in combination therapy more adverse effects may occur, lowering the net-benefits of the S1 and S2 scenarios.

Despite limitations, our analysis provides evidence that can inform decision-making around treatment decisions for hypertension. First line treatment employing SPCs is likely to generate higher net benefits compared to status quo treatment practices in many countries. To improve population health, national health systems could benefit from reducing structural and other barriers to the use of combination therapy and SPCs.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115wkfzb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension — combination therapy and single-pill combinations (SPCs) are characterized as follows: Combination therapy "is more effective, efficient, and consistent in lowering BP and improves adherence when using an SPC compared with stepped-care therapy". Initial combination therapy "is recommended for stage 2 hypertension and some high-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension (eg, non-Hispanic Black adults, ASCVD risk > 7.5%) using 2 agents from different classes, preferably in an SPC to improve adherence and BP control", and "in general, initial combination therapy with 2 drugs is reasonable in adults with stage 2 hypertension and those at high CVD risk". Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that "low-dose combinations of 3 or 4 drugs together" reduce BP more than monotherapy "over 3 to 6 months of treatment; however, none of these trials have evaluated CVD prevention". Observational data note that "SPCs have fewer cardiovascular events and all-cause deaths than those on equivalent multiple-pill combination therapy", and in older patients "BP-lowering medications should be carefully initiated and monitored… because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension (OH) may develop". Supportive text also states that, for appropriate candidates, "starting treatment with SPCs rather than equivalent free-pill combinations improves adherence".

### Treating hypertension with single pill combinations: a simple strategy to save costs for the patients and payers [^116FnreX]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Raised blood pressure is an increasing concern and causes over 10 million deaths each year globally. The cornerstone of blood pressure control is the adequate prescription and adherence to blood pressure lowering therapy. All recent major international guidelines recommend dual single pill combinations (SPCs) as first-line therapy for hypertension, both to initiate treatment and for patients taking multiple blood pressure medications. Treatment inertia appears when the health-care provider does not initiate or intensify therapy appropriately when therapeutic goals are not reached. SPC therapy has demonstrated greater effectiveness in blood pressure lowering, addressing treatment inertia and improved medication adherence. A recently published study predicted that the number of saved lives over the next 30 years across 24 low- and middle-income countries by using SPCs instead of monotherapy in hypertension was an impressive 564 000, which is significantly greater than the 430 000 lives predicted using free-drug combinations in dual therapy.

In this article, we will focus on Australia as a case study. One third of Australian adults have hypertension and 68% of them remain uncontrolled. Looking at control rates, Australia compares poorly with similar high-income countries, such as Canada. We therefore published a call-to-action in 2022, followed by the establishment of the National Hypertension Taskforce of Australia aiming to significantly improve blood pressure control. The last Australian Hypertension Guideline was released in 2016 and is outdated in key areas. It recommends starting hypertension treatment with low-moderate monotherapy, with consideration of dual therapy and is now finally about to be updated.

Still, in Australia, the current pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) restrictions do not allow physicians to initiate subsidized antihypertensive therapy with a SPC as recommended internationally, and the current drug labels of all but one antihypertensive SPC state that "the treatment must not be for the initiation of antihypertensive therapy". Using SPCs as a second step in hypertension treatment is allowed, but despite the availability of a lot of different SPCs, there is an underuse of them in hypertension treatment in Australia. A recent study showed that in 2022 $1.2 billion was spent on the management of hypertension in Australia, with 51% of the costs being pharmacy-related fees. Forty-one percentage of the costs were from patient out-of-pocket payments suggesting that out-of-pocket costs likely remain a key barrier to blood pressure control due to impacting medication adherence. Hence, reducing out-of-pocket medication costs can lead to improvements in medication adherence.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^114f9JGZ]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science for any prospective clinical trials providing race specific data on blood pressure lowering during treatment with ACEIs for adults with arterial hypertension on 3 August 2012. The search strategies were created by practicing clinicians and a research librarian and are provided in the Additional file 1: Table S1. No publication date or publication status restrictions were applied, and all languages were allowed. In addition, reference lists of review articles and the selected articles were searched for additional sources.

Once the systematic literature search was complete, two independent reviewers appraised all articles according to a standard set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. In cases of differing results, a third reviewer adjudicated. In the first step, articles were excluded or included based on a review of their titles and abstracts. The remaining articles were then evaluated in full text. All articles fulfilling the below-mentioned criteria were selected and data were extracted.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria were as follows. The study must be a prospective clinical trial providing race specific data on blood pressure lowering during treatment with ACEI. Study participants must be aged ≥ 18 years. Studies were included only if they enrolled patients for treatment of confirmed arterial hypertension. In order to evaluate the pure effect of ACEI therapy itself on blood pressure reduction, studies that used combination therapy were excluded from the analysis. The minimum treatment duration was 4 weeks; the minimum patient number was ten.

Two independent reviewers performed data extraction in duplicate. In the case of disagreement, a 3rd reviewer examined the article in order to correct the difference. Data were all entered into a standardized evidence table (see Additional file 2: Table S2). The dual primary metameters and measures of variance in this meta-analysis were change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in mmHg and standard deviation from before start of ACEI treatment to the end of the study period.

### Strategies for combination therapy in hypertension [^111QLRRq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To achieve the target blood pressure (BP) mandated by current guidelines, a large majority of patients require simultaneous administration of multiple antihypertensive agents. The purpose of this review is to focus attention on the rational selection of effective drug combinations, and upon ways to use them efficiently to achieve therapeutic objectives. The topic is widely relevant given that more than 46 million ambulatory care visits are conducted in the United States annually for hypertension management.

Recent Findings

Recommended drug combinations exhibit complimentary pharmacology and additive BP reduction, are well tolerated, and include components with demonstrated endpoint reduction in long-term clinical trials. Recently, the choice of diuretics has emerged as a controversial issue with some evidence favoring the long-acting agent, chlorthalidone, in preference to hydrochlorothiazide. For resistant hypertension, mineralocorticoid antagonists are increasingly used as preferred add-on agents. Practical strategies for the optimal use of combination therapy continue to evolve from the older stepped-care approach to the use of low-dose combinations, and to initiation of combination therapy in a broader range of hypertensive patients.

Summary

Thoughtful use of drug combinations is critical for achieving therapeutic objectives in hypertensive individuals and populations - more rapid BP control and more effective endpoint reduction. Practical strategies for the optimal use of combination therapy continue to evolve from the older stepped-care approach to more recent recommendations favoring the use of low-dose combinations, and initiation therapy of combination treatment, particularly in patients with Stage 2 hypertension.

### Mortality in pulmonary arterial hypertension in the modern era: early insights from the pulmonary hypertension association registry [^111VxZU6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

As far as management of patients with PAH, there is a growing shift toward initial combination therapy based on risk stratification. Guidelines recommend combination therapy including a parenteral prostacyclin for high‐risk patients and oral monotherapy or double combination therapy for low‐ and intermediate‐risk patients. A recent multicenter retrospective analysis from Canada showed no difference in mortality between initial monotherapy versus combination therapy in patients with PAH. Moreover, a large retrospective analysis from the FPHR showed no mortality difference between initial monotherapy versus double combination therapy specifically in patients with idiopathic, heritable, and anorexigen‐associated PAH; however, triple combination therapy including a parenteral prostacyclin improved 5‐year mortality. In our analysis, initial combination therapy (both dual and triple combination) is associated with a lower 1‐year mortality, but there is no difference in 2‐ or 3‐year mortality. However, the confidence intervals for these hazards ratios are wide; hence, these results should be interpreted with caution.

### Efficacy and safety of triple versus dual combination blood pressure-lowering drug therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115UkK4w]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Most patients with hypertension need at least two drugs to achieve goal blood pressure. This systematic review assessed efficacy and safety of triple versus dual combination therapy for the management of hypertension.

Methods

Publication databases, clinical trial registries and regulatory agency websites were searched until April 2018 for double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing triple with dual therapy of BP-lowering drugs, for at least 3 weeks, among patients with hypertension. Meta-analyses for efficacy and safety outcomes were performed using random-effects model. Regimen efficacy was predicted using the Therapeutic Intensity Score (TIS) and the Law et al. method (which predict dose doubling increases efficacy by 100% and around 20%, respectively), and compared with observed efficacy.

Results

Fourteen RCTs (11457 participants) were included. Overall, triple compared with dual therapy reduced BP by 5.4/3.2mmHg (P < 0.001), and improved BP control by 58 versus 45% [relative risk (RR) 1.33 (95% CI 1.25–1.41)], whereas incidence of withdrawals because of adverse events were 3.3 versus 3.4% [RR 1.24 (95% CI 1.00–1.54), P = 0.05]. Law et al.'s method was superior to TIS in predicting differences in efficacy between triple and dual therapies. For patients uncontrolled on submaximal dose dual therapy, adding a third drug achieved on average approximately four times more BP reduction than doubling the dose of dual therapy component drugs (6.0/3.6 versus 1.5/0.8mmHg, respectively).

Conclusion

Addition of a third drug is likely to be more efficacious without increasing adverse events, compared with increasing dose of existing dual therapy. Early use of triple therapy can significantly improve hypertension control.

Hypertension is the leading global risk factor associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease, contributing worldwide to more than 7 million deaths and 57 million disability-adjusted life-years annually. In 2015, approximately 1.13 billion adults had hypertension, yet fewer than 30% had achieved their blood pressure control goal. Notably, the burden of hypertension is particularly salient in the Asia Pacific region, given that this region has 60% of the world's population and has experienced a rapid increase in prevalence of hypertension since 1980.

Approximately 70% of patients with hypertension cannot achieve their blood pressure control goal with monotherapy. Despite the wide availability of antihypertensive agents, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the optimal choice for a second agent for use in escalation from monotherapy. Clinical trials lack head-to-head comparisons of second antihypertensive agents added to monotherapy, and only 2 trials (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living With Systolic Hypertension [ACCOMPLISH]and Combination Therapy of Hypertension to Prevent Cardiovascular Events [COPE]) directly compared combination regimens in patients with hypertension who required 2 drugs. These trials, however, provided comparisons between few agents, not drug classes; included primarily patients from Western countries; and did not systematically assess heterogeneity in patient subgroups. The absence of head-to-head comparison in clinical trials has limited the ability of clinical guidelines to provide recommendations about the preferred choice of second medication for treatment escalation. However, it is plausible that not all dual combination therapies have the same mean risks and benefits. Moreover, some combinations may be associated with better outcomes in particular patient subgroups. Evidence about the choice of medication in escalating treatment to 2 agents may better inform clinical decisions and provide needed evidence for practice guidelines.

European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) combination therapy — practice recommendations and scope — prioritize research settings and expert centers. When combination therapy is considered, patients should be treated within clinical trials or registries whenever possible. Combination therapy of established PAH drugs is recommended for patients not responding adequately to monotherapy, but combination therapy should be instituted by expert centres only. Whether the response to monotherapy is sufficient or not can only be decided on an individual basis, including an individual patient who, despite monotherapy and optimized background treatment, has an inadequate clinical response. For novel targeted agents, the safety and efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in PAH must be further evaluated and, at present, the use of these drugs should be restricted to RCTs.

### Evaluation of recent fixed-dose combination therapies in the management of hypertension [^115CKgwF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Control of hypertension remains sub-optimal with only half of patients achieving adequate control. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines recommend initial use of two antihypertensive agents in patients with stage 2 hypertension. This review discusses the drug combinations that have additive effects and those that do not provide additional benefit while increasing the adverse events.

Recent Findings

Results from late-breaking trials have shown that combinations of a calcium channel blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor are superior to a diuretic with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for reducing cardiovascular events. Additionally, in patients with vascular disease with relatively 'controlled' blood pressure at baseline, the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker did not reduce cardiovascular endpoints compared with either monotherapy and modestly increased the incidence of adverse effects.

Summary

Combination therapy of antihypertensive agents (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretics, and angiotensin receptor blocker/diuretics) as initial therapy in stage 2 hypertension can lead to markedly improved blood pressure control in patients compared with monotherapeutic regimens.

### New approach to blood pressure control: triple combination pill [^113VbLPh]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) control remains insufficient worldwide, mostly due to poor adherence to treatments, clinical inertia, adverse effects and underuse of drug-combination strategies. Monotherapy and its uptitration have been long considered the first-line strategy in the treatment of hypertension, often leading to ineffective, time consuming and frustrating results. On the other hand, several studies have demonstrated that starting and continuing antihypertensive therapy based on a drug combination is associated with a greater reduction of BP, an earlier achievement of therapeutic goals and a higher proportion of patients achieving targets with favorable implications on cardiovascular events. However, one-fourth to one-third of hypertensive patients fail to achieve BP control even with dual combination therapies, requiring three or more antihypertensive agents. The aim of this review is to discuss the effects of triple-drug associations in terms of BP lowering and prevention of major cardiovascular events, also in high-risk patients. We also discuss available data on side effects and tolerability of triple combination therapy, and the advantages to use a single-pill formulation to promote simplification and adherence to therapy. The findings reported have provided the background for most recent international guidelines on hypertension that support the use of dual and triple combination therapy for most patients.

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: do the latest trials challenge existing evidence? [^1128AZom]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Chronic RAS inhibition using ACE inhibitors or ARBs as monotherapy is the standard of care to treat the vasoconstrictive / pro-inflammatory effects of RAS activation. Despite a strong biological rationale, dual RAS blockade has been largely disappointing, with initial benefits seen on surrogate endpoints not being translated to meaningful superior clinical benefit. Data from outcome trials such as ONTARGET ®, VA NEPHRON-D, ALTITUDE and ASTRONAUT have shown no renal or CV outcome benefits with dual RAS inhibition, and have even shown deleterious effects across most patient groups. For ACE inhibitor / ARB dual therapy, benefits appear confined to symptomatic HF in patients whose symptoms persist in the presence of maximized ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker treatment and not immediately post-MI, and arguably in severe hypertension while balancing the potential adverse effects.

### Efficacy and safety of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113yP4FY]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The concept of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system originated from an experimental modelpurporting to show a "synergistic" effect between angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. The concept seemed so logical and appealing that seemingly beneficial changes in surrogate endpoints such as blood pressure, proteinuria, and endothelial dysfunction became accepted as a free pass for dual blockade having cardioprotective and nephroprotective effects. Despite a lack of solid evidence on the safety and efficacy of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system this type of therapy has been mentioned in several sets of guidelines. Thus dual therapy was commonly used in patients with hypertension and with diabetes or proteinuria, or both and also to a lesser extent in those with heart failure resistant to treatment. Even patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were not entirely able to escape this fashionable trend. In the United States more than 200 000 patients are currently treated with dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, most of them by the combination of an angiotensin receptor blocker and ACE inhibitor (70%). Some other combinations are also used, such as two ACE inhibitors (15%), two angiotensin receptor blockers (5%), and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in combination with a direct renin inhibitor (8%). The long term efficacy and safety of dual blockade is not, however, well defined.

We compared the long term efficacy of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (any two of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or aliskiren) with monotherapy and evaluated adverse events in patients receiving dual therapy compared with monotherapy.

Statistical Analyses

A sample size of 268 in each group had 90% power to detect a difference in HSBP means of 4 mm Hg, assuming a common SD of 12 mm Hg using a 2‐group t test with α = 0.01. We hypothesized 4 mm Hg because this was the difference in systolic BP between arms in the VALUE study at 3 months that was associated with significant excess mortality. 7

All analyses followed a prespecified statistical analysis plan.

We used the arithmetic mean of last 18 home BP measurements before a study visit to calculate home BP. If > 18 measurements were obtained, the earliest recorded readings were discarded. For most patients, we used all readings on days 1 to 3 before the visit, but if any of these were missing, readings from day 4 before the visit were added. The minimum number of measurements required for a valid assessment of home BP was 6, and if there were < 6 readings, we declared the observation missing.

We used mixed‐effect models with unstructured covariances for repeated measures within a patient. These models provide valid tests of hypotheses when observations are missing at random. We adjusted for prespecified baseline covariates (sex, age, height, weight, smoking history, whether or not the participant had been treated for hypertension before the baseline visit, and the baseline value of the outcome being analyzed). Least squares means estimated from these models are presented. BP control and response rates were analyzed using logistic regression models, which also included the baseline covariates. Comparisons of adverse event rates between treatments were conducted using χ² tests, and Fisher exact P values are given.

Intention‐to‐treat analyses excluded only those participants with no primary outcome data at any follow‐up visit. Other participants with missing data were included, and we assumed that data were missing at random (ie, its absence was unrelated to the unobserved value).

The investigators and all authors had sole discretion in data analysis and interpretation, writing of the report, and the decision to submit for publication.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^115Q3UvG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Comparing scale up of status quo hypertension care against dual combination therapy as separate pills or single pill combinations: an economic evaluation in 24 low-and middle-income countries [^113ahqv1]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In laying the foundation for greater population coverage with standard antihypertensive treatment in general, and initial combination therapy and SPCs in particular, health systems can face barriers such as high procurement costs, low availability of hypertension medications (especially in SPC form), and other patient and provider barriers. Registration in national drug formularies and essential medicine lists is a first step toward improving access. Among the 30 most populous LMICs worldwide, only 12 currently have SPCs registered on essential medicines lists. Once SPCs are registered, clinical practice guidelines can be aligned. Currently, few LMIC national-level clinical practice guidelines and treatment protocols recommend treatment initiation with two or more medications. Following international guidelines, countries can revise them to elevate initial combination therapy and use of SPCs.

Updating treatment guidelines to reflect the evidence supporting initial combination therapy can help raise awareness of the benefits of combination therapy or SPCs, especially among health providers who may not yet view either as acceptable treatment options. To support adoption among providers and patients, health systems could select SPCs that are supported by clinical trials, and allow for flexible dosing (i.e. tablets that can be split to support clinician titration). Dedicated initiatives such as the WHO HEARTS program, with a framework to support roll out of standard simple treatment protocols and training of providers, are likely to improve adoption rates. Most of the HEARTS countries in Latin America and the Caribbeanand Sri Lanka have all successfully implemented treatment protocols including initial dual drug combination therapy. Countries would benefit from explicitly considering cost-effectiveness criteria prior to issuing new clinical practice guidelines and treatment protocols. While evidence suggests many antihypertension medications are somewhat interchangeable in terms of effectiveness, prices can differ significantly across drug classes and medications. Detailed results in Appendix A (see Table S5.1) describe how use of a higher higher-cost ARB — telmisartan — can materially lower cost-effectiveness ratios.

### Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system for cardiorenal protection: an update [^116oL8YC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has an important role in hypertension and the continuum of cardiovascular and kidney disease. The inhibition of this system, either with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), has been shown to be beneficial for cardiorenal protection. Dual blockade with an ACE inhibitor and ARB may have additional benefits due to the more complete inhibition of the system. Most published trials, including recent large studies and meta-analyses, have reported either limited or no additional benefit. Dual-blockade therapy seems to have some benefit on proteinuria and blood pressure reduction, and on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure, compared with monotherapy. The major issue arising from these published trials and meta-analyses is the increased frequency of dual therapy discontinuation and adverse effects on kidney function. There is a lack of hard end-point data for renal outcomes and long-term safety data in most published trials. Until the results of ongoing trials become available and as further safety data emerge, a wise approach would be to withhold use of ACE inhibitor and ARB combination therapy in general practice. When used in selected conditions, patients need to be closely monitored.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of dual alpha and beta blockers for primary hypertension [^113hkHWr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Drugs with combined alpha and beta blocking activity are commonly prescribed to treat hypertension. However, the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of this class of beta blockers has not been systematically reviewed and quantified.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related effects of various types of dual alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockers (dual receptor blockers) on systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus placebo in patients with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Group's Specialised Register.

Selection Criteria

Randomized double blind placebo controlled parallel or cross-over trials. Studies contained a beta blocker monotherapy arm with a fixed dose. Patients enrolled in the studies had primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of the studies was from three to 12 weeks. Drugs in this class of beta blockers are carvedilol, dilevalol and labetalol.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (GW and AL) confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data independently. RevMan 5.3 was used to synthesize data.

Main Results

We included eight studies examining the blood pressure lowering efficacy of carvedilol and labetalol in 1493 hypertensive patients. Five of the included studies were parallel design; three were cross-over design. The two largest included studies were unpublished carvedilol studies. The estimates of BP lowering effect (systolic BP/diastolic BP millimeters of mercury; SPB/DBP mm Hg) were -4 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals (CI) -6 to -2)/-3 mm Hg (95% CI -4 to -2) for carvedilol (> 1000 subjects) and -10 mm Hg (95% CI -14 to -7)/-7 mm Hg (95% CI -9 to -5) for labetalol (110 subjects). The effect of labetalol is likely to be exaggerated due to high risk of bias. Carvedilol, within the recommended dose range, did not show a significant dose response effect for SBP or DBP. Carvedilol had little or no effect on pulse pressure (-1 mm Hg) and did not change BP variability. Overall, once and twice the starting dose of carvedilol and labetalol lowered BP by -6 mm Hg (95% CI -7 to -4) /-4 mm Hg (95% CI -4 to -3) (low quality evidence) and lowered heart rate by five beats per minute (95% CI -6 to -4) (low quality evidence). Five studies (N = 1412) reported withdrawal due to adverse effects; the risk ratio was 0.88 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.42) (moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides low quality evidence that in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, dual receptor blockers lowered trough BP by an average of -6/-4 mm Hg and reduced heart rate by five beats per minute. Due to the larger sample size from the two unpublished studies, carvedilol provided a better estimate of BP lowering effect than labetalol. The BP lowering estimate from combining carvedilol once and twice the starting doses is -4/-3 mm Hg. Doses higher than the recommended starting dose did not provide additional BP reduction. Higher doses of dual receptor blockers caused more bradycardia than lower doses. Based on indirect comparison with other classes of drugs, the blood pressure lowering effect of dual alpha- and beta-receptor blockers is less than non-selective, β₁ selective and partial agonist beta blockers, as well as thiazides and drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system. Dual blockers also had little or no effect on reducing pulse pressure, which is similar to the other beta-blocker classes, but less than the average reduction of pulse pressure seen with thiazides and drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system. Patients taking dual receptor blockers were not more likely to withdraw from the study compared to patients taking placebo.

### Comparing scale up of status quo hypertension care against dual combination therapy as separate pills or single pill combinations: an economic evaluation in 24 low-and middle-income countries [^112Yeawo]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Analyzed scenarios

In three distinct scenarios, we assessed strengthening countries' hypertension care cascades while following different hypertension treatment protocols. The three scenarios were chosen to assess how different treatment choices can affect the costs and socioeconomic benefits of antihypertensive treatment.

The differences across the three scenarios were in the anti-hypertensive treatment regimens deployed. In a baseline scenario (S0), patients diagnosed with hypertension were initiated on the WHO evidence-based Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) pharmacological treatment protocol. Within the protocol, patients initiate on monotherapy and — dependent on hypertension status — they can be titrated to combination therapy employed using separate pills. The scenario reflects the gains that can be made if the care cascade strengthens following status quo treatment protocols — since in most LMICs monotherapy is the dominant form of treatment.

Two intervention scenarios were developed to investigate the health and economic gains that could occur should countries implement recommended changes to status quo treatment protocols, such as initiating patients on combination therapy using separate pills (S1) or initiating patients on combination therapy that employs single combination pills (S2). In both intervention scenarios, patients follow WHO evidence-based ACE-I or ARB + calcium channel blockers (CCB) protocols. This protocol was selected because a) the medication–class combination is preferred based on its efficacy, tolerability, safety profile, and strong clinical trial evidence base; and, b) for this study's purposes, the protocol's medications and dosages can be mirrored in single pill or combination form — suitable for analytical cost and efficacy comparisons.

We had sufficient data to investigate using losartan or telmisartan (both ARBs) as the ACE-I or ARB, amlodipine as the CCB, and hydrochlorothiazide as the diuretic. Within the main analysis we present results using losartan as the ARB. While less-efficacious than telmisartan, its lower cost may be more reflective of prices that LMICs can pay. In a sensitivity analysis, we explore, the extent to which results change if telmisartan, a more expensive but clinically preferred medication, is used.

Compared to the baseline scenario, S1 isolates the costs and consequences of treating all patients with at least two antihypertensive medications instead of predominantly monotherapy. Compared to S1, S2 isolates treating all patients with SPCs versus separate pills.

### Abstract… [^115qwZwT]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Choice of Agents Figure 1 is an algorithm that can guide combination therapy in patients with hypertension. 1, 6 JNC8, ESC, and ACC/AHA guidelines agree that for most patients, combination therapy should include a thiazide diuretic, a CCB, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARB. They further agree that a patient should not take an ACEI and ARB simultaneously. 4–6 Therapy should be escalated at one-month intervals using any of the three accepted strategies.
6. HEART FAILURE ACEIs are associated with decreased cardiovascular mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. 40, 41 The MDRD and AASK studies did not find benefit in patients without proteinuria, and a systematic review suggests that improved renal outcomes associated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade may be entirely due to their blood pressure–lowering effect.

42 The combination of an ACEI and ARB is not recommended because of the increased risk of end-stage renal disease and lack of mortality benefit. DIABETES Using a fixed-dose combination of an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in adults with diabetes, the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial showed that a blood pressure decrease of 5. 6/2. 2 mm Hg led to lower rates of microvascular and macrovascular events and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. 5, 6 A meta-analysis showed that ACEIs — but not ARBs — reduce the incidence of doubling of the serum creatinine level in patients with diabetes, but they do not affect progression to end-stage renal disease. 46 Another meta-analysis showed that ACEIs are superior to ARBs in reducing all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

47 The ACCOMPLISH trial showed that patients with diabetes who are treated with a combined ACEI/CCB have a lower risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events compared with those treated with a combined ACEI/thiazide diuretic.
48. A1 For example, the variability in response to ACEI monotherapy is greater within races than it is between races. A2, A3 And ACEIs remain an important therapy for chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension requiring multiple drugs irrespective of race. A3.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^115Lrjwz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The number of participants required to answer the primary hypothesis for PATHWAY‐1 and the median age of 55 years at recruitment gave us the opportunity to prospectively test the age dependence of response underpinning some guidelines, such as National Institute for Health and Care Excellence/British Hypertension Society and the AB/CD rule. 17 These guidelines predict that drugs blocking the renin–angiotensin system are more effective for younger patients, whereas the reverse is true in older patients, who tend to have lower renin. The continuous correlation between baseline renin and BP response, also seen in our other 2 PATHWAY studies, 21, 22 suggests that there may be outer extremes at which renin predicts extreme responses; indeed, this was the case for our patients responding as well to initial HCTZ or losartan as to their combination (Table S7). But overall, we can conclude that combination trumps stratification, that initial combination trumps initialled (= personalised) monotherapy. Indeed, our crossover study has weakened the case for considering that 1 monotherapy can be selected with confidence that it will be effective. The renin profiling served rather to underpin previous extensive literature that divides the major antihypertensive drugs into 2 complementary categories, targeting either the renin‐angiotensin system or sodium balance; dual action is required in most patients precisely to prevent the one pressor system compensating for blockade of the other. 17, 23, 24, 25

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP > 20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

### Upfront combination therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension: time to be more ambitious than AMBITION [^1177FhVY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

With most patients not meeting treatment goals and recognizing that timing matters, the risks, uncertainties, and benefits of upfront triple combination therapy including a parenteral prostacyclin in intermediate-risk patients should be considered. The potential disadvantages include inconvenient delivery, side effects, complications such as infection, and cost. The uncertainties revolve around the absence of an RCT. The AMBITION and The Efficacy and Safety of Initial Triple versus Initial Dual Oral Combination Therapy in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (TRITON) RCTs have provided the framework for combination oral therapy for low- and intermediate-risk patients. The landmark AMBITION trial found that upfront combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil resulted in a 50% relative risk reduction for time to clinical failure compared with monotherapy, and is the cornerstone of the recommendation for upfront combination therapy for most patients with PAH. The TRITON trial, which has been previously reported in the form of an abstract, filled a critical gap showing that the addition of the oral prostacyclin agonist selexipeg to macitentan and tadalafil was not superior to initial dual therapy in decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance. However, these results are not generalizable to the more potent parenteral therapy combination strategy being evaluated in the present analysis. The evidence of benefit for parenteral prostacyclin in high-risk patients would make an RCT unethical in this group. Although an RCT of upfront parenteral prostacyclin combination therapy in intermediate-risk patients would be informative, it is likely not feasible for several reasons, including ethics in blinding to long-term administration of placebo through a central line, challenges that would arise with enrollment because patients would be unlikely to want to go on oral medications, and lack of funding. There are now several observational studies that have demonstrated a survival benefit of upfront triple combination therapy with a parenteral prostacyclin. Boucly and colleagues extend this observation to an intermediate-risk group. There has yet to be a study that showed worse outcomes with combination therapy, and upfront triple combination therapy allows for deescalation should there be an excellent response. Taken together, the treatment paradigm should evolve. Optimal medical therapy for intermediate-risk patients should include either upfront triple combination therapy with a parenteral prostacyclin or dual oral combination therapy with a rapid reassessment to ensure response (Figure 1).

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^112UvZU5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension has a major associated risk for organ damage and mortality, which is further heightened in patients with prior cardiovascular (CV) events, comorbid diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria and renal impairment. Given that most patients with hypertension require at least two antihypertensives to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals, identifying the most appropriate combination regimen based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action offer potential advantages over free-drug combinations, including simplification of treatment regimens, convenience and reduced costs. The improved adherence and convenience resulting from SPC use is recognised in updated hypertension guidelines. Despite a wide choice of SPCs for hypertension treatment, clinical evidence from direct head-to-head comparisons to guide selection for individual patients is lacking. However, in patients with evidence of renal disease or at greater risk of developing renal disease, such as those with diabetes mellitus, microalbuminura and high-normal BP or overt hypertension, guidelines recommend renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker-based combination therapy due to superior renoprotective effects compared with other antihypertensive classes. Furthermore, RAS inhibitors attenuate the oedema and renal hyperfiltration associated with calcium channel blocker (CCB) monotherapy, making them a good choice for combination therapy. The occurrence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough supports the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for RAS blockade rather than ACE inhibitors. In this regard, ARB-based SPCs are available in combination with the diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or the calcium CCB, amlodipine. Telmisartan, a long-acting ARB with preferential pharmacodynamic profile compared with several other ARBs, and the only ARB with an indication for the prevention of CV disease progression, is available in two SPC formulations, telmisartan/HCTZ and telmisartan/amlodipine. Clinical studies suggest that in CV high-risk patients and those with evidence of renal disease, the use of an ARB/CCB combination may be preferred to ARB/HCTZ combinations due to superior renoprotective and CV benefits and reduced metabolic side effects in patients with concomitant metabolic disorders. However, selection of the most appropriate antihypertensive combination should be dependent on careful review of the individual patient and appropriate consideration of drug pharmacology.

### Use of initial and subsequent antihypertensive combination treatment in the last decade: analysis of a large Italian database [^111hLVPK]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertension guidelines issued in the last 20 years have consistently recommended use of a combination of two or more antihypertensive drugs to treat most hypertensive patients. This recommendation is strongly evidence-based. First, as hypertension is a multifactorial condition and blood pressure (BP) is a multiregulated variable, use of two or more antihypertensive drugs with complementary mechanisms of action is accompanied by greater BP-lowering effects and a much more frequent BP control than monotherapy. Second, as BP reduction is associated with reduction of cardiovascular outcomes, a greater BP reduction reflects a greater cardiovascular protection, a conclusion recently documented by a meta-analysis of randomized outcome trials. Third, as reported recently, compared with initial monotherapy, initial treatment with two antihypertensive drugs is associated with better adherence to the prescribed therapeutic regimen, lower therapeutic inertia, and as a result, more frequent long-term BP control and greater reduction of cardiovascular outcomes. This has led latest guidelines to recommend use of two antihypertensive drugs not just, as in the past, after an ineffective monotherapy but as the initial treatment step.

Despite guideline recommendations, monotherapy has been reported to be still more frequently used than drug combinations in many countries, which implies that, rather the following the step-care approach recommended by guidelines (progressive addition of drugs to the initial one), doctors prefer to deal with an ineffective monotherapy by switching to another monotherapy, the so-called sequential monotherapy approach. Aim of the present study was to determine the use of single, two, three or more antihypertensive agents in the population of Lombardy, a region of northern Italy with more than 10 million people. We analysed use of drug combinations both as the initial treatment step and over a 3-year treatment period. Data collection was extended to three temporal cohorts (2012, 2015 and 2018) to also determine whether mono versus combination treatment strategies had increased over the years. Because of the large number of patients involved, the analysis was also extended to different demographic and clinical categories.

### Fixed-drug combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension [^113HmGzx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

As combinations of drugs from different classes that have synergistic or additive effect and properties to cancel out each others' untoward hemodynamic and metabolic effects become more and more widely used, their use as first-line therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed hypertensive patients is growing in popularity as well. The possibility to begin therapy with a fixed 2-drug combination may be preferable to starting with monotherapy followed by upward titration and addition of other agents. More and more combinations are coming out on the market and proving their effectiveness in randomized controlled trials and in large multicenter studies. One suggestion is the "polypill", a fixed combination of multiple agents that address various components of the metabolic syndrome and coexisting common risk factors in both high-risk patients with conditions requiring polypharmacy, and in healthy asymptomatic individuals.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose triple and quadruple… [^116Z1KSi]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 7 trials enrolling 1918 patients found that low-dose combination antihypertensives were more efficacious than monotherapy, usual care, or placebo in terms of mean blood pressure reduction and achieving blood pressure target. Low-dose combinations were also well tolerated but were associated with higher rates of dizziness than monotherapy or usual care. Meaning The findings suggest that low-dose combinations with 3 or 4 antihypertensives were effective and well tolerated in the lowering of blood pressure and may be an effective strategy for the early management of hypertension. Importance Low-dose combination antihypertensives consisting of 3 or 4 blood pressure –lowering drugs have emerged as a potentially important therapy for the initial management of hypertension. agent and more recently have recommended starting with dual combinations for an increasing proportion of people.

3, 4 These guidelines only recommend triple combination therapy in those whose BP remains uncontrolled with dual therapy. 3, 4 However, trial data have recently emerged relating to a new paradigm of hypertension treatment, indicating that low-dose combinations of 3 or more BP-lowering agents, are a potentially useful initial or early treatment strategy. Compared to initial monotherapy or usual care, LDC was associated with greater reduction in mean SBP at 6 to 12 months follow-up. Similarly, at 6 to 12 months follow-up, compared to initial monotherapy or usual care, LDC was associated with significantly greater proportions achieving BP less than 140/90 mm Hg. Usual care did not eventually catch up to an initial LDC strategy in terms of hypertension control.

At 6 months in the Quadruple Ultra-Low-Dose Treatment for Hypertension 13 and Treatment for Immune Mediated Pathophysiology 14 trials, LDC was associated with a 21% greater rate of achieving BP less than 140/90 mm Hg compared to the initial monotherapy strategy. Importantly, LDC therapies were well tolerated and were not associated with greater rates of treatment withdrawal than initial monotherapy strategies.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111xhpHY]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension guideline — single-pill combination treatment strategy to improve blood pressure control states the preferred use of two-drug combination therapy for the initial treatment of most people with hypertension, a single-pill treatment strategy for hypertension with the preferred use of single-pill combination (SPC) therapy for most patients, and simplified drug treatment algorithms with the preferred use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), combined with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and/or a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, as the core treatment strategy for most patients, with beta-blockers used for specific indications.

### Initial treatment with a single capsule containing half-dose quadruple therapy vs standard-dose dual therapy in hypertensive patients (QUADUAL): a randomized, blinded, crossover trial [^113hUSQP]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, some researchers proposed the hypothesis that low-dose multidrug combinations (≥ 3) offered better antihypertensive effects and fewer side effects in initial treatment, and conducted preliminary investigations into this field, further breaking the stereotyped thought that the current antihypertensive regimen started with a combination of two drugs, based on which 2023 ESH hypertension guidelines mentioned the quadpill concept. However, none of the above studies compared the dual therapy recommended by hypertension guidelines and involved the Chinese population. Our findings addressed these gaps, and strengthened the conclusion that small dose of quadruple drugs were more effective in lowering blood pressure than standard-dose dual drugs. In our study, half-dose quadruple therapy reduced SBP by 4.72 mmHg more than standard-dose dual therapy, which is less than the QUARTET trial, where quadruple quarter-dose therapy lowered SBP by 6.9 mmHg more than standard-dose monotherapy. This is consistent with the current understanding that the combination of two different medications is more effective than doubling the dose of a single drug. In addition, the primary outcome of our study was 24-h SBP, which is a better metric compared to office BP. This is also an advantage compared to previous research. Recent years, higher TTR was found associated with a decreased risk of death from any cause and major adverse cardiovascular events. So, we added to analysed this parameter retrospectively and found that small dose of quadruple drugs could significantly increase TTR. Though the decrease of home blood pressure at the fourth week between two treatments seemed no obvious difference, the longitudinal home blood pressure within the four weeks and TTR revealed significant advantages in small dose of quadruple drugs. The suspected reason may be nervousness on the day of visit, making the home blood pressure higher on that day.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112mNnxT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

A limitation of our study is that although larger and longer than most studies comparing combination to monotherapy, results are limited to 1 year and cannot address the impact on morbidity and mortality. In the VALUE study, a 3.8‐mm Hg lower clinic systolic BP in the first 3 months of the study translated into a significant increase in the primary end point driven mainly by mortality and stroke and was borderline for increased myocardial infarction. In our study, clinic systolic BP was 10.1 mm Hg lower in the first 2 months and 6.8 mm Hg on average lower over the first 4 months on combination therapy versus sequential monotherapy, and it is likely that such differences applied to a large population would be clinically important, especially those with similar cardiovascular risk, as participate in morbidity–mortality studies. The BP Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration found that the relative risk reduction of BP lowering was similar for low‐ and higher risk individuals. 26 It is likely that significant proportional reductions in cardiovascular events would accrue from treating all hypertensive patients with initial combination therapy. Some reviewers argued that more powerful ARBs have been identified since our study was initiated, citing a meta‐analysis of azilsartan, 27 or that HCTZ 25 mg is a paltry and unacceptable diuretic because in combination with this same ARB, it reduced systolic BP by 5.6 mm Hg less than a combination with chlortalidone, weighting a meta‐analysis of thiazide‐like versus thiazide‐type diuretics. 28, 29 There is a paucity of outcome data for the latter at their widely used modern doses. These are potentiated by ARBs, with which they are frequently combined to block the compensatory effect of renin–angiotensin stimulation. 19, 22 In the only randomized morbidity–mortality study to demonstrate superiority of an ARB to an active control, losartan was combined with HCTZ 12.5 to 25 mg in most participants. 30 In a retrospective analysis of a nonrandomized, unmatched comparison of HCTZ and chlortalidone, the event rate was lower in patients receiving chlortalidone (> 50 mg in 48%, specialist intervention in 84%) rather than HCTZ (> 50 mg in 28%, specialist intervention in 45%). 31 Not all international guidelines have been convinced of the superiority of thiazide‐like over thiazide‐type diuretics, and these have been compared directly for > 12 weeks in < 100 patients. 29, 32

### Effects of renin-angiotensin system inhibition on end-organ protection: can we do better? [^116QKzUN]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a major regulator of blood pressure (BP) and vascular response to injury. There is increasing evidence that RAS inhibition may provide end-organ protection independent of BP lowering. Two drug classes directly target angiotensin II through complementary mechanisms. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to the active peptide angiotensin II and increase the availability of bradykinin. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) selectively antagonize angiotensin II at AT₁ receptors and may also increase activation of the AT₂ receptor and modulate the effects of angiotensin II breakdown products.

Objectives

This paper presents an overview of clinical data supporting the use of RAS inhibitors (ACE inhibitors and ARBs) as monotherapy or combination therapy based on the known role of the RAS in BP regulation and the vascular response to injury, and considers the implications of the data for future treatment.

Methods

Relevant experimental and clinical studies were identified by searching MEDLINE (1969-June 30, 2007) using the primary search terms renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker, and dual RAS blockade. Trials included in the review were large (> 200 patients), prospective, randomized controlled studies evaluating the effect of RAS inhibition on end-organ protection in various high-risk populations.

Results

Eleven clinical trials each were identified that evaluated the effect of ACE-inhibitor and ARB monotherapy on end-organ protection. Five trials were identified that evaluated the effects of combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB compared with treatment with either agent alone in different patient populations using different end points. In hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, combination ACE-inhibitor/ARB therapy resulted in better BP control than either agent alone (mean difference, 11.2 mm Hg systolic [P = 0.002], 5.9 mm Hg diastolic [P = 0.003]), as well as greater reductions in microalbuminuria (mean difference in albumin:creatinine ratio, 34%; P = 0.04). Compared with monotherapy, dual RAS inhibition reduced the occurrence of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration or end-stage renal disease by 60% to 62% in patients with nondiabetic renal disease (P = 0.018 vs ACE inhibitor alone; P = 0.016 vs ARB alone). A recently published study reported a nonsignificant benefit for combination therapy over monotherapy only in a subset of hypertensive patients with high levels of microalbuminuria at baseline (58.1% vs 43.4% reduction, respectively). In patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, the relative risk for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure was reduced by 15% in those who received an ARB added to an ACE inhibitor compared with those who received placebo added to an ACE inhibitor (P = 0.011). Another study found no benefit on mortality or cardiovascular end points with combination therapy compared with ACE-inhibitor monotherapy. Ongoing studies are investigating dual RAS blockade in patients at high risk for end-organ damage, as well as the most effective doses for use in combination regimens.

Conclusions

There is accumulating evidence that antihypertensive regimens that inhibit the RAS may provide incremental end-organ protection. Combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs to provide more extensive RAS inhibition may provide greater antihypertensive efficacy and end-organ protection than use of either class alone. Future strategies for treating high-risk patients will focus on early interventions that prevent or delay end-organ damage.

### Long-term event rates, risk factors, and treatment pattern in 1.4 million individuals qualifying for dual blood pressure lowering therapy [^115HxR3D]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2018 European Society of Cardiology and European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) guidelines and the 2023 ESH guidelines recommend initiating dual combination therapy in most individuals requiring BP-lowering treatment. A targeted literature search (Supplementary data file "PubMed query for prior evidence") indicated a lack of data on the estimates of cardiovascular event rates, risk factors, treatment patterns, and BP control in a population qualifying for the initiation of dual combination therapy. The quantification of cardiovascular event rates, risk factors, and treatment patterns is important for assessing the magnitude of clinical benefit, with improved guideline concordance in real-world populations, overall and in relevant high-risk subgroups. This real-world study aimed to assess the rates of cardiovascular events and all-cause death, associated risk factors, and patterns of BP-lowering therapies in population with hypertension qualifying for initiating dual combination therapy representing usual clinical practice setting in England with 15-year follow-up period.

Findings from this study were utilized in a companion study, which provided estimates of clinical benefit due to guidelines based antihypertensive treatment in this population and provide insights into subgroups and treatment strategies that result in a high clinical benefit.

### Combination antihypertensive drugs: recommendations… [^113RewBE]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Combination therapy does not obviate the need for serial monitoring of serum electrolyte levels, but it does decrease the incidence of thiazide-induced hypokalemia without an increased risk of hyperkalemia.
12. 6, 20 The combination of a beta blocker and a diuretic produces additive effects compared with monotherapy using either agent alone. A recent study. 21 assessed the safety and efficacy of antihypertensive therapy using the cardioselective beta blocker bisoprolol alone and in combination with low dosages of hydrochlorothiazide. The dosages of bisoprolol were 2. 5, 5 and 10 mg per day. The hydrochlorothiazide dosages were 6. 25 and 25 mg per day. The study showed that monotherapy with either agent was more effective than placebo, but that when combination therapy was used, the beneficial effects were greater than when either agent was used alone.
21.

22 of black patients with hypertension compared monotherapy using 20 mg per day of enalapril with combination therapy consisting of 20 mg of enalapril plus
12. 5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day. Combination therapy significantly reduced systolic, diastolic and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements compared with monotherapy. Combination therapy controlled blood pressure to a level of less than 140/90 mm Hg in 74 percent of patients. Calcium channel blocker–ACE inhibitor combinations may result in fewer or milder side effects than occur with either agent alone. The addition of an ACE inhibitor to therapy with a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist significantly reduces the incidence of peripheral edema and reflex tachycardia. Neither class of medications has prominent metabolic side effects, an advantage in patients with diabetes and renal disease. Four fixed-dose combinations of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors are currently available in the United States.

These combinations have yet to be proved more efficacious than antihypertensive combinations containing diuretics. Final Comment The JNC VI 1 continues to recommend monotherapy with a diuretic or beta blocker as initial treatment for the undifferentiated patient with hypertension. At the same time, it is recognized that monotherapy will not provide adequate blood pressure control in a large proportion of patients, and that many patients will experience unacceptable side effects with higher dosages of a single agent. Fixed-dose combination antihypertensive medications are a useful and appropriate treatment option in this large group of patients.

### Long-term event rates, risk factors, and treatment pattern in 1.4 million individuals qualifying for dual blood pressure lowering therapy [^114b19TQ]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, there was a decrease in monotherapy from 56.7 to 42.6% in the overall population as well as in high-risk ASCVD (52.9 to 38.3%) and diabetes (57.7 to 42.3%) subgroups during 5-year follow-up, providing further opportunity to optimize guidelines recommended dual BP-lowering therapy. A higher use of monotherapy than dual combination therapy has also been reported. A potential reason could be that the index dates for patient identification ranged from 2005 to 2019, suggesting that the majority of patients received standard treatment in clinical practice prior to the 2018 ESC/ESH guideline recommending dual therapy. Another reason could be adoption of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommending an initial monotherapy in most patients with hypertension. Conversely, the population in this study is from England, where the prevalence of treatment with appropriate guideline-based therapies for chronic conditions can be higher than in other countries.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of initial treatment with single-pill combination antihypertensive medications [^1168AScL]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension guidelines recommend initiating treatment with single pill combination (SPC) antihypertensive medications, but SPCs are used by only one-third of treated hypertensive US adults. This analysis estimated the cost-effectiveness of initial treatment with SPC dual antihypertensive medications compared with usual care monotherapy in hypertensive US adults. The validated BP Control Model-Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Policy Model simulated initial SPC dual therapy (two half-standard doses in a single pill) compared with initial usual care monotherapy (half-standard dose when baseline systolic BP < 20mmHg above goal and one standard dose when ≥ 20mmHg above goal). Secondary analyses examined equivalent dose monotherapy (one standard dose) and equivalent dose dual therapy as separate pills (two half-standard doses). The primary outcomes were direct healthcare costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over 10 years from a US healthcare sector perspective. At 10 years, initial dual drug SPC was projected to yield 0.028 (95%UI 0.008 to 0.051) more QALYs at no greater cost ($73, 95%UI -$1 983 to $1 629) than usual care monotherapy. In secondary analysis, SPC dual therapy was cost-effective vs. equivalent dose monotherapy (ICER $8 000/QALY gained) and equivalent dose dual therapy as separate pills (ICER $57 000/QALY gained). At average drug prices, initiating antihypertensive treatment with SPC dual therapy is more effective at no greater cost than usual care initial monotherapy and has the potential to improve BP control rates and reduce the burden of CVD in the US.

### Establishing a new option for target-organ protection: rationale for ARB plus ACE inhibitor combination therapy [^1121SKvq]. American Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the promotion of cardiovascular disease and target-organ damage, mediated in part by hypertension. Combination therapy targeting RAS activation may reduce target-organ damage and provide superior blood pressure (BP) control; combining angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) represents one possible approach. In monotherapy studies, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have demonstrated similar positive effects on BP and on RAS-related target-organ damage, including nephropathy and congestive heart failure. Studies of combination therapy, most of which involved addition of an ARB to existing ACE inhibitor therapy, have demonstrated benefits among patients with congestive heart failure and renal disease. However, variances in study design and populations, dosing and titration methods, and clinical end points, in addition to inherent differences between agents, limit the ability to reach clinically meaningful conclusions about the value of dual RAS inhibition. Trials designed to document such efficacy are currently underway.

### Comparing scale up of status quo hypertension care against dual combination therapy as separate pills or single pill combinations: an economic evaluation in 24 low-and middle-income countries [^111fQSCJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

To date, however, few countries have adopted combination therapy as a form of first-line treatment. In addition, SPC uptake in LMICs is low due in part to cost and availability. Evidence is needed on the impact of potential changes as health authorities consider incorporating new recommendations into their national clinical practice guidelines.

The objective of this study was to assess the costs and consequences of initiating pharmacological treatment on two medications (as opposed to monotherapy) and of using SPCs versus separate pills within those regimens. For each pathway, in 24 LMICs, we quantified the costs of scaling antihypertensive pharmacological treatment at the national level, and the expected health (i.e. avoided cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)) and economic benefits (i.e. healthcare savings, monetized benefits of reduced mortality and morbidity).

### Triple-combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension: a review of the evidence [^111etyVR]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a serious public health concern with inadequate control of blood pressure (BP) worldwide. Contributing factors include low efficacy of drugs, underuse of combination therapies, irrational combinations, physicians' therapeutic inertia and poor adherence to treatment. Current guidelines recommend the use of initial (dual) combination therapy in high-risk patients for immediate BP response, better short- and long-term BP control, and continued/improved patient adherence. This article aims to review the existing evidence of triple-combination therapies with respect to efficacy, safety and adherence to treatment. It is estimated that three drugs are required to achieve BP control in approximately one-fourth to one-third of patients. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that triple combinations of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine/telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide produce greater BP reductions, with greater proportions of patients achieving BP control compared with dual therapies. Further evidence also demonstrates that triple-combination therapy is efficacious for moderate to severe hypertension, with substantial additional BP reduction over dual regimens. Both RCTs and post-marketing observational studies have shown consistent and comparable efficacy in both the general population and high-risk hypertensive subgroups. Triple therapies are generally well tolerated with adverse event profiles similar to dual regimens. In addition, fixed-dose combinations used as single pill improve patient adherence leading to better long-term BP control. Depending on regional circumstances, they may also be cost effective. Thus, single-pill triple combinations of different classes of drugs with complementary mechanisms of action help to treat patients to goal with improved efficacy and better adherence to treatment.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111N7KCo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for hypertension vary in their preference for initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy, stratified by patient profile; therefore, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of these approaches.

Methods and Results

We performed a 1‐year, double‐blind, randomized controlled trial in 605 untreated patients aged 18 to 79 years with systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 95 mm Hg. In phase 1 (weeks 0–16), patients were randomly assigned to initial monotherapy (losartan 50–100 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg crossing over at 8 weeks), or initial combination (losartan 50–100 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg). In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve target. Hierarchical primary outcomes were the difference from baseline in home systolic, averaged over phases 1 and 2 and, if significant, at 32 weeks. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, and difference in home systolic BP responses between tertiles of plasma renin. Home systolic BP after initial monotherapy fell 4.9 mm Hg (range: 3.7–6.0 mm Hg) less over 32 weeks (P < 0.001) than after initial combination but caught up at 32 weeks (difference 1.2 mm Hg [range: −0.4 to 2.8 mm Hg], P = 0.13). In phase 1, home systolic BP response to each monotherapy differed substantially between renin tertiles, whereas response to combination therapy was uniform and at least 5 mm Hg more than to monotherapy. There were no differences in withdrawals due to adverse events.

Conclusions

Initial combination therapy can be recommended for patients with BP > 150/95 mm Hg.

### The role of riociguat in combination therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension [^1121pa9U]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Effective clinical decision-making in initial treatment selection and switching or escalations of therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) depends on multiple factors including the patient's risk profile. Data from clinical trials suggest that switching from a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) to the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat may provide clinical benefit in patients not reaching treatment goals. In this review, we cover the clinical evidence for riociguat combination regimens for patients with PAH and discuss their evolving role in upfront combination therapy and switching from a PDE5i as an alternative to escalating therapy. Specifically, we review current evidence which suggests or provides a hypothesis for 1) the potential use of riociguat plus endothelin receptor antagonist combinations for upfront combination therapy in patients with PAH at intermediate to high risk of 1-year mortality and 2) the benefits of switching to riociguat from a PDE5i in patients who are not achieving treatment goals with PDE5i-based dual combination therapy and at intermediate risk.

Introduction

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with a major associated risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration and reduced healthcare costs. Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs compared with corresponding free-drug combinations is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects. A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity/mortality. This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs and the rationale for using particular combinations in patients with hypertension and renal impairment.

Why should early combination therapy be considered?

Worldwide guidelines recommend combination therapy as a first-line treatment option for hypertension likely not to be controlled on monotherapy (e.g. 20/10 mmHg above target BP) because of evidence showing that only a minority of patients will achieve and maintain BP goals on monotherapy. The recent re-appraisal of the European guidelines also recommended the preferential use of SPCs to improve adherence.

There are a number of compelling reasons why early combination therapy should be used in patients with hypertension (Table 1), including lack of efficacy with monotherapy, greater BP control and attenuation of side effects associated with monotherapeutic treatment. In addition, hypertensive patients with comorbidities, such as renal disease, might benefit from additional effects of multiple antihypertensive agents, beyond those related to BP lowering.

### Fixed-dose combination antihypertensives and risk of medication errors [^116RuvTs]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fixed-dose combinations (FDC), single medications or dosage forms that contain a combination of two or more active ingredients, are becoming increasingly common. They are most often used where multiple drugs may be required to treat/control a condition, such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, or hypertension, and polypills combining more diverse drug combinations (eg, for cardiovascular prevention) also exist. By replacing multiple treatments, they can reduce pill burden for patients and simplify medication regimens. For this reason, FDCs can increase adherence compared with patients taking the equivalent drugs separately, and improve objective measures such as blood pressure. Combination therapy using multiple drugs acting on different therapeutic targets can produce synergistic effects and provide superior efficacy compared with monotherapy. Using multiple agents can also benefit tolerability where a combination allows for each drug to be used at lower doses than would be required if either drug was used alone, reducing the risk of adverse effects. Hypertension is one of the conditions where FDCs are used most commonly. Most patients require multiple antihypertensive drugs to meet blood pressure targets, and hence the greatest number of FDCs is in this therapeutic area. Hypertension is highly prevalent, particularly among older people, and is often comorbid with other conditions in this age group. Hence, FDCs may be particularly beneficial for such patients with high pill burdens for whom adherence to treatment may be challenging. Studies have demonstrated the advantages both in efficacy and safety of utilising multiple antihypertensives instead of a higher dose of a single agent, and there is evidence from a recent Cochrane review that initiating combination antihypertensive therapy rather than monotherapy may be advantageous.

A disadvantage to FDCs is the 'fixed' nature of the dosing combinations may make dosage adjustment more difficult, leading to potential underdosing or overdosing.FDCs may reduce the ability to identify the cause of an adverse drug event relating to one of the drug ingredients. FDCs could also contribute to medication errors. They are frequently prescribed by brand name, and presence of multiple ingredients available in varying strengths within a single product adds complexity to the prescribing and dispensing process. Medication errors cause a substantial burden of patient harm, morbidity and mortality; however, the impact of FDCs on medication safety and prescribing quality has not been extensively evaluated to date. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine if prescriptions for antihypertensive FDCs increase the risk of prescribing errors, namely therapeutic duplications and potentially serious drug–drug interactions (DDI), compared with the free combination (FC) ingredients prescribed separately.

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1173nzWT]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Choice of initial monotherapy versus initial combination therapy — adults with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg) are recommended to start two first-line agents of different classes, ideally as a single-pill combination (SPC), to improve blood pressure control and adherence. In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiating therapy with a single first-line drug is reasonable with dose titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve control. In adults with hypertension, simultaneous use of an ACEi, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor in combination is not recommended due to the potential for harm.

### Initial treatment with a single capsule containing half-dose quadruple therapy vs standard-dose dual therapy in hypertensive patients (QUADUAL): a randomized, blinded, crossover trial [^115D5Zx5]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This crossover trial demonstrated that initiating treatment with half-dose quadruple combination therapy was more effective in lowering blood pressure than starting with standard-dose dual therapy. Apart from significant increases of fasting blood glucose and blood uric acid in the half-dose quadruple group, no other adverse events or changes in laboratory values differed significantly between the two treatments.

Early attainment of target blood pressure is known to lower cardiovascular risk and lead to better prognosis. Aggressive treatment of patients with grade 1 and 2 hypertension could reduce 803,000 cardiovascular events per year and increase 1.2 million quality-adjusted life years compared with maintaining the status quo, yielding considerable socioeconomic benefits. The PURE study noted that less than 1/3 of hypertensive patients achieved target blood pressure after starting with only monotherapy. Compared with monotherapy, combination therapy at the initiation of antihypertensive treatment increased magnitude of blood pressure reduction and shortened time to target blood pressure, even in patients with grade 1 hypertension.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^112GWY6k]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Core drug treatment strategy for uncomplicated hypertension — initial therapy uses dual combination "ACEi or ARB + CCB or diuretic"; if further control is needed, step up to the triple combination "ACEi or ARB + CCB + diuretic", and for resistant hypertension add spironolactone (25–50 mg o.d.) or other diuretic, alpha-blocker or beta-blocker, with consideration of referral to a specialist centre for further investigation. Consider monotherapy in low risk grade 1 hypertension (systolic BP < 150mmHg), or in very old (≥ 80 years) or frailer patients. Consider beta-blockers at any treatment step, when there is a specific indication for their use, e.g. heart failure, angina, post-MI, atrial fibrillation, or younger women with, or planning, pregnancy; ACEi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker), CCB (calcium channel blocker), and o.d. (omni die) are defined on-page.

### Efficacy and safety of dual combination therapy of blood pressure-lowering drugs as initial treatment for hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114cPNrM]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of dual combination of blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs as initial treatment for hypertension.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL were searched until August 2017 for randomized, double-blind trials of dual combination therapy vs. monotherapy in adults with hypertension who were either treatment naïve or untreated for at least 4 weeks. Regimens were classified with reference to usual daily 'standard-dose'; for example, < 1+ < 1 for a combination of two drugs both at less than one standard-dose. Random-effects models were used for meta-analysis.

Results

Thirty-three trials (13095 participants) with mean baseline mean BP 155/100mmHg were included. Compared with standard-dose monotherapy, dual combinations of < 1+ < 1, 1+ < 1 and 1+1 (i.e. low-to-standard dose), showed a dose-response relationship in reducing SBP [mean differences (95% confidence interval) of 2.8 (1.6–4.0), 4.6 (3.4–5.7) and 7.5 (5.4–9.5)mmHg, respectively], and in improving BP control [risk ratio (RR) (95% confidence interval) 1.11 (0.92–1.34), 1.25 (1.16–1.35) and 1.42 (1.27–1.58), respectively]. Withdrawals due to adverse events were uncommon with low-to-standard dose dual combinations, with no significant difference compared with standard-dose monotherapy [2.9 vs. 2.2%; RR 1.28 (0.85 to 1.92)]. There were fewer data for higher dose dual combinations, which did not appear to produce substantial additional efficacy and could potentially be less tolerable.

Conclusion

Compared with standard-dose monotherapy, initiating treatment with low-to-standard dose dual combination therapy is more efficacious without increasing withdrawals due to adverse events.

### Initial treatment with a single capsule containing half-dose quadruple therapy vs standard-dose dual therapy in hypertensive patients (QUADUAL): study protocol for a randomized, blinded, crossover trial [^113zTrFL]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Combined antihypertensive therapy has obvious advantages over single drug therapy. Hypertension guidelines fully affirm the efficacy of dual combination in initial antihypertensive therapy. Recent studies have also pointed out that the quadruple combination of very low-dose antihypertensive drugs is superior to single drugs. However, whether low-dose quadruple therapy is better than dual combination is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of half-dose quadruple therapy vs standard-dose dual therapy in the initial treatment of hypertensive patients with systolic/diastolic blood pressure 140–179/90–109 mm Hg.

Methods

A randomized double-blind crossover clinical trial will be conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of low-dose quadruple antihypertensives (irbesartan 75 mg + metoprolol 23.75 mg + amlodipine 2.5 mg + indapamide 1.25 mg) with standard-dose dual antihypertensives (irbesartan 150 mg + amlodipine 5 mg) in the initial treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension (140–179/90–109 mm Hg). Ninety patients are required and will be recruited and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 2 crossover groups. Two groups will receive a different combination therapy for 4 weeks, then switch to the other combination therapy for 4 weeks, with a 2-week wash-out. The patients will be followed up for 4 weeks to compare the antihypertensive effects and related adverse effects of the 2 antihypertensive combination treatments.

Conclusions

We present the rationale for the design of the QUADUAL trial. The trial started in July 2022 and is expected to be completed by August 2023. The study aims to evaluate if an initial treatment regimen of quadruple combination of half-dose blood pressure medications will result in greater reduction in blood pressure and fewer side effects compared to standard dose dual therapy.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^113TaGwi]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacological treatment — For hypertension: We recommend offering a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker, or either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker as primary pharmacologic therapy for hypertension for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes. In African American patients with hypertension, we recommend against using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker as monotherapy. In hypertensive patients 65 years and over, we suggest a thiazide-type diuretic for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes. We recommend against more than one of the following three drug classes together in the same patient: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct renin inhibitors. For the treatment of hypertension, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against initiating combination therapy over initiating monotherapy with the sequential addition of another medication.

### Efficacy and safety of quarter-dose blood pressure-lowering agents: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114vT1GW]. Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

There is a critical need for blood pressure-lowering strategies that have greater efficacy and minimal side effects. Low-dose combinations hold promise in this regard, but there are few data on very-low-dose therapy. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with at least one quarter-dose and one placebo and standard-dose monotherapy arm. A search was conducted of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Registry, Food and Drug Administration, and European Medicinal Agency websites. Data on blood pressure and adverse events were pooled using a fixed-effect model, and bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias. The review included 42 trials involving 20284 participants. Thirty-six comparisons evaluated quarter-dose with placebo and indicated a blood pressure reduction of -4.7/-2.4 mmHg (P < 0.001). Six comparisons were of dual quarter-dose therapy versus placebo, observing a -6.7/ -4.4 mmHg (P < 0.001) blood pressure reduction. There were no trials of triple quarter-dose combination versus placebo, but one quadruple quarter-dose study observed a blood pressure reduction of -22.4/-13.1 mmHg versus placebo (P < 0.001). Compared with standard-dose monotherapy, the blood pressure differences achieved by single (37 comparisons), dual (7 comparisons), and quadruple (1 trial) quarter-dose combinations were +3.7/+2.6 (P < 0.001), +1.3/-0.3 (NS), and -13.1/-7.9 (P < 0.001) mmHg, respectively. In terms of adverse events, single and dual quarter-dose therapy was not significantly different from placebo and had significantly fewer adverse events compared with standard-dose monotherapy. Quarter-dose combinations could provide improvements in efficacy and tolerability of blood pressure-lowering therapy.

Recent evolution of dual and triple combinations. Schematic representation demonstrating the most rational (thick lines) combinations of classes of antihypertensive agents according to 2003 guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension.(A) Adaptation of the upper scheme including direct renin inhibitors (and omitting α-blockers) demonstrating dual (red lines) and triple (patterned triangles) combinations recently approved (since 2003) or in advanced (phase II–III) development in addition to the previously established combinations (blue thick lines). ARBs, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers; ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme. In all recent combinations calcium blockers are represented by amplodipine and diuretics by hydrochlorothiazide. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors + β-blockers stand for the combination of lisinopril + carvedilol, which is a combined β/α₁-blocker (B).

Although, unsurprisingly, the triple combinations provided more profound BP reduction and higher BP control rate without compromising the tolerability or safety, the question remains whether combination therapy should be administered in fixed-dose combinations or not. The advantages of single pill regimens are (i) more simple administration, (ii) more rapid achievement of BP goal than by gradual titration; (iii) existing simple and rapid full dose up-titration schemes; (iv) better patient adherence to therapy; (v) potential for fewer non-responders to a three-drug choice. On the other hand, their disadvantages include (i) higher risk of dose-independent adverse reactions, (ii) loss of dose flexibility, with possibly inappropriate dosing, and (iii) the inability to introduce a chronotherapeutic approach. Hence, individually tailored therapy is traded for reduced costs and simplification.

More studies on novel combinations including aliskiren as RAAS inhibitor or chlorthalidone as diuretic are on the way and the recommendations on triple therapy should become more specific. After more evidence is provided, patients that will mostly benefit from single-pill regimens can be identified, while in others the therapy may still be individually adjusted.

### Monotherapy in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension at four German PH centres [^111LGHPb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although combination therapy is the gold standard for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), some of these patients are still being treated with monotherapy.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis at four German PH centres to describe the prevalence and characteristics of patients receiving monotherapy.

Results

We identified 131 incident PAH patients, with a mean age of 64 ± 13.8 years and a varying prevalence of comorbidities, cardiovascular risk factors and targeted therapy. As in other studies, the extent of prescribed PAH therapy varied with age and coexisting diseases, and younger, so-called "typical" PAH patients were more commonly treated early with combination therapy (48% at 4–8 months). In contrast, patients with multiple comorbidities or cardiovascular risk factors were more often treated with monotherapy (69% at 4–8 months). Survival at 12 months was not significantly associated with the number of PAH drugs used (single, dual, triple therapy) and was not different between "atypical" and "typical" PAH patients (89% vs. 85%).

Conclusion

Although "atypical" PAH patients with comorbidities or a more advanced age are less aggressively treated with respect to combination therapy, the outcome of monotherapy in these patients appears to be comparable to that of dual or triple therapy in "typical" PAH patients.

### Single pill combination therapy for hypertension: new evidence and new challenges: combination therapy for hypertension [^116DkB2F]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) continues to be one of the most important risk factors for major cardiovascular events and mortality. The global prevalence of hypertension is approximately 30% among adults over 20 years old. Cardiovascular risk stratification is crucial to determine the most appropriate pharmacological therapeutic strategy for hypertensive patients. Despite the many scales to stratify risk, none is perfect and represents weighted mathematical models to determine risk at 10 years. Reports have identified numerous limitations, and the challenge persists. A practical way to determine CV risk is the clinical approach based on 1) the number of risk factors, 2) the degree of elevation of blood pressure, 3) the presence of target organ damage/DM/CKD, and 4) a history of major cardiovascular events. Currently, it is recommended to start with dual therapy in a single pill (either ACE inhibitors or ARB2 + dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic); however, many patients could need to start with triple therapy (low or standard doses) if they belong to the high- or very high-risk group with elevation grade 2 or 3 of blood pressure. This article discusses this topic and establishes some practical recommendations for the physician of first contact.

### Initial combination therapy for rapid and effective control of moderate and severe hypertension [^113xQWJy]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Moderate (grade 2) and severe (grade 3) hypertension are important public health problems associated with high cardiovascular risk. Blood pressure (BP) control becomes more difficult to achieve as hypertension progresses. Therefore, early and effective treatment is essential to prevent hypertensive urgencies and emergencies and reduce cardiovascular risk. Currently, less than 50% of patients being treated for moderate or severe hypertension in the United States achieve their BP goal as recommended by treatment guidelines. This review examines the cardiovascular risk and physician inertia associated with moderate and severe hypertension, and concludes that increased use of initial combination therapy can overcome many of the barriers to effective BP control. Furthermore, initial combination therapy with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor and diuretic has the potential to rapidly and effectively reduce BP across a range of baseline BPs, with a comparable adverse event profile to monotherapy.

### Comparing scale up of status quo hypertension care against dual combination therapy as separate pills or single pill combinations: an economic evaluation in 24 low-and middle-income countries [^112foKuc]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our analysis of 24 countries — spanning income levels and regions — demonstrated that adjusting treatment guidelines to administer two or more medications as initial therapy for patients with hypertension is likely to generate higher net benefits in relatively more developed countries, and that using SPCs within those guidelines generates higher net benefits in most (16/24) countries compared to baseline practices. While a previous study by Borghi and colleagues (2021) modelled the health benefits (e.g. lives saved) of similar scenarios (see results comparison in Appendix A Table S4.2), to our knowledge this is the first modelling study that has assessed the costs and health and socio-economic benefits of scaling combination treatment with and without SPCs. In doing so, our study answers the call to develop economic evaluations that assess the budgetary consequences and cost-effectiveness of combination versus monotherapy. Results are supportive of recommendations in international hypertension treatment guidelines to administer combination therapy as first-line initial treatment using SPCs. However, considering differing findings by income status, caution should be taken to consider economic circumstances and undertake country-specific analyses.

### Implications of recently published trials of blood pressure-lowering drugs in hypertensive or high-risk patients [^114Wt8bH]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

We reviewed 6 recent outcome trials of blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs in 74,524 randomized hypertensive or high-risk patients. Over interpretation of nonsignificant or marginal probability values in large trials with overlapping end points, exclusion of patients not tolerating or not adhering to experimental treatments, labeling nonsignificant treatment effects as modest, and insufficient information on the quality of the BP measurements or on the BP changes early after randomization raise concern. From a clinical viewpoint, results should not be extrapolated to patients with characteristics dissimilar from those randomized. The benefit beyond BP lowering in cardiovascular prevention is tiny. Dual inhibition of the renin system should only be used in patients at high risk, in whom all drug combinations have been tried and who cannot be controlled by a single renin system inhibitor. Current evidence does not support BP lowering in normotensive patients or the use of renin system inhibitors for prevention of stroke recurrence. Because angiotensin-receptor blockers might offer less protection against myocardial infarction than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the latter should remain the preferred renin system inhibitor for cardiovascular prevention in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-tolerant patients. In 2 trials, in which new-onset diabetes was a predefined end point, 1000 patients had to be treated for 1 year with an angiotensin-receptor blocker instead of placebo to prevent just 2 cases. From a design viewpoint, the time has come to revise the concept of large simple trials and to pursue research questions that serve patient interests more than showing noninferiority or highlight the ancillary qualities of marketable antihypertensive drugs.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension guidelines — initial therapy selection: Monotherapy is usually inadequate therapy for most people with hypertension, and initial therapy for the majority of patients with hypertension should be with a combination of two drugs, not a single drug, with the only exception in a limited number of patients with a lower baseline BP close to their recommended target or in some frailer old or very old patients in whom more gentle reduction of BP may be desirable.

Drug combinations for hypertension treatment — trial designs and constraints: Among RCTs, only a few have directly compared different two‑drug combinations with systematic use of two combinations in both arms; more commonly, trials initiated monotherapy and added drugs in a non‑randomized fashion according to a pre‑specified algorithm; in some trials such as the Antihypertensive and Lipid‑Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), designs precluded what might be considered optimal combinations because multiple monotherapies were being evaluated and the add‑on therapy to either a diuretic, CCB, ACE inhibitor, or alpha‑blocker was a beta‑blocker, clonidine, or reserpine.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114kCRRQ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Single-pill combination therapy as usual therapy for hypertension — the 2013 ESH/ESC Guidelines favored the use of combinations of two antihypertensive drugs in a single pill, because reducing the number of pills to be taken daily improves adherence and increases the rate of BP control, and this recommendation is endorsed by the current Guidelines. In addition, the advantage of treatment simplification and adherence suggests that use of the polypill may be considered in patients with hypertension as substitution therapy when prior separate-tablet effectiveness of each component has been established.

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of antihypertensive drugs and their combinations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [^1133UAxf]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

We aimed to quantify the blood pressure-lowering efficacy of antihypertensive drugs and their combinations from the five major drug classes.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving adult participants randomly assigned to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, β blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics. Eligibility criteria included follow-up duration between 4 weeks and 26 weeks, antihypertensive drug treatment fixed in all participants for at least 4 weeks before follow-up blood pressure assessment; and availability of clinic blood pressure for the calculation of mean difference in systolic blood pressure between treatment groups. Crossover trials with less than 2 weeks' washout between the crossover periods were excluded. Eligible studies published between database inception and Dec 31, 2022 were identified from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Epistemonikos; searches were updated to include studies published between Jan 1, 2023, and Feb 28, 2025. The primary outcome was placebo-corrected reduction in systolic blood pressure. Blood pressure-lowering efficacy was estimated using fixed-effects meta-analyses standardised to mean baseline blood pressure across included trials. Drug regimens were categorised into low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to systolic blood pressure-lowering efficacy of < 10 mm Hg, 10–19 mm Hg, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively, from a baseline of 154 mm Hg. A model was developed to calculate efficacy for any combination of antihypertensives and validated on external trials of dual and triple combination antihypertensives. The study protocol was registered on the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202410036).

Findings

We analysed 484 trials including 104176 participants (mean age 54 years [SD 8], 57422 [55%] men, 46754 [45%] women, and mean baseline systolic blood pressure 154/100 mm Hg). Mean follow-up duration was 8.6 weeks (SD 5.2). On average, monotherapy at standard dose reduced systolic blood pressure by 8.7 mm Hg (95% CI 8.2–9.2), and each doubling in dose conferred an additional 1.5 mm Hg (1.2–1.7) reduction. Dual combinations at one standard dose conferred a 14.9 mm Hg (95% CI 13.1–16.8) reduction in systolic blood pressure, with each doubling of doses of both drugs conferring an additional reduction of 2.5 mm Hg (1.4–3.7). Each 10 mm Hg decrease in baseline systolic blood pressure reduced pressure-lowering efficacy by 1.3 mm Hg (1.0–1.5) for monotherapies, although differences between drug classes were observed. Among 57 monotherapies at standard dose, 45 (79%) were classified as low intensity. Of 189 different drug-dose dual combinations, 110 (58%) were classified as moderate intensity, and 21 (11%) as high intensity. There were considerable differences in dose-response and baseline blood pressure-response relationships between and within drug classes. The efficacy model showed a high correlation between predicted and observed systolic blood pressures when validated on external trials (r = 0.76, p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

These analyses provide robust estimates of the expected blood pressure-lowering effect for any combination of antihypertensive drugs, allowing their efficacy to be classified into low, moderate, and high intensity.

### Comparing scale up of status quo hypertension care against dual combination therapy as separate pills or single pill combinations: an economic evaluation in 24 low-and middle-income countries [^114sVtw8]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

International hypertension treatment guidelines recommend initiating pharmacological treatment with combination therapy and using fixed dose single pill combinations (SPCs) to improve adherence. However, few countries have adopted combination therapy as a form of first-line treatment and SPC uptake in low- and middle-income countries is low due in part to cost and availability. Evidence on costs and cost-effectiveness is needed as health authorities consider incorporating new recommendations into national clinical practice guidelines.

Methods

Over a 30-year time horizon, we used an Excel-based Markov cohort state-transition model to assess the financial costs (screening, treatment, program, and supply chain costs) and socio-economic outcomes (health outcomes, value of lives saved, productivity losses averted) of three antihypertensive treatment scenarios. A baseline scenario scaled treatment among adults age 30 plus while assuming continuation of the widespread practice of initiating treatment with monotherapy. Scenarios one and two scaled treatment while initiating patients on two antihypertensive medications, either as separate pills or as a SPC. Analysis inputs are informed by country-specific data, meta-analyses of the blood-pressure lowering of antihypertensive medications, and own-studies of medication costs. We compared costs, cost-effectiveness, and net-benefits across scenarios, and assessed uncertainty in a one-way sensitivity analysis.

Findings

Using dual combination therapy (with or without SPCs) as first-line treatment would increase costs relative to current practices that largely use monotherapy. Required additional annual resources averaged as much as 3.6, 0.9, and 0.2 percent of government health expenditures in the analysis' low-, lower-middle, and upper-middle income countries. However, across 24 countries, over the next 30 years, combination therapy with separate pills could save 430,000 more lives and combination therapy with SPCs could save 564,000 more lives compared to baseline treatment practices. Administration of two or more medications using SPCs generated higher net benefits in most countries (16/24) compared to the baseline scenario.

Interpretation

First line treatment employing SPCs is likely to generate higher net benefits compared to status quo treatment practices in countries with relatively higher incomes. To improve population health, national health systems would benefit from reducing structural and other barriers to the use of combination therapy and SPCs.

### Comparing scale up of status quo hypertension care against dual combination therapy as separate pills or single pill combinations: an economic evaluation in 24 low-and middle-income countries [^114xscTH]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Health benefits

Initiating hypertension patients on dual combination therapy using separate pills or SPCs (S1 and S2) had higher health benefits compared to treatment regimens in which monotherapy is the dominant form of treatment (baseline scenario).

Over 30 years, across countries, the baseline scenario would save more than 1.3 million lives, representing a nearly 7.5 percent reduction in deaths compared to if status quo effective coverage rates persisted. If all individuals who would have been administered monotherapy in the baseline scenario instead were administered dual combination therapy employing separate pills (S1), 429,639 more lives could be saved. Additional blood-pressure lowering from using SPCs in place of separate pills in dual combination therapy regimens (S2) saves an additional 134,615 thousand lives over S1. Altogether, treating patients with dual combination therapy and using SPCs within those regimens (S2) saves 43 percent more lives than adhering to status quo treatment practices (baseline scenario). Fig. 3 shows the number of lives saved in each scenario by country and scenario, and percent reduction in deaths compared to a status quo scenario. Appendix A Table S4.1 and Fig. S4.1 detail lives saved year-over-year, Table S4.1 details the absolute reduction in deaths in each scenario, Fig. S4.2 breaks down the ratio of lives saved by sex in the S2 scenario (47 percent female to 53 percent male) by country and Table S4.3 shows averted 30-year CVD incidence and DALYs by country.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113gqDFC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found a large average difference in HSBP in favor of initial use of combination therapy compared with initial monotherapy across the first 8 months of the study (phases 1 and 2); there was no discernible subset of patients in whom this difference was not observed. It was largely due to the superiority of combination therapy in the first 16 weeks (phase 1), by margins of almost 8 and 10 mm Hg, respectively, for home and clinic systolic BP. Although combination therapy is expected to show superior efficacy and is recommended for stage 2 hypertension by some guidelines, this has not yet become the norm in routine practice. Consequently, we incorporated a number of planned measurements in the study design that we believed, if positive, would help to change practice.

The first of the additional measurements was the co–primary end point of HSBP at 32 weeks, the prespecified time point for evaluation of the never‐catch‐up hypothesis that initial less intense BP control results in subsequently poorer BP control. This hypothesis was rejected. Never catching up in the ASCOT and VALUE trials, from which the hypothesis arose, may be more a consequence of suboptimal treatments being combined rather than optimal treatments being started sequentially. 7, 10 In contrast, our other original comparisons provide strong support for the rationale of initial combination. A unique feature of PATHWAY‐1 is the "trial within a trial" of a randomized monotherapy crossover trial, the aims of which were to ensure that each participant's best therapy at maximal force‐titrated dose was compared with combination therapy. Several clear‐cut, connected findings emerged. First, we established that among the baseline predictors of BP response to each drug, plasma renin provided a measure with substantial and significant differences in response to losartan and HCTZ between the outer tertiles (BP lowering by HCTZ was greatest in the low‐renin tertile and by losartan in the high‐renin tertile). Second, and in marked contrast to the monotherapy responses, with combination therapy, BP reduction did not vary among tertiles of renin or with other predictors. The important practical inference is that initial combination is not only effective but uniformly effective, reducing the heterogeneity in response — as illustrated by the 97% responder and 75% control rates (Table S3), with odds ratios of 8 and 5 compared with monotherapy. Third, as graphically illustrated in Figure 3 C, initial combination therapy is not only uniformly effective and superior to monotherapy but is uniformly superior to personalized monotherapy, whether achieved by prediction of each patient's best drug or by systematic crossover between the options. Even if, within the environment of a trial — with its forced dose‐drug titrations and fixed visit appointments — BP in the monotherapy arm caught up with initial combination by 32 weeks, it is reasonable to suggest the marked advantage for everyday practice of a regimen that achieves target BP in the shortest possible time and the least number of visits.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 30 days… [^113VEWp3]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What is the balance of benefits and harms for dual antiplatelet therapy compared with monotherapy for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Bottom Line For patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel for up to 30 days reduces the likelihood of subsequent stroke more than aspirin monotherapy, with a small increase in the risk of major hemorrhage. A longer duration of therapy increases the risk of harm without increasing the likelihood of benefit. Synopsis The authors identified randomized trials that compared dual antiplatelet therapy with monotherapy, started within three days of the index stroke or TIA.

In some cases, the researchers were able to get data for the subset of patients who were randomized within three days from studies in which longer intervals were allowed between stroke and randomization. Monotherapy was aspirin in 15 studies and clopidogrel in two studies. The most common dual antiplatelet therapy regimen was aspirin plus clopidogrel. The largest study compared aspirin alone with aspirin plus ticagrelor; because of the size of the study, the authors performed sensitivity analyses with and without this trial. Using dual antiplatelet therapy instead of monotherapy for 30 days or less resulted in 20 fewer strokes and two more major hemorrhages per 1, 000 patients. The likelihood of major hemorrhage was the same when the THALES trial was excluded, although there was no longer a significant difference in the risk of hemorrhage between the aspirin and dual antiplatelet therapy groups.

The authors stratified the analysis by treatment of more than 30 days or 30 days or less. Although the benefit was similar for a treatment duration of up to 30 days, the risk of hemorrhage was greater with a longer duration of therapy.
