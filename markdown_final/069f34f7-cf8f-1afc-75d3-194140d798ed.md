## Question

What were the mortality results at 28 days and at 6 months in PATCH-Trauma for tranexamic acid versus placebo?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the 28-day and 6-month mortality results in the PATCH-Trauma randomized trial comparing prehospital tranexamic acid versus placebo. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact trial design and intervention. Then, I should verify the intention-to-treat populations and denominators at each time point. Next, I will extract the 28-day mortality figures and calculate the relative risk with confidence intervals. After that, I will extract the 6-month mortality figures and do the same. Finally, I should consider clinical significance, safety, and how these results fit with broader evidence and timing hypotheses.

> Let me first confirm the trial and intervention details so I don't misstate anything. PATCH-Trauma was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adults with major trauma at risk for trauma-induced coagulopathy, comparing prehospital tranexamic acid 1 g IV bolus followed by a 1 g infusion over 8 hours versus matching placebo, with enrollment across 15 EMS systems in Australia, New Zealand, and Germany [^914d00f3] [^e16567b1].

> I need to check the sample size and ITT denominators carefully. The trial enrolled 1310 patients, with 661 assigned to tranexamic acid and 646 to placebo; however, the 28-day mortality analysis included 653 in the TXA group and 637 in the placebo group, and the 6-month mortality analysis included 648 in the TXA group and 629 in the placebo group, so I should use those denominators for the calculations [^914d00f3].

> Now, let me extract the 28-day mortality results and double-check the math. In the TXA group, 113 of 653 patients died by day 28, and in the placebo group, 139 of 637 patients died, yielding 17.3% versus 21.8% mortality, respectively. The reported risk ratio is 0.79 with a 95% CI of 0.63 to 0.99, indicating a statistically significant reduction in 28-day mortality with TXA [^914d00f3] [^e16567b1].

> Wait, let me verify the 6-month mortality figures before concluding. In the TXA group, 123 of 648 patients died by 6 months, and in the placebo group, 144 of 629 patients died, corresponding to 19.0% versus 22.9% mortality. The reported risk ratio is 0.83 with a 95% CI of 0.67 to 1.03, which is a clinically meaningful absolute reduction but does not reach conventional statistical significance [^914d00f3] [^e16567b1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical relevance. The 28-day result is statistically significant and aligns with a time-dependent benefit seen in other trauma TXA trials, where early administration reduces early mortality, whereas the 6-month result, while numerically favorable, is underpowered for mortality and was not the primary outcome. Importantly, the primary outcome of PATCH-Trauma was 6-month favorable functional outcome, which did not differ between groups, so the mortality signal should be interpreted in that context [^914d00f3] [^e16567b1].

> I should confirm safety signals to ensure we're not missing harm. Serious adverse events, including vascular occlusive events, did not differ meaningfully between TXA and placebo in PATCH-Trauma, which supports the safety of the regimen in this setting, consistent with broader TXA safety data in trauma [^914d00f3] [^e16567b1].

> Let me consider the broader evidence base to avoid overgeneralizing. CRASH-2 demonstrated a modest reduction in all-cause mortality with TXA in bleeding trauma, with the clearest benefit when given within 3 hours, and CRASH-3 showed a reduction in head injury–related deaths in mild-to-moderate TBI when treated within 3 hours. STAAMP did not show a significant 30-day mortality reduction overall but found benefit in subgroups treated within 1 hour and in severe shock, reinforcing a timing-sensitive effect that helps explain why PATCH's 28-day signal may not translate into a significant 6-month difference [^c2bf2adb] [^14423adc] [^979e7465] [^8115da73].

> In summary, I should double-check that I've stated this precisely. At 28 days, prehospital tranexamic acid reduced mortality from 21.8% to 17.3% in PATCH-Trauma, a relative risk reduction of 21% with a 95% CI that excludes 1, indicating statistical significance. At 6 months, mortality was 19.0% with TXA versus 22.9% with placebo, a relative risk reduction of 17% with a 95% CI that includes 1, so this result is not statistically significant, though the absolute difference remains clinically notable and consistent with an early mortality benefit that attenuates over longer follow-up [^914d00f3] [^e16567b1].

---

In PATCH-Trauma, prehospital tranexamic acid reduced **28-day mortality** to 17.3% vs 21.8% with placebo (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63–0.99) [^914d00f3], but did not significantly reduce **6-month mortality** (19.0% vs 22.9%; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67–1.03) [^e16567b1]. The 28-day benefit was driven by early deaths from bleeding, whereas the 6-month outcome was not statistically significant, likely due to attenuation of effect over time and competing causes of death [^e16567b1].

---

## Mortality results at 28 days

- **28-day mortality**: 17.3% with TXA vs 21.8% with placebo (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63–0.99; P = 0.04) [^914d00f3].
- **Absolute risk reduction**: 4.5% (95% CI 0.2–8.8%).
- **Number needed to treat**: 22 patients to prevent one death at 28 days.

---

## Mortality results at 6 months

- **6-month mortality**: 19.0% with TXA vs 22.9% with placebo (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67–1.03; P = 0.09) [^e16567b1].
- **Absolute risk reduction**: 3.9% (95% CI −0.4% to 8.2%).
- **Statistical significance**: Not significant.

---

## Clinical significance and implications

The **28-day mortality reduction** is clinically meaningful and aligns with prior evidence that TXA's benefit is greatest early after injury, when bleeding-related deaths predominate [^c2bf2adb] [^8115da73]. The **6-month mortality** result, though numerically favorable, did not reach statistical significance, likely reflecting attenuation of effect over time and competing causes of death (e.g. sepsis, organ failure) that TXA does not modify [^e16567b1] [^ee2d611c].

## Comparison with other studies

| **Study** | **28-Day mortality** | **6-Month mortality** |
|-|-|-|
| PATCH-Trauma | 17.3% (TXA) vs 21.8% (placebo); RR 0.79 | 19.0% (TXA) vs 22.9% (placebo); RR 0.83 |
| CRASH-2 | 14.5% (TXA) vs 16.0% (placebo); RR 0.91 | Not reported |
| CRASH-3 | 18.5% (TXA) vs 19.8% (placebo); RR 0.94 | Not reported |

---

PATCH-Trauma's 28-day benefit is consistent with CRASH-2 and CRASH-3, while the 6-month result reflects the challenge of sustaining early mortality benefits over longer follow-up [^c2bf2adb] [^14423adc].

---

## Conclusion

Prehospital tranexamic acid significantly reduced **28-day mortality** in PATCH-Trauma, but did not significantly reduce **6-month mortality**. The early benefit is clinically important, but the lack of a sustained 6-month effect underscores the need for comprehensive trauma care beyond antifibrinolytic therapy.

The study PATCH-Trauma was published by PATCH-Trauma Investigators and the ANZICS Clinical Trials Group and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Traumatic hemorrhage. In the PATCH-Trauma study, the trial question was: what is the role of prehospital administration of tranexamic acid in patients with major trauma and suspected trauma-induced coagulopathy? In the PATCH-Trauma study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PATCH-Trauma study, the population was: 1300 patients (382 female, 918 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with major trauma who were at risk for trauma-induced coagulopathy. In the PATCH-Trauma study, the interventions were: n = 657 tranexamic acid (1 g bolus before hospital admission, followed by a 1 g infusion over a period of 8 hours after arrival at the hospital) n = 643 placebo (matching placebo). In the PATCH-Trauma study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in survival with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months after injury (53.7% vs. 53.5%; RR 1, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.12). In the PATCH-Trauma study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death from any cause at day 28 (17.3% vs. 21.8%; RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99) No significant difference in death from any cause at 6 months (19% vs. 22.9%; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.03) Significant decrease in death from any cause at 24 hours (9.7% vs. 14.1%; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.94). In the PATCH-Trauma study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in vascular occlusive events, other adverse events. In the PATCH-Trauma study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with major trauma who were at risk for trauma-induced coagulopathy, tranexamic acid was not superior to placebo with respect to survival with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months after injury.

STAAMP: study of TXA during air medical prehospital transport

This multicenter trial is enrolling adult trauma patients being transported via air medical services from scene or referring to hospital, with SBP < 90 mm Hg or heart rate > 110 bpm and within 2 hours of injury. Patients will be randomized to a one-time prehospital bolus of TXA 1 g intravenous or placebo with three subsequent in-hospital groups (figure 4). The coordinating center is the University of Pittsburgh with multiple trauma center participating, and estimated total sample size 994 patients during a 3-year period of recruitment. Primary outcome measure is 30-day mortality. Predefined subgroups selected for additional exploratory analysis include subjects defined by (1) blood transfusion status; (2) traumatic brain injury; (3) transfer status; (4) requirement for operative intervention within 24 hours of admission; (5) therapeutic anticoagulation status; and (6) massive transfusion status. Two interim analyses are planned and will be overseen by the data safety monitoring board.

### Effect of out-of-hospital tranexamic acid vs placebo on 6-month functional neurologic outcomes in patients with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury [^226588e9]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability due to trauma. Early administration of tranexamic acid may benefit patients with TBI.

Objective

To determine whether tranexamic acid treatment initiated in the out-of-hospital setting within 2 hours of injury improves neurologic outcome in patients with moderate or severe TBI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial at 20 trauma centers and 39 emergency medical services agencies in the US and Canada from May 2015 to November 2017. Eligible participants (N = 1280) included out-of-hospital patients with TBI aged 15 years or older with Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 or less and systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher.

Interventions

Three interventions were evaluated, with treatment initiated within 2 hours of TBI: out-of-hospital tranexamic acid (1 g) bolus and in-hospital tranexamic acid (1 g) 8-hour infusion (bolus maintenance group; n = 312), out-of-hospital tranexamic acid (2 g) bolus and in-hospital placebo 8-hour infusion (bolus only group; n = 345), and out-of-hospital placebo bolus and in-hospital placebo 8-hour infusion (placebo group; n = 309).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was favorable neurologic function at 6 months (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score > 4 [moderate disability or good recovery]) in the combined tranexamic acid group vs the placebo group. Asymmetric significance thresholds were set at 0.1 for benefit and 0.025 for harm. There were 18 secondary end points, of which 5 are reported in this article: 28-day mortality, 6-month Disability Rating Scale score (range, 0 [no disability] to 30 [death]), progression of intracranial hemorrhage, incidence of seizures, and incidence of thromboembolic events.

Results

Among 1063 participants, a study drug was not administered to 96 randomized participants and 1 participant was excluded, resulting in 966 participants in the analysis population (mean age, 42 years; 255 [74%] male participants; mean Glasgow Coma Scale score, 8). Of these participants, 819 (84.8%) were available for primary outcome analysis at 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome occurred in 65% of patients in the tranexamic acid groups vs 62% in the placebo group (difference, 3.5%; [90% 1-sided confidence limit for benefit, -0.9%]; P = 0.16; [97.5% 1-sided confidence limit for harm, 10.2%]; P = 0.84). There was no statistically significant difference in 28-day mortality between the tranexamic acid groups vs the placebo group (14% vs 17%; difference, -2.9% [95% CI, -7.9% to 2.1%]; P = 0.26), 6-month Disability Rating Scale score (6.8 vs 7.6; difference, -0.9 [95% CI, -2.5 to 0.7]; P = 0.29), or progression of intracranial hemorrhage (16% vs 20%; difference, -5.4% [95% CI, -12.8% to 2.1%]; P = 0.16).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with moderate to severe TBI, out-of-hospital tranexamic acid administration within 2 hours of injury compared with placebo did not significantly improve 6-month neurologic outcome as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid for severe trauma [^914d00f3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether prehospital administration of tranexamic acid increases the likelihood of survival with a favorable functional outcome among patients with major trauma and suspected trauma-induced coagulopathy who are being treated in advanced trauma systems is uncertain.

Methods

We randomly assigned adults with major trauma who were at risk for trauma-induced coagulopathy to receive tranexamic acid (administered intravenously as a bolus dose of 1 g before hospital admission, followed by a 1-g infusion over a period of 8 hours after arrival at the hospital) or matched placebo. The primary outcome was survival with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months after injury, as assessed with the use of the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E). Levels on the GOS-E range from 1 (death) to 8 ("upper good recovery" [no injury-related problems]). We defined survival with a favorable functional outcome as a GOS-E level of 5 ("lower moderate disability") or higher. Secondary outcomes included death from any cause within 28 days and within 6 months after injury.

Results

A total of 1310 patients were recruited by 15 emergency medical services in Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. Of these patients, 661 were assigned to receive tranexamic acid, and 646 were assigned to receive placebo; the trial-group assignment was unknown for 3 patients. Survival with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months occurred in 307 of 572 patients (53.7%) in the tranexamic acid group and in 299 of 559 (53.5%) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90 to 1.12; P = 0.95). At 28 days after injury, 113 of 653 patients (17.3%) in the tranexamic acid group and 139 of 637 (21.8%) in the placebo group had died (risk ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.99). By 6 months, 123 of 648 patients (19.0%) in the tranexamic acid group and 144 of 629 (22.9%) in the placebo group had died (risk ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.03). The number of serious adverse events, including vascular occlusive events, did not differ meaningfully between the groups.

Conclusions

Among adults with major trauma and suspected trauma-induced coagulopathy who were being treated in advanced trauma systems, prehospital administration of tranexamic acid followed by an infusion over 8 hours did not result in a greater number of patients surviving with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months than placebo.

### Association between tranexamic acid administration and mortality based on the trauma phenotype: a retrospective analysis of a nationwide trauma registry in Japan [^573f5873]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite global efforts to standardise trauma care and improve treatment outcomes, approximately 4.5 million trauma-related deaths occur annually worldwide. Most preventable early trauma deaths are due to haemorrhage. Early trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) exacerbates this by contributing to acute bleeding, associated shock, ischaemia–reperfusion injuries, thrombotic complications, and, in severe cases, hyperfibrinolysis, further promoting haemorrhage. Tranexamic acid (TXA), a synthetic derivative of the amino acid — lysine — is an antifibrinolytic that inhibits lysine-binding sites on plasminogen. In the international randomised controlled trials (RCTs) — CRASH-2 and CRASH-3 — TXA demonstrated the potential to improve outcomes in patients with traumatic bleeding and mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injuries. Therefore, early management of bleeding and coagulation abnormalities in trauma care is recommended. The recent PATCH-Trauma trial conducted on adult patients with severe trauma revealed that early prehospital TXA administration in suspected cases of TIC was not beneficial for survival with functional outcomes at 6 months post-injury. However, secondary analyses suggested potential benefits for survival at 24 h and 1-month post-injury. A meta-analysis including RCTs and observational studies that evaluated TXA efficacy in patients with traumatic injuries and brain injuries aged ≥ 15 years suggested that TXA significantly reduced 1-month mortality rates compared to controls, indicating potential benefits across various patient groups. However, some studies lacked data on age, sex, trauma severity, and comorbidities, resulting in heterogeneity among the study groups; thus, patients most suited for TXA administration remained unclear to clinicians. Given the high heterogeneity among patients with trauma, heterogeneity of the treatment effect might exist at a more granular level, even among severely injured patients targeted in previous RCTs. Additionally, less severely injured patients may benefit from TXA administration.

### Use of tranexamic acid in trauma surgical specialties: a narrative review [^dd48f95f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pre-hospital TXA use

As the above studies found TXA to be a safe and effective drug to reduce in-hospital bleeding and mortality after major trauma, subsequent works investigated the potential utility of TXA in the pre-hospital setting. In 2020, Guyette et al. published results from The Study of Tranexamic Acid During Air Medical and Ground Pre-hospital Transport (STAAMP) randomized clinical trial. In this study, there was no significant difference in mortality at 30 days between the TXA and placebo groups (8.1% versus 9.9%, p = 0.17). However, in subgroup analysis, there was a mortality benefit among patients who received TXA within 1 h of injury compared to those that received placebo (4.6% vs. 7.6%, p < 0.001). In addition, patients with severe shock who received TXA had a lower 30-day mortality compared with the placebo group (18.5% vs. 35.5%, p < 0.003). There was no significant difference in the incidence of PE, DVT, or seizures across groups. These results are in line with prior studies demonstrating that the benefit of TXA is greatest when administered shortly after injury and in patients with more severe injuries. Similarly, the 2023 multi-center PATCH RCT evaluated the effects of pre-hospital TXA administration on survival. The author concluded that mortality at 24 h was lower among patients receiving TXA compared to placebo (9.7% vs. 14.1%, RR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.51–0.94), but survival outcomes at 6 months was not significantly different between the two groups (53.7% in the TXA group vs. 53.5% in the placebo group, RR = 1.00, p = 0.95). The number of serious adverse events, including thromboembolic complications, did not differ significantly between the groups.

### Tranexamic acid timing and mortality impact after trauma [^f39f1798]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Trauma resuscitation guidelines across the world have incorporated the administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) within 3 hours of injury. The 3-hour window was deduced from the Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH-2) trial and has not been replicated. The aim of this study was to determine whether death within 28 days after trauma varied according to time from injury to the first TXA dose and, if so, precisely determine the therapeutic window.

Methods

This was an exploratory analysis of the Prehospital Tranexamic Acid for Severe Trauma (PATCH-Trauma) trial, which enrolled adults with major trauma and suspected trauma-induced coagulopathy. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either TXA (administered intravenously as a bolus dose of 1 g before hospital admission, followed by a 1 g infusion over a period of 8 hours after arrival at the hospital) or matched placebo. In this analysis, we examined the effect of time from injury to first treatment dose on death within 28 days utilizing a continuous scale with linear, first-degree fractional polynomial, and second-degree fractional polynomial functions of time from injury to first treatment dose. Further log-binomial regression analyses were performed in subgroups based on the information obtained from the previous step.

Results

The intention-to-treat study cohort comprised 1,287 patients, of which 635 had been allocated to the placebo arm and 652 to the TXA arm. The median time from injury to first treatment dose was 79 (interquartile range [IQR] 55 to 112) minutes. Risk of death within 28 days increased as the time to first dose of treatment increased, with benefit most pronounced up to 90 minutes. Beyond 90 minutes, the upper 95% confidence interval (CI) crossed the line of equivalence (risk ratio, 1). Administration of TXA within 90 minutes significantly reduced the risk of death within 28 days (67/393 [17%] in the TXA group versus 91/363 [25%] in placebo group; adjusted risk ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.82), whereas administration beyond 90 minutes did not decrease mortality at 28 days (adjusted risk ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.47).

Conclusion

The optimal therapeutic window for TXA after trauma may be within 90 minutes.

### Association of tranexamic acid administration with mortality and thromboembolic events in patients with traumatic injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8c5134c2]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Tranexamic acid is widely available and used off-label in patients with bleeding traumatic injury, although the literature does not consistently agree on its efficacy and safety.

Objective

To examine the association of tranexamic acid administration with mortality and thromboembolic events compared with no treatment or with placebo in patients with traumatic injury in the literature.

Data Sources

On March 23, 2021, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for eligible studies published between 1986 and 2021.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials and observational studies investigating tranexamic acid administration compared with no treatment or placebo among patients with traumatic injury and traumatic brain injury who were 15 years or older were included. Included studies were published in English or German. The electronic search yielded 1546 records, of which 71 were considered for full-text screening. The selection process was performed independently by 2 reviewers.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The study followed the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers and pooled using the inverse-variance random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes were formulated before data collection and included mortality at 24 hours and 28 and 30 days (1 month) as well as the incidence of thromboembolic events and the amount of blood products administered. Owing to missing data, overall mortality was added and the amount of blood products administered was discarded.

Results

Thirty-one studies with a total of 43 473 patients were included in the systematic review. The meta-analysis demonstrated that administration of tranexamic acid was associated with a significant decrease in 1-month mortality compared with the control cohort (risk ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.71–0.97]; I2 = 35%). The results of meta-analyses for 24-hour and overall mortality and thromboembolic events were heterogeneous and could not be pooled. Further investigations on clinical heterogeneity showed that populations with trauma and trial conditions differed markedly.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that tranexamic acid may be beneficial in various patient populations with trauma. However, reasonable concerns about potential thromboembolic events with tranexamic acid remain.

### Tranexamic acid is not inferior to placebo with respect to adverse events in suspected traumatic brain injury patients not in shock with a normal head computed tomography scan: a retrospective study of a randomized trial [^535c7fd7]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A 2-g bolus of tranexamic acid (TXA) has been shown to reduce 28-day mortality in a randomized controlled trial. This study investigates whether out-of-hospital TXA use is associated with adverse events or unfavorable outcomes in suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) when intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is absent on initial computed tomography.

Methods

This study used data from a 2015 to 2017, multicenter, randomized trial studying the effect of the following TXA doses on moderate to severe TBI: 2-g bolus, 1-g bolus plus 1-g infusion over 8 hours, and a placebo bolus with placebo infusion. Of the 966 participants enrolled, 395 with an initial computed tomography negative for ICH were included in this analysis. Fifteen adverse events (28-day incidence) were studied: myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, seizure, pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac failure, liver failure, renal failure, cerebrovascular accident, cardiac arrest, cerebral vasospasm, "any thromboembolism", hypernatremia, acute kidney injury, and infection. Other unfavorable outcomes analyzed include mortality at 28 days and 6 months, Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score of ≤ 4 at discharge and 6 months, intensive care unit-free days, ventilator-free days, hospital-free days, and combined unfavorable outcomes. In both study drug groups, the incidence of dichotomous outcomes and quantity of ordinal outcomes were compared with placebo.

Results

No statistically significant increase in adverse events or unfavorable outcomes was found between either TXA dosing regimen and placebo. Demographics and injury scores were not statistically different other than two methods of injury, which were overrepresented in the 1-g TXA bolus plus 1-g TXA infusion.

Conclusion

Administration of either a 2-g TXA bolus or a 1-g TXA bolus plus 1-g TXA 8-hour infusion in suspected TBIs without ICH is not associated with increased adverse events or unfavorable outcomes. Because the out-of-hospital 2-g bolus is associated with a mortality benefit, it should be administered in suspected TBI.

The trial treatment reduces the risk of early (bleeding) deaths by one quarter (RR = 0.75) but has no effect on late (non-bleeding) deaths (RR = 1.00). The overall relative risk for all-cause mortality at the end of follow-up is a weighted average of these relative risks (RR = 0.92)

Because no treatment has effects on all causes of death, all-cause mortality at 28 days is a composite outcome that combines deaths affected by the trial treatment with those that are unaffected by it. Using all-cause mortality to assess the 'true' effect of a treatment has counterintuitive consequences since it means that the effect of any given treatment depends on the effects of all the others. An antibiotic that reduces pneumonia deaths in week 2, by reducing the proportion of late deaths, will appear to increase the effectiveness of a treatment for early bleeding. Because the proportion of late deaths varies with injury severity and in different locations, all-cause mortality is not generalisable. The only generalisable measure is the undiluted biological effect of the trial treatment.

### Use of tranexamic acid in trauma surgical specialties: a narrative review [^a6c783d0]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Similarly, Rowell et al. conducted a large pre-hospital multicenter RCT evaluating the impact of early TXA administration on neurological outcomes at six months for patients with head trauma. There was no significant difference in favorable neurologic function at 6 months between the TXA groups (65%) and the placebo group (62%) (p = 0.84). There was also no statistically significant difference in mortality at 28 days (14% in the TXA groups vs. 17% in the placebo group, p = 0.26) or progression of intracranial hemorrhage (16% in the TXA groups vs. 20% in the placebo group, p = 0.16). No statistical analysis of thromboembolic events was performed.

An additional large multi-center study on TXA after TBI was published in 2021 by Bossers et al. This study, titled the Brain Injury: Pre-hospital Registry of Outcome, Treatments and Epidemiology of Cerebral Trauma (BRAIN-PROTECT) study, included 1,827 patients with suspected severe TBI based on trauma mechanism, clinical findings, and GCS < 8. The study included 693 who received TXA and 1,134 who did not receive TXA. Most patients in the TXA group received a 1 g IV bolus in the pre-hospital setting. Both an unadjusted logistic regression model, which did not account for confounders, and a multivariable logistic regression model, which did account for cofounders, were constructed to model 30-day mortality. In the unadjusted analysis, the TXA group had significantly higher 30-day mortality (OR 1.34, p < 0.001) compared to the control group, but after adjusting for confounding variables, including injury severity, there was no significant difference (OR 1.17, p = 0.35). However, on subgroup analysis, there were substantially higher odds of death within 30 days for patients with severe isolated TBI who received pre-hospital TXA compared to similar patients who did not receive TXA (OR 2.05, p = 0.007). This study did not report on thromboembolic events.

### Association between tranexamic acid administration and mortality based on the trauma phenotype: a retrospective analysis of a nationwide trauma registry in Japan [^dd182ad8]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study used JTDB data to investigate the association between TXA administration and the survival outcome based on trauma phenotypes. Consequently, subgroups were identified within specific trauma phenotypes that may be associated with TXA administration and survival outcomes. These results were supported by sensitivity analyses and contribute to our current understanding of TXA efficacy.

This study has two significant clinical implications. First, it identified subgroups of all patients with blunt trauma for whom TXA administration was likely beneficial and those for whom it was not advisable. Evidence exists for TXA administration in patients at risk of significant haemorrhagic and those with mild-to-moderate head injuries; nonetheless, the truly effective target population for TXA has not been sufficiently clarified. A strength of this study is that it encompassed all patients with blunt trauma, including those with minor injuries, and comprehensively examined the association between TXA administration and the survival outcome based on the trauma phenotype. Additionally, the use of an integrated model that incorporates factors, such as comorbidities, vital signs upon admission, and the type and extent of organ damage, allows for an analysis that considers the heterogeneity of patients with trauma and adds novelty to the study. Meanwhile, studies examining the treatment effect of TXA by baseline risk based on RCTs showed no heterogeneity. This result is at variance with the hypothesis of this study. We aimed to identify subgroups — defined by trauma phenotypes developed in our previous study — that might particularly benefit from TXA, thereby reducing intragroup heterogeneity. Although our study is not a secondary analysis of RCT data and may not be as robust, it serves as an important step in hypothesis generation for future studies. Clinically, the clusters in which TXA administration resulted in reduced mortality rates (trauma phenotypes 1, 2, 6, and 8) exhibited higher median ISSs and a tendency towards greater trauma severity. The PATCH trauma trial included patients with severe multisite injuries and reported reduced mortality rates at 24 h and 1 month after injury in a secondary analysis, consistent with the results for severe trauma phenotypes in this study. In our previous study, proteomic analyses of the molecular pathology of high-mortality phenotypes (trauma phenotype 8 in this study) demonstrated the involvement of coagulation disorders (hyperfibrinolysis). These findings explain the effectiveness of TXA in this study from a molecular pathology perspective. However, for trauma phenotypes 3 and 4, TXA administration was associated with increased in-hospital mortality rates. Trauma phenotype 3 is characterised by orthopaedic injuries in elderly population, trauma phenotype 4 is primarily seen in younger patients with chest or orthopedic injury, and both are associated with lower trauma severity levels. Additionally, the lower proportion of patients who were administered TXA in these clusters, owing to the minor nature of the injuries, may have amplified the effect of the few mortality cases. Nevertheless, this study represents the first step toward the practice of personalized medicine in trauma care, predicting the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in a highly heterogeneous population. Although accumulating many cases in prospective studies is challenging, assessing the association between TXA administration and the survival outcome using statistical methods is a strength. Validating these results in future prospective studies could lead to more robust and optimised TXA administration.

### The effects of prehospital TXA on mortality and neurologic outcomes in patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a subgroup analysis from the prehospital TXA for TBI trial [^515cba5f]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In the prehospital tranexamic acid (TXA) for traumatic brain injury (TBI) trial, TXA administered within 2 hours of injury in the out-of-hospital setting did not reduce mortality in all patients with moderate/severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). We examined the association between TXA dosing arms, neurologic outcome, and mortality in patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on computed tomography (CT).

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of the Prehospital Tranexamic Acid for TBI Trial (ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT01990768]) that randomized adults with moderate/severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score < 13) and systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg within 2 hours of injury to a 2-g out-of-hospital TXA bolus followed by an in-hospital saline infusion, a 1-g out-of-hospital TXA bolus/1-g in-hospital TXA infusion, or an out-of-hospital saline bolus/in-hospital saline infusion (placebo). This analysis included the subgroup with ICH on initial CT. Primary outcomes included 28-day mortality, 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) ≤ 4, and 6-month Disability Rating Scale (DRS). Outcomes were modeled using linear regression with robust standard errors.

Results

The primary trial included 966 patients. Among 541 participants with ICH, 28-day mortality was lower in the 2-g TXA bolus group (17%) compared with the other two groups (1-g bolus/1-g infusion 26%, placebo 27%). The estimated adjusted difference between the 2-g bolus and placebo groups was -8.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] -15.9 to -1.0) and between the 2-g bolus and 1-g bolus/1-g infusion groups was -10.2 percentage points (95% CI, -17.6 to -2.9). Disability Rating Scale at 6 months was lower in the 2-g TXA bolus group than the 1-g bolus/1-g infusion (estimated difference - 2.1 [95% CI, -4.2 to -0.02]) and placebo groups (-2.2 [95% CI, -4.3, -0.2]). Six-month GOSE did not differ among groups.

Conclusion

A 2-g out-of-hospital TXA bolus in patients with moderate/severe TBI and ICH resulted in lower 28-day mortality and lower 6-month DRS than placebo and standard TXA dosing.

### The effect of tranexamic acid on functional outcomes: an exploratory analysis of the CRASH-2 randomized controlled trial [^4d53328c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Tranexamic acid improves survival in severely injured adults. However, its effectiveness on overall functional outcome is unknown. We hypothesized that tranexamic acid improves overall functional outcome compared with placebo in severely injured adults and conduct an exploratory analysis of the Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH-2) data to investigate this hypothesis.

Methods

We included injured adults from the CRASH-2 trial who were randomized 3 hours or less from injury. The primary outcome measure was functional status at hospital discharge or on day 28 if the subject was still in the hospital. Functional status was measured with the modified Oxford Handicap Scale, a 6-category ordinal functional outcome scale. We conducted 3 separate analyses using 3 different outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of tranexamic acid versus placebo on functional outcomes, including the mean utility-weighted modified Oxford Handicap Scale score (overall functional outcome), the area under the curve (based on functional outcome and rate of recovery), and a sliding dichotomy analysis (favorable versus unfavorable functional outcome) stratified by baseline mortality risk (stratified analysis).

Results

There were 13,432 patients (6,679 randomized to placebo and 6,753 to tranexamic acid) included in the study cohort. The mean utility-weighted modified Oxford Handicap Scale score was 0.66 (SD 0.33) for patients randomized to tranexamic acid compared with a mean of 0.64 (SD 0.34) for those randomized to placebo (mean difference 0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01 to 0.03). The area under the curve analysis demonstrated that patients randomized to tranexamic acid had a higher 28-day mean utility-weighted modified Oxford Handicap Scale score compared with those randomized to placebo (mean score 0.55 [SD 0.30] versus 0.53 [SD 0.31]; mean difference 0.02 [95% CI 0.01 to 0.03]). The sliding dichotomy analysis demonstrated heterogeneity of treatment effects across risk groups. The overall proportion of patients with favorable functional outcomes was higher in the tranexamic acid group (5,360/6,753 [79.4%]; 95% CI 78.4% to 80.3%) compared with the placebo group (5,174/6,679 [77.5%]; 95% CI 76.5% to 78.5%; difference 1.9% [95% CI 0.5% to 3.3%]; number needed to treat = 52). When each risk group was tested separately, only the lowest-risk group (< 6% baseline mortality risk) demonstrated a statistically significant effect of tranexamic acid toward favorable functional outcomes (tranexamic acid versus placebo adjusted odds ratio 0.78; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.90). There were no differences between tranexamic acid and placebo in the other risk groups.

Conclusion

Across 3 exploratory analyses, severely injured adult patients randomized within 3 hours from injury demonstrated better functional outcomes with tranexamic acid compared with placebo. When heterogeneity of treatment effects across risk groups was evaluated, only the lowest-risk group demonstrated a significant effect of tranexamic acid toward favorable outcomes. Given the overall safety and cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid use in injured adults, our results further support the use of tranexamic acid for this population. Future trauma trials that evaluate tranexamic acid use should also consider functional status as an important outcome.

### Understanding the neuroprotective effect of tranexamic acid: an exploratory analysis of the CRASH-3 randomised trial [^360e80cd]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

The background to the CRASH-3 trial, the methods, baseline characteristics and main results were previously reported. Briefly, adults with TBI who were within 3 h of injury and had a Glasgow coma scale score (GCS) ≤ 12 or any intracranial bleeding on CT scan and no significant extra-cranial bleeding were eligible. The time window for eligibility was originally 8 h, but in 2016, the protocol was changed to limit recruitment to within 3 h of injury. Between July 2012 and January 2019, we randomly allocated 12,737 patients with TBI to receive tranexamic acid or placebo, of whom 9202 patients were treated within 3 h. Patients were assigned by selecting a numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Patients, care givers and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment allocation.

Based on previous research on the mechanism of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients, we hypothesised that tranexamic acid would have a greater effect on deaths soon after injury, since early bleeding-related deaths have the most potential to be reduced by tranexamic acid. We pre-specified this hypothesis in the statistical analysis plan that we published before un-blinding. We also anticipated that the treatment effect would be diluted by the inclusion of patients with a GCS score of 3 or unreactive pupils who have a very poor prognosis regardless of treatment. The trial results were consistent with both of these hypotheses. The pre-specified primary outcome in the CRASH-3 trial was death due to head injury within 28 days among patients treated within 3 h of injury. Although our scientific reasons for pre-specifying head injury death as the primary outcome were given in the statistical analysis plan and presented in detail elsewhere, there has been strong interest in the effects of tranexamic acid on all-cause mortality. As such, this analysis focusses on early deaths from any cause, excluding patients with a GCS score of 3 or bilateral unreactive pupils. Analyses of head injury deaths and analyses including patients with a GCS score of 3 or bilateral unreactive pupils are presented in the Additional file 1 for comparison with the results presented below and for cross-reference with the main trial results.

DISCUSSION

Effectiveness and Safety of Prehospital Tranexamic Acid Administration Used for Suspected Hemorrhagic Shock

Prehospital TXA administration may reduce mortality in adult trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock when administered after lifesaving interventions.

Patient outcomes of interest include prehospital TXA effects on short- and long-term survival, long-term neurological outcomes, and a reduction in blood product use.

Short-term (< 24 hours) mortality was evaluated in a recent systematic review that included four studies. – Their findings observed a 40% lower risk of 24-hour mortality in those who received prehospital TXA, influenced largely by one retrospective, observational, propensity-matched analysis. A large German prehospital trauma database assessed early survival in a propensity match control group and found lower 6- and 12-hour mortality rates and absolute reductions of 2.3% and 2% at each timeframe, respectively, in those that received prehospital TXA. They did not, however, find any difference in mortality at 24 hours or later. An exploratory analysis of secondary outcomes assessed in a recently published, multicenter, randomized controlled trial suggested a benefit in 24-hour survival if TXA was administered in prehospital patients but with limited certainty of the true effect. In aggregate, the current data suggests improved survival at 24 hours in patients who receive prehospital TXA.

Long-term survival was also assessed by previously mentioned studies. – The meta-analysis of Almuwallad et al.did not show a reduction in mortality in those receiving prehospital TXA when assessing 28- or 30-day mortality. Similarly, the analysis of Imach et al.did not find reduced mortality at 30-days with prehospital TXA administration. One secondary post hoc analysis of the largest multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in trauma patients receiving prehospital TXA did show a 7.9% reduction in 30-day mortality if prehospital TXA was administered within an hour from time of injury but not between 1 and 3 hours. Additionally, no benefit was observed when TXA was given in combination with prehospital packed red blood cells. The most recent and largest, prospective, multicenter analysis, which assessed 6-month functional outcomes in over 1,300 prehospital injured patients, did not observe improvement in 6-month favorable functional status with the administration of prehospital TXA compared to placebo.

Prehospital TXA for TBI

An additional prehospital, multicenter, randomized, clinical trial aims to determine the efficacy of two prehospital TXA doses in moderate/severe TBI (GCS ≤ 12) compared to placebo: (1) 1 g TXA prehospital, 1 gm TXA infusion/8 hours; (2) 2 g TXA prehospital, placebo 0.9% NS/8 hours; (3) placebo 0.9% NS prehospital, placebo 0.9% NS/8 hours. The primary outcome measure is long-term neurological outcome measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E) score at 6 months postinjury.

The establishment of the Trans-Agency Consortium for Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy (TACTIC) funded by the NHLBI as a cooperative effort among NIH, the Department of Defense and other research centers will further investigate the clinical problem of trauma-induced coagulopathy and assist in making meaningful advances in this important field.

### Tranexamic acid in trauma: a joint position statement and resource document of NAEMSP, ACEP, and ACS-COT [^dfff07eb]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Head-injured patients

Our review included four articles that assessed survival and 6-month functional outcomes of TBI patients who received prehospital TXA. In patients with moderate to severe TBI with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of < 12 who were given prehospital TXA in various dosing regimens compared to placebo, there was no difference in 28-day survival or 6-month favorable neurologic function between the groups. In two retrospective analyses and another prospective subgroup analysis, TXA did not affect 6-month functional outcomes. Mortality rates were higher in those with multisystem trauma with concomitant TBI who received TXA, but this is likely due to worse baseline injury severity. These four studies did not find an increased rate of venous thromboembolic events or other complications in TBI patients who received TXA. Importantly, only one of the studies evaluated isolated TBI, while the others included multisystem trauma. While this limits the ability to generalize these findings to isolated TBI patients, it likely reflects the difficulty to definitively identify isolated head injuries in settings of polytrauma mechanisms. Although TXA is likely safe in patients with moderate to severe TBI, prehospital TXA does not appear to confer any functional or survival benefit based on current evidence.

Methods

Study design and patients

The CRASH-2 trial was a randomised placebo-controlled trial of the effect of TXA on death and vascular occlusive events in adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding, and who were within 8 h of their injury. Patients were randomly assigned to receive TXA (loading dose 1 g over 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or matching placebo. The primary outcome was death in hospital within 4 weeks of injury. Cause of death was described using the following categories: bleeding, vascular occlusion (myocardial infarction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism), multi-organ failure, head injury, and other. Follow-up data were available for 99.6% of patients. The trial was conducted in 274 hospitals in 40 countries. A detailed description of the rationale, design, methods and results of the trial has been published previously.

### Pre-hospital anti-fibrinolytics for traumatic coagulopathy and… [^a0ff50bd]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Pre-hospital Anti-fibrinolytics for Traumatic Coagulopathy and Haemorrhage ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The purpose of this research is to determine whether giving severely injured adults a drug called tranexamic acid as soon as possible after injury will improve their chances of survival and their level of recovery at six months. After severe injury, a person may have uncontrolled bleeding that places them at high risk of bleeding to death. Coagulation is an important process in the body that helps to control blood loss. Up to a quarter of people that are severely injured have a condition called acute traumatic coagulopathy. This condition affects coagulation and results in the break down of blood clots that can lead to increased blood loss and an increased risk of dying.

Recent evidence from a large clinical trial showed early treatment with TXA reduced the risk of death in severely injured patients, however the majority of patients involved in the study were injured in countries where prehospital care is limited and rapid access to lifesaving treatments is limited compared to that available in countries like Australia and New Zealand. It is unclear whether TXA will reduce the risk of death to the same degree when it is given alongside other lifesaving treatments that are available to patients soon after injury in these countries. The hypothesis is that TXA given early to injured patients who are at risk of acute traumatic coagulopathy and who are treated in countries with systems providing advanced trauma care reduces mortality and improves recovery at 6-months after injury.

### Effect of tranexamic acid vs placebo on neurologic outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury… [^4c0e10db]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Question Does early administration of tranexamic acid to patients with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury improve neurologic outcome at 6 months. Findings. There were 18 secondary end points, of which 5 are reported in this article: 28-day mortality, 6-month Disability Rating Scale score, progression of intracranial hemorrhage, incidence of seizures, and incidence of thromboembolic events. Prespecified secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality, 6-month Disability Rating Scale score, 14, 15 progression of intracranial hemorrhage. The all-cause 28-day mortality was 14% in the combined tranexamic acid group and 17% in the placebo group;. 28-day mortality was 12% for the bolus only group and 17% for the bolus maintenance group. 10 In this trial, similar to the CRASH-3 trial results, all-cause mortality at 28 days was not different between groups.

### Effect of tranexamic acid by baseline risk of death in acute bleeding patients: a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from 28 333 patients [^3724a5c7]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Tranexamic acid appears to be safe and effective regardless of the baseline risk for patients treated within 3 h since injury. Because many deaths are in patients at low and intermediate risk, tranexamic acid use should not be restricted to the most severely injured or bleeding patients. As tranexamic acid is safe, it should be considered as an early preventive measure rather than a treatment for severe coagulopathic bleeding.

### Prehospital resuscitation [^1407594d]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Prehospital tranexamic acid (TXA)

The CRASH-2 trial was a randomized controlled trial comparing tranexamic acid (TXA) (1 g bolus started by EMS followed by a 1 g in hospital infusion) to placebo for patients with significant hemorrhage or risk for significant hemorrhage. A small mortality benefit was seen in patients who received treatment within 3 hours of injury. The benefit was greatest the earlier TXA was given and there was a signal of benefit in TBI. CRASH 3 was a follow-up study which focused on outcomes in TBI where TXA or placebo was administered within 3 hours of injury. There was a small decrease in head injury-related death in mild to moderate head injury but not severe head injury, with all other outcomes examined being similar between groups. A recent randomized multicenter study by Rowell et al examined outcomes in patients with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury who received either 2 g of TXA in the out of hospital setting versus 1 g out of hospital plus a 1 g in hospital infusion versus placebo. The primary analysis assessing all enrolled patients did not show a difference in survival or 6 months' neurological outcome. A planned secondary analysis on patients who had intracranial bleeding on admission head CT revealed a significant survival advantage which primarily occurred during the first 10 hours after injury. (figure 2). In this secondary analysis, patients who received 2 g of TXA also had improved 6 month neurological outcome. In the California Prehospital Antifibrinolytic Therapy (Cal-PAT) study, another randomized multicenter study, mortality in the group that received TXA (1 g bolus and 1 g in hospital infusion) was significantly reduced at 28 days, although there was no significant difference at 24 or 48 hours (Neeki). The mortality difference was greatest in more severely injured patients. All patients required less blood transfusion after TXA administration, and no difference in adverse events was seen between groups. Based on these data, the CoTCCC has changed their guidelines to include 2 g of TXA for patients in hemorrhagic shock or those with TBI in the field.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of tranexamic acid for the treatment of traumatic brain injury, based on the results of the CRASH-3 randomised trial: a decision modelling approach [^6047efc4]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Clinical outcomes

The 28-day risk of head injury and non-head injury death for the placebo group were derived from the CRASH-3 trial, with the risk in high-income countries used to estimate the risk in the UK, and LMICs used to estimate the risk in Pakistan (table 1). A risk ratio of head injury death was applied for patients receiving tranexamic acid, as derived directly from the CRASH-3 trial. The risk of non-head injury death was equal for placebo and tranexamic acid groups.

Table 1
Base-case model parameters

Following the 28-day trial follow-up period, the risk of death was assumed equal for people treated with and without tranexamic acid. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were used to account for the higher risk of death post-TBI compared with the general population. SMRs were derived from a study which included a variety of head injury severities, which estimated an SMR of 4 for the first year following injury, and 2.26 thereafter, compared with a group of matched community controls. These SMRs were applied relative to age based, general population mortality estimates specific to both the UK and Pakistan. It was assumed that this excess risk of death continued throughout the duration of the model. A sensitivity analysis that excluded this long-term risk of death was performed to assess the impact of this parameter. The long-term survival estimates produced by the model are shown in the online supplementary materials.

There was no evidence of an increase in the risk of adverse events following tranexamic acid use in the CRASH-3 trial, therefore, they were not included in the model.

### Effects of tranexamic acid on death, disability, vascular occlusive events and other morbidities in patients with acute traumatic brain injury (CRASH-3): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^14423adc]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid reduces surgical bleeding and decreases mortality in patients with traumatic extracranial bleeding. Intracranial bleeding is common after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can cause brain herniation and death. We aimed to assess the effects of tranexamic acid in patients with TBI.

Methods

This randomised, placebo-controlled trial was done in 175 hospitals in 29 countries. Adults with TBI who were within 3 h of injury, had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 or lower or any intracranial bleeding on CT scan, and no major extracranial bleeding were eligible. The time window for eligibility was originally 8 h but in 2016 the protocol was changed to limit recruitment to patients within 3 h of injury. This change was made blind to the trial data, in response to external evidence suggesting that delayed treatment is unlikely to be effective. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to receive tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min then infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or matching placebo. Patients were assigned by selecting a numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Patients, caregivers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. The primary outcome was head injury-related death in hospital within 28 days of injury in patients treated within 3 h of injury. We prespecified a sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with a GCS score of 3 and those with bilateral unreactive pupils at baseline. All analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial was registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN15088122), ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01402882), EudraCT (2011-003669-14), and the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR20121000441277).

Results

Between July 20, 2012, and Jan 31, 2019, we randomly allocated 12737 patients with TBI to receive tranexamic acid (6406 [50.3%] or placebo [6331 [49.7%], of whom 9202 (72.2%) patients were treated within 3 h of injury. Among patients treated within 3 h of injury, the risk of head injury-related death was 18.5% in the tranexamic acid group versus 19.8% in the placebo group (855 vs 892 events; risk ratio [RR] 0.94 [95% CI 0.86–1.02]). In the prespecified sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with a GCS score of 3 or bilateral unreactive pupils at baseline, the risk of head injury-related death was 12.5% in the tranexamic acid group versus 14.0% in the placebo group (485 vs 525 events; RR 0.89 [95% CI 0.80–1.00]). The risk of head injury-related death reduced with tranexamic acid in patients with mild-to-moderate head injury (RR 0.78 [95% CI 0.64–0.95]) but not in patients with severe head injury (0.99 [95% CI 0.91–1.07]; p value for heterogeneity 0.030). Early treatment was more effective than was later treatment in patients with mild and moderate head injury (p = 0.005) but time to treatment had no obvious effect in patients with severe head injury (p = 0.73). The risk of vascular occlusive events was similar in the tranexamic acid and placebo groups (RR 0.98 (0.74–1.28). The risk of seizures was also similar between groups (1.09 [95% CI 0.90–1.33]).

Interpretation

Our results show that tranexamic acid is safe in patients with TBI and that treatment within 3 h of injury reduces head injury-related death. Patients should be treated as soon as possible after injury.

### Understanding the neuroprotective effect of tranexamic acid: an exploratory analysis of the CRASH-3 randomised trial [^4cbe106f]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Based upon this post hoc, exploratory analysis of the CRASH-3 trial, tranexamic acid reduces deaths on the day of the injury regardless of TBI severity and country income but has no apparent effect on deaths beyond the day of the injury. The effect of tranexamic acid on all-cause mortality at 28 days is a weighted average of these early and late effects and, although diluted toward the null, is similar to the results of the CRASH-2 trial and indicative of a survival benefit.

Because a larger proportion of deaths in the CRASH-3 trial occurred after 24 h (69% in CRASH-3 versus 43% in CRASH-2), the effect on mortality at 28 days is smaller (more diluted) in the CRASH-3 trial, although there is no evidence of heterogeneity. As anticipated in the statistical analysis plan, the effect is smaller when including patients with un-survivable injuries prior to treatment. Tranexamic acid did not increase the risk of adverse vascular occlusive events in trauma patients.

Because our choice of head injury death as the primary outcome measure was criticised, these analyses report all-cause mortality. The trial inclusion criteria were clinical and reflect the situation that doctors face in practice. We enrolled TBI patients within 3 h of injury if they had no significant extra-cranial bleeding. The effect of tranexamic acid on early deaths is not explained by undiagnosed extra-cranial bleeding. Only 1.5% of patients had hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) at baseline and only 11 of the 1112 deaths (six in the tranexamic acid group and five in the placebo group) were classified as extracranial bleeding deaths. When patients with hypotension are excluded, the results are the same. The reduction in all-cause mortality within 24 h strongly suggests that tranexamic acid reduces intracranial bleeding deaths.

### Mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients: an exploratory analysis of data from the CRASH-2 trial [^44cb55ce]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

To investigate the mechanism of action of tranexamic acid (TXA) in bleeding trauma patients, we examined the timing of its effect on mortality. We hypothesised that if TXA reduces mortality by decreasing blood loss, its effect should be greatest on the day of the injury when bleeding is most profuse. However, if TXA reduces mortality via an anti-inflammatory mechanism its effect should be greater over the subsequent days.

Methods

Exploratory analysis, including per-protocol analyses, of data from the CRASH-2 trial, a randomised placebo controlled trial of the effect of TXA on mortality in 20,211 trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding. We examined hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for all-cause mortality, deaths due to bleeding and non-bleeding deaths, according to the day since injury. The CRASH-2 trial is registered as ISRCTN86750102 and ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00375258.

Results

The effect of TXA on mortality is greatest for deaths occurring on the day of the injury (HR all-cause mortality = 0.83, 0.73 to 0.93). This survival benefit is only evident in patients in whom treatment is initiated within 3 hours of their injury (HR ≤ 3 hours = 0.78, 0.68 to 0.90; HR > 3 hours = 1.02, 0.76 to 1.36). Initiation of TXA treatment within 3 hours of injury reduced the hazard of death due to bleeding on the day of the injury by 28% (HR = 0.72, 0.60 to 0.86). TXA treatment initiated beyond 3 hours of injury appeared to increase the hazard of death due to bleeding, although the estimates were imprecise.

Conclusions

Early administration of tranexamic acid appears to reduce mortality primarily by preventing exsanguination on the day of the injury.

### Effects of tranexamic acid on death, disability, vascular occlusive events and other morbidities in patients with acute traumatic brain injury (CRASH-3): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^ee25d5dd]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study CRASH-3 was published by CRASH- trial collaborators. and colleagues in 2019 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Traumatic brain injury. In the CRASH-3 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tranexamic acid in patients with acute traumatic brain injury? In the CRASH-3 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CRASH-3 study, the population was: 9202 patients (1800 female, 7402 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with traumatic brain injury who were within 3 hours of injury, had a GCS score ≤ 12 or any intracranial bleeding on CT scan, and no major extracranial bleeding. The key exclusion criteria were the responsible clinician's 'uncertainty' as to the appropriateness of tranexamic acid treatment in a particular patient with traumatic brain injury. In the CRASH-3 study, the interventions were: n = 4649 tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min then infusion of 1 g over 8 hours) n = 4553 placebo (0.9% sodium chloride by intravenous infusion). In the CRASH-3 study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of head injury-related death in hospital within 28 days of injury (18.5% vs. 19.8%; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02). In the CRASH-3 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in mild-to-moderate head injury-related death (5.8% vs. 7.5%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.95) Significant decrease in head injury-related death among patients with reactive pupils (11.5% vs. 13.2%; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98) No significant difference in severe head injury-related death (39.6% vs. 40.1%; RR 0.99, 99% CI 0.91 to 1.07). In the CRASH-3 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in risk of vascular occlusive events, seizures, and stroke. In the CRASH-3 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with traumatic brain injury who were within 3 hours of injury, had a GCS score ≤ 12 or any intracranial bleeding on CT scan, and no major extracranial bleeding, tranexamic acid was not superior to placebo with respect to the rate of head injury-related death in hospital within 28 days of injury.

### The impact of prehospital tranexamic acid on mortality and transfusion requirements: match-pair analysis from the nationwide German traumaRegister DGU ® [^0e937393]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

In the clinical course, less multiorgan failures were reported in these patients without significantly improving mortality after 30 days. This is in accordance with the findings in the mature trauma system in London, Great Britain, in 2015 (reduction in MOF [odds ratio (OR) = 0.27, confidence interval (CI): 0.10–0.73, p = 0.01]. Evidence from cardiothoracic surgery implies a decrease in the inflammatory response by TXA use in dosing up to 80 mg kg −1.

It is worth mentioning that in each group around 30 percent of the patients preclinically had at least one episode of systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg. This sign of hemodynamic derangement was one of the major inclusion criteria of the widely appreciated randomized controlled CRASH-2 trail which showed a reduced all-cause mortality by TXA use (14.5% vs 16.0%; RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85–0.97; p = 0.0035). Larger effects were detected in even more hemodynamically unstable patients, as a 4.5 percent absolute reduction in mortality was achieved among patients presenting with a systolic blood pressure of less than 75 mmHg. The recently published STAAMP-trail (NCT02086500) only demonstrated a lower 30-day mortality for patients with severe shock (SBP ≤ 70 mmHg) when receiving TXA (18.5% vs 35.5%; 95% CI: − 25.8% to − 8.1%, p < 0.003). Current guidelines in Germany, Europe and the USA define a potential risk of bleeding based on CRASH-2 as an indication for TXA use. The randomized PATCH-study (Pre-hospital Anti-fibrinolytics for Traumatic Coagulopathy and Hemorrhage, NCT02187120, 1316 patients planned, estimated completion 01/2021, in 06/2021 still recruiting) tries to objectify the indication of TXA by applying a score (COAST score).

### Tranexamic acid in trauma: a joint position statement and resource document of NAEMSP, ACEP, and ACS-COT [^9cc8c7bd]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The ideal dose, rate, and route of prehospital administration of TXA for adult trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock has not been determined. Current evidence suggest EMS agencies may administer either a 1-g intravenous/intraosseous dose (followed by a hospital-based 1-g infusion over 8 hours) or a 2-g intravenous/intraosseous dose as an infusion or slow push.

The TXA dosing strategy established by the CRASH-2 trial included a 1-g bolus over 10 minutes followed by a 1-g infusion over the following 8 hours. Faster and simpler rates of administration are of interest to simplify prehospital care, but these dosing strategies have not yet been validated as safe or effective compared to the initial dosing strategies established by CRASH-2. Alternative dosing strategies using a more rapid and simplified dosing approach have been recommended, such as the single 2-g dose by intravenous push only recommended for combat casualties by the Joint Trauma System Damage Control Resuscitation guideline.

Evidence assessing increased doses of TXA for prehospital use is sparse, including a well-designed multicenter, randomized controlled trial that found no evidence of harm, although no benefit. In this analysis of polytrauma patients with TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score of < 12 without hypotension) who received a 1-g bolus plus infusion, a 2-g bolus alone, or placebo, no differences were observed in 28-day mortality or 6-month functional outcomes. In this same study, the proportion of patients requiring a blood transfusion and total volume of blood products administered within 24 hours showed a slight benefit in the 2-g bolus dosing group. The 2-g bolus-only dose was associated with a small increase in seizure rate compared to the 1-g bolus and infusion dosing group. However, the seizure event rate across these groups was too small to determine if a true difference exists.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid: what is the current evidence? [^a3874689]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many trauma centers are examining the potential use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in the prehospital phase of care in an attempt to provide an adjunct to early hemorrhage control to improve trauma outcomes. But the published evidence on prehospital TXA use in trauma is small. This review, therefore, first updates the current evidence regarding in-hospital TXA efficacy and examines the evidence for efficacy of prehospital use of TXA in trauma. These data are needed to determine whether to implement prehospital TXA protocols or not, and to determine which trauma patients may benefit from prehospital TXA administration for prehospital protocol development.

Evidence for in-hospital TXA

At present, there is still only one large randomized clinical trial (Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage 2 (CRASH-2)) that examined the efficacy of in-hospital TXA in trauma and documented that all-cause mortality was reduced from 16.0% to 14.5% (1.5% absolute reduction, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.91 (0.85 to 0.97), p = 0.0035, NNT 67) and risk of death caused by bleeding was reduced from 5.7% to 4.9% (0.8% reduction, NNT 121). Importantly, for bleeding deaths, early TXA treatment was better: TXA given ≤ 1 hour after injury was more protective than when given 1–3 hours after injury, and TXA given after 3 hours was associated with increased risk of death (figure 1).

We have previously reviewed the significant limitations of the CRASH-2 trial and the difficulty in translating the international study results to large civilian trauma centers and trauma systems of care. We also reviewed that in the CRASH 2 subgroup analysis, the most significant mortality benefit for TXA was in the severe shock cohort, trauma patients with admission systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 75 mm Hg with 28-day all-cause mortality of 30.6% for TXA vs 35.1% for placebo (RR 0.87, 99% CI 0.76 to 0.99).

### Effect of tranexamic acid on mortality in patients with traumatic bleeding: prespecified analysis of data from randomised controlled trial [^6c0a45d0]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To examine whether the effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of death and thrombotic events in patients with traumatic bleeding varies according to baseline risk of death. To assess the extent to which current protocols for treatment with tranexamic acid maximise benefits to patients.

Design

Prespecified stratified analysis of data from an international multicentre randomised controlled trial (the CRASH-2 trial) with an estimation of the proportion of premature deaths that could potentially be averted through the administration of tranexamic acid.

Participants

13,273 trauma patients in the CRASH-2 trial who were treated with tranexamic acid or placebo within three hours of injury and trauma patients enrolled in UK Trauma and Audit Research Network, stratified by risk of death at baseline (< 6%, 6–20%, 21–50%, > 50%).

Intervention

Tranexamic acid (1 g over 10 minutes followed by 1 g over eight hours) or matching placebo.

Main Outcome Measure

Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for death in hospital within four weeks of injury, deaths from bleeding, and fatal and non-fatal thrombotic events associated with the use of tranexamic acid according to baseline risk of death. Unless there was strong evidence against the null hypothesis of homogeneity of effects (P < 0.001), the overall odds ratio was used as the most reliable guide to the odds ratios in all strata.

Results

Tranexamic acid was associated with a significant reduction in all cause mortality and deaths from bleeding. In each stratum of baseline risk, there were fewer deaths among patients treated with tranexamic acid. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the effect of tranexamic acid on all cause mortality (P = 0.96 for interaction) or deaths from bleeding (P = 0.98) by baseline risk of death. In those treated with tranexamic acid there was a significant reduction in the odds of fatal and non-fatal thrombotic events (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.89; P = 0.005) and a significant reduction in arterial thrombotic events (0.58, 0.40 to 0.83; P = 0.003) but no significant reduction in venous thrombotic events (0.83, 0.59 to 1.17; P = 0.295). There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of thrombotic events (P = 0.74). If the effect of tranexamic acid is assumed to be the same in all risk strata (< 6%, 6–20%, 21–50%, > 50% risk of death at baseline), the percentage of deaths that could be averted by administration of tranexamic acid within three hours of injury in each group is 17%, 36%, 30%, and 17%, respectively.

Conclusions

Tranexamic acid can be administered safely to a wide spectrum of patients with traumatic bleeding and should not be restricted to the most severely injured.

### Efficacy of prehospital administration of tranexamic acid in trauma patients: a meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials [^620af36b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid (TXA) has a potential clinical benefit for in-hospital patients with severe bleeding but its effectiveness in pre-hospital settings remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether pre-hospital administration of TXA compared to placebo improve patients' outcomes?

Methods

PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, clinicaltrials.gov and Google scholar databases were searched for a retrospective, prospective and randomized (RCT) or quasi-RCT studies that assessed the effect of prehospital administration of TXA versus placebo on the outcomes of trauma patients with significant hemorrhage. The main outcomes of interest were 24hour 30-day mortality and in-hospital thromboembolic complications. Two authors independently abstracted the data using a data collection form. Results from different studies were pooled for the analysis, when appropriate.

Results

Out of 92 references identified through the search, two analytical studies met the inclusion criteria. The effect of TXA on 24-hour mortality had a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.49 (95% CI 0.28–0.85), 30-day mortality OR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.56–1.32), and thromboembolic events OR of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.27–2.07).

Conclusion

Prehospital TXA appears to reduce early mortality in trauma patients. The pooled analysis also shows a trend toward lower 30-day mortality and reduced risk of thromboembolic events. Additional randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the significance of these trends.

The study CRASH-2 was published by CRASH- trial collaborators and colleagues in 2010 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Traumatic hemorrhage. In the CRASH-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tranexamic acid in trauma patients with significant hemorrhage? In the CRASH-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CRASH-2 study, the population was: 20207 patients (3272 female, 16935 male). The inclusion criteria were adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding. The key exclusion criteria were a clear indication for tranexamic acid, or a clear contraindication to tranexamic acid treatment. In the CRASH-2 study, the interventions were: n = 10093 tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min then infusion of 1 g over 8 h IV) n = 10114 placebo (matching placebo of 0.9% saline IV). In the CRASH-2 study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in all-cause death (14.5% vs. 16%; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97). In the CRASH-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death due to bleeding (4.9% vs. 5.7%; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.96) No significant difference in death due to vascular occlusion (0.3% vs. 0.5%; RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.08) No significant difference in vascular occlusive events (1.7% vs. 2%; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02). In the CRASH-2 study, the conclusion was: in adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding, tranexamic acid was superior to placebo with respect to a all-cause death.

Table 2 shows the effect of tranexamic acid on head injury-related death in the 9127 patients randomly assigned within 3 h of injury with outcome data. Among these patients, the risk of head injury-related death was 18.5% in the tranexamic acid group versus 19.8% in the placebo group (855 vs 892 events, RR 0.94 [95% CI 0.86–1.02]). In the prespecified sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with a GCS score of 3 or bilateral unreactive pupils at baseline, the results were 12.5% in the tranexamic acid group versus 14.0% in the placebo group (485 vs 525 events, 0.89 [0.80–1.00]).

Table 2

We examined the effect of tranexamic acid on head injury-related death stratified by baseline GCS and pupillary reactions (figure 3). We found a reduction in the risk of head injury-related death with tranexamic acid in patients with mild-to-moderate head injury (RR 0.78 [95% CI 0.64–0.95]) but in patients with severe head injury (0.99 [0.91–1.07]) we found no clear evidence of a reduction (p value for heterogeneity 0.030). When we examined the effect of baseline GCS in a regression analysis we found evidence that tranexamic acid is more effective in less severely injured patients (p = 0.007). Among patients with reactive pupils, head injury-related deaths were reduced with tranexamic acid (0.87, [0.77–0.98]).

Discussion

This trial provides evidence that the administration of tranexamic acid to patients with TBI within 3 h of injury reduces head injury-related death, with no evidence of adverse effects or complications. We found a substantial reduction in head injury-related deaths with tranexamic acid in patients with mild and moderate head injuries but no apparent reduction in those with severe head injury. We found no increase in disability among survivors.

Our trial had several strengths but also some limitations. The method of randomisation ensured that participating clinicians had no foreknowledge of the treatment allocation and the use of placebo control ensured that outcome assessments were blind to the intervention. Although the eligibility criteria required the recruiting clinician to be uncertain as to the appropriateness of tranexamic acid treatment, because tranexamic acid is not a recommended treatment for patients with isolated TBI, almost all patients with TBI who met the inclusion criteria were recruited. Baseline prognostic factors were well balanced and because almost all randomly assigned patients were followed up there was little potential for bias. The analysis was by intention to treat. The primary outcome was head injury-related death as assessed by the responsible clinician. Although some misclassification of cause of death is inevitable, the assessment was made blind to the trial treatment. All-cause mortality combines causes of death that might be affected by tranexamic acid (eg, head injury-related death due to intracranial bleeding) with causes that we do not expect to be affected by tranexamic acid (eg, sepsis) and therefore would be biased towards the null. Although the CRASH-3 trial is one of the largest trials in patients with TBI, the CIs were wide and compatible with a substantial reduction in head injury-related death and little or no benefit. On the other hand, when set in the context of all the available randomised trials of tranexamic acid in patients with TBI (figure 5), the possibility of no mortality benefit appears remote. When assessing outcome measures in clinical trials, provided there are few false positives (high specificity), estimates of the RR are unbiased even when sensitivity is imperfect. For this reason, a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism was recorded only if we found a positive result on imaging (eg, ultrasound) or at post-mortem examination. As a result, although the trial might have underestimated the risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, the RR estimates for this outcome should be unbiased.

Patient Selection Criteria

Patient selection protocols that identify candidates for prehospital TXA administration should utilize clinical determinants easily and readily available to EMS clinicians. Simultaneously, such protocols should not distract from or hinder timeliness of richer evidence-based patient care priorities. There is agreement in research and current practice that prehospital TXA administration should not be indiscriminately given to all trauma patients, instead being reserved for those in hemorrhagic shock. Most civilian prehospital TXA protocols identify candidate patients based on the CRASH-2 criteria of systolic blood pressure of < 90 mm Hg and/or a heart rate of > 110 beats per minute who are < 3 hours from the time of injury.

Unfortunately, definitive, objective prehospital markers of patients who are in hemorrhagic shock, and therefore might benefit most from TXA, have not yet been well defined. Table 1 outlines the available prognostic tools derived from outcomes based on in-hospital TXA administration. There is limited certainty in extrapolating these to prehospital use. The recent multicenter, randomized controlled PATCH Trial utilized the Coagulopathy of Severe Trauma score and time less than 3 hours from injury as their initial patient inclusion criteria. The Coagulopathy of Severe Trauma score was developed in the hospital as a prognostic tool, and its use to identify prehospital patients with risk of coagulopathy has not been validated. Tools or criteria to identify prehospital patients who would most benefit from TXA administration is a significant area for further research.

Evidence for tranexamic acid in adult trauma

In 2010, CRASH-2 (Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage-2) demonstrated that TXA safely reduces the risk of death in adult (age ≥ 16 years) trauma. This was the first study to show a medical treatment for trauma and a reduction in mortality. This randomized placebo-controlled trial involved 20,211 patients in 40 countries. Adult patients with unstable vitals (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg and/or heart rate > 110 beats per minute, or both) or a high clinical suspicion for significant hemorrhage were randomized to TXA versus placebo. The primary outcome, in-hospital mortality at 4 weeks, showed a significant reduction in risk of death due to bleeding for the TXA group (risk of death 0.85; 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.96; P = 0.004, number needed to treat (NNT) 121) and all-cause mortality for the overall population (risk of death 0.91; 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.97; P = 0.0035, NNT 67). TXA appeared to have the greatest impact on reduction of death caused by bleeding in the severe shock group (admission systolic blood pressure ≤ 75 mmHg) if administered within the first hour from injury. Further sub-analysis of CRASH-2 showed that mortality benefit was greatest when given within 3 hours of the injury, with suggested increased risk of death caused by bleeding, but no difference in all-cause mortality, if given later.

The CRASH-2 trial administered 1 g of TXA over 10 minutes followed by 1 g over 8 hours. Adverse events have not been published with this dose, but reports exist from other patient populations when much larger doses are given. In cardiovascular bypass surgery, extremely high doses (> 100 mg/kg) of TXA appear to increase the risk of perioperative seizures. There are also reports of TXA rapid infusion hypotension, TXA-induced cerebrovascular infarctions and even a single case report of TXA-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis. Vascular occlusive events were included in the secondary outcomes in the CRASH-2 trial, but there were no significant differences between TXA and control groups with respect to arterial and venous thromboembolic events. Systematic reviews have failed to find a concern regarding adverse events.

### Mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients: an exploratory analysis of data from the CRASH-2 trial [^6791b5d2]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Of the 20,211 patients who were randomly allocated to receive TXA or placebo, primary outcome data were available for 20,127 patients (99.6%) (10,060 allocated to TXA and 10,067 to placebo). There were 3,076 deaths (15.3%). Figure 1 shows cause of death by day since injury. On the day of the injury, there were 990 (32.2%) deaths, 587 (59%) of which were due to bleeding. A total 19,944 patients (99.1%) were known to have received a loading dose of TXA or placebo and 3,021 of these patients died. The following results are based on patients who received the loading dose of TXA or placebo (per protocol analysis). The intention-to-treat analyses were essentially the same.

Cause of death by day since injury.

There was a significant reduction in the hazard of death from all causes in TXA treated patients on the day of the injury (HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.73, 0.93). Thereafter, there was no significant reduction in the hazard of death from all causes (Table 1). Figure 2 shows a heat map of the smoothed HR, stratified by time from injury to treatment and day of death.

Among those treated within 3 h of injury, there was a 22% reduction in the hazard of death from all causes on the day of the injury (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.68, 0.90). There was no reduction in the hazard of death from all causes on the day of the injury among those treated after 3 hours (HR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.76, 1.36).

### Mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients: an exploratory analysis of data from the CRASH-2 trial [^bfe97fc3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

To investigate the mechanism of action of TXA in bleeding trauma patients we examined the timing of its effect on mortality
We hypothesised that if TXA reduces mortality by decreasing bleeding, its effect should be greatest on the day of the injury, but if it reduces mortality via an anti-inflammatory mechanism, its effect should be greater over subsequent days
We found that the effect of TXA on mortality is greatest on the day of the injury, when early TXA treatment reduces the risk of death from all causes by about 20% and death due to bleeding by about 30%. Our results support the hypothesis that TXA improves survival by reducing bleeding
There is a short time-window during which TXA administration can prevent exsanguination; urgent treatment may therefore be essential

### Tranexamic acid in trauma: how should we use it? [^fcfb69f3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces blood loss by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin. It is often used in surgery to decrease bleeding and the need for blood transfusion. In 2011, results from a multi-center, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial (CRASH-2 trial) showed that TXA (1 g loading dose over 10 min followed by an infusion of 1 g over 8 h) safely reduces mortality in bleeding trauma patients. Initiation of TXA treatment within 3 h of injury reduces the risk of hemorrhage death by about one-third, regardless of baseline risk. Because it does not have any serious adverse effects, TXA can be administered to a wide spectrum of bleeding trauma patients. Limiting its use to the most severely injured or those with a diagnosis of 'hyperfibrinolysis' would result in thousands of avoidable deaths. A clinical trial (CRASH-3 trial) of TXA in patients with traumatic brain injury is now in progress.

Tranexamic acid in acute bleeding conditions

In addition to the preventive use of TXA, a number of studies have investigated the role of this anti-fibrinolytic agent in patients presenting with acute, critical bleeding.– In trauma patients, the largest body of evidence stems from the Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH) trials. In the CRASH-2 trial, 20,211 severely injured adults with confirmed or suspected hemorrhage were randomly assigned within 8 h from the occurrence of trauma to receive TXA (loading bolus dose of 1 g and then an infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or placebo. Despite no difference in bleeding rate and transfusion use, all-cause mortality was lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group (14.5% vs. 16%, respectively; RR 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85–0.97, P = 0.0035). Similarly, the rate of deaths attributed to bleeding was reduced from 5.7% to 4.9% (P = 0.0077) (Table 1). Yet, from a sub-analysis of CRASH-2, the timing of TXA administration was crucial for patients' outcomes. Early infusion of TXA within 1 h after trauma was associated with the largest survival benefit (absolute reduction = 2.4%, number needed to treat = 41). TXA infused between 1 and 3 h also reduced the risk of death due to bleeding (absolute reduction = 1.3%, number needed to treat = 77), but a later administration (> 3 h after trauma) was associated with an increased risk of death from bleeding compared with the risk among patients receiving placebo (RR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.12–1.84; P = 0.004). There was no evidence that TXA increased the risk of vascular occlusive events and, in a pre-specified analysis of the data collected when TXA was given within 3 h of injury, there was even a reduction in the odds of fatal and non-fatal vascular occlusive events (odds ratio = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53–0.89; P = 0.005). Following the publication of this study, the World Health Organization (WHO) included TXA in their list of essential medicines (available at:). Since this seminal study, a number of randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the efficacy of anti-fibrinolytic agents have been published. The Cochrane systematic review regarding anti-fibrinolytic drugs for acute traumatic injury found that, after the analysis of four trials involving 20,548 patients, TXA reduced the risk of death by 10% (RR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.85–0.96; P = 0.002) without increasing the risk of adverse events.

### Association of tranexamic acid administration with mortality and thromboembolic events in patients with traumatic injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f51bd4a7]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This report details a systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic injury. The main strength of this review is its size, including 31 studies that summarize, to our knowledge, all the clinical evidence published thus far. However, given the large diversity of the included trials, the results must be analyzed critically.

Overall, tranexamic acid administration was associated with a 17% decrease in 1-month mortality compared with the control group. A subgroup analysis revealed that patients with multiple traumatic injuries may benefit more from tranexamic acid administration than patients with TBI, in particular when the leading pathological finding was hemorrhage along with clinical signs of shock. Although the results for patients with TBI were mainly dominated by a single study (ie, the Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Head Injury [CRASH-3] study), the comparison between the 2 entities may be viewed with caution. However, the present results are corroborated by the most recent RCT, in which results of comparing patients with nonsevere and severe TBI were largely similar.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid is associated with a survival benefit without an increase in complications: results of two harmonized randomized clinical trials [^1e4a0504]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Among patients with major traumatic injury, from two harmonized prehospital TXA trials representing a diverse range of injury characteristics and demographics, prehospital TXA was associated with lower 28-day mortality and 24-hour red cell transfusion requirements. A dose-response relationship was also characterized, demonstrating that increasing the dose of prehospital TXA resulted in an incremental reduction in 28-day mortality and 24-hour red cell transfusion requirements. Prehospital TXA was not associated with an increase in adverse events.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on mortality in patients with traumatic bleeding: prespecified analysis of data from randomised controlled trial [^db111740]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The beneficial effects of tranexamic acid in reducing all cause mortality and deaths from bleeding in patients with traumatic bleeding do not seem to vary significantly by baseline risk of death. Tranexamic acid reduced the odds of death from bleeding by about 30% in each of the baseline risk strata studied and reduced the odds of thrombotic events by about 30%. Once again, this reduction did not vary significantly by baseline risk of death. Taken together, these data suggest that tranexamic acid can be administered safely to a wide spectrum of patients with traumatic bleeding and that its use should not be restricted to those with the most severe haemorrhage. Absence of evidence of heterogeneity by baseline risk of death, however, should not be taken as evidence of absence. In particular, in the lowest risk group the precision of the estimated effect is low, and there remains some uncertainty.

Strengths and weaknesses

The data examined are from a large randomised placebo controlled trial with well concealed allocation, blinded outcome assessment, and minimal loss to follow up. We prespecified this analysis of the effect of tranexamic acid stratified by baseline risk of death in the planned statistical analysis in 2010 before un-blinding. Specifically, we stated that we would conduct "subgroup analyses according to baseline risk of mortality. We will develop a prognostic model including all the baseline variables (age, sex, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma Score, number of hours since injury, central capillary refill time and type of injury). This model will be derived only from the control group. We will categorise the patients according to tertiles of risk and we will report the relative and absolute measures of effect for each category". The only substantial deviation from this plan was that we created four risk strata rather than three. This was done so that the risk groups analysed corresponded with those in a risk score that we had previously developed for use by emergency physicians. The risk score categories in turn were based on previous research and the views of clinical users.

### Understanding the neuroprotective effect of tranexamic acid: an exploratory analysis of the CRASH-3 randomised trial [^19894173]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The CRASH-3 trial hypothesised that timely tranexamic acid (TXA) treatment might reduce deaths from intracranial bleeding after traumatic brain injury (TBI). To explore the mechanism of action of TXA in TBI, we examined the timing of its effect on death.

Methods

The CRASH-3 trial randomised 9202 patients within 3h of injury with a GCS score ≤ 12 or intracranial bleeding on CT scan and no significant extracranial bleeding to receive TXA or placebo. We conducted an exploratory analysis of the effects of TXA on all-cause mortality within 24h of injury and within 28days, excluding patients with a GCS score of 3 or bilateral unreactive pupils, stratified by severity and country income. We pool data from the CRASH-2 and CRASH-3 trials in a one-step fixed effects individual patient data meta-analysis.

Results

There were 7637 patients for analysis after excluding patients with a GCS score of 3 or bilateral unreactive pupils. Of 1112 deaths, 23.3% were within 24h of injury (early deaths). The risk of early death was reduced with TXA (112 (2.9%) TXA group vs 147 (3.9%) placebo group; risk ratio [RR] RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58–0.94). There was no evidence of heterogeneity by severity (p = 0.64) or country income (p = 0.68). The risk of death beyond 24h of injury was similar in the TXA and placebo groups (432 (11.5%) TXA group vs 421 (11.7%) placebo group; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.69–1.12). The risk of death at 28days was 14.0% in the TXA group versus 15.1% in the placebo group (544 vs 568 events; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83–1.03). When the CRASH-2 and CRASH-3 trial data were pooled, TXA reduced early death (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70–0.87) and death within 28days (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82–0.94).

Conclusions

Tranexamic acid reduces early deaths in non-moribund TBI patients regardless of TBI severity or country income. The effect of tranexamic acid in patients with isolated TBI is similar to that in polytrauma. Treatment is safe and even severely injured patients appear to benefit when treated soon after injury.

### Tranexamic acid during prehospital transport in patients at risk for hemorrhage after injury: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^979e7465]. JAMA Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

In-hospital administration of tranexamic acid after injury improves outcomes in patients at risk for hemorrhage. Data demonstrating the benefit and safety of the pragmatic use of tranexamic acid in the prehospital phase of care are lacking for these patients.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness and safety of tranexamic acid administered before hospitalization compared with placebo in injured patients at risk for hemorrhage.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This pragmatic, phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority randomized clinical trial included injured patients with prehospital hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg) or tachycardia (heart rate ≥ 110/min) before arrival at 1 of 4 US level 1 trauma centers, within an estimated 2 hours of injury, from May 1, 2015, through October 31, 2019.

Interventions

Patients received 1 g of tranexamic acid before hospitalization (447 patients) or placebo (456 patients) infused for 10 minutes in 100 mL of saline. The randomization scheme used prehospital and in-hospital phase assignments, and patients administered tranexamic acid were allocated to abbreviated, standard, and repeat bolus dosing regimens on trauma center arrival.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality.

Results

In all, 927 patients (mean [SD] age, 42 [18] years; 686 [74.0%] male) were eligible for prehospital enrollment (460 randomized to tranexamic acid intervention; 467 to placebo intervention). After exclusions, the intention-to-treat study cohort comprised 903 patients: 447 in the tranexamic acid arm and 456 in the placebo arm. Mortality at 30 days was 8.1% in patients receiving tranexamic acid compared with 9.9% in patients receiving placebo (difference, -1.8%; 95% CI, -5.6% to 1.9%; P = 0.17). Results of Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, accounting for site, verified that randomization to tranexamic acid was not associated with a significant reduction in 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59–1.11, P = 0.18). Prespecified dosing regimens and post-hoc subgroup analyses found that prehospital tranexamic acid were associated with significantly lower 30-day mortality. When comparing tranexamic acid effect stratified by time to treatment and qualifying shock severity in a post hoc comparison, 30-day mortality was lower when tranexamic acid was administered within 1 hour of injury (4.6% vs 7.6%; difference, -3.0%; 95% CI, -5.7% to -0.3%; P < .002). Patients with severe shock (systolic blood pressure ≤ 70 mm Hg) who received tranexamic acid demonstrated lower 30-day mortality compared with placebo (18.5% vs 35.5%; difference, -17%; 95% CI, -25.8% to -8.1%; P < .003).

Conclusions and Relevance

In injured patients at risk for hemorrhage, tranexamic acid administered before hospitalization did not result in significantly lower 30-day mortality. The prehospital administration of tranexamic acid after injury did not result in a higher incidence of thrombotic complications or adverse events. Tranexamic acid given to injured patients at risk for hemorrhage in the prehospital setting is safe and associated with survival benefit in specific subgroups of patients.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid is associated with a survival benefit without an increase in complications: results of two harmonized randomized clinical trials [^3888c463]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Given that this is a secondary analysis of two trials with different primary endpoints, we conducted a power analysis for the primary outcome. Powered at 90%, with the harmonized sample size, an effect size represented by a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.86 would be required to find a statistically significant difference between prehospital TXA and control groups. Assuming a similar range for the HR for midterm survival (0.6–0.8) as seen in previous literature, the harmonized data set provides a sufficient sample size and power to characterize the effect of prehospital TXA on 28-day survival. In addition, with regard to adverse events, we estimated that our cohort of 1,744 patients with complete data, using an adverse event estimate of 3% and a 2-sided α = 0.05, would provide 80% power to detect a difference of just under 3 percentage points (3.00% vs. 5.75%) in adverse events between treatment groups.

Descriptive statistics characterized the demographics and injuries of the patients and outcomes of interest. A Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted on all continuous variables to test for normality. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages and tested using the χ 2 test. Continuous variables were expressed as medians with interquartile ranges and were tested using Wilcoxon rank sum. Statistical significance was determined at the p < 0.05 level (two-sided). All data were analyzed using STATA version 17.0 (College Station, TX).

### Pre-hospital anti-fibrinolytics for traumatic coagulopathy and haemorrhage (the PATCH study) (PATCH) [^26d583bc]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Study Overview The purpose of this research is to determine whether giving severely injured adults a drug called tranexamic acid as soon as possible after injury will improve their chances of survival and their level of recovery at six months. After severe injury, a person may have uncontrolled bleeding that places them at high risk of bleeding to death. Coagulation is an important process in the body that helps to control blood loss. Up to a quarter of people that are severely injured have a condition called acute traumatic coagulopathy. This condition affects coagulation and results in the break down of blood clots that can lead to increased blood loss and an increased risk of dying.

Recent evidence from a large clinical trial showed early treatment with TXA reduced the risk of death in severely injured patients, however the majority of patients involved in the study were injured in countries where prehospital care is limited and rapid access to lifesaving treatments is limited compared to that available in countries like Australia and New Zealand. It is unclear whether TXA will reduce the risk of death to the same degree when it is given alongside other lifesaving treatments that are available to patients soon after injury in these countries. The hypothesis is that TXA given early to injured patients who are at risk of acute traumatic coagulopathy and who are treated in countries with systems providing advanced trauma care reduces mortality and improves recovery at 6-months after injury.

### Effects of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events, and blood transfusion in trauma patients with significant haemorrhage (CRASH-2): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^ba293814]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid can reduce bleeding in patients undergoing elective surgery. We assessed the effects of early administration of a short course of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events, and the receipt of blood transfusion in trauma patients.

Methods

This randomised controlled trial was undertaken in 274 hospitals in 40 countries. 20 211 adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding were randomly assigned within 8 h of injury to either tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min then infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or matching placebo. Randomisation was balanced by centre, with an allocation sequence based on a block size of eight, generated with a computer random number generator. Both participants and study staff (site investigators and trial coordinating centre staff) were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was death in hospital within 4 weeks of injury, and was described with the following categories: bleeding, vascular occlusion (myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism), multiorgan failure, head injury, and other. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered as ISRCTN86750102, Clinicaltrials.govNCT00375258, and South African Clinical Trial RegisterDOH-27-0607-1919.

Findings

10 096 patients were allocated to tranexamic acid and 10 115 to placebo, of whom 10 060 and 10 067, respectively, were analysed. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced with tranexamic acid (1463 [14.5%] tranexamic acid group vs 1613 [16.0%] placebo group; relative risk 0.91, 95% CI 0.85–0.97; p = 0.0035). The risk of death due to bleeding was significantly reduced (489 [4.9%] vs 574 [5.7%]; relative risk 0.85, 95% CI 0.76–0.96; p = 0.0077).

Interpretation

Tranexamic acid safely reduced the risk of death in bleeding trauma patients in this study. On the basis of these results, tranexamic acid should be considered for use in bleeding trauma patients.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on mortality in patients with traumatic bleeding: prespecified analysis of data from randomised controlled trial [^4b895880]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The CRASH-2 trial showed that a short course of tranexamic acid given within three hours of injury to adult patients with traumatic bleeding significantly reduces all cause mortality with no apparent increase in the risk of adverse thrombotic events. As a result, tranexamic acid is now being incorporated into trauma protocols around the world. These protocols generally focus on the care of the most severely injured. Patients with a high risk of death at baseline have the most to gain from the use of life saving treatments because the absolute benefits of an effective treatment tend to increase as the baseline risk increases. On the other hand, there are more low risk trauma patients than high risk patients, and a large number of patients at low risk might contribute more deaths than a smaller number of patients at high risk. We carried out prespecified analyses of the CRASH-2 trial data to examine how effects of treatment with tranexamic acid vary according to the baseline risk of death in patients with traumatic bleeding. We then used data from a large hospital based trauma registry to assess the extent to which current trauma protocols maximise the benefits to patients of treatment with tranexamic acid.

### Understanding the neuroprotective effect of tranexamic acid: an exploratory analysis of the CRASH-3 randomised trial [^05ff2990]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

We prespecified an analysis setting the results of the CRASH-3 trial in the context of other evidence, including the CRASH-2 trial, in which 40% of deaths were due to head injury. The CRASH-3 trial essentially represents a subgroup of patients with isolated TBI who were excluded from the CRASH-2 trial. Here, to set our results in the context of tranexamic acid in polytrauma patients, we pooled the data from the CRASH-2 and CRASH-3 trials in a one-step fixed effects individual patient data meta-analysis using a Poisson regression model with sandwich variance estimation, adjusted for time to treatment. In the main CRASH-3 trial publication, we updated a systematic search for randomised trials of tranexamic acid in TBI. We searched PubMed, Science Citation Index, National Research Register, Zetoc, SIGLE, Global Health, LILACS, Current Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE. We identified three trials in addition to the CRASH-3 trial including the CRASH-2 intracranial bleeding study, a randomised trial of 283 TBI patients sponsored by Khon Kaen University and a randomised trial of pre-hospital tranexamic acid in 967 TBI patients sponsored by the University of Washington (NCT01990768). The CRASH-2 intracranial bleeding study was omitted as this is already contained within the CRASH-2 trial dataset, and the small Thai study was omitted due to a lack of data on timing of death, cause of death and GCS score, and limitations in methodological quality including an unclear risk of selection bias from allocation concealment.

The model for the one-step meta-analysis was as follows:

where trial = 0 for CRASH-2 and 1 for CRASH-3, group = 0 for placebo and 1 for TXA, ttt is time to treatment and β 2 is the summary effect estimate across both trials.

We also consider the CRASH-3 trial results in the context of the CRASH-2 trial and the trial of pre-hospital tranexamic acid (NCT01990768) using an aggregate data meta-analysis with fixed effects to assess the effect of tranexamic acid on death at 28 days excluding patients with a GCS score of 3 or bilateral unreactive pupils, and on vascular occlusive events in all patients. An aggregate data meta-analysis was used because we did not have access to the individual patient data for trial NCT01990768.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of tranexamic acid for the treatment of traumatic brain injury, based on the results of the CRASH-3 randomised trial: a decision modelling approach [^36ba6e4e]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

The CRASH-3 trial showed that earlier treatment administration resulted in a greater reduction in head injury deaths for those sustaining a mild or moderate TBI. This relationship was unknown during the trial, and the randomisation process also required additional time prior to treatment. Therefore, tranexamic acid is likely to be even more cost-effective than our results suggest if the time to treatment administration is reduced in a real-world setting, as demonstrated in a sensitivity analysis. In the CRASH-3 trial, tranexamic acid was administered in the emergency department, but this finding would support its administration in the prehospital setting (eg, at the location of injury or in the ambulance), where possible.

To our knowledge, this is the first cost-effectiveness analysis of tranexamic acid for patients sustaining a TBI. Our results are similar to those of previous economic evaluations for tranexamic acid in postpartum haemorrhage, trauma patients with significant haemorrhage and patients experiencing bleeding during the surgery. These studies have also shown tranexamic acid to be cost-effective, with relatively low incremental costs associated with providing treatment.

Our analysis has considerable strengths, but also some limitations. The analysis uses data taken from a large, multinational RCT, and therefore, the evidence of the treatment effect can be considered of high quality. In addition, our analysis showed the intervention is highly likely to be cost-effective in both high-income and low-income settings. However, one limitation of our analysis is that the CRASH-3 trial only followed patients for 28 days postinjury, leading to uncertainty in patient outcomes beyond this time. Data on the long-term outcomes posthead injury are relatively scarce in the literature, particularly for LMICs. We assumed that after the trial period the risk of death remained considerably elevated compared with the general population (four times higher for first year, two times higher thereafter), to capture the long-term additional risk of death compared with the general population. These elevated risks were derived from Scotland, and therefore, may differ for low-income countries. However, sensitivity analyses using higher discount rates (giving lower weighting to future events), and a scenario excluding this additional mortality both had little impact on the estimated ICER, with tranexamic acid remaining cost-effective in both analyses.

### Effects of tranexamic acid on death, disability, vascular occlusive events and other morbidities in patients with acute traumatic brain injury (CRASH-3): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^37401bb0]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The effect of tranexamic acid on head injury-related death appears to depend on the time interval between injury and the initiation of the trial treatment and on the severity of TBI. Early treatment of patients with mild (GCS 13–15 and intracranial bleeding on baseline CT scan) and moderate head injury seemed to confer the greatest mortality benefit. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that tranexamic acid improves outcome by reducing intracranial bleeding. Because haemorrhage expansion occurs in the hours immediately after injury, treatment delay would reduce the potential for tranexamic acid to prevent intracranial bleeding. Patients with severe head injury might have less to gain from tranexamic acid treatment than patients with mild-to-moderate head injury because such patients already have extensive intracranial haemorrhage before treatment or other potentially life-threatening intracranial pathologies that are not affected by tranexamic acid. We anticipated in our statistical analysis plan that the effect of tranexamic acid would be greater for head injury-related deaths occurring in the first few days after injury than for late head injury-related deaths because early head injury-related deaths are more likely due to bleeding. Our data supports this hypothesis, showing a substantial reduction in head injury-related deaths within 24 h of injury. Similar results were obtained in the CRASH-2 trial of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic extracranial bleeding, in which the effect of tranexamic acid on death from bleeding was greatest on the day of the injury (RR 0.72 [95% CI 0.60–0.86]). However, thereafter the benefit of tranexamic acid in head injury patients was slightly attenuated, probably because patients succumbed to non-bleeding-related pathophysiological mechanisms. This finding might explain why the effect of early tranexamic acid treatment on head injury-related death is slightly smaller than the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding seen in the CRASH-2 trial.

### Efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in acute traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^5e8c26f2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

With the publication of a large randomized-controlled trial (RCT) suggesting that tranexamic acid (TXA) may improve head-injury-related deaths, we aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of TXA in acute traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINHAL, ACPJC, Google Scholar, and unpublished sources from inception until June 24, 2020 for randomized-controlled trials comparing TXA and placebo in adults and adolescents (≥ 15 years of age) with acute TBI. We screened studies and extracted summary estimates independently and in duplicate. We assessed the quality of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020164232).

Results

Nine RCTs enrolled 14,747 patients. Compared to placebo, TXA had no effect on mortality (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.88–1.02; RD 1.0% reduction; 95% CI 2.5% reduction to 0.4% increase, moderate certainty) or disability assessed by the Disability Rating Scale (MD, - 0.18 points; 95% CI - 0.43 to 0.08; moderate certainty). TXA may reduce hematoma expansion on subsequent imaging (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.58–1.03, RD 3.6%, 95% CI 6.6% reduction to 0.5% increase, low certainty). Risks of adverse events (all moderate, low, or very low certainty) were similar between placebo and TXA.

Conclusions

In patients with acute TBI, TXA probably has no effect on mortality or disability. TXA may decrease hematoma expansion on subsequent imaging; however, this outcome is likely of less importance to patients. The use of TXA probably does not increase the risk of adverse events.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid is associated with a dose-dependent decrease in syndecan-1 after trauma: a secondary analysis of a prospective randomized trial [^3eebdcb4]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The STAAMP Trial assessed 30-day mortality for 927 patients who received prehospital TXA vs. those who received a placebo. After exclusion, the intention-to-treat study cohort comprised 903 patients: 447 patients received prehospital TXA and 456 patients received the placebo. This cohort included mostly male patients (686 [74%]) with a mean [SD] age of 42 years [18 years], a median [IQR] Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 12 [5, 22], and 30-day mortality of 9.1%. Patients sustained primarily blunt injuries and most were transferred directly from the scene of their injuries. The number of adverse events (e.g. venous thromboembolism) was similar across trial arms. Patients who received TXA compared with placebo in the prehospital setting did not have a lower rate of 30-day mortality (8.1% vs. 9.9%). In a post hoc secondary analysis, a lower 30-day mortality was found when TXA was administered to patients within 1 hour of injury (4.6% vs. 7.6% p = 0.002) and in patients with severe prehospital shock (SBP ≤ 70) (18.5% vs. 35.5% p = 0.003).

### Prehospital tranexamic acid is associated with a survival benefit without an increase in complications: results of two harmonized randomized clinical trials [^b0cf46b6]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

There have been mixed results regarding the efficacy and potential safety of TXA in previous literature. The Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Hemorrhage (CRASH-2) trialdemonstrated that in-hospital administration of TXA, administered within 3 hours after injury, was shown to reduce 28-day mortality among patients with suspected bleeding. However, both STAAMPand ROC-TXAfailed to demonstrate a primary outcome benefit. Importantly, CRASH-2 found that treatment given after 3 hours seemed to increase the risk of death due to bleeding, which has prompted considerable debate regarding the utility of TXA in patients with traumatic injury. Most recently, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trialassessing the efficacy and safety of prehospital TXA in patients suffering traumatic injury demonstrated a significant reduction in both 24-hour and 28-day mortality relative to placebo. In addition, prehospital TXA was not associated with an increase in VTE, myocardial infarction, or stroke. The results of the current analysis strengthen the evidence for both the safety and efficacy of prehospital TXA in a diverse injured patient population and is concordant with the most recent randomized trial. This growing body of evidence should begin to change practice and promote the utilization of TXA as close to the time of injury as possible.

### Effect of early tranexamic acid administration on mortality, hysterectomy, and other morbidities in women with post-partum haemorrhage (WOMAN): an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^43898d23]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Post-partum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. Early administration of tranexamic acid reduces deaths due to bleeding in trauma patients. We aimed to assess the effects of early administration of tranexamic acid on death, hysterectomy, and other relevant outcomes in women with post-partum haemorrhage.

Methods

In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women aged 16 years and older with a clinical diagnosis of post-partum haemorrhage after a vaginal birth or caesarean section from 193 hospitals in 21 countries. We randomly assigned women to receive either 1 g intravenous tranexamic acid or matching placebo in addition to usual care. If bleeding continued after 30 min, or stopped and restarted within 24 h of the first dose, a second dose of 1 g of tranexamic acid or placebo could be given. Patients were assigned by selection of a numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight numbered packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Participants, care givers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. We originally planned to enrol 15000 women with a composite primary endpoint of death from all-causes or hysterectomy within 42 days of giving birth. However, during the trial it became apparent that the decision to conduct a hysterectomy was often made at the same time as randomisation. Although tranexamic acid could influence the risk of death in these cases, it could not affect the risk of hysterectomy. We therefore increased the sample size from 15000 to 20000 women in order to estimate the effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of death from post-partum haemorrhage. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ISRCTN76912190 (Dec 8, 2008); ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00872469; and PACTR201007000192283.

Findings

Between March, 2010, and April, 2016, 20060 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive tranexamic acid (n = 10051) or placebo (n = 10009), of whom 10036 and 9985, respectively, were included in the analysis. Death due to bleeding was significantly reduced in women given tranexamic acid (155 [1.5%] of 10036 patients vs 191 [1.9%] of 9985 in the placebo group, risk ratio [RR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.65–1.00; p = 0.045), especially in women given treatment within 3 h of giving birth (89 [1.2%] in the tranexamic acid group vs 127 [1.7%] in the placebo group, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.91; p = 0.008). All other causes of death did not differ significantly by group. Hysterectomy was not reduced with tranexamic acid (358 [3.6%] patients in the tranexamic acid group vs 351 [3.5%] in the placebo group, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88–1.07; p = 0.84). The composite primary endpoint of death from all causes or hysterectomy was not reduced with tranexamic acid (534 [5.3%] deaths or hysterectomies in the tranexamic acid group vs 546 [5.5%] in the placebo group, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87–1.09; p = 0.65). Adverse events (including thromboembolic events) did not differ significantly in the tranexamic acid versus placebo group.

Interpretation

Tranexamic acid reduces death due to bleeding in women with post-partum haemorrhage with no adverse effects. When used as a treatment for postpartum haemorrhage, tranexamic acid should be given as soon as possible after bleeding onset.

### Mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients: an exploratory analysis of data from the CRASH-2 trial [^ad98cd5f]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Analysis

Both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. The effect of TXA on mortality was assessed using hazard ratios (HR), which give the ratio of the probability of death in the TXA and placebo group at a given time point, among patients surviving to that time point. It represents the instantaneous risk of death for an individual who has survived to that particular time point. We calculated HR for all-cause mortality, death due to bleeding and for non-bleeding deaths, on the day of the injury and for the subsequent four days. We also conducted analyses stratified by time from injury to the initiation of TXA treatment (≤ 3 h or > 3 h). Precision was quantified using 95% CI.

To give a visual representation of the results, we prepared a heat map of the smoothed HR. We stratified patients into one-hour intervals by time from injury to treatment and estimated HR for all-cause mortality for each stratum over the first 5 days. We plotted these HR in a two-dimensional coloured heat map of nine by five cells. To reduce the impact of random variability, we smoothed the HR using a simple moving average method. The smoothed HR was a double-weighted average of itself and the neighbouring HR. The two weights were: 1) the inverse of the variance of the HR and 2) the inverse of the distance between the smoothed HR and the neighbouring HR. Distance was defined as 1 for the HR being smoothed, with +1 being added for each day and hour of separation up to a maximum of 3 units (see Additional file 1 for an example of distances).

The trial was considered and approved by the relevant ethics committees in all participating hospitals (see Additional file 2). Consent procedures at participating hospitals were established by local regulation and the appropriate ethics committees. Informed consent was obtained from patients if physical and mental capacity allowed. If patients could not give consent, proxy consent was obtained from a relative or representative. If a proxy was unavailable, then if permitted by local regulation, consent was deferred or waived. When consent was deferred or given by a proxy, the patient was informed about the trial as soon as possible and consent obtained for the use of the data collected.

### Use of tranexamic acid in trauma surgical specialties: a narrative review [^4dff65d9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Though some studies suggest limited or no mortality benefit of TXA, particularly in the prehospital setting, multiple large, high-quality clinical trials have found that TXA significantly reduces mortality among trauma patients. Most notably, the CRASH-2 trial found that empiric TXA administration resulted in a 1.5% absolute reduction in 28-day mortality among patients with or at risk for hemodynamically significant bleeding. Current literature also supports the use of TXA after orthopaedic trauma. Extensive evidence exists that TXA is a safe medication, with numerous studies demonstrating no increased risk of thromboembolic events after administration of TXA in trauma settings. Future research on TXA is needed to elucidate the potential benefit of TXA after traumatic brain and spine injury and the optimal dose and route of administration of TXA.

### The importance of early treatment with tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients: an exploratory analysis of the CRASH-2 randomised controlled trial [^8115da73]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The aim of the CRASH-2 trial was to assess the effects of early administration of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events, and blood transfusion in trauma patients with significant haemorrhage. Tranexamic acid significantly reduced all-cause mortality. Because tranexamic acid is thought to exert its effect through inhibition of fibrinolysis, we undertook exploratory analyses of its effect on death due to bleeding.

Methods

The CRASH-2 trial was undertaken in 274 hospitals in 40 countries. 20,211 adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding were randomly assigned within 8 h of injury to either tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min followed by infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or placebo. Patients were randomly assigned by selection of the lowest numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight numbered packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Both participants and study staff (site investigators and trial coordinating centre staff) were masked to treatment allocation. We examined the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding according to time to treatment, severity of haemorrhage as assessed by systolic blood pressure, Glasgow coma score (GCS), and type of injury. All analyses were by intention to treat. The trial is registered as ISRCTN86750102, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00375258, and South African Clinical Trial Register/Department of Health DOH-27-0607-1919.

Findings

10,096 patients were allocated to tranexamic acid and 10,115 to placebo, of whom 10,060 and 10,067, respectively, were analysed. 1063 deaths (35%) were due to bleeding. We recorded strong evidence that the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding varied according to the time from injury to treatment (test for interaction p < 0.0001). Early treatment (≤ 1 h from injury) significantly reduced the risk of death due to bleeding (198/3747 [5.3%] events in tranexamic acid group vs 286/3704 [7.7%] in placebo group; relative risk [RR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.57–0.82; p < 0.0001). Treatment given between 1 and 3 h also reduced the risk of death due to bleeding (147/3037 [4.8%] vs 184/2996 [6.1%]; RR 0.79, 0.64–0.97; p = 0.03). Treatment given after 3 h seemed to increase the risk of death due to bleeding (144/3272 [4.4%] vs 103/3362 [3.1%]; RR 1.44, 1.12–1.84; p = 0.004). We recorded no evidence that the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding varied by systolic blood pressure, Glasgow coma score, or type of injury.

Interpretation

Tranexamic acid should be given as early as possible to bleeding trauma patients. For trauma patients admitted late after injury, tranexamic acid is less effective and could be harmful.

Summary

Post-partum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. Early administration of tranexamic acid reduces deaths due to bleeding in trauma patients. We aimed to assess the effects of early administration of tranexamic acid on death, hysterectomy, and other relevant outcomes in women with post-partum haemorrhage.

Adverse events (including thromboembolic events) did not differ significantly in the tranexamic acid versus placebo group.

Interpretation

Tranexamic acid reduces death due to bleeding in women with post-partum haemorrhage with no adverse effects. When used as a treatment for postpartum haemorrhage, tranexamic acid should be given as soon as possible after bleeding onset.

### Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary intraCerebral haemorrhage (TICH-2): an international randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 superiority trial [^61d26859]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study TICH-2 was published by Nikola Sprigg and colleagues in 2018 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Intracerebral hemorrhage. In the TICH-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tranexamic acid in patients with stroke due to intracerebral hemorrhage? In the TICH-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TICH-2 study, the population was: 2325 patients (1024 female, 1301 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with intracerebral hemorrhage from acute stroke. The key exclusion criteria were intracerebral hemorrhage secondary to anticoagulation, thrombolysis, trauma, or a known underlying structural abnormality; contraindication to tranexamic acid; prestroke dependence; life expectancy < 3 months; and GCS score < 5. In the TICH-2 study, the interventions were: n = 1161 tranexamic acid (1 g intravenous bolus followed by another 1 g infused over 8 hours, within 8 hours of symptom onset) n = 1164 placebo (normal saline 0.9% administered with an identical regimen). In the TICH-2 study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at 90 days (22% vs. 21%; aHR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.1). In the TICH-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in change in volume of hematoma from baseline to 24 hours (3.72 mL vs. 4.9 mL; AD -1.37 mL, 95% CI -2.71 to -0.04) Significant increase in length of stay in hospital (63.12 days vs. 63.73 days; AD 1.09 days, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.24). In the TICH-2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in venous thromboembolic events, arterial occlusions, seizure, nervous system disorders, infections. significant differences in serious adverse events by day 2 (33% vs. 36%), day 7 (39% vs. 43%), 90 days (45% vs. 48%). In the TICH-2 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with intracerebral hemorrhage from acute stroke, tranexamic acid was not superior to placebo with respect to death at 90 days.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^36305a0e]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Tranexamic acid (trans-4-aminomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid; TXA) is a synthetic lysine analogue that is a competitive inhibitor of plasminogen. TXA is distributed throughout all tissues, and the plasma half-life is 120 min. The Clinical Randomisation of Antifibrinolytic therapy in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH-2) trial assessed the effects of early administration of a short course of TXA on death, vascular occlusive events and the receipt of blood product transfusion in trauma patients who were bleeding or at risk of significant bleeding. The trial randomised 20,211 adult trauma patients with or at risk of significant bleeding to either TXA (loading dose 1 g over 10 min followed by infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or matching placebo within 8 h of injury. The primary outcome was death in hospital within 4 weeks of injury. All analyses assessed the intention-to-treat population. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced with TXA by 1.5%, and the risk of death due to bleeding was significantly reduced by 0.8% and a reduction in bleeding deaths by one-third, mainly through preventing exsanguination within the first 24 h. One retrospective study has suggested that TXA is of no benefit in patients with viscoelastic hyperfibrinolysis and another found TXA to reduce multiple organ failure and mortality in severely injured shocked patients. This discrepancy is probably attributable to methodological limitations.

### Tranexamic acid in traumatic brain injury… [^49866e6c]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits clot breakdown and decreases bleeding. 1 Early TXA administration has been shown to reduce mortality from head injury and improve neurologic recovery at 6 months in patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. 2, 3 The mechanism for this mortality difference remains unclear. We performed a cohort study using data from a subgroup of patients enrolled in the Prehospital TXA for TBI Trial. 3 Patients with moderate or severe TBI were randomized within 2 hours of injury to 1 of 2 dosing regimens of TXA or placebo to determine the association between TXA and long-term neurologic outcomes and mortality stratified by ICH type.

Multivariable Cox and linear regression models were created to identify factors associated with mortality and 6-month functional outcome, controlling for age, sex, race and ethnicity, best GCS in the first 24 hours, Injury Severity Score, Marshall score, 4 additional lesion types, and study site. P <. 05 was considered significant. R, version 4.
2. 3 software was used for analysis. Of the 966 patients in the original trial, 503 met the inclusion criteria for this study and had complete data for analysis. Patients with combined extra-axial and intra-axial hemorrhage had a higher ISS, more severe brain injury, and higher 28-day mortality than those with extra-axial hemorrhage alone.

In patients with moderate or severe TBI, those with extra-axial hemorrhage alone who were treated with a 2-g TXA bolus within 2 hours of injury had reduced mortality and improved neurologic outcomes vs patients with combined extra-axial and intra-axial hemorrhage. As this observation remains preliminary and may be due to the higher injury burden associated with mixed hematoma types, we continue to recommend a 2-g IV TXA bolus within 2 hours of injury in all patients with moderate or severe TBI and ICH.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives [^63a767eb]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Low fibrinogen levels (< 1.5 g.l ‐1) are also common in patients who have suffered trauma and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. The CRYOSTAT‐2 trial randomly allocated 1604 patients to standard care, which was the local major haemorrhage protocol, or early and empirical high‐dose cryoprecipitate (three pools of cryoprecipitate, equivalence to 6 g of fibrinogen) within 90 min of randomisation and 3 h of injury. The authors found no evidence of an effect on the primary outcome of all‐cause mortality at 28 days. In a prespecified subgroup analysis, 28‐day mortality was higher in patients with penetrating trauma who were allocated to the cryoprecipitate (16.2% vs. 10.0%, odds ratio (95%CI) 1.74 (1.20–2.51), p = 0.006) but the underlying mechanisms of this finding are unclear. The use of tranexamic acid, administered within 3 h of injury, reduces mortality in patients who are bleeding after trauma and in those with mild‐to‐moderate brain traumatic brain injury. Gruen et al. recently reported the results of a large RCT, in advanced trauma systems, evaluating the safety and efficacy of prehospital tranexamic acid in patients with severe trauma who were at risk of trauma‐induced coagulopathy. The authors observed a lower 28‐day mortality rate in patients who received tranexamic acid, but no difference in the primary outcome of survival with a favourable functional outcome at 6 months.

### Tranexamic acid for traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c00c1797]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid (TXA) has demonstrated clinical benefit in trauma patients with severe bleeding, but its effectiveness in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is unclear. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the following research question: In ED patients with or at risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) secondary to TBI, does TXA compared to placebo improve patients' outcomes?

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and other databases were searched for randomized controlled trial (RCT) or quasi-RCT studies that compared the effect of TXA to placebo on outcomes of TBI patients. The main outcomes of interest included mortality, neurologic function, hematoma expansion, and adverse effects. We used "Grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations" to assess the quality of trials. Two authors independently abstracted data using a data collection form. Results from studies were pooled when appropriate.

Results

Of 1030 references identified through the search, 2 high-quality RCTs met inclusion criteria. The effect of TXA on mortality had a pooled relative risk of 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41–1.02); on unfavorable functional status, a relative risk of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.59–1.02); and on ICH progression, a relative risk of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.58–0.98). No serious adverse effects (such as thromboembolic events) associated with TXA group were reported in the included trials.

Conclusion

Pooled results from the 2 RCTs demonstrated statistically significant reduction in ICH progression with TXA and a nonstatistically significant improvement of clinical outcomes in ED patients with TBI. Further evidence is required to support its routine use in patients with TBI.

Meta-analysis of 24-Hour Mortality Data

Data for the meta-analysis of 24-hour mortality was not pooled owing to significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 85%; P < .001). All included studies except 1 reported mortality rates. Twenty-one studies, had reported lower mortality and 9 studies, had reported higher mortality for tranexamic acid treatment. A common quantitative measure would be misleading because the risk ratios (RRs) varied from 0.11 (95% CI, 0.01–0.80) to 3.38 (95% CI, 2.41–4.74). A sensitivity analysis of observational studies excluding studies with a high risk of bias due to confounding was performed, but tranexamic acid treatment with low heterogeneity was not associated with a survival advantage (RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.45–1.01]; I² = 0%; 95% PI, 0.42–1.07). A sensitivity analysis of RCTs and subgroup analyses would not have been useful because each would have had included fewer than 5 studies.

Meta-analysis of 1-Month Mortality Data

Data for the meta-analysis of 1-month mortality was associated with a 17% decrease in mortality for tranexamic acid, with a pooled RR estimate of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.71–0.97) and a moderate heterogeneity (I 2 = 35%; 95% PI, 0.55–1.27) (Figure 2). This was confirmed by a sensitivity analysis of RCTs with no heterogeneity (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87–0.97]; I² = 0%; 95% PI, 0.87–0.97). The sensitivity analysis of observational studies excluding studies at high risk for confounding bias was not associated with greater survival benefits compared with the RCT analysis (RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.53–1.00]), and heterogeneity was moderate (I 2 = 49%; 95% PI, 0.34–1.55).

### Effect of tranexamic acid on mortality in patients with traumatic bleeding: prespecified analysis of data from randomised controlled trial [^a033bd6a]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

We also used the prognostic model to estimate the number and proportion of deaths at different levels of baseline risk in UK trauma patients using data from the UK Trauma Audit and Research Network. This analysis was conducted to assess the distribution of risk of death in a representative trauma population. The network dataset includes data from 60% of hospitals receiving trauma patients in England and Wales. Data are collected on patients who meet any of the following criteria: death from injury at any point during admission, hospital stay longer than three days, requirement for intensive or high dependency care, requirement for transfer between hospitals for specialist care. For these analyses, we included patients presenting between 2000 and 2008 to hospitals participating in the UK Trauma Audit and Research Network with an estimated blood loss of at least 20% on the basis that these patients can be considered to have severe haemorrhage. Estimated blood loss was calculated in patients in the network by allocating an estimated percentage of total volume of blood lost for each injury code in the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) dictionary by blinded, then consensus, agreement from two emergency physicians, as described in detail elsewhere. Finally, for each patient we used the prognostic model described above to estimate the predicted risk of death and then estimated the proportion of premature deaths averted by applying the odds ratio from the CRASH-2 trial to each of the risk strata.

Results

Table 1shows the characteristics of patients in the CRASH-2 trial and the UK Trauma Audit and Research Network according to risk of death at baseline. Patients with a higher baseline risk were older, had a lower systolic blood pressure, had a lower score on the Glasgow coma scale, had a higher heart and respiratory rate, and were more likely to have trauma from a blunt injury than patients with a lower risk. Most CRASH-2 trial patients (97%) were from middle income countries, and this frequency distribution was similar for all the risk strata.

Figure 1shows the effect of tranexamic acid on all cause mortality by risk of death at baseline. In each stratum of baseline risk, there were fewer deaths among patients treated with tranexamic acid, although in the lowest risk strata, the effect was not significant. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the effect of tranexamic acid on all cause mortality (P = 0.96 for interaction).

Figures 2and 3show the effect of tranexamic acid on death from bleeding and on fatal and non-fatal thrombotic events by baseline risk of death. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the effect of tranexamic acid on deaths from bleeding (P = 0.98) or on thrombotic events (P = 0.74). There was no significant reduction in all other causes of death combined (that is, non-bleeding deaths) (odds ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.09) and no evidence of heterogeneity according to baseline risk (P = 0.99).

### Effect of tranexamic acid in traumatic brain injury: a nested randomised, placebo controlled trial (CRASH-2 intracranial bleeding study) [^ac503ee4]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

The larger effect on haematoma growth observed in surgical patients is consistent with the evidence of effectiveness of antifibrinolytic agents in elective surgery, for which antifibrinolytic agents have been shown to reduce blood loss.

We found a reduction in new focal cerebral ischaemic lesions in the patients allocated tranexamic acid. However, the overall incidence of these lesions was low, and it is possible that the observed difference between the groups may have arisen by chance alone. Nevertheless, it is plausible that if tranexamic acid reduces haemorrhage growth then this could reduce the local pressure on arteries. Any reduction in intracranial pressure might also reduce the risk of ischaemia. Given that tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce mortality from bleeding, it is also possible that patients allocated to tranexamic acid may have had a more stable circulation and that this may have accounted for the observed reduction in ischaemic lesions. Our findings differ from those reported in a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of tranexamic acid in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, which found that tranexamic acid reduced the rate of re-bleeding but increased cerebral ischaemia. However, the doses of tranexamic acid used in these trials were larger and more prolonged than in our study. Furthermore, the risk and mechanism of cerebral ischaemia is different in the two conditions.

Regarding the clinical outcomes, although the results were not statistically significant, we found a trend towards a reduction in mortality, without any evidence of increase in dependency among survivors.

When we assessed the effect of tranexamic acid on a composite outcome that considered poor computed tomography and clinical outcomes we found a statistically significant reduction. Importantly, this composite outcome was pre-specified, and the effect on all the outcomes included in the composite outcome showed the same direction towards benefit.

### Understanding the neuroprotective effect of tranexamic acid: an exploratory analysis of the CRASH-3 randomised trial [^12a5431f]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

We conducted the CRASH-3 trial because there was reason to believe that tranexamic acid could reduce bleeding-related head injury deaths. Increased fibrinolysis is common in TBI patients and worsens intracranial bleeding. The CRASH-2 trial in 20,211 polytrauma patients (extra-cranial and intra-cranial injury) with significant bleeding found that tranexamic acid reduces mortality, primarily by reducing bleeding deaths on the day of the injury. Because the CRASH-2 trial was large, this early benefit was still apparent at 28 days, although 'diluted' by non-bleeding deaths. The CRASH-3 trial was smaller than the CRASH-2 trial, and so despite the higher mortality rate, there were fewer deaths and less statistical power to detect the diluted effect on all-cause mortality at 28 days. A non-significant difference between two groups in a randomised trial can be real difference that is not significant due to a lack of power, or it can be a difference that has occurred by chance. In this case (Table 1), there is a large reduction in deaths within 24 h with tranexamic acid (RR = 0.74) that is highly statistically significant and consistent with the expected biological effects of tranexamic acid but no apparent reduction in deaths beyond 24 h (RR = 0.98). Because the relative risk at 28 days is a weighted average of these effects, the modest reduction in death at 28 days (RR = 0.93) is not statistically significant. We believe the reduction in deaths at 28 days is a real reduction that is not significant due to a lack of statistical power. This interpretation is consistent with biology (intracranial bleeding occurs early, and there is little or no tranexamic acid in the body beyond 24 h) and as shown in the next paragraph is mathematically consistent with dilution. The reduction in deaths at 28 days in the CRASH-3 trial is similar to that seen in the larger (and more powerful) CRASH-2 trial, and when the results are pooled, the reduction in deaths at 28 days with tranexamic acid is highly significant. However, we accept that can never rule out chance as a potential explanation.

### Effect of tranexamic acid in traumatic brain injury: a nested randomised, placebo controlled trial (CRASH-2 intracranial bleeding study) [^6a4b9d06]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective To assess the effect of tranexamic acid (which reduces bleeding in surgical patients and reduces mortality due to bleeding in trauma patients) on intracranial haemorrhage in patients with traumatic brain injury.

Methods A nested, randomised, placebo controlled trial. All investigators were masked to treatment allocation. All analyses were by intention to treat.

Patients 270 adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant extracranial bleeding within 8 hours of injury, who also had traumatic brain injury.

Interventions Patients randomly allocated to tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 minutes, then infusion of 1 g over 8 hours) or matching placebo.

Main outcome measures Intracranial haemorrhage growth (measured by computed tomography) between hospital admission and then 24–48 hours later, with adjustment for Glasgow coma score, age, time from injury to the scans, and initial haemorrhage volume.

Results Of the 133 patients allocated to tranexamic acid and 137 allocated to placebo, 123 (92%) and 126 (92%) respectively provided information on the primary outcome. All patients provided information on clinical outcomes. The mean total haemorrhage growth was 5.9 mL (SD 26.8) and 8.1 mL (SD 29.2) in the tranexamic acid and placebo groups respectively (adjusted difference –3.8 mL (95% confidence interval −11.5 to 3.9)). New focal cerebral ischaemic lesions occurred in 6 (5%) patients in the tranexamic acid group versus 12 (9%) in the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio 0.51 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 1.44)). There were 14 (11%) deaths in the tranexamic acid group and 24 (18%) in the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio 0.47 (0.21 to 1.04)).

Conclusions This trial shows that neither moderate benefits nor moderate harmful effects of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic brain injury can be excluded. However, the analysis provides grounds for further clinical trials evaluating the effect of tranexamic acid in this population.

Trial registration ISRCTN86750102.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^67932efc]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Lysine analogues vs placebo — large RCT data support tranexamic acid (TXA) efficacy with dosing change mid-trial and provide safety signals. In a 2017 randomized trial of 4631 patients, TXA 100 mg/kg after induction (reduced to 50 mg/kg after 1392 patients) decreased the need for RBCs and any blood product (both P < .001), yielded a number needed to treat of 6 for reducing transfusion of 1 unit, and lowered reexploration (4.1% vs 2.8%; RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32–0.75; P = 0.001), without significant benefit for 30-day mortality or thromboembolic events, while raising questions about an association with seizures.

### Tranexamic acid for traumatic injury in the emergency setting: a systematic review and bias-adjusted meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^adf9f405]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Traumatic injury causes a significant number of deaths due to bleeding. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, can reduce bleeding in traumatic injuries and potentially enhance outcomes. Previous reviews suggested potential TXA benefits but did not consider the latest trials.

Methods

A systematic review and bias-adjusted meta-analysis were performed to assess TXA's effectiveness in emergency traumatic injury settings by pooling estimates from randomized controlled trials. Researchers searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central for randomized controlled trials comparing TXA's effects to a placebo in emergency trauma cases. The primary endpoint was 1-month mortality. The methodological quality of the trials underwent assessment using the MASTER scale, and the meta-analysis applied the quality-effects method to adjust for methodological quality.

Results

Seven randomized controlled trials met the set criteria. This meta-analysis indicated an 11% decrease in the death risk at 1 month after TXA use (odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84 to 0.95) with a number needed to treat of 61 to avoid 1 additional death. The meta-analysis also revealed reduced 24-hour mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88) for TXA. No compelling evidence of increased vascular occlusive events emerged (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.27). Subgroup analyses highlighted TXA's effectiveness in general trauma versus traumatic brain injury and survival advantages when administered out-of-hospital versus inhospital.

Conclusions

This synthesis demonstrates that TXA use for trauma in emergencies leads to a reduction in 1-month mortality, with no significant evidence of problematic vascular occlusive events. Administering TXA in the out-of-hospital setting is associated with reduced mortality compared to inhospital administration, and less mortality with TXA in systemic trauma is noted compared with traumatic brain injury specifically.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on mortality in patients with traumatic bleeding: prespecified analysis of data from randomised controlled trial [^db6de5df]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Potential biological mechanisms

Tranexamic acid reduces the risk of death from haemorrhage and seems to reduce the risk of arterial thrombotic events. It is possible that by reducing bleeding, tranexamic acid reduces myocardial oxygen demand and increases oxygen supply. It is also possible that the reduction in arterial thrombotic events could be mediated through an anti-inflammatory effect of tranexamic acid.

Implications for patients

These results have important implications for the care of trauma patients. Firstly, they suggest that tranexamic acid can safely be used in all trauma patients with or at risk of severe bleeding, as in the inclusion criteria used in the CRASH-2 trial, and not just in the most severely injured. Secondly, the observed reduction in the risk of arterial events with tranexamic acid suggests that the absolute benefits from administration of tranexamic acid are likely to be greatest in older trauma patients, who at any given level of severity of injury have a higher baseline risk of death from haemorrhage and thrombotic events. Clinical concern about an increased risk of ischaemic cardiac events might be a reason to give rather than to withhold tranexamic acid. It is worth noting that trials of tranexamic acid in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, a group at high risk of cardiac events, provide no evidence of any increased risk. We acknowledge that estimating the risk of severe bleeding is a challenging ongoing process that uses not only physiological variables but other variables such as laboratory measurements and response to treatments. Physicians will use all this information and their clinical judgment when deciding whether to use tranexamic acid. In situations of uncertainty, however, physicians can use the prognostic model to support the decision making process and should certainly consider administering tranexamic acid to patients with a risk of death higher than 5%.

### Effect of early tranexamic acid administration on mortality, hysterectomy, and other morbidities in women with post-partum haemorrhage (WOMAN): an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^6aab80af]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study WOMAN was published by WOMAN Trial Collaborators. and colleagues in 2017 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Postpartum hemorrhage. In the WOMAN study, the trial question was: what is the effect of early tranexamic acid administration in patients with postpartum hemorrhage? In the WOMAN study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the WOMAN study, the population was: 20060 female patients. The inclusion criteria were female patients ≥ 16 years with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal birth or C-section. The key exclusion criteria were consideration of a clear indication or contraindication for tranexamic acid by the responsible clinician. In the WOMAN study, the interventions were: n = 10051 tranexamic acid (an intravenous dose of 1 g plus usual care) n = 10009 placebo (matching placebo plus usual care). In the WOMAN study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death due to bleeding (1.5% vs. 1.9%; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1). In the WOMAN study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from all causes or hysterectomy at day 42 (5.3% vs. 5.6%; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.09) Significant decrease in death due to bleeding in women given treatment within 3 hours of giving birth (1.2% vs. 1.7%; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91) No significant difference in hysterectomy (3.6% vs. 3.5%; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.07). In the WOMAN study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events including thromboembolic events. significant differences in use of brace sutures (3.0% vs. 2.5%), laparotomy for bleeding (0.8% vs. 1.3%). In the WOMAN study, the conclusion was: in female patients ≥ 16 years with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal birth or C-section, tranexamic acid was superior to placebo with respect to death due to bleeding.

### Effect of early tranexamic acid administration on mortality, hysterectomy, and other morbidities in women with post-partum haemorrhage (WOMAN): an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^5d10ac19]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The dilution of the effect of tranexamic acid arising from interventions that were initiated prior to receipt of the trial treatment is likely to apply to other surgical interventions and blood transfusion. Considering that there may only be a few hours from onset of primary post-partum haemorrhage to maternal death, it is not surprising that other interventions were given concurrently with the trial treatment. Given the urgency, clinicians cannot wait and see if the trial treatment has an effect before giving other treatments, not least because half of the women received placebo. The only outcome that invariably follows randomisation is death. This may explain why in this trial, and in the CRASH-2 trial of tranexamic acid in significant traumatic bleeding, there was a reduction in death due to bleeding with tranexamic acid despite no reduction in transfusion.

The WOMAN trial began before the results of the CRASH-2 trial of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients were available. The CRASH-2 trial recruited 20 211 adults with traumatic bleeding and showed that tranexamic acid reduces death due to bleeding and all-cause mortality with no increase in vascular occlusive events. There was strong evidence of a time to treatment interaction. In patients treated within 3 h of injury, tranexamic acid reduced death due to bleeding by around one third, but when given after 3 h, it seemed to increase the risk. Early activation of fibrinolysis is common after trauma and is associated with increased mortality. Because similar temporal changes in fibrinolysis have been observed after childbirth, we expected that early treatment with tranexamic acid would also be more effective after post-partum haemorrhage and planned to set the WOMAN trial results in the context of all available clinical data on the time to treatment interaction. Bearing in mind that even a large trial such as ours would have limited power to detect a time to treatment interaction for death due to bleeding, setting the trial results in the context of the totality of the available evidence seemed to be the most sensible approach. Although there are on-going trials of tranexamic acid in life threatening bleeding, the CRASH-2 trial is the only trial to date that provides such evidence. Figure 5 shows the results of the WOMAN trial in the context of the CRASH-2 results. There is a strong suggestion that early treatment is most effective and late treatment is unlikely to be beneficial.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^4db9677c]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Main results of randomized clinical trials assessing the use of tranexamic acid for acute bleeding.

TXA has also been extensively studied in the setting of traumatic brain injury, a leading cause of trauma deaths often associated with alterations of hemostasis with the features of hyperfibrinolysis. Meta-analysis of two randomized trials examining the effect of TXA on outcomes following traumatic brain injury showed a significant reduction in the progression of intracranial hemorrhage. The results of the CRASH-3 trial were published recently. This trial included 12,737 patients who had isolated acute traumatic brain injury (which occurred within 3 h of random assignment to receive TXA (loading dose 1 g over 10 minutes, then infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or placebo. TXA failed to reduce the primary endpoint, i.e. the risk of head injury-related death. However, after the exclusion of patients too severe to be saved, namely those with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 or unreactive bilateral pupils at baseline, TXA reduced the risk of head injury-related deaths compared to placebo (12.5% vs. 14.0%; RR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00). In particular, TXA decreased the risk of injury-related deaths in patients with mild-to-moderate head injury (RR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.64–0.95) but not in those with severe head injury (Table 1). As in CRASH-2, early treatment was more effective than more delayed treatment in patients with mild and moderate head injury (P = 0.005), with a 10% decrease in treatment effectiveness for every 20 min delay. The risk of vascular occlusive events was similar in the TXA and placebo groups. Notably, the CRASH-3 trial was the first RCT to show that a drug has neuroprotective properties for patients with traumatic brain injury and even reduced mortality. Finally, a very recently published meta-analysis of six RCT on the effect of TXA, compared with placebo, on traumatic brain injury showed that this medication was associated with a reduced mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85–0.97; P = 0.0004).

### Effect of tranexamic acid in traumatic brain injury: a nested randomised, placebo controlled trial (CRASH-2 intracranial bleeding study) [^d0f404cc]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Implications of results

The CRASH-2 trial has shown reliably that early administration of tranexamic acid in trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding reduces the risk of all cause mortality. As a consequence of this trial, tranexamic acid has been incorporated into trauma treatment protocols worldwide. Many patients with traumatic haemorrhage also have traumatic brain injury, and concerns about the risk of cerebral ischaemia may affect decisions whether to give tranexamic acid to these patients. The results presented here are the only available evidence to inform doctors about the effect of tranexamic acid on brain ischaemic lesions in patients with traumatic haemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, and, although imprecise, the results should give some reassurance about the safety of tranexamic acid in such patients.

Our results also have important research implications. In theory, if tranexamic acid reduces intracranial haemorrhage after traumatic brain injury without increasing the risk of ischaemic lesions, it could substantially improve patient outcomes. Until now, however, no trial has evaluated the effect of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic brain injury. Our results suggest it is probable that, in such patients, the benefits of tranexamic acid administration would outweigh the risks. If such an inexpensive and widely practicable treatment were found to improve patient outcomes after traumatic intracranial haemorrhage this would have major implications for clinical care. The CRASH-3 trial will determine reliably the effectiveness of the early administration of a short course of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic brain injury.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid is associated with a survival benefit without an increase in complications: results of two harmonized randomized clinical trials [^f1415d74]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recent randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that prehospital tranexamic acid (TXA) administration following injury is safe and improves survival. However, the effect of prehospital TXA on adverse events, transfusion requirements, and any dose-response relationships require further elucidation.

Methods

A secondary analysis was performed using harmonized data from two large, double-blinded, randomized prehospital TXA trials. Outcomes, including 28-day mortality, pertinent adverse events, and 24-hour red cell transfusion requirements, were compared between TXA and placebo groups. Regression analyses were used to determine the independent associations of TXA after adjusting for study enrollment, injury characteristics, and shock severity across a broad spectrum of injured patients. Dose-response relationships were similarly characterized based upon grams of prehospital TXA administered.

Results

A total of 1,744 patients had data available for secondary analysis and were included in the current harmonized secondary analysis. The study cohort had an overall mortality of 11.2% and a median Injury Severity Score of 16 (interquartile range, 5–26). Tranexamic acid was independently associated with a lower risk of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54–0.96; p = 0.03). Prehospital TXA also demonstrated an independent 22% lower risk of mortality for every gram of prehospital TXA administered (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63–0.96; p = 0.02). Multivariable linear regression verified that patients who received TXA were independently associated with lower 24-hour red cell transfusion requirements (β = - 0.31; 95% CI, -0.61 to -0.01; p = 0.04) with a dose-response relationship (β = - 0.24; 95% CI, -0.45 to -0.02; p = 0.03). There was no independent association of prehospital TXA administration on thromboembolism, seizure, or stroke.

Conclusion

In this secondary analysis of harmonized data from two large randomized interventional trials, prehospital TXA administration across a broad spectrum of injured patients is safe. Prehospital TXA is associated with a significant 28-day survival benefit and lower red cell transfusion requirements at 24 hours and demonstrates a dose-response relationship.

### Effect of tranexamic acid in traumatic brain injury: a nested randomised, placebo controlled trial (CRASH-2 intracranial bleeding study) [^1659a463]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of tranexamic acid (which reduces bleeding in surgical patients and reduces mortality due to bleeding in trauma patients) on intracranial haemorrhage in patients with traumatic brain injury.

Methods

A nested, randomised, placebo controlled trial. All investigators were masked to treatment allocation. All analyses were by intention to treat. Patients 270 adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant extracranial bleeding within 8 hours of injury, who also had traumatic brain injury.

Interventions

Patients randomly allocated to tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 minutes, then infusion of 1 g over 8 hours) or matching placebo.

Main Outcome Measures

Intracranial haemorrhage growth (measured by computed tomography) between hospital admission and then 24–48 hours later, with adjustment for Glasgow coma score, age, time from injury to the scans, and initial haemorrhage volume.

Results

Of the 133 patients allocated to tranexamic acid and 137 allocated to placebo, 123 (92%) and 126 (92%) respectively provided information on the primary outcome. All patients provided information on clinical outcomes. The mean total haemorrhage growth was 5.9 mL (SD 26.8) and 8.1 mL (SD 29.2) in the tranexamic acid and placebo groups respectively (adjusted difference -3.8 mL (95% confidence interval -11.5 to 3.9)). New focal cerebral ischaemic lesions occurred in 6 (5%) patients in the tranexamic acid group versus 12 (9%) in the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio 0.51 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 1.44)). There were 14 (11%) deaths in the tranexamic acid group and 24 (18%) in the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio 0.47 (0.21 to 1.04)).

Conclusions

This trial shows that neither moderate benefits nor moderate harmful effects of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic brain injury can be excluded. However, the analysis provides grounds for further clinical trials evaluating the effect of tranexamic acid in this population. Trial registration ISRCTN86750102.

### Mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients: an exploratory analysis of data from the CRASH-2 trial [^ab4b174e]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The strength of this analysis is that it is based on data from a randomised controlled trial with over 20,000 patients in which there were 3,076 deaths. As a result, this study has considerable statistical power to examine the temporal effects of TXA administration. Nevertheless, because a large proportion of the deaths occurred in the first 48 h after injury, the subsequent HR are imprecise with wide confidence intervals. A further weakness is that these analyses were not pre-specified in the trial protocol with the attendant risk that random patterns in the data may have been over interpreted. These results should therefore be interpreted cautiously and in the context of other relevant research.

The hypothesis that TXA has beneficial mechanisms other than haemostasis was suggested by the MATTERS investigators on the basis that there was 'no difference in mortality between the TXA and no TXA groups until the 48-hour pointʼ. However, the MATTERS data show a 23% relative reduction in all-cause mortality at 24 h (9.6% versus 12.4%; P = 0.2). Although this reduction was not statistically significant, it is not possible from these data to exclude a possible effect on mortality; rather, only that such a statistically significant effect was not observed. With much larger patient numbers, we found a similar reduction in early mortality with TXA that was highly statistically significant.

The lack of any apparent effect of TXA administration on the receipt of blood transfusion has also contributed to the debate about its mechanism of action. However, there are several possible reasons why TXA did not reduce the receipt of blood transfusion in the CRASH-2 trial. First, much of the blood loss in trauma patients occurs before hospital admission and therefore before TXA administration. Some of the transfusions that patients received in hospital would have been in response to this early bleeding and could not have been influenced by TXA. Second, because TXA reduced mortality, more TXA-treated patients had the opportunity to be transfused. Third, any effect of TXA on blood transfusion may have been diluted by transfusions given later during the hospital stay, for example transfusions given during orthopaedic surgery. Finally, accurate estimation of blood loss is difficult in trauma patients and so the amount of blood transfused might not indicate the amount of blood lost.

### Evaluating the tactical combat casualty care principles in civilian and military settings: systematic review, knowledge gap analysis and recommendations for future research [^61fd9917]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

In the military prehospital setting, blood transfusion has been widely studied leading to the adoption of blood product transfusion into civilian prehospital care. Through the literature identified in this review, studies assessing blood transfusion were of higher quality, though some reported conflicting results. Studies assessing mortality in this population are typically non-randomized and not powered to detect differences in meaningful clinical outcomes. However, it is reasonable to acknowledge the challenges associated with prehospital research in resuscitation of bleeding trauma patients, such as proper classification and enrollment of participants and proper randomization. Thus, blood product transfusion in the treatment of prehospital combat casualties and civilian trauma warrants continuing investigation in a variety of prehospital environments to generate robust evidence.

Lastly, the safety and efficacy of TXA has been widely investigated in the perioperative environment and other clinical settings after the release of the Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Hemorrhage (CRASH)-2 study. Overall, studies have demonstrated that TXA use is safe and is associated with both decreased requirements for allogeneic blood product transfusion and improvement of coagulation profiles. However, in prehospital environments, there is still room to improve evidence. The CRASH-3 study, a multicenter RCT conducted in patients with isolated TBI, assessed the use of TXA compared with placebo on hospital arrival. The study found no difference in TBI-related death, though identified increased efficacy with earlier treatment in those with mild to moderate TBI. Additionally, the risk of vascular occlusive events and seizures was similar between groups. A second study assessing patients with isolated brain injury given out-of-hospital TXA, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) TXA trial, reported no difference in the neurofunctional outcome at 6 months after injury, in the 28-day mortality between groups, and in the progression of intracranial hemorrhage receiving TXA compared with the placebo group. Third, the recently published Study of Tranexamic Acid During Air Medical and Ground Prehospital Transport (STAAMP) trial, a further multicenter RCT conducted in prehospital trauma patients at risk of hemorrhage, reported no difference in 30-day mortality rates, 6 and 24-hour blood and blood component transfusion requirements, and in the incidence of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis in the group receiving prehospital TXA administration compared with placebo. However, in patients who received prehospital TXA administration within 1 hour of injury and in those with evidence of prehospital severe shock, post hoc subgroup analysis suggested that prehospital TXA is associated with lower 30-day mortality. Therefore, the CRASH-3 study, the ROC TXA trial, and the STAAMP trial have reported important differences and findings that warrant consideration and further investigation in studies with improved patient selection methods to further explore the efficacy of TXA in important clinical outcomes.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^f7d92d6b]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Two RCTs examined pre-hospital TXA, using varying drug dosing. In a RCT investigating patients with TBI, 966 patients (GCS < 12) were treated with TXA or placebo using an out-of-hospital bolus and an in-hospital infusion regimen. Two different doses of TXA were used: 1 g bolus and 1 g infusion, or 2 g bolus and placebo infusion. No difference was reported in the primary endpoint, the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score > 4 at 6 months, 65% combined TXA group vs. 62%, placebo. In a general trauma RCT (n = 927), pre-hospital TXA (1 g over 10 min in 100 mL saline) was compared with matched placebo, given within 2 h of injury. Mortality at 30 days was 9.9% with placebo versus 8.1% with TXA (no difference). Subsequent in-hospital dosing for the TXA arm followed three routes: no additional TXA, 1 g infusion, 1 g bolus followed by a 1 g infusion, with 30-day mortality rates of 9.3%, 7.8%, 7.3%, respectively (10% for placebo only). Participants administered TXA within 1 h of injury and a shock index < 0.9, had a 65% lower likelihood of 30-day mortality (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.19–0.65), as well as a lower incidence of multiorgan failure and 24 h transfusion requirements compared with those with delayed (> 1 h from injury) TXA treatment.

There have been questions raised about whether TXA should be administered only to those patients with evidence of hyperfibrinolysis, following concerns that some patients are in a state of fibrinolytic shutdown (TEG LY30 < 0.9%). In the pre-hospital TBI RCT described above, 700 of the 966-strong cohort had TEG samples analysed at 0 and 6 h. There was an equal spread of fibrinolytic TEG phenotypes, in particular shutdown across the 3 groups, with no increased incidence in those treated with TXA. VEM measures did not change over 6 h, despite changes to CCT measures of lysis. This finding led the authors to suggest that TEG may be poorly sensitive to fibrinolysis.

### Efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in acute traumatic brain injury: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^c99b1f89]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tranexamic acid (TXA) holds a pivotal role in the therapeutic approach to traumatic conditions. Nevertheless, its precise influence on diminishing mortality and limiting the progression of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) during the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains indeterminate.

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched for randomized controlled trials that compared TXA and a placebo in adults with TBI up to September 31, 2023. Two authors independently abstracted the data and assessed the quality of evidence. Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed to assess outcomes with low heterogenety.

Results

Our search strategy yielded 11,299 patients from 11 studies. The result showed that TXA had no effect on mortality (RR 0.93 [0.86, 1.00], p = 0.06; I 2: 0%, p = 0.79), poor clinical outcomes (RR 0.92 [0.78, 1.09], p = 0.34; I 2: 0%, p = 0.40), adverse events (RR 0.94 [0.83, 1.07], p = 0.34; I 2: 48%, p = 0.10), vascular occlusive events (RR 0.85 [0.68, 1.06], p = 0.16; I 2: 32%, p = 0.22), pulmonary embolism (RR 0.76 [0.47, 1.22], p = 0.26; I 2: 0%, p = 0.83), seizure (RR 1.11 [0.92, 1.35], p = 0.27; I 2: 0%, p = 0.49) and hemorrhagic complications (RR 0.78 [0.55, 1.09], p = 0.14; I 2: 0%, p = 0.42). TXA might reduce the rate of hemorrhagic expansion (RR 0.83 [0.70, 0.99], p = 0.03; I 2: 18%, p = 0.29) and mean hemorrhage volume (SMD -0.39 [-0.60, -0.18], p < 0.001; I 2: 44%, p = 0.13). When the time interval from symptom onset to treatment was < 3 h, TXA reduced mean hemorrhage volume (SMD -0.51 [-0.81, -0.20], p = 0.001; I 2: 0%, p = 0.94).

Conclusions

TXA did not elevate the risk of adverse event, however, the lack of reduction in mortality and the poor clinical outcomes constrain the value of clinical application. Early administration of TXA (within 3 h) may significantly decrease the likelihood of ICH growth in patients with TBI.

### Use of tranexamic acid in trauma surgical specialties: a narrative review [^b110c554]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute trauma is a leading cause of death in adults worldwide, with trauma-associated hemorrhage being a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in these patients. In addition, the concurrent development of coagulopathy secondary to trauma can further exacerbate hemorrhage due to hyperfibrinolysis, with some studies showing a mortality rate as high as 70–100% in traumatized patients in a hyperfibrinolytic state. Given these factors, there is increasing interest in modalities to reduce hemorrhage in trauma patients to decrease morbidity and improve patient survival.

In 2010, the landmark Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Hemorrhage (CRASH)-2 trial demonstrated that empiric administration of tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic, resulted in a 1.5% absolute reduction in 28-day mortality among 20,211 patients with or at risk of significant bleeding. Since then, numerous subsequent studies have similarly found that TXA is associated with decreased mortality and risk of bleeding after trauma. However, several more recent studies have found no significant reduction in mortality rates after TXA administration in the pre-hospital setting or in trauma patients with hyperfibrinolysis.

Given these conflicting findings, this review seeks to summarize the existing body of evidence regarding the efficacy, safety, and cost of TXA across multiple trauma contexts including in-hospital administration, pre-hospital administration, orthopaedic/spine trauma, and neurological trauma.

### Mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients: an exploratory analysis of data from the CRASH-2 trial [^73b85d04]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The CRASH-2 trial has shown that administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) to bleeding trauma patients who are within 3 hours of injury, significantly reduces death due to bleeding (risk ratio (RR) = 0.72, 95% CI 0.63, 0.83) and all-cause mortality, without increasing the risk of vascular occlusive events. Since the publication of these results, there has been debate about the mechanism of action of TXA in trauma patients. Several authors, observing that plasmin is pro-inflammatory, suggest that TXA increases survival by reducing inflammation. On the basis of results from an observational study of TXA administration in combat casualties, the investigators of the military application of TXA in trauma emergency resuscitation study (MATTERS) argued that the timing of the survival benefit with TXA suggests a mechanism other than haemostasis and hypothesised that TXA may attenuate the inflammatory response. Similarly, Neapolitano et al. noting the lack of a statistically significant difference in blood transfusion between TXA and placebo groups state that 'it remains unclear whether the mortality benefit from TXA is from reversal of fibrinolysis or whether an inflammatory or immune modulation is the underlying mechanismʼ. An expert committee convened by the US Department of Defense called for more research into the mechanism of action of TXA in trauma patients.

In response to these concerns, we conducted further analyses of the CRASH-2 trial data to examine the timing of the effect of TXA on mortality. It is generally accepted that deaths due to bleeding occur soon after the bleeding event. The Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC), which was established to provide a standard definition of bleeding for use in clinical trials, noted that 'the time interval from the bleeding event to the death should be considered with respect to likely causalityʼ, although they do not specify a particular interval. The MATTERS investigators argued that beyond 48 h, bleeding is less likely to be the primary cause of death. We hypothesised that if TXA improves survival by reducing bleeding, its effect should be greatest on the day of the injury. On the other hand, if it improves survival by reducing inflammation its effect should be most apparent in subsequent days.

### Effect of early tranexamic acid administration on mortality, hysterectomy, and other morbidities in women with post-partum haemorrhage (WOMAN): an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^4790ce9b]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The primary endpoint of death from all causes or hysterectomy within 42 days of giving birth occurred in 1080 women. Of these, 371 (34%) women died without undergoing a hysterectomy, 112 (10%) died after hysterectomy, and 597 (55%) survived after hysterectomy. The risk of death from all causes or hysterectomy was not reduced with tranexamic acid (534 [5.3%] tranexamic acid group vs 546 [5.6%] placebo group, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87–1.09; p = 0.65). After adjusting for baseline risk, the risk ratio for death from all causes or hysterectomy was 0.98 (95% CI 0.87–1.10; p = 0.75). There was no significant heterogeneity in the effect of tranexamic acid by time to treatment, type of birth or cause of bleeding (table 3).

### Optimal dose of tranexamic acid in traumatic brain injury: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^6e6aefd4]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been used to treat traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, no definitive conclusions have been drawn regarding its effectiveness or dosage. This study evaluated the optimal TXA dose for treating TBI using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

Methods

Five databases were searched for peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from inception to May 2024. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) RCTs, (2) patients older than 1 month with TBI, (3) interventions of TXA and control, (4) primary outcomes of mortality and poor neurological outcomes and secondary outcomes of vascular occlusive events, and (5) full-text peer-reviewed articles. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. Frequency-based NMA was performed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation working-group approach.

Results

We included 10 RCTs comprising 11,237 patients with TBI. Placebo showed higher mortality compared with that of a 2-g bolus of TXA (risk ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–2.17). Higher mortality was observed with a 1-g bolus of TXA followed by 1-g maintenance TXA compared with that of a 2-g bolus of TXA (risk ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–2.03). No significant differences in poor neurological outcomes or vascular occlusive events were observed between the treatment groups.

Conclusion

Placebo and a 1-g bolus followed by 1-g maintenance TXA were associated with higher mortality rates than those of a 2-g bolus of TXA. No difference in vascular occlusive events was observed with either treatment, indicating that our NMA recommends 2 g of TXA. However, the data for the 2-g bolus of TXA were from a single study, and further research is needed to draw definitive conclusions.

### Effect of early tranexamic acid administration on mortality, hysterectomy, and other morbidities in women with post-partum haemorrhage (WOMAN): an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^85799bae]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Primary post-partum haemorrhage, usually defined as a blood loss of more than 500 mL within 24 h of giving birth, is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide, responsible for about 100 000 deaths every year. Most of the deaths occur soon after giving birth and almost all (99%) occur in low-income and middle-income countries.

Tranexamic acid reduces bleeding by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin by plasmin. Findings of a systematic review of clinical trials of tranexamic acid in surgery showed that the drug reduces blood loss by about one third. Tranexamic acid reduces death due to bleeding in patients with trauma. The CRASH-2 trial, which recruited 20 211 adults with acute traumatic bleeding, showed that tranexamic acid reduced death due to bleeding, with no apparent increase in vascular occlusive events. Planned subgroup analysis of the effect of tranexamic acid by time from injury to the start of treatment showed that early treatment is essential. In patients given treatment within 3 h of injury, tranexamic acid reduced death due to bleeding by nearly one third. However, when given after 3 h, there was no benefit. Early activation of fibrinolysis is common after trauma and is associated with increased mortality. Trauma triggers the release of tissue plasminogen activator, the enzyme that converts plasminogen to the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin.

### Tranexamic acid for intracerebral haemorrhage within 2 hours of onset: protocol of a phase II randomised placebo-controlled double-blind multicentre trial [^076adbd1]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) causes approximately 3 million deaths per year worldwide. This is a similar number of deaths to ischaemic stroke despite ischaemic stroke being twice as common. While there are a number of highly effective treatment options for ischaemic stroke, therapies for ICH remain extremely limited. Organised stroke unit care reduces mortality and dependency in ICH. Additionally, early blood pressure lowering to a target of < 140 mm Hg may improve functional outcomes, but more aggressive blood pressure lowering has not been shown to be beneficial. The role of surgical intervention remains limited and not well established.

Haematoma growth is one of the strongest predictors of morbidity and mortality after ICH and is a key therapeutic target (figure 1). Acute medical interventions that attenuate haematoma expansion have been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy. One of these, recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has consistently reduced haematoma growth in phase II and III trials, but has been associated with an increase in thromboembolic complications. The high cost of this agent also limits access in many healthcare settings. Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, is inexpensive, widely available and has an excellent safety profile. It has been shown to improve survival and outcome in haemorrhage due to acute trauma, and specifically in the setting of traumatic brain injury when administered within 3 hours. It has also been shown to reduce rebleeding following subarachnoid haemorrhage, although this has not translated to improved outcomes in this condition.

### Transforming research to improve therapies for trauma in the twenty-first century [^413cf200]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Adaptive trial design has been successfully used in the critically ill to test COVID-19 therapies. The MATIC-2 trauma trial (NCT06070350) makes use of an adaptive platform design to compare whole blood to component therapy, and TXA to placebo in children with traumatic bleeding. The use of platform trials with response adaptive randomization can improve the efficiency and economics of trauma trials and should be seriously considered instead of continuing to study one therapy at a time in a rigid manner that may not be translatable since severely injured trauma patients receive a bundle of care. Conventional trial design cannot adequately dissect the complexities of the bundle of acute trauma care, and this can only be evaluated with adaptive trial designs where Bayesian analyses allow for the incorporation of the clinical context to determine if the results are clinically and statistically significant. In addition, recent success in utilizing biorepositories from RCTs in trauma to identify specific cohorts of patients who benefit from the intervention highlight the need to pair these advances in trial design with robust sampling and repository storage for assessment of mechanisms and heterogeneity of treatment effect on important clinical outcomes.

An important point in trial design is the choice of the primary outcome. Mortality is a relevant outcome, but also the most difficult one to alter with a single intervention. In order to address the ambiguity of appropriate primary outcomes, the NIH and US Department of Defense sponsored a workshop in 2019 that developed a consensus statement for recommendations of primary outcomes for clinical trials of hemostatic agents. In patients with traumatic injury, excluding isolated traumatic brain injury and burn injury, the recommended primary outcome was 3–6-h all-cause mortality for hemostatic interventions, with robust evaluation of late safety-related outcomes such as 28 day mortality. In children with life-threatening traumatic hemorrhage, a primary outcome of death at either 6 or 24 h was recommended. For patients with intracranial hemorrhage the recommended primary outcome of trials of hemostatic agents was a global patient-centered clinical outcome scale measured between 30 and 180 days after the event.

### Ultra-early tranexamic acid after subarachnoid haemorrhage (ULTRA): a randomised controlled trial [^aea26b9a]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study ULTRA was published by René Post and colleagues in 2021 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Subarachnoid hemorrhage. In the ULTRA study, the trial question was: what is the role of ultra-early, short-term treatment with tranexamic acid in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage? In the ULTRA study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ULTRA study, the population was: 955 patients (644 female, 311 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with spontaneous CT-proven subarachnoid hemorrhage. The key exclusion criteria were no loss of consciousness after the hemorrhage, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage pattern on CT, treatment for DVT or PE, history of hypercoagulability disorder, history of severe renal failure, imminent death within 24 hours. In the ULTRA study, the interventions were: n = 480 tranexamic acid (1 g bolus, followed by continuous infusion of 1 g every 8 h, terminated immediately before aneurysm treatment, or 24 h after start of the medication, whichever came first plus standard care) n = 475 control (standard care alone). In the ULTRA study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in good clinical outcome at 6 months, mRS score of 0–3 (60% vs. 64%; aOR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.12). In the ULTRA study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant decrease in excellent clinical outcome, mRS score of 0–2 (48% vs. 56%; OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.96) No significant difference in death from all causes at 30 days (22% vs. 22%; OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.33) No significant difference in death from all causes at 6 months (27% vs. 24%; OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.54). In the ULTRA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in any serious adverse events. significant difference in all rebleeding before aneurysm treatment (10% vs. 14%). In the ULTRA study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with spontaneous CT-proven subarachnoid hemorrhage, tranexamic acid was not superior to control with respect to good clinical outcome at 6 months, mRS score of 0–3.

### Early prehospital tranexamic acid following injury is associated with a 30-day survival benefit: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^85c93543]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

We sought to characterize the timing of administration of prehospital tranexamic acid (TXA) and associated outcome benefits.

Background

TXA has been shown to be safe in the prehospital setting post-injury.

Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of a recent prehospital randomized TXA clinical trial in injured patients. Those who received prehospital TXA within 1 hour (EARLY) from time of injury were compared to those who received prehospital TXA beyond 1 hour (DELAYED). We included patients with a shock index of > 0.9. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Cox Hazard regression were utilized to characterize mortality relationships.

Results

EARLY and DELAYED patients had similar demographics, injury characteristics, and shock severity but DELAYED patients had greater prehospital resuscitation requirements and longer prehospital times. Stratified Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significant separation for EARLY patients (N = 238, log-rank chi-square test, 4.99; P = 0.03) with no separation for DELAYED patients (N = 238, log-rank chi-square test, 0.04; P = 0.83). Stratified Cox Hazard regression verified, after controlling for confounders, that EARLY TXA was associated with a 65% lower independent hazard for 30-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19–0.65, P = 0.001] with no independent survival benefit found in DELAYED patients (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63–1.60, P = 0.999). EARLY TXA patients had lower incidence of multiple organ failure and 6-hour and 24-hour transfusion requirements compared to placebo.

Conclusions

Administration of prehospital TXA within 1 hour from injury in patients at risk of hemorrhage is associated with 30-day survival benefit, lower incidence of multiple organ failure, and lower transfusion requirements.
