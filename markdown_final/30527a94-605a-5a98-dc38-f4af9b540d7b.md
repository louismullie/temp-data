## Question

How to explain ductal carcinoma in Situ to a patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to explain ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to a patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and why DCIS is different from invasive cancer. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and why DCIS is being diagnosed more often. Next, I will examine the natural history and progression risk, including the overtreatment concern. After that, I need to review treatment options and their trade-offs, including surgery, radiation, and endocrine therapy, and consider active surveillance. Finally, I should integrate shared decision-making, address common misconceptions, and close with a concise, reassuring summary that aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't mislead the patient. DCIS is abnormal cells confined to the milk ducts of the breast; they have not broken through the basement membrane or spread outside the duct, so by definition it is noninvasive and not life-threatening in and of itself, though it can progress to invasive cancer in some cases [^9ab09fcf] [^f72c2d35].

> Wait, let me verify the terminology because patients often hear "carcinoma" and assume cancer. Some experts argue the word "carcinoma" in DCIS creates unnecessary anxiety and suggest alternatives, but clinically DCIS is still categorized as Stage 0 breast cancer; I should explain that while it is a precursor, it is not the same as invasive breast cancer and does not spread to lymph nodes or distant sites unless it progresses [^0007a229] [^0efe9cd3].

> I need to check the epidemiology to contextualize why this diagnosis is common. DCIS now accounts for roughly 20–25% of screen-detected breast cancers in countries with organized screening, reflecting increased detection rather than a surge in disease; most cases are asymptomatic and found on mammography, often as calcifications [^f72c2d35] [^f8ac7005].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk. I should confirm progression estimates. Most DCIS lesions will never become invasive, and even when progression occurs, it is typically slow-growing and early-detectable; nonetheless, women with DCIS have about a threefold higher long-term risk of dying from breast cancer than women without DCIS, largely due to the small subset that does progress, which is why we treat it even though mortality is low overall [^f72c2d35] [^318c6598] [^5377d831].

> Let me think about the overtreatment issue carefully. Because we cannot reliably distinguish indolent DCIS from potentially progressive DCIS, many patients receive surgery, radiation, and sometimes endocrine therapy that they may not need; this is the core controversy, and it drives ongoing research into risk stratification and active surveillance for low-risk disease [^0efe9cd3] [^f72c2d35].

> Next, I should review treatment options and their benefits and trade-offs. Standard care remains surgical excision, either breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) or mastectomy, with lumpectomy generally preferred when feasible; adding whole-breast radiation after lumpectomy reduces local recurrence by about half but does not improve survival, and endocrine therapy can further reduce recurrence in hormone receptor–positive DCIS, again without a survival benefit, so decisions hinge on recurrence risk and patient preferences [^586229b7] [^06dccb45] [^7e8d6814].

> I should double-check the active surveillance data before suggesting it. Active surveillance is not yet standard of care but is being studied in trials; observational cohorts suggest that in carefully selected low-risk patients, the 8-year risk of invasive cancer in the same breast is around 8–11%, which is comparable to other high-risk breast lesions, reinforcing that surveillance may be reasonable for some, though selection criteria and imaging protocols are critical [^e3740761] [^6b7f2af3].

> But wait, what if the initial biopsy understates invasive disease. Upgrading to invasive cancer at surgery occurs in roughly 10–20% of cases labeled as non–high-grade DCIS on core biopsy, which is why surveillance trials exclude high-grade features and require meticulous imaging and pathology review; I need to ensure patients understand this uncertainty when discussing surveillance [^9cbf7a17] [^945586f4].

> I will now examine shared decision-making because patient values often determine the best path. Women frequently overestimate progression risk and experience persistent anxiety, yet many are willing to trade some cancer risk to avoid surgery or radiation side effects; tools and conversations that clarify recurrence risks, cosmetic outcomes, pain, and surveillance burdens improve alignment between treatment and what matters most to the patient [^f50feec1] [^6c567f01] [^00549ec8].

> Let me consider practical communication aids. Visual diagrams of ducts, the concept of "inside vs outside" the duct, and simple risk analogies (for example, "out of 100 women like you, about 8–10 would develop invasive cancer in the same breast over 8 years without surgery, and treatment reduces that risk but does not change survival") can reduce confusion; I should also acknowledge that some recurrences are new, unrelated cancers, which helps explain why even optimal local therapy does not eliminate all future risk [^dce9a745] [^043c2935] [^e3740761].

> Hold on, I should verify and correct a common misconception. Patients often ask, "Did the cancer spread?" I need to explain that DCIS itself does not spread beyond the breast ducts, so there is no metastasis from DCIS alone; however, if DCIS progresses to invasive cancer, that invasive component can spread, which is why we treat DCIS to prevent that step [^9ab09fcf] [^f72c2d35].

> Next, I should review what guides individualized decisions. Factors such as age, extent of disease, nuclear grade, necrosis, margin status, and biomarkers like ER influence recurrence risk and the role of radiation or endocrine therapy; in select low-risk cases, omission of radiation may be reasonable after shared decision-making, and ongoing trials are testing whether surveillance can safely replace surgery for the lowest-risk DCIS [^586229b7] [^06dccb45] [^e3740761].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line so I don't overpromise. DCIS is a noninvasive, Stage 0 breast condition with an excellent prognosis; most patients will not die of breast cancer, but a small subset can progress, so treatment aims to reduce local recurrence while balancing side effects and patient preferences; survival is high regardless of local therapy choice, which supports tailoring decisions to what the patient values most [^0efe9cd3] [^00549ec8] [^5377d831].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and support. After treatment, routine surveillance mammography is standard, and patients should be counseled on signs of recurrence; for those considering or enrolled in surveillance protocols, close imaging follow-up and clear return precautions are essential, and access to decision aids and support groups can mitigate anxiety and improve satisfaction with care [^586229b7] [^6b7f2af3] [^dce9a745].

DCIS is **Stage 0 breast cancer** — abnormal cells confined to the milk ducts, not invasive, and not life-threatening by itself [^9ab09fcf] [^0efe9cd3]. It has a **high survival rate** (> 98% at 10 years) [^f50feec1], but a small risk of becoming invasive over time, so treatment aims to prevent progression while avoiding overtreatment [^0efe9cd3]. Options include lumpectomy with or without radiation, mastectomy, or, in select low-risk cases, active surveillance [^586229b7] [^e3740761]. Shared decision-making is essential to balance benefits and side effects, and most patients have an excellent long-term outlook [^0efe9cd3] [^00549ec8].

---

## What is DCIS?

DCIS is a **non-invasive breast condition** in which abnormal cells are confined to the milk ducts and have not spread into surrounding breast tissue or beyond [^9ab09fcf]. It is considered Stage 0 breast cancer and is not life-threatening on its own [^0efe9cd3].

---

## How is DCIS detected?

Most DCIS is found on **screening mammography**, typically as calcifications, and is usually asymptomatic [^f8ac7005]. Occasionally, it may present with symptoms such as a breast lump or nipple discharge, but this is less common [^52e89a1e].

---

## What are the treatment options for DCIS?

Treatment aims to **prevent progression to invasive cancer** while minimizing overtreatment [^0efe9cd3]. Options include:

- **Lumpectomy (breast-conserving surgery)**: Removal of the abnormal tissue with preservation of the breast, often followed by radiation therapy to reduce recurrence risk [^586229b7].
- **Mastectomy**: Removal of the entire breast, typically reserved for extensive or multifocal DCIS [^586229b7].
- **Active surveillance**: Observation with regular imaging and clinical exams, currently under investigation for carefully selected low-risk patients [^e3740761] [^6b7f2af3].

---

## What are the risks and benefits of treatment?

Treatment effectively **reduces the risk of local recurrence** and progression to invasive cancer, but it can also cause side effects such as pain, fatigue, and anxiety [^06dccb45] [^00549ec8]. Importantly, treatment does not significantly improve overall survival, as most patients with DCIS have an excellent prognosis regardless of treatment choice [^0efe9cd3] [^f50feec1].

---

## What is the prognosis for patients with DCIS?

The prognosis for DCIS is **excellent**, with a 10-year disease-specific survival rate exceeding 98% [^f50feec1]. The main risk is progression to invasive breast cancer, which occurs in approximately 20–30% of untreated cases over time, though many DCIS lesions remain indolent and never progress [^1d23d4c0] [^f72c2d35].

---

## How should patients approach decision-making?

Patients should engage in **shared decision-making** with their healthcare team, considering their individual risk factors, preferences, and values [^0efe9cd3]. It is important to discuss the risks and benefits of each treatment option, including the possibility of overtreatment and the potential for recurrence [^06dccb45].

---

## Key points to remember

- DCIS is **non-invasive and not life-threatening** by itself [^9ab09fcf] [^0efe9cd3].
- Treatment aims to **prevent progression** to invasive cancer while minimizing overtreatment [^0efe9cd3].
- **Prognosis is excellent**, with high long-term survival rates [^f50feec1].
- **Shared decision-making** is essential to balance risks and benefits [^0efe9cd3].

---

DCIS is a **non-invasive breast condition** with an excellent prognosis. Treatment decisions should be individualized, balancing the risk of progression with the potential side effects of therapy, and shared decision-making is crucial to ensure the best outcomes for patients [^0efe9cd3].

### Challenges in ductal carcinoma in situ risk communication and decision-making: report from an American cancer society and national cancer institute workshop [^7bf60922]. CA (2012). Low credibility.

In September 2010, the American Cancer Society and National Cancer Institute convened a conference to review current issues in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) risk communication and decision-making and to identify directions for future research. Specific topics included patient and health care provider knowledge and attitudes about DCIS and its treatment, how to explain DCIS to patients given the heterogeneity of the disease, consideration of nomenclature changes, and the usefulness of decision tools/aids. This report describes the proceedings of the workshop in the context of the current literature and discusses future directions. Evidence suggests that there is a lack of clarity about the implications and risks of a diagnosis of DCIS among patients, providers, and researchers. Research is needed to understand better the biology and mechanisms of the progression of DCIS to invasive breast cancer and the factors that predict those subtypes of DCIS that do not progress, as well as efforts to improve the communication and informed decision-making surrounding DCIS.

Background

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was rarely diagnosed before the advent of breast screening, yet it now accounts for 25% of detected 'breast cancers'. Over 60,000 women are diagnosed with DCIS each year in the USA, > 7000 in the UKand > 2500 in the Netherlands.DCIS is a proliferation of neoplastic luminal cells that are confined to the ductolobular system of the breast. If DCIS progresses to invasive breast cancer, DCIS cells penetrate the ductal basement membrane and invade the surrounding parenchyma. Individual lesions differ in aspects of the disease: presentation, histology, progression, and genetic features. Despite being pre- or non-invasive, DCIS is often regarded as an early form of (Stage 0) breast cancer. Therefore, conventional management includes mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery supplemented with radiotherapy; in some countries, adjuvant endocrine therapy is added. Regrettably, current therapeutic approaches result in overtreatment of some women with DCIS (Box 1). The Marmot Report in 2012 recognised the burden of overtreatment to women's wellbeing. In effect, women with DCIS are labelled as 'cancer patients', with concomitant anxiety and negative impact on their lives, despite the fact that most DCIS lesions will probably never progress to invasive breast cancer. Owing to the uncertainty regarding which lesions run the risk of progression to invasive cancer, current risk perceptions are misleading and consequently bias the dialogue between clinicians and women diagnosed with DCIS, resulting in overtreatment for some, and potentially many, women.

Improving the management and treatment of DCIS presents a central challenge: distinguishing indolent, harmless DCIS lesions from potentially hazardous ones. This poses a fundamental question to address: 'Is cancer always cancer?'. To answer this question, we need to adopt an interdisciplinary and translational approach, merging fields of epidemiology, molecular biology, clinical research and psychosocial studies. How low does the risk need to be to refrain from treating DCIS? What are the prognostic markers and read-outs we can rely on? How do we frame and communicate the risks involved?

In this review, we describe the current approaches to diagnosing DCIS, the perception of the risk of developing invasive breast carcinoma, the treatment options available following a diagnosis and a current knowledge of the progression of DCIS, before outlining future endeavours and the need for an integrated approach that blends clinical and patient insights with scientific advances.

### A patient-centered approach to evaluate the information needs of women with ductal carcinoma in situ [^5cb02038]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the information needs of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) patients.

Methods

Four focus groups involving 24 previously treated DCIS patients were conducted to develop a comprehensive list of questions they felt were important to have answered at the time of diagnosis. Using a survey, a separate group of patients treated for DCIS then rated the importance of having each of these questions addressed before treatment decision making. Response options were "essential", "desired", "not important", "no opinion", and "avoid". For each essential/desired question, respondents specified how addressing it would help them: "understand", "decide", "plan", "not sure", or "other".

Results

Focus group participants generated 117 questions used in the survey. Fifty-seven patients completed the survey (55% response rate). Respondents rated a median of 66 questions as essential. The most commonly cited reason for rating a question essential was to "understand", followed by to "decide". The top questions women deemed essential to help them understand were disease specific, whereas the top questions deemed essential to help women decide were predominantly treatment specific, pertaining to available options, recurrence and survival outcomes, and timelines to decide and start treatment.

Conclusions

DCIS patients want a large number of questions answered, mostly for understanding, and also for deciding and planning. A core set of questions that most patients consider essential for decision making has been formulated and may be used in the clinical setting and in research to develop educational resources and decision-making tools specific to DCIS.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ: to treat or not to treat, that is the question [^acce91bd]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) now represents 20–25% of all 'breast cancers' consequent upon detection by population-based breast cancer screening programmes. Currently, all DCIS lesions are treated, and treatment comprises either mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery supplemented with radiotherapy. However, most DCIS lesions remain indolent. Difficulty in discerning harmless lesions from potentially invasive ones can lead to overtreatment of this condition in many patients. To counter overtreatment and to transform clinical practice, a global, comprehensive and multidisciplinary collaboration is required. Here we review the incidence of DCIS, the perception of risk for developing invasive breast cancer, the current treatment options and the known molecular aspects of progression. Further research is needed to gain new insights for improved diagnosis and management of DCIS, and this is integrated in the PRECISION (PREvent ductal Carcinoma In Situ Invasive Overtreatment Now) initiative. This international effort will seek to determine which DCISs require treatment and prevent the consequences of overtreatment on the lives of many women affected by DCIS.

Conclusion

Current perceptions of the risk-framing dialogue between clinicians and women diagnosed with DCIS are currently resulting in the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of DCIS. The need to reframe perceptions of risk and to avoid overtreatment is urgent, as overtreatment leads to physical and emotional harm for patients and to unnecessary costs for society. Specifically, knowing when a lesion could be or will not be life-threatening requires a thorough understanding of the progression and evolution of DCIS. To this end, initiatives, such as PRECISION, have been set out to reduce the burden of overtreatment of DCIS by gaining deep knowledge about the biology of DCIS. This knowledge will contribute to informed decision-making between patients and clinicians, without compromising the excellent outcomes for DCIS that are presently achieved. Dealing with this challenge demands an integrated approach that blends clinical and patient insights with scientific advances in order to improve the diagnosis, treatment and management of DCIS. To accomplish this, it is critical that patient advocates, scientists and clinicians work together, exemplified by a collaborative patient advocate and scientist in the PRECISION research team video:

### Treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ after excision: would a prophylactic paradigm be more appropriate? [^9e332ca4]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Corresponding to the increased use of mammography, the incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has risen dramatically in the past 30 years. Despite its growing incidence, the treatment of DCIS remains highly variable and controversial. Although DCIS itself does not metastasize and is never lethal, it may be a precursor of invasive breast cancer and is a marker of increased breast cancer risk. Confusing a precursor lesion with cancer, many clinicians apply an invasive breast cancer treatment paradigm to DCIS patients, offering adjuvant radiation therapy and tamoxifen after diagnosis. In this commentary, we outline the issues associated with DCIS management — is DCIS a cancer, a precursor of cancer, or a marker of invasive carcinoma risk? Specifically, we argue that consideration be given to removing the term "carcinoma" from DCIS, using cancer "occurrence" to mean the diagnosis of invasive cancer after DCIS instead of "recurrence", and make the argument that a prophylactic paradigm of treatment after excision may be more appropriate.

Box 1: Consequences of overdiagnosis in DCIS: Impact of DCIS on a woman's life

The diagnosis of DCIS labels women as being at risk for invasive breast cancer. Despite the good prognosis and normal life-expectancy, women diagnosed with DCIS may experience substantial psychological distressand overestimate the implications of a DCIS diagnosis. Comorbidity of surgery and prior depression have been reported as important factors related to worse quality of life in these women. Critical questions yet to be answered include: (i) Can the way in which a diagnosis for DCIS is communicated be improved? (ii) Can the labelling effects of a diagnosis of DCIS be mitigated, while ensuring adequate follow-up of these high-risk women? And, finally, (iii) what is the impact on quality of life for active surveillance of women diagnosed with low-grade DCIS? Addressing these questions requires central involvement of patient voices to improve clarity not only for patients but also for healthcare providers about the implications and risks of a diagnosis of DCIS.

### National Institutes of Health state-of-the-science conference statement: diagnosis and management of ductal carcinoma in situ September 22–24, 2009 [^0007a229]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide health-care providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data on the diagnosis and management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

Participants

A non-Department of Health and Human Services, nonadvocate, 14-member panel representing the fields of oncology, radiology, surgery (general and reconstructive), pathology, radiation oncology, internal medicine, epidemiology, biostatistics, nursing, obstetrics and gynecology, preventative medicine and population health, and social work. In addition, 22 experts from pertinent fields presented data to the panel and conference audience.

Evidence

Presentations by experts and a systematic review of the literature prepared by the Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center, through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Scientific evidence was given precedence over anecdotal experience.

Conference Process

The panel drafted its statement based on scientific evidence presented in open forum and on published scientific literature. The draft statement was presented on the final day of the conference and circulated to the audience for comment. The panel released a revised statement later that day at http://consensus.nih.gov. This statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the National Institutes of Health or the Federal Government.

Conclusions

Clearly, the diagnosis and management of DCIS is highly complex with many unanswered questions, including the fundamental natural history of untreated disease. Because of the noninvasive nature of DCIS, coupled with its favorable prognosis, strong consideration should be given to elimination of the use of the anxiety-producing term "carcinoma" from the description of DCIS. The outcomes in women treated with available therapies are excellent. Thus, the primary question for future research must focus on the accurate identification of patient subsets diagnosed with DCIS, including those persons who may be managed with less therapeutic intervention without sacrificing the excellent outcomes presently achieved. Essential in this quest will be the development and validation of accurate risk stratification methods based on a comprehensive understanding of the clinical, pathological, and biological factors associated with DCIS.

### Are there alternative strategies for the local management of ductal carcinoma in situ? [^ff3123a4]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has traditionally followed the evidence base for invasive breast cancer using surgery, radiation therapy, and drug therapy to remove the DCIS from the breast and reduce the risk of recurrence for both DCIS and invasive breast cancer. Because of concerns regarding the overtreatment of DCIS, randomized controlled trials have been established to test the outcomes (invasive breast cancer outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures) of active surveillance compared with guideline-concordant care for low-risk (for progression) DCIS. These strategies are undergoing rigorous evaluation to evaluate alternatives to the current management of DCIS.

### Learning to distinguish progressive and non-progressive ductal carcinoma in situ [^f72c2d35]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-invasive breast neoplasia that accounts for 25% of all screen-detected breast cancers diagnosed annually. Neoplastic cells in DCIS are confined to the ductal system of the breast, although they can escape and progress to invasive breast cancer in a subset of patients. A key concern of DCIS is overtreatment, as most patients screened for DCIS and in whom DCIS is diagnosed will not go on to exhibit symptoms or die of breast cancer, even if left untreated. However, differentiating low-risk, indolent DCIS from potentially progressive DCIS remains challenging. In this Review, we summarize our current knowledge of DCIS and explore open questions about the basic biology of DCIS, including those regarding how genomic events in neoplastic cells and the surrounding microenvironment contribute to the progression of DCIS to invasive breast cancer. Further, we discuss what information will be needed to prevent overtreatment of indolent DCIS lesions without compromising adequate treatment for high-risk patients.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ and progression to invasive cancer: a review of the evidence [^baa02d52]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), breast cancer confined to the milk ducts, is a heterogeneous entity. The question of how and when a case of DCIS will extend beyond the ducts to become invasive breast cancer has implications for both patient prognosis and optimal treatment approaches. The natural history of DCIS has been explored through a variety of methods, from mouse models to biopsy specimen reviews to population-based screening data to modeling studies. This article will review the available evidence regarding progression pathways and will also summarize current trials designed to assess DCIS progression.

Looking ahead

Uncertainty exists about how DCIS develops, and global consensus is lacking as to how best to optimally manage this disease. A better understanding of the biology of DCIS and the natural course of the disease is required to support patients and healthcare professionals in making more informed treatment decisions, in turn reducing the current overtreatment of DCIS. In 2014, Gierisch et al.described and prioritised knowledge gaps of patients and decision makers with regards to future research of DCIS for the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), a private, non-governmental, non-profit, USA-based institute created by The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 to 'help people make informed healthcare decisions, and improve healthcare delivery and outcomes'. By reviewing the existing literature and using a forced-ranking prioritisation method, a list of ten evidence gaps was created (Table 1). Issues that needed immediate attention include the effective communication of information about diagnosis and prognosis and dedicated efforts to fill the knowledge gaps regarding long-term implications and risks of a diagnosis of DCIS.

To address these priorities in DCIS, a multidisciplinary approach with scientific, clinical and patient expertise is needed. Data from large retrospective cohorts should be integrated with in vitro and in vivo studies and the results should be validated to transform clinical practise. To fund such a large multinational consortium, Cancer Research UK and the Dutch Cancer Society (KWF) partnered to support the Grand Challengeaward in 2017, the PREvent ductal Carcinoma In Situ Invasive Overtreatment Now (PRECISION) initiative (see Box 2 and Supplementary Material for more information about PRECISION).

### Association of a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ with death from breast cancer [^318c6598]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) associated with lifetime risk of dying of breast cancer?

Findings

In this cohort study of 144 524 women treated for DCIS, 1540 women died of breast cancer, while based on national incidence and case-fatality rates, the expected number of deaths from breast cancer was 458. Women with DCIS had a 3-fold increased risk of dying of breast cancer compared with women without DCIS.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the current treatment of DCIS does not eliminate the risk of breast cancer mortality.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ-update on risk assessment and management [^d557a07e]. Histopathology (2016). Low credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) accounts for ~20–25% of breast cancers. While DCIS is not life-threatening, it may progress to invasive carcinoma over time, and treatment intended to prevent invasive progression may itself cause significant morbidity. Accurate risk assessment is therefore necessary to avoid over- or undertreatment of an individual patient. In this review we will outline the evidence for current management of DCIS, discuss approaches to DCIS risk assessment and challenges facing identification of novel DCIS biomarkers.

Perception of risk

Generally, patients diagnosed with DCIS have an excellent long-term breast-cancer-specific survival of around 98% after 10 years of follow-up – and a normal life expectancy. However, a consensus in the medical community is lacking on how to effectively communicate to patients about DCIS and the associated risk of development into invasive cancer. It is essential to be aware of the fact that if the lower-grade DCIS (considered as the lower-risk lesions) progresses into invasive breast cancer, this will often be the lower-grade, slow-growing and early-detectable invasive disease, with excellent prognosis.

Because both diagnosis and treatment of the condition can have a profound psychosocial impact on a woman's life, adequate perception of risk by both health professionals and patients is important in determining the appropriate modalities of treatment. Despite an excellent prognosis and normal life-expectancy, women diagnosed with DCIS experience stress and anxiety. Studies report that most women with DCIS (and early-stage breast cancer) have little knowledge and inaccurate perceptions of the risk of disease progression, and this misperception is associated with psychological distress. – Women with DCIS make substantial changes to their behaviour after diagnosis, including smoking cessation and decreasing the use of postmenopausal hormones.

Similar to progression rates for DCIS, classic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) confers a risk of 1–2% per year to develop into invasive disease. First-line treatment for LCIS usually comprises active surveillance; unlike DCIS, doctors and patients accept the concept of active surveillance to monitor for progression of LCIS before administering any aggressive treatment. The need for effective doctor–patient communication is therefore essential for patients to understand the risk of recurrence. According to Kim et al.women in whom DCIS was detected experienced high decisional conflict in treatment options and were not satisfied with the information provided to them. The development of a prediction tool could help to classify patients into risk groups and provide accurate guidance to patients, as well as healthcare professionals, in their choice of an appropriate treatment option. Nowadays, such a tool is even more important, as patients increasingly wish to engage in shared decision making about their disease.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ: state of the science and roadmap to advance the field [^969764e1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the fourth leading cancer for women in the United States. Understanding of the biology and clinical behavior of DCIS is imperfect. This article highlights the current knowledge base and the scientific roadmap needed to advance the field.

Methods

This article is based on work done by and consultations obtained from leading experts in the field over a 6-month period that culminated in a full-day symposium designed to systematically review the most pertinent MEDLINE published reports and develop a roadmap to elucidate the molecular steps of carcinogenesis, reduce the extent or prevent the need for therapies, eliminate recurrences, and reduce morbidity.

Results

Expression profiling of pure DCIS will help elucidate the molecular characteristics that distinguish high-risk lesions from clinically irrelevant lesions. The development of new methods of extracting RNA from processed tissues may provide opportunities for research. Mammography often underestimates the pathologic extent of DCIS; other imaging methods need to be investigated for detection and monitoring of disease stability or progression. Novel biologic agents are being delivered in neoadjuvant clinical trials, and alternative methods for breast irradiation are being studied. Future trials of treatment versus no treatment for biologically selected cases of DCIS should be developed.

Conclusion

There is a critical need for a concerted international effort among patients with DCIS, clinicians, and basic scientists to conduct the research necessary to improve fundamental understanding of the biology and clinical behavior of DCIS and prevent development of invasive breast cancer.

### Applying the neoadjuvant paradigm to ductal carcinoma in situ [^3de1486a]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Local treatment options for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are virtually identical to those for early invasive breast cancer, despite the fact that the survival from this condition is much higher. Our ability to more appropriately tailor therapy for DCIS is hampered by a lack of understanding of the natural history of DCIS, our limited ability to predict the rate of progression to invasive cancer and the response to therapy, and the absence of tools to follow patients who have not had invasive treatments. Neoadjuvant therapy, which has been proven to be both safe and effective in tailoring treatments for invasive cancer, could be ideally suited to DCIS. However, neoadjuvant therapy requires that doctors and patients delay surgical treatment that has known benefits. In order to successfully introduce this approach into clinical practice, risk assessment and decision support tools will be needed to help physicians and patients feel comfortable that they are not being exposed to unnecessary or excessive risk. In addition, we need better imaging to track extent and progression of disease. Among the possible benefits of the neoadjuvant approach, we may discover that many lesions are responsive and some even reversible, leaving us with treatments that might be tailored to biology and with important clues for breast cancer prevention in high-risk women.

### Development and pilot testing of a communication aid to assist clinicians to communicate with women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) [^dce9a745]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The literature highlights the confusion amongst women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) about aspects of their disease and treatment and the wide variation in how doctors communicate about DCIS. The DCIS communication aid (CA) was developed to assist clinicians to communicate with women diagnosed with DCIS and to improve women's understanding about their disease, prognosis and treatment options. This study aimed to assess patient and clinician perceptions of the CA.

Methods

The CA included information and diagrams about key aspects of the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and support. It was designed to be used in clinical consultations and taken home after the consultation. Australian women with DCIS (n = 18) participated in structured interviews and clinicians (n = 7), including surgeons and radiation oncologists, completed surveys to assess their perceptions of the CA. Main outcome measures included satisfaction with the content, design and diagrams in the CA, and perceptions of the benefits of the CA and its impact on doctor-patient communication.

Results

All clinicians and women with DCIS reported that the CA would assist communication and help women understand their diagnosis.

Conclusions

This is the first intervention designed to decrease the confusion amongst women with DCIS and improve doctor-patient communication in this area. This study highlights that interventions such as the DCIS communication aid may be a valuable resource for clinicians and women with DCIS. This study also highlights key communication challenges relating to DCIS.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ: the whole truth [^695c5f8c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive malignant breast disease traditionally described as a precursor lesion to invasive breast cancer. With screening mammography, DCIS now accounts for approximately 20% of newly diagnosed cancer cases. DCIS is not well understood because of its heterogeneous nature.

Conclusion

Studies have aimed to assess prognostic factors to characterize its risk of invasive potential; however, there still remains a lack of uniformity in workup and treatment. We summarize current knowledge of DCIS and the ongoing controversies.

### Treatment of low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ: is nothing better than something? [^8e8d78f5]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

The heterogeneous nature of ductal carcinoma in situ has been emphasised by data for breast-cancer screening that show substantial increases in the detection of early-stage non-invasive breast cancer but no noteworthy change in the incidence of invasive and distant metastatic disease. Indolent non-progressive forms of ductal carcinoma in situ are managed according to similar surgical strategies as high-risk disease, with extent of resection dictated by radiological and pathological estimates of tumour dimensions. Although adjuvant treatments might be withheld for low-risk lesions, surgical treatments incur potential morbidity, especially when mastectomy and breast reconstruction are done for widespread low-grade or intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. Low rates of deaths from breast cancer coupled with overdiagnosis within screening programmes have prompted a fundamental rethink of approaches to the management of both low-risk and high-risk ductal carcinoma in situ. Changes include active surveillance for low-risk lesions and a watchful waiting policy with intervention when invasive local recurrence after breast-conserving surgery is detected. Prediction of ipsilateral invasive recurrence is likely to be improved by integration of molecular biomarkers with conventional histopathological parameters. Moreover, further genetic interrogation of ductal carcinoma in situ might lead to a reclassification of some low-grade lesions as non-cancerous entities.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: current concepts and future directions [^7959b982]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Context

In situ carcinomas of the breast constitute 15% to 30% of all newly diagnosed breast cancer cases; 80% of these in situ lesions belong to the ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) category. Similar to invasive breast carcinomas, DCIS is not a single disease but rather many distinct diseases with different histopathologic and molecular characteristics, a propensity to progress to invasive disease, and differential response to treatment.

Objective

To review the classic pathologic parameters of clinical significance and the differential diagnosis of the DCIS lesions, present our new understanding of the importance of biomarkers, and discuss innovative approaches for targeted therapy in DCIS.

Data Sources

Extensive review of the relevant peer-reviewed literature.

Conclusions

In DCIS, improved understanding of the underlying biologic pathways of tumor progression is expected to lead to more accurate classification and innovative targeted treatment approaches for the management of these lesions.

### Management of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: a review [^06dccb45]. JAMA Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast represents a disease process that continues to increase in incidence with treatment paradigms that continue to evolve. Greater access to long-term data from large observational studies addressing the natural history of the disease has contributed to changes in treatment paradigms and put into question traditional management strategies.

Observations

While recent analyses have suggested that a more conservative approach to the management of DCIS without surgical intervention or radiation therapy may be advisable based on breast cancer mortality data, there is a lack of level 1 or prospective evidence to support the widespread adoption of these approaches. Currently, surgery remains the standard of care for the initial treatment of DCIS. Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) has consistently demonstrated a reduction in the risk of local recurrence following breast-conserving surgery (BCS), even in "low-risk" populations of patients. Invasive recurrences following BCS are associated with increases in breast cancer mortality. Questions that remain to be answered include (1) what constitutes an acceptable risk of local recurrence, (2) what are the costs associated with managing local recurrences compared with RT given initially after BCS (particularly in light of data supporting shorter courses of RT), and (3) what are the benefits of endocrine therapy on local recurrence, and do they justify the additional toxic effects and potential noncompliance with their long-term administration?

Conclusions and Relevance

Surgery and RT remain standard of care treatment options in the management of DCIS. Future studies are required to identify cohorts of patients in which RT can be safely omitted as well as to evaluate whether short-course RT alone may represent a better option than endocrine therapy with respect to compliance, toxic effects, cost and local control following BCS.

### Evidence map of ductal carcinoma in situ management options [^7bdaf70f]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has the potential to progress to invasive carcinoma. The optimal management of DCIS and methods for individualizing treatment of DCIS are still being determined. This evidence map depicts the robustness and topical span of research on DCIS management choice on patient-centered and clinical outcomes.

Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed Health, PROSPERO, and clinical practice guideline sites to identify systematic reviews of DCIS management options and consulted with topic experts. A bubble plot visualizes the literature volume and research content for patient-centered outcomes. An online decision tree facilitates discussions with patients and guides through the available evidence.

Results

In total, 40 systematic reviews met inclusion criteria. The research syntheses addressed DCIS management options, including the role of magnetic resonance imaging, axillary surgery/sentinel lymph node biopsy, and excisional biopsy. The map shows existing evidence for mutually exclusive treatment options including active surveillance, breast-conserving surgery, nipple sparing mastectomy, and simple mastectomy. Research findings for intraoperative radiation, adjuvant radiation therapy, adjuvant hormone therapy, hypofractionation radiotherapy, accelerated partial breast irradiation, radiation therapy plus boost, and combined radiation and hormone therapy, as well as for breast reconstruction after mastectomy and surveillance mammography postsurgery are also displayed. The evidence map highlights a scarcity of robust evidence on patient-centered outcomes.

Conclusions

The evidence map provides an overview of DCIS research showing the range of management options and remaining decisional dilemmas that follow a diagnosis of DCIS. It maps the evidence in accessible tools to guide practice and future research.: Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A448.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ [^06675e6c]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

DCIS is a heterogeneous disease whose natural history is poorly defined. Screening mammography has increased the detection rate of DCIS, but we remain unable to identify cases of DCIS that will not progress to invasive carcinoma during an individual's lifetime. Genomics holds great promise in this regard, but prospective studies with long-term follow-up will be needed before concluding that a subset of DCIS is clinically insignificant. The varying intensity of treatment options for DCIS, ranging from mastectomy to excision, RT, and tamoxifen to excision alone, reflects the uncertainty about the natural history of DCIS as well as differing physician values regarding the impact of local recurrence. The extent of DCIS within the breast is the major determinant of whether the patient is a candidate for a breast-conserving approach, and contraindications to the use of breast conservation treatment and to the use of irradiation have been defined. The clinical decision-making process in DCIS would benefit greatly from improvements in our ability to convey information about the long-term risks and benefits of therapy, as well as the tradeoffs in health-related quality of life, to patients, and to incorporate their preferences into the decision-making process.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: finding the balance between overtreatment and undertreatment [^0efe9cd3]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) accounts for 15–25% of all breast cancer diagnoses. Its prognosis is excellent overall, the main risk being the occurrence of local breast events, as most cases of DCIS do not progress to invasive cancer. Systematic screening has greatly increased the incidence of this non-obligate precursor of invasion, lending urgency to the need to identify DCIS that is prone to invasive progression and distinguish it from non-invasion-prone DCIS, as the latter can be overdiagnosed and therefore overtreated. Treatment strategies, including surgery, radiotherapy, and optional endocrine therapy, decrease the risk of local events, but have no effect on survival outcomes. Active surveillance is being evaluated as a possible new option for low-risk DCIS. Considerable efforts to decipher the biology of DCIS have led to a better understanding of the factors that determine its variable natural history. Given this variability, shared decision making regarding optimal, personalised treatment strategies is the most appropriate course of action. Well designed, risk-based de-escalation studies remain a major need in this field.

### Cause-specific mortality in a population-based cohort of 9799 women treated for ductal carcinoma in situ [^454b8fd1]. Annals of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a proliferation of neoplastic cells confined to the ductolobular system — that is, without invading the surrounding breast tissue. It is a heterogeneous disease entity ranging from indolent, harmless DCIS to aggressive lesions with high invasive potential. As such, some DCIS lesions may progress into invasive breast cancer (IBC), and ultimately to fatal metastatic disease, whereas many DCIS lesions will never become invasive. The low risk of death from breast cancer among DCIS patients, may be because of effective treatment, the potentially indolent and slow-growing nature of most DCIS, or both.

Most DCIS cases are picked up by breast cancer screening mammograms. Women with screen-detected breast lesions are generally in good health and do not experience any breast changes or symptoms. It is not surprising that inaccurate risk perceptions and anxiety in women diagnosed with DCIS are frequent. DCIS patients are generally told that they do not have cancer and have normal life expectancy, but may experience short- and long-term morbidity from the invasive treatment, which is in many respects similar to that for women with IBC. Therefore, the treatment decision-making process in DCIS is complex and controversial.

To fine-tune current practice and reduce confusing perceptions, there is an ongoing need to provide accurate information to DCIS patients and their health-care providers about the risks involved. Several population-based studies have studied breast cancer-specific mortality among DCIS patients,– but only a few assessed competing causes of death or comprehensively compared these with that of the general population. Therefore, we assessed the likelihood of breast cancer-related death in DCIS patients and compared cause-specific mortality with rates expected based on mortality in the general population.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ, complexities and challenges [^4fd1ccf2]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2004). Low credibility.

The incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive form of breast cancer, has increased markedly in recent decades, and DCIS now accounts for approximately 20% of breast cancers diagnosed by mammography. Laboratory and patient data suggest that DCIS is a precursor lesion for invasive cancer. The appropriate classification of DCIS has provoked much debate; a number of classification systems have been developed, but there is a lack of uniformity in the diagnosis and prognostication of this disease. Further investigation of molecular markers should improve the classification of DCIS and our understanding of its relationship to invasive disease. Controversy also exists with regard to the optimal management of DCIS patients. In the past, mastectomy was the primary treatment for patients with DCIS, but as with invasive cancer, breast-conserving surgery has become the standard approach. Three randomized trials have reported a statistically significant decrease in the risk of recurrence with radiation therapy in combination with lumpectomy compared with lumpectomy alone, but there was no survival advantage with the addition of radiotherapy. Two randomized trials have suggested an additional benefit, in terms of recurrence, with the addition of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, although in one trial the benefit was not statistically significant. Current data suggest that tamoxifen use should be restricted to patients with estrogen receptor-positive DCIS. Neither trial demonstrated a survival benefit with adjuvant tamoxifen. Ongoing and recently completed studies should provide information on outcomes in patients treated with lumpectomy alone and on the effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors as an alternative to tamoxifen.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: a systematic review of incidence, treatment, and outcomes [^6570b740]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The National Institutes of Health Office of Medical Applications of Research commissioned a structured literature review on the incidence, treatment, and outcomes of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as a background article for the State of the Science Conference on Diagnosis and Management of DCIS.

Methods

Published studies were identified and abstracted from MEDLINE and other sources. We include articles published between 1965 and January 31, 2009; 374 publications were identified that addressed DCIS incidence, staging, treatment, and outcomes in adult women.

Results

In the United States, DCIS incidence rose from 1.87 per 100 000 in 1973–1975 to 32.5 in 2004. Incidence increased in all ages but more so in women older than 50 years. Increased use of mammography explains some but not all of the increased incidence. Risk factors for incident DCIS include older age and family history. Although tamoxifen treatment prevented both invasive breast cancer and DCIS, raloxifene treatment decreased incidence of invasive breast cancer but not DCIS. Among patients with DCIS, magnetic resonance imaging was more sensitive than mammography for detecting multicentric disease and estimating tumor size. Because about 15% of patients with DCIS identified on core needle biopsy are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer after excision or mastectomy, the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy after excision is relevant to surgical management of DCIS. Most studies demonstrated that sentinel lymph node biopsy is feasible after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Younger age, positive surgical margins, tumor size and grade, and comedo necrosis were consistently related to DCIS recurrence. DCIS outcomes after either mastectomy or BCS plus radiation therapy were superior to BCS alone. Tamoxifen treatment after DCIS diagnosis reduced risk of recurrent disease.

Conclusions

Scientific questions deserving further investigation include the relationship between mammography use and DCIS incidence and whether imaging technologies and treatment guidelines can be modified to focus on lesions that are most likely to become clinically problematic.

### Is conservative management of ductal carcinoma in situ risky? [^52e89a1e]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is a group of complex and heterogeneous lesions. Currently, the incidence rate of DCIS in a general population of women aged 40 years and older is about 31.5 cases per 100,000 person-years and represents ~20–25% of all new breast neoplastic lesions diagnosed. There is marked heterogeneity in the clinical presentation, histologic features, genetic abnormalities, and biologic potential of DCIS. Clinically, DCIS can present as a palpable mass, nipple discharge, or Paget disease. The widespread use of population-based screening mammography has resulted in more than 85% of asymptomatic DCIS cases. However, despite substantial increases in the number of cases of pre-invasive and early-stage breast cancer detected, screening mammography has only marginally reduced the incidence of advanced-stage cancer at diagnosis. Moreover, DCIS is a precursor and many lesions will never progress to invasion in a patient's lifetime. As a result, there is strong interest in studying the factors which may reliably distinguish high-risk DCIS from indolent cases; the latter may potentially be managed by nonsurgical/active surveillance strategies.

### Dataset for pathology reporting of ductal carcinoma in situ, variants of lobular carcinoma in situ and low-grade lesions: recommendations from the international collaboration on cancer reporting (ICCR) [^8ca7437f]. Histopathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

To describe a new international dataset for pathology reporting of ductal carcinoma insitu (DCIS), variants of lobular carcinoma insitu (LCIS) and low-grade lesions (encapsulated papillary carcinoma, solid papillary carcinoma insitu, Paget's disease) produced by the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR).

Methods and Results

The ICCR, a global alliance of pathology bodies, uses a rigorous and efficient process for the development of evidence-based, structured datasets for pathology reporting of common cancers. Their aim is to support quality pathology reporting and engender understanding between the breast surgeon, pathologist, and oncologist for optimal and uniform patient management globally. Here we describe the dataset for DCIS, some variants of LCIS (namely the pleomorphic and the florid variants), and low-grade lesions by a multidisciplinary panel of internationally recognized experts. The agreed dataset comprises 12 core (required) and five noncore (recommended) elements suitable for both developed and low-income jurisdictions, derived from a review of current evidence. Areas of contention were addressed using a pragmatic approach in the absence of evidence. Use of all core elements is the minimum reporting standard for any individual case. Commentary is provided, explaining each element's clinical relevance, definitions to be applied where appropriate for the agreed list of value options and the rationale for considering the element as core or noncore.

Conclusion

This first internationally agreed dataset for DCIS, variants of LCIS, and low-grade lesions reporting will enable their standardization of pathology reporting and enhance clinicopathological communication leading to improved patient outcomes. Widespread adoption will also facilitate international comparisons, multinational clinical trials, and help to improve the management of breast disease globally.

### Identifying recurrences and metastasis after ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast [^b3666f73]. Histopathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is a non‐invasive tumour that has the potential to progress to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Thus, it represents a treatment dilemma: alone it does not present a risk to life, however, left untreated it may progress to a life‐threatening condition. Current clinico‐pathological features cannot accurately predict which patients with DCIS have invasive potential, and therefore clinicians are unable to quantify the risk of progression for an individual patient. This leads to many women being over‐treated, while others may not receive sufficient treatment to prevent invasive recurrence. A better understanding of the molecular features of DCIS, both tumour‐intrinsic and the microenvironment, could offer the ability to better predict which women need aggressive treatment, and which can avoid therapies carrying significant side‐effects and such as radiotherapy. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge of DCIS, and consider future research directions.

### Radiation therapy for duct carcinoma in situ: who needs radiation therapy, who doesn' t? [^c5745a25]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a common but non-life-threatening breast cancer. Four large prospective randomized trials comparing radiation therapy (RT) with none after breast-conservation surgery have all concluded that the use of RT reduces the risk of a local recurrence (LR) in the ipsilateral breast by at least 50%. More information is needed to assess the role of antiestrogen therapy when RT is not given. When markers are validated to predict which patients will have an invasive LR versus another DCIS or no LR, it is hoped that the discussion with the patient will clarify the situation further.

From DCIS to invasive breast cancer

Proposed mechanisms for the development of invasive breast cancer

Although the natural course of the intraductal process is unknown, DCIS is considered to be a non-obligate precursor of invasive breast cancer. Four evolutionary models have been proposed to describe the progression of DCIS into invasive breast cancer (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Overview of models showing four different theories of progression from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive breast cancer

The first model is the independent lineage model. On the basis of mathematical simulations of the observed frequencies of the histological grade of DCIS and the histological grade of invasive disease in the same biopsy sample, Sontag et al. proposed that in situ and invasive cell populations arise from different cell lineages and develop in parallel and independently of each other. – In support of this theory, Narod et al.state that small clusters of cancer cells with metastatic ability spread concomitantly through various routes to different organs and can therefore give rise to DCIS, invasive breast cancer and metastatic deposits simultaneously. Recent studies elucidating molecular differences between DCIS and invasive breast cancer further support the relevance of this model.

The convergent phenotype model proposes that different genotypes of DCIS could lead to invasive breast cancer of the same phenotype. Furthermore, this model assumes that all the cells within the DCIS duct have the same genetic aberrations but that the combination of aberrations could differ between ducts (within the same DCIS lesion). Hernandez et al. demonstrated similarity in the genomic profiles of DCIS and invasive breast cancer in the majority of the matched pairs. However, in some cases, DCIS and adjacent invasive breast cancer differ in copy number and gene mutations, supporting the notion that, at least in some cases, progression is driven by specific clones leading to the same phenotype.

In the evolutionary bottleneck model, individual cells within a duct are considered to accumulate different genetic aberrations; however, only a subpopulation of cells with a specific genetic profile is able to overcome an evolutionary bottleneck and invade into the adjacent tissue. This bottleneck model is supported by studies that report high genetic concordance between in situ and invasive lesions in addition to some differences between DCIS and invasive disease.

The multidisciplinary guidelines for management of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast from the American College of Radiology, the American College of Surgeons, the College of American Pathology, and the Society of Surgical Oncology have been updated to take into account continuing advances in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. The continued growth in mammographic evaluation and technology has resulted in an increase in the diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS). The resulting guidelines provide a framework for clinical decision-making for patients with DCIS based on review of relevant literature, and includes information on patient selection and evaluation, technical aspects of surgical treatment, techniques of irradiation, and follow-up care.

Invasive, genetically abnormal carcinoma progenitor cells have been propagated from human and mouse breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions, providing new insights into breast cancer progression. The survival of DCIS cells in the hypoxic, nutrient-deprived intraductal niche could promote genetic instability and the derepression of the invasive phenotype. Understanding potential survival mechanisms, such as autophagy, that might be functioning in DCIS lesions provides strategies for arresting invasion at the pre-malignant stage. A new, open trial of neoadjuvant therapy for patients with DCIS constitutes a model for testing investigational agents that target malignant progenitor cells in the intraductal niche.

### Quality of life among patients with ductal carcinoma in situ [^00549ec8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a nonobligate precursor breast cancer accounting for approximately 20% to 25% of newly diagnosed lesions that are commonly classified as malignant. Rates of DCIS diagnosis have risen significantly with widespread screening mammography. DCIS, often referred to as preinvasive or stage 0 cancer, is considered a key precursor to invasive breast cancer (IBC), with high-grade subtypes more likely to progress to IBC if left untreated. The goal of treatment in DCIS is to reduce the risk of this progression. Surgical treatment options for DCIS vary and include wide local excision (WLE), with or without radiation, as well as mastectomy. Survival following these treatments is high, with 10-year disease-specific survival exceeding 98%, but patient choice in receiving these treatments varies. We previously demonstrated that the process of treatment decision-making in DCIS is dynamic and influenced by surgeon recommendation, self-reported importance of keeping one's breast, and cancer worry.

### Cancer outcomes in women without upfront surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ: observational cohort study [^e3740761]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

As with all interventions for asymptomatic pre-cancers, the benefit-harm trade-offs for an individual patient must be considered in the context of the patient's ability to accrue the long term oncologic benefits from treatment. Previous studies show that patients report long term pain and neuropathy after breast conserving surgery, especially when it is combined with radiation. Generally, however, breast conserving surgery has few morbidities and is well tolerated by patients. In addition, both the practical and psychosocial burdens of ongoing surveillance must be considered. Although the optimal surveillance strategy in patients without upfront surgery is unknown, it may have different burdens from those in patients undergoing initial surgery, with the associated potential for worry and anxiety.

Although this descriptive study alone cannot change practice, the data presented here provide two important perspectives for patients and their healthcare providers. Firstly, DCIS should not be categorically regarded as "cancer", with the attendant fears of cancer dissemination and death. Especially in those patients with low risk disease who may have competing health risks requiring a delay to surgery, an active monitoring approach is not likely to pose undue oncologic dangers. Secondly, the eight year risk of a cancer event following a diagnosis of DCIS does not exceed 11% and is comparable to the magnitude of risk conferred by other high risk histologies such as atypia. This level of risk should be part of the conversation as patients consider their treatment options and underscores the central role of patient education and shared decision making, particularly in the setting of low risk DCIS. The findings from ongoing prospective clinical trials that collect patient reported outcomes will inform how any perceived benefit to the patient or population more broadly should be balanced against the side effects of treatment and the resource utilization expended for surgery, potential reconstruction, and radiation in this favorable risk population.

Conclusions

In women who did not receive initial surgery on diagnosis of DCIS, the eight year cumulative incidence of invasive cancer in the same breast was 10.7% overall and 8.5% in women with low risk DCIS. Effective risk stratification tools and shared decision making are essential in this patient population.

### Effects of patient selection on the applicability of results from a randomised clinical trial (EORTC 10853) investigating breast-conserving therapy for DCIS [^786d181a]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Selection of patients for randomised clinical trials may have a large impact on the applicability of the study results to the general population presenting the same disorder. However, clinical characteristics and outcome data on non-entered patients are usually not available. The effects of patient selection for the EORTC 10853 trial investigating the role of radiotherapy in breast conserving therapy for ductal carcinoma in situ have been studied, in an analysis of all patients treated for ductal carcinoma in situ in five participating institutes. The reasons for not entering patients were evaluated and treatment results of the randomised patients were compared to those not entered. A total of 910 patients were treated for ductal carcinoma in situ. Of these, 477 (52%) were ineligible, with the size of the lesion being the main reason for ineligibility (30% of all ductal carcinoma in situ). Of the 433 eligible patients, 278 (64%) were randomised into the trial. The main reasons for non-entry of eligible patients were either physicians' preference for one of the treatment arms (26%) or patients' refusal (9%). These percentages showed significant variation among the institutes. At 4 years follow-up, those patients not entered in the trial and treated with local excision and radiotherapy, had higher local recurrence rates than the patients randomised in the trial and treated with the same approach, (17 vs 2%, P = 0.03). The patients treated with local excision alone had equal local recurrence rates (11% in both groups). Selection of patients may explain the differences in outcome of the randomised patients, and those not-entered. Thus, the results of this trial may not be applicable to all patients with ductal carcinoma in situ.

### Biology of ductal carcinoma in situ classification based on biologic potential [^cd8a298c]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has increased significantly during the last decade, comprising almost 20% of all breast cancers diagnosed today. DCIS is composed of malignant breast duct epithelial cells that have clonally proliferated and accumulated within the mammary duct lumen. It comprises a group of heterogeneous tumors with varying biologic behavior rendering its classification and management challenging. By definition, DCIS does not invade through the basement membrane; it is a preinvasive malignancy and systemic disease is nonexistent. The basis of treatment is to prevent progression into an invasive cancer such as ductal carcinoma. Most current DCIS classification schemes do not predict its potential to progress to invasive disease. In this review the natural history of DCIS, as it relates to its biologic potential to progress to invasive disease, is summarized, and a broad classification system that may provide a guideline for patient management is proposed.

### A morphometric signature to identify ductal carcinoma in situ with a low risk of progression [^d916d0b0]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

AI-tools have been developed in cancer pathology to make predictions beyond the subjective interpretation by the pathologist, including outcome and treatment response –. However, AI algorithms often lack interpretability regarding the predicting features that are evaluated and recognized. For instance, Klimov et al.developed a machine learning-based model to predict recurrence risk in primary DCIS using H&E WSIs. They reported promising accuracy values to identify high-risk DCIS (HR = 6.39, 95%CI 3.0–13.8). However, their model was built based on features that cannot be explained or related to our current clinical and biological knowledge on DCIS. This might hamper acceptance in the clinic as a risk stratification tool. Additionally, the number of DCIS samples analyzed was limited, the patients were not uniformly treated, and the test dataset was composed by grade 3 DCIS lesions only.

In previous decades, the measurement of geometric features and spatial arrangement of DCIS lesions would not be feasible using classical microscopy and H&E glass slides only. Here, we developed a hand-crafted pathologist-trained AI-based tool that provides an output of explainable features relating to DCIS histology, which consequently contributes to developing trust and transparency into an AI decision making process. We also used a large patient dataset (n = 689), treated with BCS only, and including DCIS lesions from various histologic grade and growth patterns. It is important to mention that the use of ground truth information to train the AI algorithm can be time consuming and might feed human bias into the models. Since the calculation of the morphometric features and the segmentation learning process were blinded to the clinical outcome variables, AIDmap has a relatively simple architecture and lower computation cost.

### Heterogeneity of ductal carcinoma in situ and its effects on management [^f50d4137]. The Lancet: Oncology (2006). Medium credibility.

Data derived from histopathological analysis, natural history, radiological characteristics, molecular markers, and clinical outcome indicate that ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous disease, meaning that no one treatment strategy is best, but rather that treatment should be personalised and entail a systematic and rigorous multidisciplinary approach. Many women with DCIS will develop actual invasive carcinoma over time, whereas others-especially those with low-grade cancers-will not. At the moment, identification of patients at low risk of recurrence risk is very difficult (that is, such people for whom further treatment beyond lumpectomy is not needed). In this context, molecular profiling analysis is a promising method to guide management decisions. In this Review, various treatment strategies for DCIS will be reviewed, highlighting the limitations of randomised trials. Furthermore, discussions about the role of sentinel-node biopsy and tamoxifen in disease management; locoregional recurrence; and special clinical scenarios such as recurrent disease, DCIS after thoracic radiotherapy, ductal carcinoma with concurrent lobular carcinoma in situ, and DCIS in elderly people and in men will be presented.

### Identifying recurrences and metastasis after ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast [^d0917b3d]. Histopathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Ductal carcinoma insitu (DCIS) of the breast is a non-invasive tumour that has the potential to progress to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Thus, it represents a treatment dilemma: alone it does not present a risk to life, however, left untreated it may progress to a life-threatening condition. Current clinico-pathological features cannot accurately predict which patients with DCIS have invasive potential, and therefore clinicians are unable to quantify the risk of progression for an individual patient. This leads to many women being over-treated, while others may not receive sufficient treatment to prevent invasive recurrence. A better understanding of the molecular features of DCIS, both tumour-intrinsic and the microenvironment, could offer the ability to better predict which women need aggressive treatment, and which can avoid therapies carrying significant side-effects and such as radiotherapy. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge of DCIS, and consider future research directions.

### Assessing the benefit of radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery for ductal carcinoma-in-situ [^45aa4804]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess women's preferences regarding the trade-off between the risks and benefits of treatment with radiation therapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS).

Patients and Methods

Utilities were obtained from 120 patients and 210 nonpatients for eight relevant health states using standard gambles.

Results

Differences in utilities obtained from patient and nonpatient participants between health states were relatively similar. Reduction in the likelihood of local recurrence associated with RT did not result in higher utilities. Utilities for noninvasive recurrence were only lower after initial treatment with RT. Patient and nonpatient participants had the lowest utilities for invasive local recurrence, regardless of initial treatment or manner of salvage therapy. When comparing patient and nonpatient utilities directly, patients had higher utility for being without recurrence after initial RT and lower utility for invasive recurrence salvaged by mastectomy after initial BCS alone. None of the clinical or sociodemographic factors examined explained more than 5% of the variability in the patients' or nonpatients' utilities or their differences.

Conclusion

The principal benefit associated with adding RT to BCS for DCIS seems to be its ability to reduce invasive recurrences.

### Association of a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ with death from breast cancer [^5377d831]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) refers to the histological appearance of cancer cells within the breast ductule/lobule without evidence of cancer cells present beyond the basement membrane.DCIS is generally identified in asymptomatic women who undergo screening mammography. Approximately 3% of women with DCIS will die of breast cancer within 20 years; however, the risk is greater for young women and Black women.

It is believed that DCIS in itself is not life-threatening but can progress to invasive breast cancer. The 2 goals of treatment are to prevent invasive ipsilateral recurrence and to prevent death from breast cancer. It is proposed that death from breast cancer following a diagnosis of DCIS is a consequence of the intervening invasive breast cancer and that control of invasive ipsilateral recurrence is a critical step in preventing death from breast cancer. Treatment options include surgical procedures (ie, lumpectomy or mastectomy), radiation, and hormonal therapy.

Under ideal circumstances, all local invasive recurrences would be prevented, as would all deaths from breast cancer following DCIS. If the absolute risk of dying of breast cancer for women with DCIS fell below that of the general population, this would be a strong argument in favor of current treatment protocols for DCIS and an endorsement of screening in general. On the other hand, if the mortality rate from breast cancer among women with DCIS was found to be much higher than that of the general population, this would require reevaluation of the underlying 2-step model as well as reconsideration of the current treatment paradigm. In this study using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry data, we estimated the risk of dying of breast cancer after a diagnosis of DCIS and compared this with the risk of a woman in the general population who is breast cancer–free at the time of follow-up.

### The role of clinical trials in changing therapy for ductal carcinoma in situ [^f0ca9ae7]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Some aspects of the diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are well established, but consideration of other variables may be critical to optimize treatment. Mastectomy was once standard surgery, to reduce the probability of invasive breast carcinoma recurrence (to < 1%). However, the ability to control DCIS to a comparable extent but without resorting to mastectomy has been a major goal. There are indications from clinical studies that excision plus radiation therapy is as effective as mastectomy in reducing recurrence in patients with low-risk DCIS. Furthermore, following surgery and irradiation with long-term endocrine therapy appears to further reduce the risk of local DCIS progression. Variables that should be considered in making a treatment decision are extent of disease within the breast, nuclear grade of the lesion, age of the patient, and margin of surgical excision. Several randomized trials are currently evaluating the clinical value of these variables in optimizing treatment for patients with low-risk DCIS. Future improvements in treatment may depend on more sophisticated cellular and molecular markers of disease extent and prognosis at diagnosis.

### Management of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: a review [^6c1965b5]. JAMA Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ductal carcinoma in situ:

- **Definition**: DCIS of the breast is the proliferation of malignant epithelial cells within the mammary ductal system without involving the basement membrane or invasion into the surrounding stroma.
- **Pathophysiology**: DCIS is caused mainly by chromosomal imbalances including loss of heterozygosity and overexpression of the HER2/neu proto-oncogene and mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene.
- **Disease course**: DCIS is clinically silent in most cases; however, a breast lump or bloody nipple discharge may be present. Progression may lead to invasive breast cancer.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: DCIS is not associated with any excess risk of death, except in women aged < 50 years with a standard mortality ratio of 3.44 (95% CI 1.85–6.40).

### Modeling the effectiveness of initial management strategies for ductal carcinoma in situ [^44dd3c54]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and the marked variability in patterns of care highlight the need for comparative effectiveness research. We sought to quantify the tradeoffs among alternative management strategies for DCIS with respect to disease outcomes and breast preservation.

Methods

We developed a disease simulation model integrating data from the published literature to simulate the clinical events after six treatments (lumpectomy alone, lumpectomy with radiation, lumpectomy with radiation and tamoxifen, lumpectomy with tamoxifen, and mastectomy with and without breast reconstruction) for women with newly diagnosed DCIS. Outcomes included disease-free, invasive disease-free, and overall survival and breast preservation.

Results

For a cohort of 1 million simulated women aged 45 years at diagnosis, both mastectomy and lumpectomy with radiation and tamoxifen were associated with a 12-month improvement in overall survival relative to lumpectomy alone. Adding radiation therapy to lumpectomy resulted in a 6-month improvement in overall survival but decreased long-term breast-preservation outcomes (likelihood of lifetime breast preservation = 0.781 vs 0.843 for lumpectomy alone). This decrement with radiation therapy was mitigated by the addition of tamoxifen (likelihood of lifetime breast preservation = 0.846).

Conclusions

Overall survival benefits of the six management strategies for DCIS are within 1 year, suggesting that treatment decisions can be informed by the patient's preference for breast preservation and disutility for recurrence. Our delineation of personalized outcomes for each strategy can help patients understand the implications of their treatment choice, so their decisions may reflect their own personal values and help improve the quality of care for patients with DCIS.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ: current concepts in biology, imaging, and treatment [^f8ac7005]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is a group of heterogeneous epithelial proliferations confined to the milk ducts that nearly always present in asymptomatic women on breast cancer screening. A stage 0, preinvasive breast cancer, increased detection of DCIS was initially hailed as a means to prevent invasive breast cancer through surgical treatment with adjuvant radiation and/or endocrine therapies. However, controversy in the medical community has emerged in the past two decades that a fraction of DCIS represents overdiagnosis, leading to unnecessary treatments and resulting morbidity. The imaging hallmarks of DCIS include linearly or segmentally distributed calcifications on mammography or nonmass enhancement on breast MRI. Imaging features have been shown to reflect the biological heterogeneity of DCIS lesions, with recent studies indicating MRI may identify a greater fraction of higher-grade lesions than mammography does. There is strong interest in the surgical, imaging, and oncology communities to better align DCIS management with biology, which has resulted in trials of active surveillance and therapy that is less aggressive. However, risk stratification of DCIS remains imperfect, which has limited the development of precision therapy approaches matched to DCIS aggressiveness. Accordingly, there are opportunities for breast imaging radiologists to assist the oncology community by leveraging advanced imaging techniques to identify appropriate patients for the less aggressive DCIS treatments.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ: to treat or not to treat, that is the question [^26a72d31]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

DCIS incidence

The number of women diagnosed with DCIS over the past few decades largely follows the introduction of population-based breast cancer screening. – The European standardised rate of in situ lesions has increased four-fold, from 4.90 per 100,000 women in 1989 (accounting for 4.5% of all diagnoses registered as breast cancer) to 20.68 in 2011 (accounting for 12.8% of all diagnoses registered as breast cancer;). Of all in situ breast lesions reported, 80% are DCIS. Nevertheless, the incidence of mortality from early-stage breast cancer has not decreased concurrently with DCIS detection and treatment, indicating that managing DCIS does not reduce breast-cancer-specific mortality and therefore could be considered as overtreatment. A review of autopsies in women of all ages revealed a median prevalence of 8.9% (range 0–14.7%). For woman aged > 40 years, this prevalence was 7–39%, whereas breast cancer is diagnosed in only 1% of women in the same age range. These data suggest that a large number of women might have an undetected source of DCIS that will never become symptomatic.

### Cumulative 6-year risk of screen-detected ductal carcinoma in situ by screening frequency [^1a297d1c]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does cumulative risk of screen-detected ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) vary according to mammography screening interval and clinical risk factors?

Findings

For this cohort study, a well-calibrated model was developed to predict cumulative 6-year risk of screen-detected DCIS in 916 931 women. Compared with women undergoing biennial mammography, those undergoing annual mammography had a 40% to 45% higher 6-year cumulative risk of screen-detected DCIS, whereas those undergoing triennial mammography had lower risk.

Meaning

This risk model provides estimates of the 6-year probability of screen-detected DCIS and can inform discussions of screening benefits and harms for those considering a screening interval other than biennial.

### Evolving paradigm for imaging, diagnosis, and management of DCIS [^7a83a534]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the biology of breast cancer has dramatically expanded over the past decade, revealing that breast cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases. This new knowledge can generate insights to improve screening performance and the management of ductal carcinoma in situ. In this article, the authors review the current state of the science of breast cancer and tools that can be used to improve screening and risk assessment. They describe several opportunities to improve clinical screening: (1) radiologists interpreting mammograms should aim to differentiate between the risk for invasive cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ to better assess the time frame for disease progression and the need for and optimal timing of biopsy; (2) imaging features associated with low risk, slow-growing cancer versus high risk, fast-growing cancer should be better defined and taught; and (3) as we learn more about assessing an individual's risk for developing breast cancer, we should incorporate these factors into a strategy for personalized screening to maximize benefit and minimize harm.

### Patient preferences for outcomes following DCIS management strategies: a discrete choice experiment [^6c567f01]. JCO Oncology Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a nonobligate precursor of breast cancer, is often aggressively managed with multimodal therapy. However, there is limited research on patients' preferences for trade-offs among treatment-related outcomes such as breast appearance, side effects, and future cancer risk. We sought to investigate whether women consider treatment features aside from cancer risk when making treatment choices for ductal carcinoma in situ and if so, to what degree other features influence these decisions.

Methods

A discrete choice experiment was administered to participants in a comprehensive cancer screening mammography clinic. The experimental design was used to generate constructed health profiles resulting from different management strategies. Health profiles were defined by breast appearance, severity of infection within the first year, chronic pain, hot flashes, and risk of developing or dying from breast cancer within 10 years.

Results

One hundred ninety-four women without a personal history of breast cancer completed the choice task. Across 10 choice questions, 29% always selected the health profile with a lower risk of invasive breast cancer (ie, dominated on cancer risk), regardless of the effects of treatment. For nonrisk dominators, breast cancer risk remained the most important factor but was closely followed by chronic pain (24% [95% CI, 20 to 28]) and infection (22% [95% CI, 18 to 25]). Depending on treatment outcomes, the tolerable increase in breast cancer risk was as high as 3.4%.

Conclusion

Most women were willing to make some trade-offs between invasive cancer risk and treatment-related outcomes. Our findings highlight the importance of shared decision-making weighing risks and benefits between patient and provider management of low-risk disease.

### Identifying recurrences and metastasis after ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast [^9b7cf167]. Histopathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Future perspectives

DCIS has been a biological and clinical conundrum for many years. Elucidating the natural history of this group of diseases has been challenging, due to the need for collating large cohorts of patients together with techniques that were generally low‐throughput or low‐resolution. We now have the establishment of a large series of patients through multiple consortia, e.g. PREvent ductal Carcinoma In Situ Invasive Overtreatment Now (PRECISION) initiative, or leveraging from multiple sources and randomised clinical trials. These well‐annotated cohorts are being interrogated using innovative technologies including multi‐omics and spatial multiplexing to fully characterise the spectrum of DCIS. Ultimately this will lead to improved therapeutic decision‐making, mainly concerning urgently needed de‐escalation strategies. Clinical tests that can be used on biopsies to determine the likelihood of DCIS progression and identifying those suitable for any adjuvant therapies are now being validated. However, for full clinical application, a long‐term prospective implementation trial may be required.

### Surgical margins in breast conserving surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast and clinical outcomes: a national audit with long term follow-up [^36247908]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This audit has identified a number of risk factors for patients diagnosed with DCIS. Patients undergoing BCS with histological margins of < 2 mm, adjusted for other clinical factors, have significantly worse time to recurrence (TTR) compared to margins ≥ 2 mm. The risk of recurrence also increases as the number of BCSs/operations to obtain adequate margins increases from one through to ≥ 3 operations. The rate of recurrence across 14 years runs at 1.2% per annum without any evidence thus far of plateau. The audit also reports that ∼80% of recurrences were invasive breast cancers which carry a risk to those patients of developing overt metastatic disease at some future timepoint. All of these risks should be explained when discussing surgical options with patients.

Key Points

Question

Is there a short-term reduction in health-related quality of life associated with breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ?

Findings

In this cohort study of 244 women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, a short-term reduction in quality of life associated with MRI was revealed, primarily owing to fear before the test and fear and physical discomfort during the test.

Meaning

Understanding the potential reduction in quality of life associated with MRI in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ may allow development of targeted interventions to improve the patient's experience.

### Genomic analysis defines clonal relationships of ductal carcinoma in situ and recurrent invasive breast cancer [^043c2935]. Nature Genetics (2022). High credibility.

The finding that one in five ipsilateral invasive cancers following DCIS are not clonally related has fundamental biologic implications: first, DCIS can no longer be considered solely as a precursor lesion, but rather also a risk lesion for development of further invasive disease. This is similar to the role that has been ascribed to lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), where there is both an increased risk of subsequent ipsilateral and contralateral invasive disease. Second, the true risk of recurrence from the same population of preinvasive tumor cells has probably been overestimated, thereby confounding the potential benefit of radiotherapy, as radiation probably prevents clonal progression rather than preventing initiation of a new neoplastic process. Third, these data have important implications for accurate identification of predictive biomarkers for invasive progression, since, in clonally unrelated DCIS, the notion of biomarkers predictive of invasion is irrelevant. These data may explain why it has been so challenging to identify predictive biomarkers of progression to invasive disease to date, further underscoring the need to characterize DCIS more comprehensively in the context of the stroma in future studies.

Important future directions will include identifying those factors that contribute to dormancy of DCIS cells and their reactivation to establish invasive disease years to decades later, and understanding the role of nongenetic factors, such as the tumor microenvironment, in invasive progression. These biological insights are essential to enable well-informed DCIS treatment decisions that will help avoid overtreatment of low-risk DCIS that likely will never progress, while still providing appropriately aggressive treatment for high-risk DCIS with greatest invasive potential.

In conclusion, we performed extensive genomic characterization of the primary tumor and matched recurrence in one of the largest cohorts of patients treated for DCIS who subsequently developed an ipsilateral invasive cancer. Although the majority of subsequent invasive cancers were clonally related to the primary DCIS, a substantial subset was unrelated to the index DCIS. Our findings show that DCIS is not only a precursor to invasive cancer, but also a potential marker of a field effect for which surgery may have a limited role. These insights suggest an increasingly important rationale for developing nonsurgical approaches to effectively reduce increased breast cancer risk in these patients.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ: treatment update and current trends [^e2d5ef99]. Current Oncology Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) traditionally has been managed through various combinations of surgery, radiation, and endocrine therapy. However, concern for under- or over-treatment of DCIS has led many surgeons to question historically standardized approaches and instead begin to tailor treatment based on individual prognostic indicators. Recent and ongoing clinical trials have investigated the potential for active surveillance in DCIS, the possibility of eliminating radiation therapy (RT), and ways in which adjuvant systemic therapy may be refined. This review will summarize the current trends in the treatment of DCIS, as well as highlight the most pertinent clinical trials that are shaping management today.

### Predictors of recurrence for ductal carcinoma in situ after breast-conserving surgery [^20589ec7]. The Lancet: Oncology (2013). Medium credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) constitutes a major public health problem, with up to half of screen-detected cancers representing pure forms of DCIS without evidence of invasion. A proportion of cases detected with routine screening would not have progressed to a life-threatening form of breast cancer during the patient's lifetime, and overdiagnosis of breast cancer is a cause for concern. Once DCIS has been detected, treatment is obligatory and present technologies do not allow accurate risk stratification such that intensity of treatment can be tailored to risk of recurrence and progression to invasive disease. Present management strategies are based on prognostic and predictive information derived from conventional histopathological and host factors. With increasing molecular characterisation of these preinvasive lesions, data will be available for how factors such as oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2, and indicators of proliferative activity can provide additional information about both prognosis and benefit from adjuvant treatments such as radiotherapy and hormonal therapy. Low-risk patients are especially poorly defined in terms of need for adjuvant therapies, which can be associated with both short-term adverse sequelae and long-term effects (eg, cardiotoxicity) that can affect all-cause mortality. Optimum risk prediction in the future is likely to be achieved by integration of both conventional and molecular factors, which should be incorporated into a validated predictive model to help with clinical decision making.

### How to navigate the treatment spectrum from multimodality therapy to observation alone for ductal carcinoma in situ [^a69cb011]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

DCIS detection has increased dramatically since the introduction of screening mammography. Current guidance concordant care recommends surgical intervention for all patients with DCIS, followed by radiation and/or endocrine therapy for some. Adjuvant therapies after surgical excision have reduced recurrence rates but not breast cancer mortality. Given the lack of evidence of current treatment regimens and the morbidity associated with these treatments, there is concern that DCIS is over-treated. Active surveillance may be a favorable alternative for selected patients and is currently being investigated through four international clinical trials.

### Long-term risk perceptions of women with ductal carcinoma in situ [^cbb6ff40]. The Oncologist (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Previous research has demonstrated that many women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) overestimate their risk for future breast cancer at the time of diagnosis and soon thereafter. This study aims to evaluate risk perceptions after 5 years.

Patients and Methods

In a longitudinal cohort study, we mailed long-term follow-up surveys to 315 women who had previously responded to a survey 18 months after they were diagnosed with DCIS, excluding those who had experienced recurrence and those not treated at our institution. We evaluated risk perceptions with items used previously in the cohort.

Results

One hundred ninety-three women (61%) responded. The median time since diagnosis was 5.9 years. We excluded 12 because of recurrence. Of the 181 remaining, 32% perceived at least a moderate 5-year risk for developing DCIS again, 43% perceived at least a moderate lifetime risk for developing DCIS again, 27% perceived at least a moderate 5-year risk for invasive breast cancer, 38% perceived at least a moderate lifetime risk for invasive breast cancer, and 24% perceived at least a moderate risk for DCIS spreading to other body parts. In a multivariate model, worse financial status and higher perceived risk in the previous survey were the only predictors of at least a moderate perception of risk for DCIS spreading.

Conclusion

Women with a history of DCIS continue to harbor inaccurate perceptions of their risk for future breast cancer events even 5 years after diagnosis.

### Evolving treatment paradigms for low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ: imaging needs [^6b7f2af3]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a nonobligate precursor to invasive cancer that classically presents as asymptomatic calcifications on screening mammography. The increase in DCIS diagnoses with organized screening programs has raised concerns about overdiagnosis, while a patientcentric push for more personalized care has increased awareness about DCIS overtreatment. The standard of care for most new DCIS diagnoses is surgical excision, but nonsurgical management via active monitoring is gaining attention, and multiple clinical trials are ongoing. Imaging, along with demographic and pathologic information, is a critical component of active monitoring efforts. Commonly used imaging modalities including mammography, ultrasound, and MRI, as well as newer modalities such as contrast-enhanced mammography and dedicated breast PET, can provide prognostic information to risk stratify patients for DCIS active monitoring eligibility. Furthermore, radiologists will be responsible for closely surveilling patients on active monitoring and identifying if invasive progression occurs. Active monitoring is a paradigm shift for DCIS care, but the success or failure will rely heavily on the interpretations and guidance of radiologists.

### Association of radiotherapy with survival in women treated for ductal carcinoma in situ with lumpectomy or mastectomy [^14abbdbb]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Similar results have been reported for patients with invasive cancer. In the 7 trials comparing mastectomy alone with lumpectomy and radiotherapy among women with node-negative invasive breast cancer, the rate ratio for local recurrence was 0.54 (P < .001) and the rate ratio for breast cancer mortality was 0.98 (P = 0.80). Several studies in patients with early invasive breast cancer have shown that lumpectomy and radiotherapy combined are superior to mastectomy in terms of survival, despite being less effective in terms of local control.,

These results support our conclusion that the survival benefits of radiotherapy seen in both patients with DCIS and patients with invasive breast cancer cannot be explained by improving local control. We must seek an alternative explanation, namely that radiation to the breast acts as a systemic therapy to eradicate subclinical latent metastases. If a patient dies of breast cancer following DCIS, it is reasonable to conclude that undetected metastatic deposits were present at the time of diagnosis, and that may lead to generalized metastatic clinical disease and death. Perhaps radiation induces an immune response or activates another defense mechanism, thereby preventing the emergence or expansion of subclinical metastatic clones. Possible considerations include radiation to the blood as it circulates through the breast, radiation to stromal elements in the breast matrix, and radiation scatter to tissues beyond the breast. These areas are deserving of future study.

Support for the notion that local radiation induces systemic antitumor effects is the observation of a significant reduction in contralateral invasive breast cancers in the matched comparison of lumpectomy and radiotherapy vs lumpectomy alone (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85 to 0.97) (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). A 2017 meta-analysis of all observational and randomized studies in patients with DCIS reported an HR for radiotherapy on contralateral breast cancer of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.44–1.82). Future studies are required to more closely examine this association. This study of patients with DCIS is ideal, as fewer patients will receive chemotherapy or other systemic therapies that could affect risk.

### Interobserver variability in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast [^c659ccbe]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Since most patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast are treated upon diagnosis, evidence on its natural progression to invasive carcinoma is limited. It is estimated that around half of the screen-detected DCIS lesions would have remained indolent if they had never been detected. Many patients with DCIS are therefore probably overtreated. Four ongoing randomized noninferiority trials explore active surveillance as a treatment option. Eligibility for these trials is mainly based on histopathologic features. Hence, the call for reproducible histopathologic assessment has never sounded louder.

Methods

Here, the available classification systems for DCIS are discussed in depth.

Results

This comprehensive review illustrates that histopathologic evaluation of DCIS is characterized by significant interobserver variability. Future digitalization of pathology, combined with development of deep learning algorithms or so-called artificial intelligence, may be an innovative solution to tackle this problem. However, implementation of digital pathology is not within reach for each laboratory worldwide. An alternative classification system could reduce the disagreement among histopathologists who use "conventional" light microscopy: the introduction of dichotomous histopathologic assessment is likely to increase interobserver concordance.

Conclusions

Reproducible histopathologic assessment is a prerequisite for robust risk stratification and adequate clinical decision-making. Two-tier histopathologic assessment might enhance the quality of care.

### Association of radiotherapy with survival in women treated for ductal carcinoma in situ with lumpectomy or mastectomy [^310bac2d]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is adjuvant radiation associated with a reduction in breast cancer mortality in patients treated for ductal carcinoma in situ?

Findings

Using a matched approach in a large cohort of patients treated for ductal carcinoma in situ, treatment with lumpectomy and radiotherapy was associated with a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer–specific mortality compared with treatment with lumpectomy alone (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.88) or mastectomy alone (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65–0.87).

Meaning

Adjuvant radiation is associated with a small but significant breast cancer survival benefit in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ that cannot be accounted for by enhancing local control.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ: to treat or not to treat, that is the question [^c452a573]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

One of the key molecular differences between DCIS and invasive breast cancer is the prevalence of HER2 amplification: 34% for DCISversus 13% for invasive disease.HER2 amplification might be a prognostic factor in predicting an in situ recurrence after DCIS, but it seems not to be predictive for an invasive recurrence. That said, one study with a long follow-up (mean follow-up > 15 years) counterintuitively demonstrated that HER2 positivity in primary DCIS was associated with a lower risk of late invasive breast cancer compared with HER2 negativity. In HER2-positive DCIS, TILs are present at higher levels, but an association with an invasive recurrence risk after DCIS has not been reported.

A caveat of molecular studies on DCIS is the fact that most studies examine relatively small series of DCIS lesions with a contemporaneously adjacent invasive component, instead of a metachronous (subsequent) invasive lesion developing during follow-up. Thus these series are inherently biased, because the majority of the DCIS lesions will never develop an invasive component. In addition, most studies do not distinguish between in situ or invasive recurrences after DCIS. Two biomarker-based assays have been developed for DCIS, which purport to predict the benefit of radiotherapy for DCIS. However, the assays only discriminate between the risk of an in situ versus an invasive recurrence after DCIS to a limited extent. This difference is important for the women involved, especially regarding treatment choices, prognosis and psychosocial impact. Furthermore, intratumoural heterogeneity complicates our understanding of the relationship between DCIS and its invasive counterpart, as most studies only analyse a small proportion of an often heterogeneous lesion or analyse a bulk tissue sample in which small cell populations are easily overlooked. The low number of samples and lack of longitudinal follow-up data mean that our overall molecular knowledge of the landscape of changes in DCIS is limited.

### Genomic analysis defines clonal relationships of ductal carcinoma in situ and recurrent invasive breast cancer [^ca267420]. Nature Genetics (2022). High credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the most common form of preinvasive breast cancer and, despite treatment, a small fraction (5–10%) of DCIS patients develop subsequent invasive disease. A fundamental biologic question is whether the invasive disease arises from tumor cells in the initial DCIS or represents new unrelated disease. To address this question, we performed genomic analyses on the initial DCIS lesion and paired invasive recurrent tumors in 95 patients together with single-cell DNA sequencing in a subset of cases. Our data show that in 75% of cases the invasive recurrence was clonally related to the initial DCIS, suggesting that tumor cells were not eliminated during the initial treatment. Surprisingly, however, 18% were clonally unrelated to the DCIS, representing new independent lineages and 7% of cases were ambiguous. This knowledge is essential for accurate risk evaluation of DCIS, treatment de-escalation strategies and the identification of predictive biomarkers.

### Is conservative management of ductal carcinoma in situ risky? [^945586f4]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Nonsurgical management of ductal carcinoma in situ is controversial and little is known about the long-term consequences of this approach. In this study, we aimed to determine the risk of (a) upstaging to invasive carcinoma at excision and (b) ipsilateral breast cancer events in patients who might have been eligible for nonsurgical management of DCIS trials. Data from women aged 20 years or older with a biopsy diagnosis of DCIS between January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2014 were collated. The women underwent biopsy and surgical resection (lumpectomy or mastectomy) and were treated with radiation or endocrine therapy as per treating physicians' choice. The development of ipsilateral breast cancer events (IBEs) was analyzed in patients with at least 5 years of follow-up after standard of care therapy for DCIS. Subset-analysis was undertaken to identify the incidence of IBEs in patients eligible for nonsurgical management trials. The study population consisted of 378 patients with matched cases of biopsy and surgical excision. The overall upstaging rate to IBC was 14.3 and 12.9% for COMET, 8.8% for LORIS, and 10.7% for LORD trial "eligible" patients. At 5 years of follow-up, ~11.5% of overall and trial eligible patients developed IBEs of which approximately half were invasive IBEs. In conclusion, women with DCIS who would have been eligible for nonsurgical management trials have a significantly high risk of developing ipsilateral breast events within 5 years of diagnosis. Better selection criteria are needed to identify DCIS patients who are at very low risk for the development of IBC.

### Guiding principles for the responsible development of artificial intelligence tools for healthcare [^1e8f4881]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Principle 8: AI tools should facilitate shared decision-making

Some machine learning algorithms — specifically 'black-box' deep learning algorithms — are difficult to explain and interpret. The need for AI tools to be explainable (the internal logic of the system can be understood) and interpretable (the cause of a decision can be understood) has been consistently recognized as a central principle by many organizations (Table 1). Opaque AI tools cannot be adequately evaluated and audited, undermine trust, and cannot facilitate shared, informed decision-making between patient and practitioner. Shared decision-making means that the patient is provided with adequate information about the intervention, which is considered along with their preferences and values (e.g. belief systems and risk tolerance) as a decision is made. This is challenging if the patient and practitioner do not understand how and why the AI tool arrived at a decision. An example is the case of offering patients diagnosed with DCIS either surgery or active surveillance. To facilitate this decision, the patient and practitioner would need to understand the risks and benefits of each option. If an AI tool is designed to assist with this decision, the patient and practitioner would also need to know how and why the recommendation was made and the advantages and limitations of the AI tool.

To ensure that AI tools make patient understanding and values central, AI researchers can utilize different explainability toolsand prioritize simpler, more intuitive algorithms. Another method recommended by Birch et al is to have AI risk prediction tools generate a continuous score rather than a fixed score so that decision threshold determination can be left to the patient and physician based on risk preferences.

### Radiotherapy in DCIS, an underestimated benefit? [^31ef8a62]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Often considered an "indolent" disease for which a treatment de-escalation is advocated, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast has been recently shown to be associated with a significant increase in long-term mortality in case of invasive local recurrence (LR). The publication of data from four randomised trials did not prevent the continuation of the debates about the pros and cons of postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) for optimal DCIS management. Actually only partial answers regarding the impact of PORT on local control had been brought by these randomised trials among others due to differences in pathological assessment among these controlled studies. A biologically heterogeneous disease, DCIS is characterised by a large variation in clinical behaviour, which hampers the identification of those patients for whom PORT might be considered as an overtreatment. At the light of the most recent biological and clinical studies, this review tries to identify accurately the LR risks associated with both tumour- and patient-related factors and to analyse the treatment-related parameters impacting significantly on the patient outcome.

### Genomic analysis defines clonal relationships of ductal carcinoma in situ and recurrent invasive breast cancer [^7df598fb]. Nature Genetics (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large dataset of matched DCIS-INV recurrence pairs, we have confirmed that primary DCIS can be a precursor to subsequent invasive cancer. However, our data show that not all ipsilateral invasive breast cancers are clonally related to previous DCIS, but rather 18% represent de novo primary cancers in the same breast. As such, our results confirm, on a much larger and detailed scale, the small study by Gorringe et al. showing unrelated recurrences. In patients with nonclonally related recurrences, the major question is what factors constituted the basis of risk in these women who developed two clonally different cancers in the same breast over time. We can speculate that such cases may be due to genetic predisposition as there is clear evidence that the known invasive breast cancer predisposition genes and polymorphisms also predispose to DCIS, particularly ER+ DCIS. However, the limited data on rare germline variants in this study does not support this theory. Another possibility is that a cancer field effect in the breast has greatly increased the probability of developing new cancers compared with the general population. The 'sick lobe' theory and field cancerization concepts may explain why, in an affected breast prone to tumorigenesis, despite wide local excision of DCIS with histologically clear margins and radiotherapy, a secondary tumor can emerge that is unrelated to the initial DCIS. Studies on tumor-adjacent normal tissue raise the possibility that nonmalignant precancerous cells contribute to recurrences.

Our data also show that at least 75% of the invasive recurrences are clonally related to the initial DCIS diagnosis, sharing a common genomic lineage that was established from the same ancestral cell in the breast (Extended Data Fig. 7). The genomic data show a very high concordance in both the driver mutations and chromosomal amplifications that were detected in both the DCIS and invasive disease in these patients. These findings support that genomic evolution occurs at the earliest stages of breast cancer progression (within the ducts) in which driver events including TP53, PIK3CA mutations and HER2 amplifications are present at the DCIS stage, before breaking through the basement membrane of the ducts to establish the invasive disease. These findings suggest that specific genomic mutations per se do not drive invasion, but that perhaps a critical combination of mutations and CNAs is required, or, alternatively, that characteristics of the tumor and surrounding microenvironment are present at the earliest stages of progression to permit invasion in the later stages of the disease. Further characterization of the DCIS microenvironment may reveal key stromal and immune factors that may create conditions that are permissive for invasion.

### The clinical significance of oestrogen receptor expression in breast ductal carcinoma in situ [^b442a674]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In countries with routine mammographic screening, one case of pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is diagnosed for every four cases of breast cancer (BC). The management of DCIS continues to be a challenge. Although DCIS is predominantly associated with a low risk of mortality, it is well documented that it could progress into invasive BC (IBC), with an associated increased mortality risk. Precise identification of the mortality risk has been difficult as most of the studies do not provide long-term (i.e. > 20 years) mortality data. For example, a woman in her 40s or 50s treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) who subsequently died following DCIS would normally develop an initial local invasive recurrence, then subsequently metastatic disease before eventually dying of BC. Furthermore, in the last 20 years, the average survival of patients with ER-positive primary or metastatic BC has increased. In addition, the psychological impact of a recurrence, in situ or invasive disease, must also not be underestimated. Currently, lack of a robust tool to identify low-risk DCIS results in recommendation that all women with DCIS undergo treatment. The results of clinical trials that provide no active treatment to low-risk DCIS are awaited.

### Current treatment and clinical trial developments for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast [^1d23d4c0]. The Oncologist (2007). Low credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the fastest growing subtype of breast cancer, mainly because of the aging of our populations and improvements in diagnostic mammography and core biopsy. DCIS represents a proliferation of malignant-appearing cells that have not invaded beyond the ductal basement membrane and is a precursor for the development of invasive breast cancer (IBC). Approximately 40% of patients with DCIS treated with biopsy alone, without complete excision or further therapy, develop IBC. Most DCIS itself is harmless if it is detected and excised before it can progress to IBC, and the current approach to DCIS treatment is aimed at just that goal. Typically, it consists of multimodal treatment including segmental mastectomy followed by radiation therapy to the whole breast and then hormonal therapy or total mastectomy followed by hormonal therapy. This review discusses the state-of-the-art in DCIS detection and treatment and highlights promising new strategies in the care of DCIS patients. The data regarding the effectiveness of breast-conserving surgery versus total mastectomy, the possible avoidance of radiation therapy in some subgroups of patients, and the role of hormonal agents are reviewed. Neoadjuvant therapy and the use of trastuzumab for DCIS are currently under investigation and may be future treatment options for DCIS.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) — initial evaluation and biomarkers — The recommended workup and staging of DCIS includes history and physical examination, bilateral diagnostic mammography, pathology review, determination of tumor estrogen receptor (ER) status, and MRI, as indicated. For pathology reporting, the NCCN Panel endorses the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Protocol for both invasive and noninvasive carcinomas of the breast. The NCCN Panel recommends testing for ER status in order to determine the benefit of adjuvant endocrine therapy or risk reduction, and the American Society for Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines state that progesterone receptor (PR) testing be considered optional. The NCCN Panel has concluded that HER2 status for DCIS does not alter the management strategy and therefore is not recommended for DCIS. Genetic counseling is recommended if the patient is considered to be at high risk for hereditary breast cancer as defined by the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic.

### Factors associated with underestimation of invasive cancer in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ: precautions for active surveillance [^9cbf7a17]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Recent recognition of the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) detected by mammography has led to the development of clinical trials randomizing women with non-high-grade DCIS to active surveillance, defined as imaging surveillance with or without endocrine therapy, vs standard surgical care.

Objective

To determine the factors associated with underestimation of invasive cancer in patients with a clinical diagnosis of non-high-grade DCIS that would preclude active surveillance.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using records from the National Cancer Database from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2012, of female patients 40 to 99 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of non-high-grade DCIS who underwent definitive surgical treatment. Data analysis was conducted from November 1, 2015, to February 4, 2017.

Exposures

Patients with an upgraded diagnosis of invasive carcinoma vs those with a diagnosis of DCIS based on final surgical pathologic findings.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The proportions of cases with an upgraded diagnosis of invasive carcinoma from final surgical pathologic findings were compared by tumor, host, and system characteristics.

Results

Of 37 544 women (mean [SD] age, 59.3 [12.4] years) presenting with a clinical diagnosis of non-high-grade DCIS, 8320 (22.2%) had invasive carcinoma based on final pathologic findings. Invasive carcinomas were more likely to be smaller (> 0.5 to ≤ 1.0 cm vs ≤ 0.5 cm: odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67–0.79; > 1.0 to ≤ 2.0 cm vs ≤ 0.5 cm: OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.39–0.46; > 2.0 to ≤ 5.0 cm vs ≤ 0.5 cm: OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.17–0.22; and > 5.0 cm vs ≤ 0.5 cm: OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.08–0.15) and lower grade (intermediate vs low: OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.69–0.80). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that younger age (60–79 vs 40–49 years: OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77–0.92; and ≥ 80 vs 40 to 49 years: OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64–0.91), negative estrogen receptor status (positive vs negative: OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.34–0.43), treatment at an academic facility (academic vs community: OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.82–2.38), and higher annual income (> $63 000 vs < $38 000: OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02–1.28) were significantly associated with an upgraded diagnosis of invasive carcinoma based on final pathologic findings.

Conclusions and Relevance

When selecting patients for active surveillance of DCIS, factors other than tumor biology associated with invasive carcinoma based on final pathologic findings may need to be considered. At the time of randomization to active surveillance, a significant proportion of patients with non-high-grade DCIS will harbor invasive carcinoma.

### Clinical utility of the 12-gene DCIS score assay: impact on radiotherapy recommendations for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ [^db58daa9]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) comprises a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions confined to the breast ducts. The incidence of DCIS has increased dramatically over the last quarter-century, since mammography in most women aged 40 years and older became routine.DCIS now accounts for nearly 18% of all breast cancers diagnosed in the US.

The current treatment paradigm for DCIS involves initial mastectomy or lumpectomy [also known as breast-conserving surgery (BCS)], often with radiotherapy following lumpectomy and endocrine therapy for patients with hormone receptor-positive disease. Rates of ipsilateral or local recurrence after BCS alone can range from 14 to 60% at 10 years, and the addition of radiotherapy reduces the risk by at least half.–None of the randomized trials comparing BCS alone against BCS with radiotherapy has identified a patient subgroup that did not experience a reduction in the risk of local recurrence with radiotherapy after BCS, nor has there been a change in disease-specific or overall survival from adding radiotherapy detected in any of the trials.

A clinical conundrum now exists for patients diagnosed with DCIS: against the backdrop of increased detection of DCIS and reduced recurrence risk with BCS plus radiotherapy, there has been little change over time in the incidence of invasive disease related to DCIS or the rate of breast cancer-related death with BCS plus radiotherapy in patients with DCIS. The increased incidence of DCIS stemming from the adoption of widespread mammographic screening has included proportionally more cases with less adverse clinicopathologic features. Two clinical trials conducted in this more modern DCIS cohort have revealed relatively lower event rates for recurrence post-lumpectomy, either with or without radiotherapy. This supports then that patients with DCIS undergoing BCS do not benefit uniformly from radiotherapy and therefore the treatment approach may represent overtreatment (i.e. the risks of radiotherapy outweigh the benefits) for many in current practice. There is no means to reliably identify individual patients most likely to have a recurrence, who would meaningfully benefit from added radiotherapy.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ: to treat or not to treat, that is the question [^1ae306e2]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Current diagnosis and imaging

DCIS is usually straightforward to detect by mammography because of its association with calcifications; the proliferation of cells itself is not visible on the mammogram. However, as only 75% of all DCIS lesions contain calcifications, a substantial percentage of DCIS lesions will not be detected by mammography, implying that some lesions might be mammographically occult or that the diameter of the area containing calcifications underestimates the extent of DCIS. This suggests that DCIS might be left behind following breast-conserving treatment in a proportion of cases.

After detection, the lesion is classified by the pathologist by histological features as low, medium or high grade, which is assumed to correspond to the level of aggressiveness. Surprisingly, many grading systems exist. An agreement on classification was reached during a consensus meeting in the USA where consensus was reached to include nuclear grade, presence of necrosis, cell polarisation and architectural patterns in the pathology report. Some studies showed a slight tendency for high-grade DCIS to progress to invasive breast cancer, but others demonstrated that grade is not significantly associated with the risk of local invasive recurrence. Greater consistency in grading could result in more certainty about the association of morphology with progression and outcome. In addition, as grade is not a perfect discriminator for progression risk, other risk discriminators, such as molecular biomarkers, are examined (discussed later in 'Molecular, cellular and microenvironmental aspects').

### Increased risk of second malignancies after in situ breast carcinoma in a population-based registry [^a6155ccc]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of ductal breast carcinoma in situ has increased in the Netherlands, partly as a consequence of screening, from 0.3 per 100 000 in 1975 to 13.4 per 100 000 in 1997. Women with previous breast cancer are known to carry a two-fold increased risk of second cancer in comparison to the general population. Studies assessing the risk of second cancer following the diagnosis of BCIS (breast carcinoma in situ) are however scarce or only focused on the risk of second breast cancer.

An increased risk of 2.0–7.2 for breast cancer following the diagnosis of BCIS has been reported, the probability that a breast cancer will develop in BCIS patients being 26% after 20 years of follow-up. This is as high as the risk of second breast cancer found for patients with malignant breast carcinoma. Excess risk of second breast cancer is not explained by treatment choice (i.e. radiotherapy) for BCIS, suggesting a shared aetiology (hereditary or lifestyle) for both first and second cancer. In addition to second breast cancer, other cancers were diagnosed in 17% of DCIS and 3.2% of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) patients. However, no previous studies assessed the risks of different types of second cancer in BCIS patients.

The aim of the study is to assess the risk pattern for second cancer after diagnosis of BCIS and to compare it with that found for malignant breast carcinoma, thereby examining the impact of age, breast cancer screening policy at the time of primary BCIS diagnosis and treatment for various subtypes of BCIS.

### Gene expression signatures of individual ductal carcinoma in situ lesions identify processes and biomarkers associated with progression towards invasive ductal carcinoma [^ab8eb683]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is considered a non-invasive precursor to breast cancer, and although associated with an increased risk of developing invasive disease, many women with DCIS will never progress beyond their in situ diagnosis. The path from normal duct to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is not well understood, and efforts to do so are hampered by the substantial heterogeneity that exists between patients, and even within patients. Here we show gene expression analysis from > 2,000 individually micro-dissected ductal lesions representing 145 patients. Combining all samples into one continuous trajectory we show there is a progressive loss in basal layer integrity heading towards IDC, coupled with two epithelial to mesenchymal transitions, one early and a second coinciding with the convergence of DCIS and IDC expression profiles. We identify early processes and potential biomarkers, including CAMK2N1, MNX1, ADCY5, HOXC11 and ANKRD22, whose reduced expression is associated with the progression of DCIS to invasive breast cancer.
