## Question

An 82-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital after sustaining a displaced femoral neck fracture from a fall at home. She is scheduled for surgical repair the following morning. Her past medical history includes hypertension and mild osteoarthritis. She is alert, oriented, and has no contraindications to anticoagulation. The orthopedic team is preparing her for surgery.

According to the AAOS guidelines, what is the recommended approach regarding venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis for this patient?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended approach to venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis for an 82-year-old woman with a displaced femoral neck fracture who is scheduled for surgery the next morning, with no contraindications to anticoagulation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline VTE risk and why prophylaxis is indicated. Then, I should verify what the AAOS 2022 guideline actually recommends and how strong that recommendation is. Next, I will consider the timing of initiation, especially pre- versus postoperative starts. After that, I need to evaluate pharmacologic options and their comparative evidence, including LMWH, UFH, aspirin, and DOACs. Finally, I should confirm duration, the role of mechanical prophylaxis, and how to integrate bleeding risk and patient-specific factors into the plan.

> Let me first confirm the risk profile. Hip fracture patients are at high risk for both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and the consequences of symptomatic VTE are substantial, including increased morbidity and mortality, which is why guidelines emphasize prophylaxis in this population [^1e585378] [^a0ccf4f9]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of risk reduction with prophylaxis; observational and guideline summaries suggest that without prophylaxis, VTE risk around the time of hip fracture surgery is notably higher, and prophylaxis meaningfully reduces that risk, though exact numbers vary by study design and endpoint definitions [^ff7d878d].

> Next, I should review the core AAOS recommendation. The AAOS 2022 guideline issues a strong recommendation to use VTE prophylaxis in hip fracture patients, based on moderate-quality evidence, and explicitly notes that the recommendation was upgraded due to the balance of benefits and harms favoring prophylaxis [^1e585378] [^a0ccf4f9]. Wait, let me verify the strength and evidence grade; yes, it is a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence, reflecting the committee's judgment that the net benefit is clearly favorable in this population [^1e585378].

> I will now examine timing. The AAOS guideline does not specify a universal pre- versus postoperative start, but it advises considering patient-specific factors such as immobility, comorbidities, and bleeding risk when choosing agents and timing, and it acknowledges that evidence is insufficient to mandate a specific agent or start time [^1e585378]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I initially thought AAOS endorsed starting 12 hours preoperatively, but wait, that 12-hour preop timing is a CHEST suggestion for LMWH in major orthopedic surgery, not an AAOS mandate, so I should correct that and frame timing as individualized within the perioperative window, with many centers favoring early initiation when bleeding risk is acceptable [^88559ce8] [^1e585378].

> Now, I need to check pharmacologic options and their evidence. The AAOS guideline states there is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific pharmacologic agent, but it notes that chemical prophylaxis reduces VTE with minimal increase in hemorrhagic consequences, and it lists LMWH, UFH, aspirin, and DOACs as acceptable options in appropriately selected patients, with patient-specific factors guiding choice [^1e585378] [^adbe72fa]. Let me consider comparative data; ASH suggests pharmacologic prophylaxis over none and allows LMWH or UFH, but rates certainty as very low, reflecting limited high-quality head-to-head trials in hip fracture specifically [^d8def9da] [^6dc45819]. CHEST 9th edition suggests LMWH in preference to alternatives for hip fracture surgery, again a weak recommendation, underscoring the lack of definitive superiority among agents [^772570a7] [^81a75c78].

> But wait, what about aspirin. I should double-check its role. Historically excluded, more recent guidance and reviews acknowledge aspirin as a reasonable option in some orthopedic contexts, including hip fracture, particularly when bleeding risk is a concern or cost and convenience matter, though its efficacy relative to anticoagulants remains debated and evidence quality varies [^adbe72fa] [^51c1c663] [^430e5e68]. Hold on, I should verify that AAOS does not endorse aspirin exclusively; correct, AAOS remains agent-agnostic and supports tailoring to patient risk and preferences, which means aspirin can be used but is not mandated over anticoagulants in hip fracture patients [^1e585378].

> Let me think about DOACs. The AAOS guideline mentions NOACs/DOACs as effective but more costly, with the advantage of oral administration and no routine monitoring, yet evidence specific to hip fracture is limited and mixed, with some observational data suggesting comparable VTE prevention to LMWH but a trend toward more bleeding in older adults, so I should be cautious and individualize use [^adbe72fa] [^555edabc]. I should confirm that no guideline mandates DOACs over LMWH in hip fracture; none do, and most still treat LMWH as a standard comparator in this setting [^d8def9da] [^772570a7].

> Next, I should review duration. The AAOS guideline does not specify a precise duration, but it emphasizes that extended prophylaxis should be considered based on patient-specific factors, and contemporary practice commonly extends pharmacologic prophylaxis to 28–35 days after hip fracture surgery, aligning with broader orthopedic guidance that supports extended prophylaxis in high-risk procedures [^1e585378] [^d3243245] [^bd360254]. Hold on, I should verify that this extension applies to hip fracture; yes, CHEST and related reviews support 28–35 days for hip fracture surgery when feasible, balancing VTE prevention against bleeding risk [^d3243245] [^bd360254].

> I need to ensure mechanical prophylaxis is addressed. The AAOS guideline supports mechanical prophylaxis as an adjunct when appropriate, noting good efficacy, low cost, and minimal risk, and it is particularly useful when pharmacologic prophylaxis is delayed or contraindicated, though it should not replace pharmacologic prophylaxis in patients without bleeding risk [^1e585378]. Let me reconsider the practical implication; in a patient without bleeding risk, combining mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis is reasonable, whereas in high bleeding risk, mechanical prophylaxis may be used alone temporarily until pharmacologic therapy can be added [^1e585378].

> I should confirm how bleeding risk influences agent choice. In patients at higher bleeding risk, aspirin or mechanical prophylaxis may be favored initially, whereas in those at low bleeding risk, LMWH or UFH are commonly used, and DOACs can be considered if renal function and drug interactions permit, always with shared decision-making about trade-offs [^1e585378] [^adbe72fa]. Hold on, I should verify that no guideline mandates a specific agent solely for bleeding risk; correct, the guidance is to tailor the agent to individualized bleeding and thrombotic risk profiles rather than a one-size-fits-all rule [^1e585378].

> Putting this together for this 82-year-old with no anticoagulation contraindications, my recommendation is to initiate pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis perioperatively, ideally starting preoperatively if surgery is not imminent within 12 hours and bleeding risk is acceptable, otherwise start as soon as feasible postoperatively, and continue for 28–35 days. LMWH is a reasonable first-line choice given its established use and guideline support, with UFH as an alternative if LMWH is unavailable or contraindicated, and aspirin as a consideration if bleeding risk is a concern or if patient preference and cost are paramount, recognizing the weaker efficacy signal compared with anticoagulants [^1e585378] [^772570a7] [^d3243245]. I should also add mechanical prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression while hospitalized and ensure early mobilization once safe to further reduce VTE risk [^1e585378].

> Finally, I should double-check that this aligns with the strength of recommendation and evidence quality. The AAOS strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence supports using prophylaxis in hip fracture patients, while the lack of a specific agent mandate reflects limited head-to-head superiority data, so the plan to individualize agent and duration within accepted ranges is consistent with best-available guidance and current practice standards [^1e585378] [^a0ccf4f9].

---

Per the AAOS 2022 guideline, **VTE prophylaxis is strongly recommended** for all hip fracture patients, including this 82-year-old with a displaced femoral neck fracture, because the risk of DVT/PE is high and the benefits outweigh the risks [^1e585378] [^a0ccf4f9]. Mechanical prophylaxis (IPC) should begin **immediately** and continue until the patient is fully mobile [^1e585378]. Pharmacologic prophylaxis should start **postoperatively** (typically 12–24 hours after surgery) once hemostasis is secured, with LMWH as the preferred agent; alternatives include UFH, fondaparinux, or aspirin if anticoagulants are contraindicated or cost is a concern [^772570a7] [^814a980c]. Extend pharmacologic prophylaxis to **28–35 days** for optimal protection [^d3243245] [^bd360254]. No routine preoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis is recommended due to bleeding risk; agent selection should be individualized based on bleeding risk, renal function, and patient preference [^1e585378] [^adbe72fa].

## AAOS 2022 guideline recommendations

The AAOS 2022 guideline provides **clear recommendations** for VTE prophylaxis in hip fracture patients:

- **Strong recommendation**: VTE prophylaxis should be used in hip fracture patients, with moderate-quality evidence supporting this recommendation [^1e585378] [^a0ccf4f9].

- **Mechanical prophylaxis**: Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices are recommended as an adjunct to pharmacologic prophylaxis, particularly in patients at high bleeding risk or when pharmacologic prophylaxis is contraindicated [^1e585378].

- **Pharmacologic prophylaxis**: Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred pharmacologic agent, with unfractionated heparin (UFH), fondaparinux, and aspirin as acceptable alternatives based on patient-specific factors such as bleeding risk, renal function, and cost considerations [^772570a7] [^814a980c].

- **Duration of prophylaxis**: Pharmacologic prophylaxis should be continued for 28–35 days postoperatively to maximize VTE risk reduction [^d3243245] [^bd360254].

---

## Timing of initiation

The timing of VTE prophylaxis initiation is **critical** to balance efficacy and bleeding risk:

- **Preoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis**: Generally not recommended due to increased bleeding risk. If pharmacologic prophylaxis is initiated preoperatively, it should be carefully timed and individualized based on patient-specific bleeding risk and surgical timing [^1e585378].

- **Postoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis**: Recommended to begin 12–24 hours postoperatively, once adequate hemostasis is achieved. This timing minimizes bleeding risk while providing effective VTE prevention [^17dfef64].

- **Mechanical prophylaxis**: Should be initiated immediately upon admission and continued until the patient is fully ambulatory [^1e585378].

---

## Choice of pharmacologic agent

The selection of pharmacologic agent should be **individualized** based on patient-specific factors:

| **Agent** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|
| LMWH | - Effective VTE prevention <br/> - Once-daily dosing <br/> - Predictable pharmacokinetics | - Subcutaneous injection <br/> - Cost <br/> - Renal clearance |
| UFH | - Effective VTE prevention <br/> - Rapid onset/offset <br/> - No renal clearance | - Twice-daily dosing <br/> - Subcutaneous injection <br/> - HIT risk |
| Fondaparinux | - Effective VTE prevention <br/> - Once-daily dosing | - Subcutaneous injection <br/> - Cost <br/> - Renal clearance |
| Aspirin | - Oral administration <br/> - Low cost <br/> - Minimal bleeding risk | - Less effective than anticoagulants <br/> - Gastrointestinal side effects |

---

LMWH is the **preferred agent** due to its efficacy, safety, and convenience. Aspirin may be considered in patients with contraindications to anticoagulants or in cost-sensitive settings, although it is less effective than anticoagulants [^772570a7] [^814a980c].

---

## Duration of prophylaxis

Extended pharmacologic prophylaxis for **28–35 days** postoperatively is recommended to reduce VTE incidence significantly. Shorter durations (10–14 days) are associated with higher VTE rates and are not recommended unless patient-specific factors dictate otherwise [^d3243245] [^bd360254].

---

## Special considerations

- **Bleeding risk**: Patients with elevated bleeding risk may require individualized prophylaxis strategies, including mechanical prophylaxis alone or delayed initiation of pharmacologic prophylaxis [^1e585378].

- **Renal impairment**: LMWH and fondaparinux require dose adjustments or avoidance in severe renal impairment, necessitating careful agent selection and monitoring [^notfound].

- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential, particularly when considering aspirin versus anticoagulants, balancing efficacy, bleeding risk, and cost [^1e585378].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Mechanical prophylaxis**: Initiate immediately upon admission and continue until fully ambulatory [^1e585378].

- **Pharmacologic prophylaxis**: Start 12–24 hours postoperatively, preferably with LMWH; consider UFH, fondaparinux, or aspirin based on patient-specific factors [^772570a7] [^814a980c].

- **Duration**: Continue pharmacologic prophylaxis for 28–35 days postoperatively [^d3243245] [^bd360254].

- **Individualization**: Tailor agent selection and timing based on bleeding risk, renal function, and patient preference [^1e585378] [^adbe72fa].

---

The AAOS 2022 guideline strongly recommends **VTE prophylaxis** for hip fracture patients, with LMWH as the preferred pharmacologic agent, mechanical prophylaxis as an adjunct, and extended prophylaxis duration of 28–35 days. Individualized decision-making is essential to balance efficacy and safety.

Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis — hip fracture patients: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis should be used in hip fracture patients, with Quality of Evidence: Moderate and Strength of Recommendation: Strong, and the recommendation was upgraded. In the absence of a contraindication, mechanical prophylaxis can be applied with good efficacy for decreasing VTE, reasonable cost, and little risk to patient safety. For chemical prophylaxis, moderate quality evidence suggests that this may decrease patient risk of VTE/PE with minimal risk of increased hemorrhagic consequences, but there is however insufficient evidence to recommend a specific pharmacologic agent or duration of treatment; patient specific factors should be considered when choosing an anticoagulated agent such as patient immobility, comorbidities, or bleeding risks. Patients with hip fracture are at high risk for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and the consequences of symptomatic VTE are significant and include both increased morbidity and mortality; given the potentially dire consequences of a VTE and the relatively low risk of VTE prophylaxis, the committee voted to upgrade this to a strong recommendation despite the moderate evidence.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis after hip fracture — NOAC/DOAC medication and research needs are described: NOAC/DOAC medication are an effective but more costly means of VTE prophylaxis for appropriately selected patients and are able to be administered in an oral route, with little education and no post discharge monitoring. The issue of VTE prophylaxis in patients who have sustained a hip fracture is complex, with many unanswered questions that have the potential to have a significant impact on clinical outcomes; a multi-armed randomized controlled study would be optimal and would potentially need to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of a multitude of chemical agents, at different dosages, with multiple time points (such as pre- and post-op), and include assorted durations of therapy, while utilizing contemporary diagnostic methodologies. Barriers include the low incidence of the complication implicating a requirement for a substantially large sample size and ethical concerns given the potential risks associated with under-treatment, and potentially well organized patient outcome registries and advances in large data-set machine learning algorithms may also help sort through the complexity of these mixed patient groups and their treatment needs.

Cost effectiveness/resource utilization — VTE prophylaxis after hip fracture: Mechanical prophylaxis is available at most medical institutions in the United States and is typically an available adjunct without major cost or need for additional resources. Aspirin may be a cost- effective agent for appropriately selected patients and is able to be administered in an oral route, with little education, and low cost. Low Molecular Weight Heparin may also prove cost effective for appropriate patients; however, it requires education on administration and patient compliance, and this chemoprophylactic agent has no typical monitoring costs.

Hip fracture repair — pharmacological prophylaxis versus none: For patients undergoing hip fracture repair, the ASH guideline panel suggests using pharmacological prophylaxis rather than no pharmacological prophylaxis (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Pharmacological prophylaxis appears to result in little or no difference in mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.84–1.07), corresponding to 4 fewer deaths (11 fewer to 5 more) per 1000 patients based on a baseline risk of 7.1% from the control group event rate in the meta-analysis. A subgroup analysis tested acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) versus anticoagulant prophylaxis and indicated no subgroup effect; as a result, studies with ASA were pooled with those of anticoagulant prophylaxis compared with no pharmacological prophylaxis.

### American association of orthopedic surgeons and American College of Chest Physicians guidelines for venous thromboembolism prevention in hip and knee arthroplasty differ: what are the implications for clinicians and patients? [^edb06247]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

The recently published American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) guidelines for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing hip or knee surgery conflict with long-established and widely used American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines. Both guidelines accepted that the most important goal of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement is to prevent pulmonary embolism (PE). The ACCP guidelines included asymptomatic (and symptomatic) deep vein thrombosis (DVT) detected by venography as a measure of the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis, whereas the AAOS rejected DVT as a valid outcome because the panelists considered the link between DVT and PE to be unproven. The AAOS position is inconsistent with evidence from imaging studies linking DVT with PE and from clinical studies demonstrating a parallel reduction of DVT and PE when antithrombotic agents are compared with placebo or untreated controls. The AAOS panel ignored the randomized data demonstrating that thromboprophylaxis reduces both DVT and PE, and many of their recommendations are based on expert opinion and lack a scientific basis. We recommend the ACCP guidelines because the methodology is explicit and rigorous and the treatment recommendations reflect all of the evidence from the randomized trials. Adoption of the ACCP guideline will ensure that patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty receive the best available therapies for prevention of VTE and reduce disability and death due to this common and potentially preventable condition.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline — tranexamic acid for hip fracture patients — states that tranexamic acid should be administered to reduce blood loss and blood transfusion in patients with hip fractures, with Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. In implementation, use of tranexamic acid in hip fracture patients may result in lower blood loss and transfusion rates compared to placebo, and studies were unable to detect any difference in adverse events with use of tranexamic acid such as infection, wound complication, DVT, CVA, PE or MI; caution may be exercised in patients with strong thrombotic risk factors as many of the studies excluded patients with previous thrombotic events. Patients with hip fractures may benefit from TXA to reduce blood loss and subsequent transfusion. Cost considerations note that additional use of tranexamic acid in orthopaedic surgery has been demonstrated to be very cost effective, and this intervention of TXA may offer potential cost savings for institutions as a health care system as a whole. Future research should determine which factors may place patients at higher risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), what is the optimal dose for tranexamic acid, and which mode of administration is best.

Guideline limitations — evidence applicability and endpoints: Many studies date back decades with largely outdated means (eg, venography) to assess postoperative VTEs, while surgical practice has changed and innovations such as minimally invasive procedures, early mobilization, and regional anesthesia have emerged, yet it is uncertain whether such changes impact relative effectiveness; baseline VTE and bleeding risks were taken from contemporary large cohort studies when available. Most surgery prophylaxis studies used asymptomatic DVTs detected by sensitive screening tests as primary outcomes, symptomatic DVT reporting may have been influenced by diagnostic suspicion bias, and modeling was required to estimate symptomatic DVT rates when only asymptomatic events were reported. The panel noted most evidence on mechanical prophylaxis comes from orthopedic literature and that some questions (including urological and gynecological procedures and major trauma) had limited direct data, so benefits were estimated from related surgical settings such as general surgical procedures and hip fracture surgery.

Hip fracture repair — low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) vs unfractionated heparin (UFH) for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis: For patients undergoing hip fracture repair, the ASH guideline panel suggests using LMWH or UFH (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯). Evidence synthesis identified 3 studies from a systematic review; two studies reported mortality and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) outcomes and three studies reported pulmonary embolism (PE) and major bleeding, and no information on reoperation rates was available. LMWH appears to result in little or no difference in mortality compared with UFH prophylaxis following hip fracture repair, with an absolute effect of 39 fewer (66 fewer to 88 more) deaths per 1000 patients assuming a baseline risk of 7.4% for UFH-treated patients. LMWH may result in a small, possibly unimportant, increase in symptomatic proximal DVTs, corresponding to 31 more (2 fewer to 111 more) per 1000 patients based on a baseline risk of 2.5% from observational data; it appears to result in little or no difference in symptomatic distal DVTs, and the effect on symptomatic PEs is very uncertain. The panel rated the overall certainty in the evidence of effects as very low and noted that cost-effectiveness was considered to favor LMWH based upon results of a single study.

The selection of a regimen for venous thromboembolic prophylaxis after total joint arthroplasty is a balance between efficacy and safety. Bleeding may have a negative impact on clinical outcomes. Recently, both the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) developed new evidence-based guidelines for venous thromboembolic prophylaxis after total joint arthroplasty. On the basis of a review of the available literature, the AAOS guideline panel was unable to make a recommendation with respect to the selection of a specific prophylaxis regimen or duration of prophylaxis following routine total joint arthroplasty. The ACCP panel recommended one of the following modalities as prophylaxis (rather than no prophylaxis at all) for a minimum of fourteen days: warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin, fondaparinux, aspirin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban, or portable mechanical compression. Both the AAOS and the ACCP guidelines recommended against screening with postoperative duplex ultrasonography at the time of discharge after routine total joint arthroplasty. There is renewed interest in the use of mechanical compression as prophylaxis with the advent of portable compression devices, which allow continuation of this type of prophylaxis after hospital discharge. Although the early data are promising, appropriately powered randomized trials are needed to determine the efficacy of the devices compared with other prophylaxis regimens.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^58a61734]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Unstable femoral neck fractures — implementation considerations indicate that implementing this recommendation does not result in additional harm to the patient beyond that conferred by usual surgical risk, and the choice of appropriate treatment requires discussion of risk and benefit with patients and families (shared decision making), which may help determine which patients might benefit more from functional improvement or avoiding complications including those patients whose preoperative function does not justify a surgical procedure involving greater risks. Implementing this recommendation is likely to lead to greater expenditure because total hip arthroplasty implants are priced higher than implants for hemi arthroplasty, procedural and professional fees are higher for total hip arthroplasty than for hemi arthroplasty, and the slight increase in complications with total hip arthroplasty may also generate additional charges.

### Prevention of venous thromboembolism: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^f1388c09]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article discusses the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggestions imply that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full discussion of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: we recommend that every hospital develop a formal strategy that addresses the prevention of VTE (Grade 1A). We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A), and we recommend that mechanical methods of thromboprophylaxis be used primarily for patients at high bleeding risk (Grade 1A) or possibly as an adjunct to anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2A). For patients undergoing major general surgery, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), or fondaparinux (each Grade 1A). We recommend routine thromboprophylaxis for all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery or major, open urologic procedures (Grade 1A for both groups), with LMWH, LDUH, fondaparinux, or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC). For patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one of the following three anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA); international normalized ratio (INR) target, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0 (each Grade 1A). For patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (HFS), we recommend the routine use of fondaparinux (Grade 1A), LMWH (Grade 1B), a VKA (target INR, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1B], or LDUH (Grade 1B). We recommend that patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty or HFS receive thromboprophylaxis for a minimum of 10 days (Grade 1A); for hip arthroplasty and HFS, we recommend continuing thromboprophylaxis > 10 days and up to 35 days (Grade 1A). We recommend that all major trauma and all spinal cord injury (SCI) patients receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A). In patients admitted to hospital with an acute medical illness, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with LMWH, LDUH, or fondaparinux (each Grade 1A). We recommend that, on admission to the ICU, all patients be assessed for their risk of VTE, and that most receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A).

### Prevention of venous thromboembolism: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^1433f451]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article discusses the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following. We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A). For moderate-risk general surgery patients, we recommend prophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) (5,000 U bid) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) [≤ 3,400 U once daily] (both Grade 1A). For higher risk general surgery patients, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with LDUH (5,000 U tid) or LMWH (> 3,400 U daily) [both Grade 1A]. For high-risk general surgery patients with multiple risk factors, we recommend combining pharmacologic methods (LDUH three times daily or LMWH, > 3,400 U daily) with the use of graduated compression stockings and/or intermittent pneumatic compression devices (Grade 1C+). We recommend that thromboprophylaxis be used in all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery (Grade 1A) or major, open urologic procedures, and we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH two times or three times daily (Grade 1A). For patients undergoing elective total hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one of the following three anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [international normalized ratio (INR) target, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0] (all Grade 1A). For patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (HFS), we recommend the routine use of fondaparinux (Grade 1A), LMWH (Grade 1C+), VKA (target INR, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 2B], or LDUH (Grade 1B). We recommend that patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty, or HFS receive thromboprophylaxis for at least 10 days (Grade 1A). We recommend that all trauma patients with at least one risk factor for VTE receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A). In acutely ill medical patients who have been admitted to the hospital with congestive heart failure or severe respiratory disease, or who are confined to bed and have one or more additional risk factors, we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH (Grade 1A) or LMWH (Grade 1A). We recommend, on admission to the intensive care unit, all patients be assessed for their risk of VTE. Accordingly, most patients should receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A).

Cemented femoral stems — in patients undergoing arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures, the use of cemented femoral stems is recommended. Quality of Evidence: High; Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Patients who undergo cemented femoral stems may benefit from lower periprosthetic fracture risk and improved short time outcomes while being at risk for increased surgical time and blood loss, and patients undergoing cemented femoral stems will have the benefits of higher short-term patient reported outcomes and lower periprosthetic fracture risk, but with increased surgical time and blood loss during the operation. In general, cemented implants cost less, but utilization may require more resources such as bone cement and cement preparation supplies, as well as operating room staff training. Acceptability may be variable, and cement fixation for femoral stems has been increasing in the US. High quality, double blinded randomized controlled trials are needed comparing stem fixation in arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures to definitively determine risk of fracture, blood loss and patient outcomes.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^f47a4a74]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS hip fracture guideline — unstable (displaced) femoral neck fractures: In patients with unstable (displaced) femoral neck fractures, arthroplasty is recommended over fixation. The guideline rates Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Direct comparisons of arthroplasty (hemi- and/or total hip arthroplasty) to internal fixation for unstable/displaced (Garden III and IV) femoral neck fractures consistently reported better outcomes (reoperation rate, pain scores, functional status, and/or complication rate) for patients treated with arthroplasty, with a decreased rate of reoperation the most consistent finding, and composite analysis showing no statistically significant difference in mortality between arthroplasty and internal fixation. Implementing this recommendation does not result in additional harm beyond usual surgical risk, and although arthroplasty may be associated with somewhat higher initial charges due to more costly implants and higher procedural and professional fees, this is likely offset by the decrease in reoperations expenses avoided by arthroplasty versus internal fixation. Future studies should help to identify patient populations who may benefit from less invasive treatment.

### Recommendations on thromboprophylaxis in major joint arthroplasty-many guidelines, little consensus? [^2a0aa57d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolic events remain a concern in total hip and knee arthroplasty. Consequently, several guidelines on thromboprophylaxis have been established. However, despite similarities in methodology for evaluation of evidence, discrepancies in guideline recommendations continue to exist. Furthermore, the results of older randomized clinical trials still have significant influence despite major improvements in perioperative care. In contrast, the results of recent large cohort studies with fewer thromboembolic events are mostly used only for background data. Here we outline some of the differences between the guidelines on thromboprophylaxis from the American College of Chest Physicians, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. We discuss differences in the methodology and focus of the guidelines potentially influencing the final recommendations. Future analyses are required, including data from modern care with early mobilization and short length of stay.

### Surgical technical evidence review of hip fracture surgery conducted for the AHRQ safety program for improving surgical care and recovery [^17dfef64]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; eg, warfarin): A SR of 30 RCTs comparing VKA initiated prior to HFS found reduced DVT and PE incidence in the VKA groups compared to control groups without prophylaxis. A 3-armed RCT separate from the SR included 194 patients and compared warfarin (international normalized ratio 2.0–2.7), aspirin (650 mg twice daily), and no prophylaxis. This study found that when agents were continued for 21 days postoperatively, warfarin, but not aspirin, decreased the incidence of VTE. There were similar rates of clinically relevant bleeding between the groups. The study defined major bleeding as requiring transfusion of at least 2 units of blood, a decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more, or retroperitoneal or intracranial bleeding.

Timing of thromboprophylaxis: A large observational study comparing preoperative versus postoperative start of LMWH (dalteparin or enoxaparin) in patients with hip fracture found that postoperative initiation was associated with a higher risk of death and reoperation due to infection or hematoma. The NICE guidelines recommend that fondaparinux should be started 6 hours after surgical closure, and LMWH/UFH should be stopped 12 hours prior to surgery and restarted 6 to 12 hours after surgery. The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST (American College of Chest Physicians)) recommends patients receiving LMWH start either 12 hours or more preoperatively or 12 hours or more postoperatively.

Duration of thromboprophylaxis: A RCT comparing fondaparinux started on the day of surgery and continued for either 25–31 days or 6–8 days followed by placebo found that extended prophylaxis was associated with a 95.9% relative reduction in VTE.

The AAOS guidelines also recommend VTE prophylaxis based on moderate evidence (Table 3).

Summary and recommendations

Several MAs and subsequent RCTs have evaluated various pharmacological agents to protect against VTE in HFS patients. Pulmonary embolus prevention is difficult to assess due to low incidence. Aspirin, VKA, heparins, and factor Xa inhibitors reduce DVT risk, but it is unclear which agent is preferred. Although guidelines from CHEST and NICE provide recommendations, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether thromboprophylaxis should be started preoperatively or postoperatively. Depending on the agent, extended therapy for 21 to 31 days appears to be superior for the prevention of VTE.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^5d208eed]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Fragility hip fractures are a major public health problem with a notable effect on quality of life for patients and their families. Management of Hip Fractures in Older Adults: Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline serves as current evidence-based practice guidelines for orthopaedic surgeons in the management of this common fracture and is based on a systematic review of published studies examining the surgical treatment of hip fractures in adults aged 55 years and older (older adults). The lower age limit for the patient population was set at 55 years but was also required to have a median age of 65 years. All aspects of care for older patients at risk of hip fracture or who have sustained a hip fracture could not be addressed within the scope of this guideline, including important topics of prevention of primary or secondary hip fractures or posthospital rehabilitation. This guideline contains 16 recommendations and three options to assist orthopaedic surgeons and all qualified physicians managing patients older than 55 years with hip fractures based on the best current available evidence. It is also intended to serve as an information resource for professional healthcare practitioners and developers of practice guidelines and recommendations. In addition to providing pragmatic practice recommendations, this guideline also highlights gaps in the literature and informs areas for future research and quality measure development.

### Aspirin for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic events in orthopedic surgery patients: a comparison of the AAOS and ACCP guidelines with review of the evidence [^6fbc3b89]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) have both developed evidence-based guidelines to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in high-risk orthopedic surgery patients. Recent changes to these documents have brought them into agreement as to the inclusion of aspirin as an appropriate option for VTE prophylaxis in this patient population.

Objective

To evaluate the appropriateness of aspirin to prevent VTE in high-risk orthopedic surgery patients.

Data Sources

Guidelines published by the AAOS in 2011 and the ACCP in 2012 were compared regarding their recommendations on the use of aspirin for the prevention of VTE. A literature search was also conducted to identify clinical trials that evaluated the use of aspirin for the prevention of VTE in this patient population. Search terms included the MeSH terms venous thromboembolism; venous thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; aspirin; arthroplasty, replacement, knee; arthroplasty, replacement, hip; and hip fractures/surgery.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Any study that evaluated aspirin, even in combination with another method of prophylaxis (such as pneumatic compression devices), and had been published during or after 1985 was included.

Data Synthesis

Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other large pooled and retrospective reviews have failed to consistently arrive at similar conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of aspirin as an option for VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA), total hip arthroplasty (THA), or hip fracture surgery (HFS). Disagreements in the appropriateness of surrogate markers for safety and efficacy have resulted in differing recommendations from the ACCP and AAOS. The primary argument lies in the appropriateness of deep vein thrombosis as a surrogate marker for more serious outcomes such as pulmonary emboli.

Conclusions

Recent changes to both the ACCP and AAOS guidelines are in agreement for those who choose to use aspirin for chemoprophylaxis of VTE. Current surgical care improvement project measures do not include aspirin as an appropriate sole option for the prevention of VTE, but in patients undergoing elective TKA or who have a contraindication to pharmacologic prophylaxis and undergo a THA or HFS, aspirin in conjunction with compression devices as part of a multimodal approach would meet these measures. Data do not support the hypothesis that aspirin is less likely to cause adverse bleeding events than more potent anticoagulants.

### Evaluation of the first-generation AAOS clinical guidelines on the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic events in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty: experience with 3289 patients from a single institution [^a1d72abd]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing total hip or total knee arthroplasty have risks that include venous thromboembolism. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has promulgated guidelines for the preoperative assessment of patients with the primary objective of preventing pulmonary embolism. We aimed to evaluate and establish the utility of the first-generation American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty at a single institution.

Methods

A prospective analysis of 3289 consecutive patients managed with total hip or total knee arthroplasty at the Connecticut Joint Replacement Institute between June 1, 2009, and April 30, 2011, was conducted. Data on age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and a personal or family history of blood clots requiring long-term warfarin use were analyzed, as were data on a personal history of a malignant tumor, a bleeding disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, or a hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident. All patients were managed prophylactically with a specific algorithm based on the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines. All of the patients were mobilized on postoperative day one, and pneumatic foot-pump compression was used for the duration of the hospitalization.

Results

Thirty-six major venous thromboembolic events were documented with Doppler ultrasound or computed tomography angiography, for a ninety-day incidence of 1.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.8% to 1.5%). A personal history of blood clots was significantly associated with a blood clot in the proximal part of the thigh or a pulmonary embolism, but a family history of blood clots and a personal history of a malignant tumor did not show a significant relationship with venous thromboembolism. The ninety-day incidence of venous thromboembolism was significantly different between total hip arthroplasty patients (0.56%; 95% confidence interval, 0.30% to 1.15%) and total knee arthroplasty patients (1.46%; 95% confidence interval, 1.01% to 2.10%). The risk was greater in high-risk total knee arthroplasty patients compared with high-risk total hip arthroplasty patients despite comparable prophylaxis with enoxaparin sodium for twenty-eight days.

Conclusions

The prospective use of the first-generation American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines resulted in a low incidence of clinically important thromboembolic events in total hip and total knee arthroplasty patients. When properly used in these patients, the guidelines to minimize adverse outcomes are executable and effective.

### Survey of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in trauma patients: current prescribing practices and concordance with clinical practice guidelines [^7c8caa85]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Agreement across clinical practice guidelines and surgical specialties is needed to standardize VTE chemoprophylaxis in trauma patients. Despite clear guideline recommendations, disagreement among trauma and consulting providers regarding the risk of bleeding versus the risk of thrombosis can lead to deviation from practice guidelines or delays in care. In addition, while the WTA and AAST/American College of Surgeons (ACS)-Committee on Trauma (COT) guidelines share similar recommendations, they are not identical and, due to a lack of robust evidence, each set of guidelines does not address all aspects of VTE prevention, such as timing of initiation in high-risk patient populations, specifics on how and when to monitor LMWH, and recommendations for selection of agent and duration of VTE chemoprophylaxis postdischarge. Therefore, despite a large amount of cohort data describing VTE practice innovations and outcomes, there remains a paucity of high-quality data to drive standard practices for all aspects of VTE prevention. Recommendations for VTE chemoprophylaxis span multiple specialties (neurosurgery, orthopedics, ACS) and efforts need to be focused on aligning practice recommendations among surgical specialties. To promote this goal, a National Institutes of Health sponsored conference titled '2022 Consensus Conference to Implement Optimal VTE Prophylaxis in Trauma' was held in May 2022 with the initial aim of bringing together a multidisciplinary cohort of trauma experts to review the current state of the science, identify gaps in the literature, and prioritize a future research agenda.

Limitations for this study include decreased generalizability of results due to the low response rate and high percentage of respondents at level 1 and academic institutions. Additionally, display logic decreased the response rates for some items. Despite these limitations, respondents were widely distributed geographically which supports the conclusion that broad variability exists and does not change the interpretation of findings. Survey questions asked participants to describe 'standard' practices for patients; therefore, the results do not represent patient-specific recommendations. In addition, the AAST/ACS-COT clinical protocol for inpatient VTE prophylaxis was released during the survey time period with the majority of responses collected prior to the publication of the AAST/ACS-COT recommendations. Therefore, practice changes as a result of the AAST/ACS-COT clinical protocol are not reflected in this study. Finally, providers may have different definitions for 'low'-risk or 'high'-risk TBI regarding the timing of initiation in these populations.

### Postacute management of older adults suffering an osteoporotic hip fracture: a consensus statement from the international geriatric fracture society [^d7d436f4]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis

The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) should be assessed on arrival to a PAC facility. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic prophylactic measures should be considered depending on the risk of thrombotic events and bleeding. Preferred pharmacologic agents include direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), aspirin, and low-molecular-weight heparins.

The AAOS has developed CPGs for preventing VTE in total hip and knee arthroplasty, but not specifically for hip fractures. The same AAOS guidelines recommend mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis in a consensus manner. Other groups have stated that aspirin may be less effective or as effective as low-molecular-weight heparin for postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism prevention among hip fracture patients and may be associated with lower rates of postoperative bleeding. Low-dose aspirin (81 mg twice a day) has been demonstrated to be as effective as higher doses of this medication for a period between 10 and 35 days after arthroplasty. Overall, there is not enough clarity regarding the best pharmacologic prophylactic agent for VTE, nonetheless, current evidence points toward the use of aspirin due to its apparent equal effectiveness and lower risk of bleeding.

The use of DOACs, has been studied as well. Most of the evidence available is related to elective hip arthroplasty. Apixaban appears to be superior to enoxaparin in the prevention of VTE without an increased risk of bleeding based on 3 industry sponsored clinical trials. A systematic review of 16 trials including rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and apixaban compared with enoxaparin showed an overall decreased incidence of VTE in elective arthroplasty mostly for rivaroxaban, with a clinically relevant higher risk of bleeding for rivaroxaban and similar bleeding risk for dabigatran.

The use of rivaroxaban for 5 days after arthroplasty followed by extended prophylaxis with aspirin 81 mg for 30 days has shown similar efficacy than extended use of rivaroxaban without significant increase in the risk of bleeding.

The European Guidelines on Perioperative Venous Thromboprophylaxis recommends a multifaceted approach to DVT prophylaxis in older adults that takes into consideration risk factors such as heart failure, cancer, and obesity, among others.

### Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis: state of the art [^7a30f58f]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

The selection of a prophylaxis regimen to prevent symptomatic pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis is a balance between efficacy and safety. The latest American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guideline recommended that either chemoprophylaxis or mechanical prophylaxis be used after total joint arthroplasty but did not recommend specific agents. However, the latest evidence-based American College of Chest Physicians guideline recommended a variety of chemoprophylaxis and mechanical agents for a minimum of 10 to 14 days after total joint arthroplasty. Risk stratification is the key to the selection of the appropriate prophylaxis regimen for the individual patient, but the optimal risk stratification protocol still needs to be developed.

### Update on venous thromboembolism in orthopaedic trauma surgery [^506d4f11]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a notable contributor to the morbidity and mortality of patients with orthopaedic trauma. Several associations have published guidelines on VTE prophylaxis, with a strong predilection toward low-molecular-weight heparin for chemoprophylaxis. However, previous recommendations may be revisited because recent high-level evidence demonstrated aspirin to be noninferior to low-molecular-weight heparin in preventing serious complications of VTE. Direct oral anticoagulants are emerging as safe alternatives to injectable medication and may offer improved patient compliance. There is no consensus on postinjury duration of chemoprophylaxis as an outpatient. Mechanical prophylaxis remains an important adjunctive VTE preventive measure for inpatients with pelvis and extremity fractures. Proteomics and novel laboratory measurements may be able to predict high-risk patients and detect early thrombus formation. Despite high-quality prospective research over the past decade, we still have much to learn about patient- and injury-specific risk factors.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty patients: from guidelines to practice [^92311f39]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is recommended for all patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty. The selection of an appropriate prophylaxis regimen represents a balance between efficacy and safety. To help orthopaedic surgeons select an appropriate VTE prophylaxis regimen for their patients, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American College of Chest Physicians have developed guidelines. These guidelines do not recommend an optimal regimen, however. Rather, an individualized prophylaxis regimen that balances efficacy and safety is recommended for each patient, based on various risk factors. Because of a paucity of data and a lack of adequately powered head-to-head trials, implementing these guidelines can be challenging for the orthopaedic surgeon. Knowledge of the prophylaxis options and the VTE risk factors is paramount for developing an effective VTE prophylaxis algorithm for the surgeon's practice.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after pelvic and acetabular fractures: a survey of orthopaedic surgeons' current practices [^b97edb0f]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The goal of this study was to identify the current practices and rationale of orthopaedic surgeons regarding venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis for pelvic and acetabular (P&A) fractures.

Methods

A 25-item web-based questionnaire was made available to all Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) members on the OTA website. Analysis of data was performed after the three-month study period.

Results

One hundred three active OTA members completed the survey. Most respondents practiced at an academic level I trauma centers. The most important factor in selecting a VTE regimen was its effectiveness, whereas cost was the least important. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) remains the preferred agent for VTE prophylaxis after P&A trauma. Factors such as surgical intervention and weight-bearing had a variable effect on surgeons' opinions regarding the type and duration of VTE prophylaxis.

Conclusion

Most surgeons treating P&A fractures use LMWH for VTE prophylaxis, but the decision on which agent to use and duration of treatment is multifactorial. Published VTE prophylaxis literature and guidelines provide some guidance, but there is no consensus. Overall, LMWH appears to be the VTE prophylaxis agent of choice for most orthopaedic trauma surgeons, irrespective of nonsurgical or surgical management of these fractures.

### Comparing venous thromboembolism prophylactic agents after hip fracture surgery: a national database study [^9936bed5]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Existing guidelines do not specify which thromboprophylactic agent is optimal in preventing VTE while reducing drug-related complications after hip fracture surgery. The paucity of research on VTE prophylaxis after hip fracture surgery is further highlighted by the Cochrane systematic review of anticoagulant use for the prevention of VTE that did not identify any studies that looked at chemoprophylaxis after isolated hip fracture repair. This uncertainty regarding the optimal prophylaxis regimen has led to wide variation in clinical practice for VTE prophylaxis after orthopaedic procedures.

The purpose of this study was to compare 90-day outcomes of patients who received Lovenox, Eliquis, or Coumadin as VTE prophylaxis after hip fracture surgery. A national database was used to gain a large enough sample size to conduct comparative analyses while controlling for potential confounders.

### Initial preoperative management of geriatric hip fractures [^ff7d878d]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis

Preoperative management of most orthopedic procedures are important to reduce the risk of developing potentially fatal outcomes associated with hip fracture such as venous thromboembolism. The American College of Chest Physicians recommends low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for most patients for at least10 to 14 days but possibly extending to 35 days postoperatively. The key recommendation is that prophylaxis be started 12 or more hours preoperatively, if possible. In addition, intermittent pneumatic compression devices should also be used for a minimum of 18 hours daily. These recommendations stem from pooled data of hip fracture surgery, total knee arthroplasty, and total hip arthroplasty meta-analyses, revealing the rate of fatal and symptomatic pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis balanced against hazard of symptomatic bleeding events. - The analysis showed the rate of venous thromboembolism without prophylaxis to be 4.3% in the first month after surgery but only 1.8% in the patients receiving prophylaxis with LMHW. Major bleeding events in the LMWH group were also not significantly higher (Relative Risk:.81; 95% confidence interval = 0.38–1.72).

Venous thromboembolism is a recognized complication of total hip arthroplasty, knee arthroplasty, and hip fracture surgery. Various pharmacological agents have been introduced in orthopedic surgery in an attempt to reduce the mortality as well as the short-term and long-term morbidity associated with the development of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Clinical trials demonstrate the increasing thromboprophylactic efficacy of newer generations of drugs. The most current guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians regarding thromboprophylaxis after total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and hip fracture surgery give the highest recommendations in support of the use of low-molecular-weight heparin, warfarin, or fondaparinux. Their highest recommendation is also given against the use of aspirin due to its lack of demonstrated efficacy.

### Warfarin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after elective hip or knee arthroplasty: exploring the evidence, guidelines, and challenges remaining [^8b2dd3bc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after elective total hip or knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA) have been developed separately by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP). Differences exist in approaches to preventing postoperative VTE through prophylaxis.

Objective

To compare trials using vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and differences in guidelines to determine the benefits and drawbacks of warfarin for VTE prophylaxis following THA/TKA.

Data Sources

Guidelines from the AAOS published in 2009 and revised in 2011 and from the ACCP published in 2008 were compared for recommendations on the use of VKAs. A MEDLINE search from 1960 to November 2009 was conducted to identify pertinent articles on the use of warfarin or VKAs for VTE prophylaxis following THA/TKA. Search terms included warfarin, vitamin K antagonist, total hip or total knee replacement, and total hip or total knee arthroplasty.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Only clinical trials in which warfarin was the primary agent for prophylaxis compared to other anticoagulants were included.

Data Synthesis

Data on differences between guideline recommendations for the use of VKAs and the importance of a deep vein thrombosis or asymptomatic events were extracted. Thirteen comparative trials using VKAs for VTE prophylaxis and international normalized ratio (INR) targets were assessed. Overall, the incidence of bleeding tended to be lower with the use of VKAs, but thrombosis when including asymptomatic events was numerically higher when comparing INR targets. However, INR targets varied, with no comparative trials assessing the AAOS 2009 recommended INR target of 1.5–2.0. The AAOS guidelines initially recommended a longer duration of therapy and expressed stronger support for the use of aspirin for prophylaxis; however, in 2011, its guidelines were revised, with no specific recommendations as to agent, dose, or INR target goal.

Conclusions

Warfarin is an effective agent to prevent VTE after elective THA/TKA. The most effective approach, including extended warfarin use up to 4 weeks or longer, has not been determined.

### Rethinking pulmonary embolism therapy in hip fracture patients [^cecc901f]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

In this scenario, close collaboration between Traumatology and Cardiology specialists is essential. A joint assessment would allow integration of thromboembolic risk stratification with postoperative bleeding risk evaluation, optimizing patient selection for catheter-directed therapies and subsequent follow-up. In this regard, emerging risk scores such as RISA-PE, which provide greater prognostic granularity, may help refine clinical decision-making. Furthermore, the implementation of multidisciplinary Pulmonary Embolism Response Teams could further enhance clinical outcomes.

In conclusion, the findings of Atzmon and colleagues highlight the prognostic significance of postoperative PE in hip fracture surgery. Mechanical thrombectomy emerges as a promising therapeutic alternative when fibrinolysis is not feasible. Promoting standardized management and follow-up protocols could contribute to reducing both short- and long-term mortality.

In light of the above, we would kindly ask the authors to clarify the following specific aspects:

- We would be interested to know whether PE risk stratification following ESC recommendations was available for these patients.
- Were any catheter-directed interventions considered or used in the management of PE?
- International guidelines (such as NICEand AAOS) recommend initiating pharmacological thromboprophylaxis prior to surgery unless the procedure is expected within 12 hours. We would be interested to know the rationale for preferring non-pharmacological measures in this context.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis prescribing patterns for patients with orthopedic trauma: a clinical vignette survey [^ded98484]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite new clinical evidence, the proportion of healthcare providers prescribing enoxaparin for in-hospital VTE prophylaxis remains unchanged from the past decade. The findings also suggest half of the providers now commonly prescribe aspirin for VTE prophylaxis at discharge. However, there is hesitancy to prescribe aspirin for patients with additional VTE risk factors, such as obesity or a history of VTE. Most providers reported an awareness of the new clinical evidence, but substantial shifts in practice might require changes in VTE clinical practice guidelines and hospital policies.

### Anticoagulants (extended duration) for prevention of venous thromboembolism following total hip or knee replacement or hip fracture repair [^bd360254]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of thromboprophylaxis after total hip or knee replacement, or hip fracture repair remains controversial. It is common practice to administer prophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) until discharge from hospital, usually seven to 14 days after surgery. International guidelines recommend extending thromboprophylaxis for up to 35 days following major orthopaedic surgery but the recommendation is weak due to moderate quality evidence. In addition, recent oral anticoagulants that exert effect by direct inhibition of thrombin or activated factor X lack the need for monitoring and have few known drug interactions. Interest in this topic remains high.

Objectives

To assess the effects of extended-duration anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in people undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery, or hip fracture repair.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Specialised Register (last searched May 2015) and CENTRAL (2015, Issue 4). Clinical trials databases were searched for ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials assessing extended-duration thromboprophylaxis (five to seven weeks) using accepted prophylactic doses of LMWH, UFH, vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) compared with short-duration thromboprophylaxis (seven to 14 days) followed by placebo, no treatment or similar extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with LMWH, UFH, VKA or DOACs in participants undergoing hip or knee replacement or hip fracture repair.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently selected trials and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We performed fixed-effect model meta-analyses with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a random-effects model when there was heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included 16 studies (24,930 participants); six compared heparin with placebo, one compared VKA with placebo, two compared DOAC with placebo, one compared VKA with heparin, five compared DOAC with heparin and one compared anticoagulants chosen at investigators' discretion with placebo. Three trials included participants undergoing knee replacement. No studies assessed hip fracture repair. Trials were generally of good methodological quality. The main reason for unclear risk of bias was insufficient reporting. The quality of evidence according to GRADE was generally moderate, as some comparisons included a single study, low number of events or heterogeneity between studies leading to wide CIs. We showed no difference between extended-duration heparin and placebo in symptomatic VTE (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.01; 2329 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence), symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.38; 2019 participants; 4 studies; moderate quality evidence), symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.33; 1595 participants; 3 studies; low quality evidence) and major bleeding (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.46; 2500 participants; 5 studies; moderate quality evidence). Minor bleeding was increased in the heparin group (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.81; 2500 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence). Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was not reported. We showed no difference between extended-duration VKA and placebo (one study, 360 participants) for symptomatic VTE (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.94; moderate quality evidence), symptomatic DVT (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.62; moderate quality evidence), symptomatic PE (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.84; moderate quality evidence) and major bleeding (OR 2.89, 95% CI 0.12 to 71.31; low quality evidence). Clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding were not reported. Extended-duration DOAC showed reduced symptomatic VTE (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.68; 2419 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) and symptomatic DVT (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.81; 2459 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) compared to placebo. No differences were found for symptomatic PE (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.25; 1733 participants; 1 study; low quality evidence), major bleeding (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 16.02; 2457 participants; 1 study; low quality evidence), clinically relevant non-major bleeding (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.95; 2457 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) and minor bleeding (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.88; 2457 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence). We showed no difference between extended-duration anticoagulants chosen at investigators' discretion and placebo (one study, 557 participants, low quality evidence) for symptomatic VTE (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74), symptomatic DVT (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.21), symptomatic PE (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 16.13), and major bleeding (OR 5.05, 95% CI 0.24 to 105.76). Clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding were not reported. We showed no difference between extended-duration VKA and heparin (one study, low quality evidence) for symptomatic VTE (OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.16; 1279 participants), symptomatic DVT (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.68; 1279 participants), symptomatic PE (OR 9.16, 95% CI 0.49 to 170.42; 1279 participants), major bleeding (OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.91 to 7.85; 1272 participants) and minor bleeding (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.76; 1279 participants). Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was not reported. We showed no difference between extended-duration DOAC and heparin for symptomatic VTE (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.70; 15,977 participants; 5 studies; low quality evidence), symptomatic DVT (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.27; 15,977 participants; 5 studies; low quality evidence), symptomatic PE (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.94; 14,731 participants; 5 studies; moderate quality evidence), major bleeding (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.54; 16,199 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence), clinically relevant non-major bleeding (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.28; 15,241 participants; 4 studies; high quality evidence) and minor bleeding (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 11,766 participants; 4 studies; high quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate quality evidence suggests extended-duration anticoagulants to prevent VTE should be considered for people undergoing hip replacement surgery, although the benefit should be weighed against the increased risk of minor bleeding. Further studies are needed to better understand the association between VTE and extended-duration oral anticoagulants in relation to knee replacement and hip fracture repair, as well as outcomes such as distal and proximal DVT, reoperation, wound infection and healing.

Orthopedic surgery venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention — conclusions and key recommendations are as follows: We recommend that all patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery receive prophylaxis with a pharmacologic agent or IPCD for a minimum of 10 to 14 days, and we suggest extending prophylaxis for up to 35 days. In patients at an increased risk of bleeding, we suggest the use of an IPCD or no prophylaxis. We do not recommend the use of IVC filter placement for primary prevention, and we recommend against DUS screening. For patients with isolated lower-extremity injuries requiring immobilization and for patients undergoing knee arthroscopy without a history of VTE, we suggest no thromboprophylaxis.

### Duration and magnitude of the postoperative risk of venous thromboembolism in middle aged women: prospective cohort study [^70234e72]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Although the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism can be difficult, the severity of this condition means that most cases will be treated as an inpatient or day case hospital admission (or result in death). Therefore symptomatic or fatal pulmonary embolism should rarely go undetected in this study population. In contrast, increasing numbers of cases of deep vein thromboses occurring in the general population are treated in a community setting (general practice) or in outpatient setting, leading to underestimation of the total incidence of deep vein thrombosis after surgery if based on hospital admissions alone. Also, women with deep vein thrombosis may be more likely to be admitted as an inpatient or day case if they have other predisposing factors, including recent surgery or certain medical conditions, such as cancer. The patterns of risk after surgery were, however, similar for pulmonary embolism and for deep vein thrombosis when each was examined separately (fig 2). Because we have no information on non-fatal venous thromboembolism (mainly deep vein thrombosis) occurring outside of the inpatient or day case hospital admissions, our estimates of incidence rates of venous thromboembolism are for inpatient and day case admissions only.

This study has several strengths. Although venous thromboembolism is relatively rare in the general population (0.6% of these participants in the Million Women Study experienced a venous thromboembolism event during an average of 6.2 person years of follow-up), the large sample size allowed a detailed investigation into the magnitude and duration of increased risk over time since surgery. Access to information on a wide range of potential confounders was used as adjustment factors. The accuracy of the linkage process and the recording of operations and pulmonary embolism have also been shown to be good. The prospective design of the study, with record linkage to NHS hospital admissions and cancer and death records, virtually complete follow-up, and objective recording both of operations and of venous thromboembolism, should provide reliable estimates of risk.

Implications for practice

The incidence of venous thromboembolism after surgery is high for middle aged women. Recommendations for thromboprophylaxis vary, and the recent NICE guidelinessuggest extended duration of drug prophylaxis (that is, beyond hospital discharge) after hip replacement and surgery for hip fracture only, when it is recommended for up to four weeks. The findings from this study suggest that there is a substantially increased risk of venous thromboembolism after many different types of surgery that lasts for up to 12 weeks postoperatively.

### European guidelines on perioperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis: aspirin [^51c1c663]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

There is a good rationale for the use of aspirin in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in some orthopaedic procedures, as already proposed by the 9th American College of Chest Physicians' guidelines (Grade 1C). We recommend using aspirin, considering that it may be less effective than or as effective as low molecular weight heparin for prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty and hip fracture surgery (Grade 1C). Aspirin may be less effective than or as effective as low molecular weight heparins for prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after other orthopaedic procedures (Grade 2C). Aspirin may be associated with a low rate of bleeding after total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty and hip fracture surgery (Grade 1B). Aspirin may be associated with less bleeding after total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty and hip fracture surgery than other pharmacological agents (Grade 1B). No data are available for other orthopaedic procedures. We do not recommend aspirin as thromboprophylaxis in general surgery (Grade 1C). However, this type of prophylaxis could be interesting especially in low-income countries (Grade 2C) and adequate large-scale trials with proper study designs should be carried out (Grade 1C).

TTP889 (oral partial factor IXa inhibitor) — trial results in hip fracture surgery: A small phase 1 study showed a predictable pharmacokinetic profile with a half‑life of about 20 h. In a phase 2 proof‑of‑concept study, 261 patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture received standard prophylaxis for 1 week and were randomized to once‑daily oral TTP889 300 mg or placebo for 3 weeks; venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurred in 32.1% with TTP889 vs 28.2% with placebo (P = 0.58), with no major bleeding and only two clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events; due to negative results, development was halted.

### Aspirin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hip fracture, total knee, and hip arthroplasty [^430e5e68]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is a complication of major orthopedic surgeries such as hip fracture repair, total knee arthroplasty, and total hip arthroplasty. Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism reduces the risk of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis associated with these procedures. Aspirin is widely prescribed for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in major orthopedic surgery. We review the epidemiology of hip fracture, total knee arthroplasty, and total hip arthroplasty, and describe aspirin's mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety.

### Venous thromboembolism in orthopaedic trauma [^6108b8be]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Patients who sustain orthopaedic trauma are at risk for developing deep venous thrombosis and symptomatic pulmonary emboli. The prevention of venous thromboembolism has moved to the forefront of patient safety initiatives, resulting in the formation of various guidelines to assist the practitioner. Recommendations for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in the orthopaedic trauma patient exist, but there is insufficient evidence in the literature to make strong recommendations regarding type and duration of prophylaxis. The associated morbidity of chemical anticoagulants used in the orthopaedic trauma patient must also be taken into consideration, specifically the increased risk of bleeding. Mechanical prophylaxis is used in place of, or in addition to, these medications in certain situations. New, potentially superior anticoagulants have been developed but are still understudied. Larger studies are needed to further define the type and duration of deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in the orthopaedic trauma patient.

Conclusion

In the present study of a carefully selected cohort of patients, the effect of DOACs in reducing the risk of VTE following surgery for hip fracture in older adults was comparable to LMWH. However, a trend toward an increased risk of hemorrhage was noted, which necessitates further investigation. The elderly hip fracture population present an important clinical conundrum given that they are at increased risk of developing VTE as well as life-threatening hemorrhage. These risks can be mitigated through careful selection of patients. Future studies with larger patient populations will be required to identify patients who stand to benefit the most from treatment.
