## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about trigeminal neuralgia, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the recommended diagnostic workup, especially MRI and neurophysiology. Next, I will review first-line and second-line medical therapy, including dosing and monitoring. After that, I need to check indications and selection of surgical options, including comparative outcomes. I will then consider special populations and secondary causes. Finally, I should integrate longitudinal care, patient education, and a practical algorithm, while continuously validating claims against guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and diagnostic criteria so I don't anchor prematurely on a label. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by recurrent, unilateral, brief, electric shock–like paroxysmal facial pain confined to one or more trigeminal divisions, triggered by innocuous stimuli, with attacks lasting fractions of a second to 2 minutes, and not better accounted for by another diagnosis, which aligns with ICHD-3 and contemporary reviews, and I should double-check that I'm not conflating this with continuous neuropathic pain or other facial pain syndromes that can mimic TN [^112PsDs9] [^113aNB2p].

> Wait, let me verify the classification because management hinges on it. Classical TN reflects neurovascular compression with morphological changes of the trigeminal root, secondary TN is due to identifiable neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis or a cerebellopontine angle lesion, and idiopathic TN has no identified cause; importantly, simple vessel contact without morphological change is not sufficient to diagnose classical TN, so I need to ensure imaging interpretation is precise before assigning that subtype [^112PsDs9] [^113aNB2p].

> I should confirm the diagnostic workup next. MRI with high-resolution trigeminal sequences is recommended in all patients to exclude secondary causes and to characterize neurovascular relationships; a combination of 3D T2-weighted, 3D time-of-flight MRA, and 3D T1-weighted gadolinium sequences with blinded neuroradiology review improves detection of vascular contacts and morphological changes, and I need to remember that demonstrating a contact does not confirm the diagnosis but informs surgical decision-making [^115Eq88b] [^114okwxG] [^113aNB2p].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of neurophysiology. Trigeminal reflex testing has high pooled sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing symptomatic from classic TN, whereas trigeminal evoked potentials are less accurate and should not be relied upon alone; thus, if MRI is unavailable or equivocal, reflex testing can be a reasonable adjunct, but I need to ensure it's performed in a qualified laboratory [^1128F4JD] [^115d7psw].

> Next, I will examine first-line pharmacotherapy, and I should double-check the strength of evidence. Carbamazepine is the initial drug of choice with robust efficacy in randomized trials, and oxcarbazepine is an accepted alternative with comparable pain reduction and better tolerability; typical effective maintenance ranges are carbamazepine 400–800 mg/day and oxcarbazepine 600–1,800 mg/day, with careful titration and periodic attempts to minimize dose, and I need to monitor for hyponatremia, hematologic effects, and drug interactions, especially with carbamazepine [^115q3b6S] [^113tor51] [^115Vk6Ri] [^117DZQWr] [^111NDjtJ] [^111DSxPG].

> Let me consider second-line and adjunctive options, and I should confirm the evidence level. Lamotrigine and gabapentin can be considered as monotherapy or add-on when first-line agents are ineffective or poorly tolerated, and botulinum toxin type A is a reasonable medium-term add-on for refractory cases; I need to remember that the evidence base for these alternatives is weaker and that shared decision-making about benefits and side effects is essential [^114xi8P1] [^1172LxG2] [^112znau4].

> I will now examine acute exacerbation management, but wait, I should verify the evidence strength. Intravenous fosphenytoin or lidocaine may be considered for severe flares, although high-quality evidence is limited; given the brevity of attacks, abortive strategies are generally not useful, so prevention remains the mainstay and acute IV therapy should be reserved for carefully selected cases with close monitoring [^113BPN8D] [^111Nf7Cd] [^112znau4].

> Next, I should review when to offer surgery and which procedure to prioritize. Surgery should be considered when pain is refractory to medical therapy or medications are poorly tolerated, and in classical TN with imaging evidence of neurovascular compression, microvascular decompression is preferred over gamma knife surgery when the patient can undergo posterior fossa surgery; I need to counsel on durability and risks, including sensory complications and rare mortality, and ensure referral to experienced centers [^111xxBZQ] [^111iWNZL] [^116h7JqS] [^115wKZLt].

> But wait, what if the patient has secondary TN or is not a candidate for open surgery. In medically refractory secondary TN or when MVD is contraindicated, percutaneous Gasserian ganglion procedures or stereotactic radiosurgery are reasonable options, and I should confirm that comparative long-term outcomes favor MVD for durability in classical TN, while acknowledging that head-to-head RCTs are limited and patient selection is key [^112LZbt9] [^115eWVcS].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In multiple sclerosis–associated TN, evidence for surgery is limited and management is individualized; in older adults or those with comorbidities, oxcarbazepine may be favored over carbamazepine for tolerability; and I should remember that sex-based differences exist, with men more likely to achieve pain freedom after MVD and women more often requiring ongoing medical therapy, which may influence timing and choice of interventions [^116qvAxr] [^115Vk6Ri] [^111Ekw2B].

> Let me think about longitudinal care and quality of life, and I should double-check supportive measures. Psychological comorbidity is common and untreated symptoms can drive anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance, so offering psychological and nursing support and connecting patients with national support groups is recommended; I also need to monitor for cognitive effects of long-term antiseizure therapy and periodically attempt dose reduction to the lowest effective level [^112arnRo] [^115g5LyF] [^111NDjtJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical treatment algorithm to avoid gaps. Start with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine and titrate to effect while monitoring safety, add lamotrigine or gabapentin if needed, consider botulinum toxin for refractory cases, and refer for surgical evaluation if pain remains uncontrolled or medications are not tolerated; in classical TN with clear neurovascular compression, prioritize MVD, whereas in nonclassical or high-risk patients consider percutaneous procedures or radiosurgery, all within a multidisciplinary framework [^113Qzue2] [^111xxBZQ] [^111iWNZL].

> Finally, I should confirm that patient education and expectations are addressed. Many patients benefit from early discussion of surgical options even during medical optimization, given the superior long-term pain freedom with MVD in selected patients, and I need to ensure imaging and neurophysiology are interpreted in experienced centers to avoid misclassification and to guide timely, appropriate interventions [^111xxBZQ] [^116jUc7L].

Neuralgia is best defined as **severe, paroxysmal pain** in the distribution of a specific nerve, most often the trigeminal nerve, with attacks lasting seconds to minutes and triggered by light touch or everyday activities [^112PsDs9]. Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by MRI to exclude secondary causes and to assess for neurovascular compression [^114okwxG] [^115Eq88b]. First-line treatment is with **carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine** [^113tor51]; if these are ineffective or poorly tolerated, consider lamotrigine, gabapentin, or pregabalin [^114xi8P1], and reserve surgery (microvascular decompression or percutaneous procedures) for refractory cases [^111xxBZQ] [^115eWVcS]. Early, accurate diagnosis and guideline-based care are essential to reduce pain, prevent disability, and improve quality of life [^113aNB2p].

---

## Clinical features and classification

Neuralgia presents with **distinctive clinical features**:

- **Trigeminal neuralgia (TN)**: Sudden, unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve; typically triggered by innocuous stimuli (e.g. light touch, chewing, talking, brushing teeth) [^112PsDs9] [^1138rwFB].

- **Occipital neuralgia**: Sharp, electric-like pain originating from the occiput and extending along the posterior scalp, often associated with sensory disturbances [^1117Hx2d].

- **Glossopharyngeal neuralgia**: Severe, transient pain in the oropharynx, tonsils, or base of the tongue, sometimes triggered by swallowing or coughing.

The **classification of TN** includes:

| **Type** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Classical | Neurovascular compression with morphological changes of the trigeminal root [^112PsDs9] |
| Secondary | Identifiable neurological disease (e.g. multiple sclerosis, tumor) [^112PsDs9] |
| Idiopathic | No identifiable cause [^112PsDs9] |

---

## Diagnostic criteria and evaluation

Diagnosis of neuralgia is **primarily clinical**, based on characteristic pain features and distribution [^112PsDs9]. MRI is recommended to exclude secondary causes and assess for neurovascular compression; high-resolution trigeminal sequences improve detection of vascular contacts [^114okwxG] [^115Eq88b]. Trigeminal reflex testing can help distinguish classical from secondary TN but is not routinely required [^1128F4JD] [^111KpibU].

---

## Pathophysiology

Neuralgia pathophysiology involves **peripheral and central mechanisms**. Peripheral sensitization results from nerve injury or compression that increases excitability and lowers firing thresholds, while central sensitization reflects abnormal processing in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, leading to hyperexcitability and pain amplification [^notfound].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Medical management

First-line pharmacotherapy includes **carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine**, which provide effective pain control in most patients [^113tor51] [^115q3b6S]. Second-line options include lamotrigine, gabapentin, or pregabalin, considered when first-line agents are ineffective or poorly tolerated [^114xi8P1]. Botulinum toxin type A may be considered as add-on therapy for refractory cases [^1172LxG2].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for patients with **refractory pain despite medical therapy** or when medications are poorly tolerated [^111xxBZQ]. Microvascular decompression (MVD) is the preferred surgical option for classical TN with neurovascular compression, providing long-term pain relief in approximately 70–80% of patients [^111iWNZL] [^116h7JqS]. Percutaneous procedures (radiofrequency thermocoagulation, glycerol rhizotomy, balloon compression) and Gamma Knife radiosurgery are alternatives for patients unsuitable for MVD or with idiopathic TN [^114av2CV] [^113isByQ].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Neuralgia significantly impairs **quality of life**, causing anxiety, depression, and functional disability [^115g5LyF]. Early diagnosis and effective treatment improve outcomes, but many patients experience chronic pain and require long-term management [^113aNB2p].

---

## Recent advances and emerging therapies

Recent research has improved understanding of neuralgia pathophysiology, leading to **new diagnostic criteria and classification systems** [^113bNjs9]. Emerging therapies include novel sodium channel blockers, neuromodulation techniques, and minimally invasive surgical approaches, although further research is needed to establish their efficacy and safety [^111Ekw2B].

---

Neuralgia is characterized by **severe, paroxysmal pain** in the distribution of a specific nerve, most commonly the trigeminal nerve. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by MRI to exclude secondary causes. First-line treatment includes carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, with surgery reserved for refractory cases. Early diagnosis and guideline-based care are essential for optimal outcomes.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for occipital nerve stimulation for the treatment of patients with medically refractory occipital neuralgia: update [^113eaaTx]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The Guidelines Task Force conducted a systematic review of the relevant literature on occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) for occipital neuralgia (ON) to update the original 2015 guidelines to ensure timeliness and accuracy for clinical practice.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review of the literature and update the evidence-based guidelines on ONS for ON.

Methods

The Guidelines Task Force conducted another systematic review of the relevant literature, using the same search terms and strategies used to search PubMed and Embase for relevant literature. The updated search included studies published between 1966 and January 2023. The same inclusion/exclusion criteria as the original guideline were also applied. Abstracts were reviewed, and relevant full text articles were retrieved and graded. Of 307 articles, 18 were retrieved for full-text review and analysis. Recommendations were updated according to new evidence yielded by this update.

Results

Nine studies were included in the original guideline, reporting the use of ONS as an effective treatment option for patients with medically refractory ON. An additional 6 studies were included in this update. All studies in the original guideline and this current update provide Class III evidence.

Conclusion

Based on the availability of new literature, the current article is a minor update only that does not result in modification of the prior recommendations: Clinicians may use ONS as a treatment option for patients with medically refractory ON.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: new classification and diagnostic grading for practice and research [^113bNjs9]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) critically depends on a patient's description of pathognomonic pain attacks. Unequivocal definition of the characteristic features of TN is therefore mandatory. Diagnostic criteria must encompass variants of the clinical phenotype and incorporate the etiology of TN. However, existing criteria are plagued by terminologic inconsistencies that compromise the communication among patients, physicians, and researchers (appendix e-1 on the Neurology ® Web site at). Two recently published diagnostic guidelines have inadvertently made the classification of TN harder.

Although TN is a prototype of neuropathic pain, typical TN does not fit the grading system for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. For a definite diagnosis, the grading system requires objective signs or tests that reveal an underlying lesion or disease of the nervous system. This requirement is suitable for secondary forms of TN, but cannot be applied to classical TN, the most common form of the neuralgia. Conversely, the most recent edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) no longer lists symptomatic or secondary TN as a diagnostic category, leaving a widely used designation for TN that is caused by a major neurologic disease without defined criteria. Recognizing these shortcomings, we developed a new classification of TN that accommodates the needs of clinical practice and research, matches the grading system for neuropathic pain, and corresponds to the common nosology of neurologic disorders. Treatment recommendations are beyond the scope of this article, but we anticipate that they will become more specific following widespread use of the proposed classification.

### Sluder's neuralgia: a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia? [^115DUUcX]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

The objective was to formulate distinctive criteria to substantiate our opinion that Sluder's neuralgia and cluster headache are two different clinical entities. A systematic review was carried out of all available, original literature on Sluder's neuralgia. Pain characteristics, periodicity and associated signs and symptoms were studied and listed according to frequency of appearance. Eleven articles on Sluder's neuralgia were evaluated. Several differences between Sluder's neuralgia and cluster headache became evident. Based on described symptoms, new criteria for Sluder's neuralgia could be formulated. Sluder's neuralgia and cluster headache could possibly be regarded as two different headache syndromes, and Sluder's neuralgia could be a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia.

### Advances in diagnosis, classification, pathophysiology, and management of trigeminal neuralgia [^113aNB2p]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia is a very painful neurological condition with severe, stimulus-evoked, short-lasting stabbing pain attacks in the face. The past decade has offered new insights into trigeminal neuralgia symptomatology, pathophysiology, and treatment, leading to a change in the classification of the condition. An accurate diagnosis is crucial because neuroimaging interpretation and clinical management differ among the various forms of facial pain. MRI using specific sequences should be a part of the diagnostic workup to detect a possible neurovascular contact and exclude secondary causes. Demonstration of a neurovascular contact should not be used to confirm a diagnosis but rather to facilitate surgical decision making. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are drugs of first choice for long-term treatment, whereas microvascular decompression is the first-line surgery in medically refractory patients. Advances in neuroimaging techniques and animal models will provide further insight into the causes of trigeminal neuralgia and its pathophysiology. Development of more efficacious treatment options is highly warranted.

### Trigeminal neuralgia [^1138rwFB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, unilateral, brief, stabbing, recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Pain occurs in paroxysms, which can last from a few seconds to several minutes. The frequency of the paroxysms ranges from a few to hundreds of attacks a day. Periods of remission can last for months to years, but tend to shorten over time. The condition can impair activities of daily living and lead to depression.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of ongoing treatments in people with trigeminal neuralgia? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found seven studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: baclofen; carbamazepine; gabapentin; lamotrigine; oxcarbazepine; microvascular decompression; and destructive neurosurgical techniques (radiofrequency thermocoagulation, glycerol rhizolysis, balloon compression, and stereotactic radiosurgery).

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^113AaNGb]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) research priorities emphasize that the efficacy of new drugs and, in particular, surgical interventions, needs to be determined in well- designed RCTs, and that randomized treatment allocation and independent outcome assessment would go a long way to establish the efficacy of the surgical techniques. Surgical comparison is proposed to be answered with a prospective study comparing long- term outcomes in patients with TN undergoing microvascular decompression with and without neurovascular contact identified on preoperative high-resolution MRI. The optimal timing of surgical referral remains a crucial question, including the clinical uncertainties "How many different drugs should be tried before referring a patient for surgery?" and "What is the likelihood that a patient with TN failing OXC or CBZ will respond to alternative drugs?", which could be answered by a large prospective cohort survey of patients with TN treated in a standardized, stepwise fashion.

### Trigeminal neuralgia [^117B1nY4]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, unilateral, brief, stabbing, recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Pain occurs in paroxysms which last from a few seconds to 2 minutes. The frequency of the paroxysms ranges from a few to hundreds of attacks a day. Periods of remission can last for months to years, but tend to shorten over time.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with trigeminal neuralgia? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ablative neurosurgical techniques to the Gasserian ganglion, baclofen, carbamazepine, clonazepam, cryotherapy of peripheral nerves, gabapentin, lamotrigine, microvascular decompression, nerve block, oxcarbazepine, peripheral acupuncture, phenytoin, proparacaine eye drops, sodium valproate, stereotactic radiosurgery, tizanidine, and topiramate.

Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common cause of facial pain.

Purpose

To answer the following questions: 1) In patients with TN, how often does routine neuroimaging (CT, MRI) identify a cause? 2) Which features identify patients at increased risk for symptomatic TN (STN; i.e., a structural cause such as a tumor)? 3) Does high-resolution MRI accurately identify patients with neurovascular compression? 4) Which drugs effectively treat classic and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia? 5) When should surgery be offered? 6) Which surgical technique gives the longest pain-free period with the fewest complications and good quality of life?

Methods

Systematic review of the literature by a panel of experts.

Conclusions

In patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), routine head imaging identifies structural causes in up to 15% of patients and may be considered useful (Level C). Trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic TN (STN) and should be considered useful in distinguishing STN from classic trigeminal neuralgia (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI to identify neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve (Level U). Carbamazepine (Level A) or oxcarbazepine (Level B) should be offered for pain control while baclofen and lamotrigine (Level C) may be considered useful. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C). The role of surgery vs pharmacotherapy in the management of TN in patients with MS remains uncertain.

### Trigeminal neuralgia [^112NWPtt]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia is an uncommon disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of lancinating pain in the trigeminal nerve distribution. Typically, brief attacks are triggered by talking, chewing, teeth brushing, shaving, a light touch, or even a cool breeze. The pain is nearly always unilateral, and it may occur repeatedly throughout the day. The diagnosis is typically determined clinically, although imaging studies or referral for specialized testing may be necessary to rule out other diseases. Accurate and prompt diagnosis is important because the pain of trigeminal neuralgia can be severe. Carbamazepine is the drug of choice for the initial treatment of trigeminal neuralgia; however, baclofen, gabapentin, and other drugs may provide relief in refractory cases. Neurosurgical treatments may help patients in whom medical therapy is unsuccessful or poorly tolerated.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) — diagnostic workflow context: Based upon cost, local expertise and availability, and patient preferences, obtaining trigeminal reflex testing or head imaging are both reasonable next steps. Because of a high diagnostic accuracy, MRI might reasonably be foregone in a patient with normal trigeminal reflexes.

Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) — first-line pharmacotherapy and evidence gaps: The two drugs to consider as first-line therapy in TN are carbamazepine (CBZ) (200–1,200 mg/day) and oxcarbazepine (OXC) (600–1,800 mg/day). Although the evidence for CBZ is stronger than for OXC, the latter may pose fewer safety concerns. There is little evidence to guide the clinician after the treatment of patients with TN who fail first-line therapy, the effect of other drugs commonly used in neuropathic pain is unknown, and there are no published studies directly comparing polytherapy with monotherapy.

Discussion

This 5-year study is the first to prospectively describe long-term outcomes of surgical (n = 95) and medical (n = 132) treatment for trigeminal neuralgia within the same clinical setting using guideline-adherent care. With the highly important caveat that the two groups do not directly compare, both treatment pathways led to substantial pain reduction and high patient satisfaction. MVD, however, was associated with higher rates of pain freedom, greater overall pain reduction, and lower medication use, supporting earlier findings of its superiority. The evidence base for current medical treatment guidelines remains limited, ranging from very low to moderate quality, with few randomized placebo-controlled trials. In this context, real-world studies like ours provide important evidence to guide treatment decisions.

Long-term outcomes in medical vs surgical treatment

Both cohorts experienced a similarly high pain burden at baseline. At 5 years, nearly 60% of MVD patients were pain-free, compared to about one-third of the medical cohort. Notably, over half of medically treated patients achieved a ≥ 30% pain reduction — a threshold considered clinically meaningful — exceeding rates typically observed in central neuropathic pain or diabetic neuropathy. These results support meaningful long-term benefit from both treatment strategies when delivered in a specialized, multidisciplinary setting.

Predictors of long-term outcome

In the MVD cohort, male sex was significantly associated with excellent surgical outcome, consistent with previous studies. NVC with morphological changes showed a non-significant trend toward better outcomes, possibly reflecting limited power or biological heterogeneity. While male sex was independently associated with better outcomes, formal interaction analysis did not support a sex-specific effect of NVC. Our earlier work suggests that even patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia and (simple) NVC without morphological changes may benefit from MVD, though these cases require individualized evaluation using high-resolution MRI. The current findings support this as 26% of the MVD patients did not present with morphological changes on a preoperative MRI.

Esmail Jorjani was a prominent Persian physician of the 11th and 12th centuries. We present Jorjani's descriptions of probable trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, and Bell's palsy. Additionally, on the basis of our translations of his original text, we believe that Jorjani may have been the first to implicate an artery-nerve conflict as an etiology of trigeminal neuralgia. This theory, documented in Jorjani's Treasure of the Khawarazm Shah and elaborated on by Dandy and Jannetta, constitutes the basis of a modern surgical approach to trigeminal neuralgia. The authors also describe the life and works of Esmail Jorjani and review his Treasure for its descriptions related to the aforementioned cranial nerve pathologies.

Trigeminal neuralgia — clinical features for identifying symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN): seven papers (one graded Class IV) assessed clinical characteristics distinguishing STN from classic TN (CTN), including sensory deficits, age at onset, first trigeminal division involvement, bilateral trigeminal involvement, and unresponsiveness to treatment; one study was graded Class III, and four cohort studies with broad spectra were graded Class II due to retrospective data collection; across studies, first-division involvement and unresponsiveness were not associated with increased STN risk, while younger age was significantly associated with increased risk but its diagnostic accuracy was too low to be clinically useful for discriminating CTN and STN.

Predictors of symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) risk among patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN): Younger age and abnormal trigeminal nerve evoked potentials are probably associated with an increased risk of STN, but there is too much overlap in patients with classic TN (CTN) and STN for these predictors to be considered clinically useful. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerves probably increases the risk of STN, whereas the absence of these features does not rule out STN. Involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve and unresponsiveness to treatment are probably not associated with an increased risk of STN.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^114av2CV]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a highly disabling disorder characterised by very severe, brief and electric shock like recurrent episodes of facial pain. New diagnostic criteria, which subclassify TN on the basis of presence of trigeminal neurovascular conflict or an underlying neurological disorder, should be used as they allow better characterisation of patients and help in decision-making regarding medical and surgical treatments. MR imaging, including high-resolution trigeminal sequences, should be performed as part of the diagnostic work-up. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are drugs of first choice. Lamotrigine, gabapentin, pregabalin, botulinum toxin type A and baclofen can be used either alone or as add-on therapy. Surgery should be considered if the pain is poorly controlled or the medical treatments are poorly tolerated. Trigeminal microvascular decompression is the first-line surgery in patients with trigeminal neurovascular conflict while neuroablative surgical treatments can be offered if MR imaging does not show any neurovascular contact or where patients are considered too frail for microvascular decompression or do not wish to take the risk.

### Other facial neuralgias [^115EujfH]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Premise In this article we review some lesser known cranial neuralgias that are distinct from trigeminal neuralgia, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, or trigeminal neuropathies. Included are occipital neuralgia, superior laryngeal neuralgia, auriculotemporal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal and nervus intermedius neuralgia, and pain from acute herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia of the trigeminal and intermedius nerves. Problem Facial neuralgias are rare and many physicians do not see such cases in their lifetime, so patients with a suspected diagnosis within this group should be referred to a specialized center where multidisciplinary team diagnosis may be available. Potential solution Each facial neuralgia can be identified on the basis of clinical presentation, allowing for precision diagnosis and planning of treatment. Treatment remains conservative with oral or topical medication recommended for neuropathic pain to be tried before more invasive procedures are undertaken. However, evidence for efficacy of current treatments remains weak.

Background

Trigeminal neuralgia is a severe facial pain disorder with major impact on quality of life. Long-term prospective data comparing medical and surgical treatments remain scarce. This study compared 5-year outcomes of medical management and microvascular decompression (MVD) and explored predictors of treatment response.

Methods

We conducted a prospective observational cohort study at a national referral center (2012–2019). Consecutive patients with classical or idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia underwent MRI, baseline assessment, and systematic 5-year follow-up. Treatment allocation (medical therapy or MVD) followed clinical evaluation and international guidelines. The primary outcome was categorized as pain-free without medication, pain-free with medication, continued pain without medication, or continued pain with medication.

Results

Of 626 eligible patients, 227 completed follow-up (95 MVD, 132 medical). Pain-free without medication was achieved in 59% of MVD patients versus 19% of medically treated [relative risk (RR) 3.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67–5.50]. Pain-free with medication occurred in 1% after MVD versus 14% of the medical cohort (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04–0.69). Continued pain on medication was less frequent after MVD (22% vs 49%; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24–0.80). Male sex predicted excellent outcome after MVD (odds ratio 2.60, 95% CI 1.02–6.91). Postoperative hypoesthesia occurred in 23% and hearing impairment in 7%, while 55% of medically treated patients reported side effects.

Conclusions

MVD provided superior long-term pain relief, higher rates of medication-free pain freedom, and reduced medication use compared with medical management, supporting earlier surgical consideration in selected patients and emphasizing individualized, guideline-based care.

### Drug treatment of trigeminal neuralgia: a systematic review of the literature [^112N27UJ]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study undertook a systematic review of the literature on drug treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.

Methods

An electronic search was carried out for articles published between January 1960 to February 2005. Studies with high level of evidence were included. The levels of evidence of the articles were classified after the guidelines of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

Results

Of 770 publications, only 21 publications showed a high level of evidence (6 randomized controlled trials and 15 clinical trials/controlled clinical trials), with a total of 348 patients. A total of 749 publications were not included in the review as they showed a low level of evidence.

Conclusions

Anticonvulsants are effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia; however, few studies with high levels of evidence were found. It is quite difficult to compare or even combine their outcomes in a scientifically meaningful manner. Due to insufficient research data, there is a need for high-quality randomized controlled trials in this area of medicine.

Diagnostic criteria and classification

The International Classification of Headache Disorders third edition (ICHD-3) criteria for TN require recurrent paroxysms of unilateral facial pain restricted to the trigeminal distribution, lasting from a fraction of a second to 2 min, severe in intensity with an electric shock-like shooting, stabbing or sharp quality, and precipitated by innocuous stimuli (see box 1).

Box 1
International Classification of Headache Disorders edition 3 (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria for trigeminal neuralgia

Recurrent paroxysms of unilateral facial pain in the distribution(s) of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve, with no radiation beyond, and fulfilling criteria B and C.
Pain has all of the following characteristics: Lasting from a fraction of a second to 2 min. Severe intensity. Electric shock-like shooting, stabbing or sharp in quality.
Precipitated by innocuous stimuli within the affected trigeminal distribution.
Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

TN is further subclassified into classical, secondary or idiopathic, depending on the underlying cause (figure 1). The classical type, which is the most common and accounts for 75% of cases, is diagnosed when there is trigeminal neurovascular compression with morphological changes ipsilateral to the side of the pain, demonstrated either on MR imaging with appropriate trigeminal sequences or during surgery. Simple trigeminal contact without morphological changes is not sufficient to underpin such a diagnosis as this is a common neuroimaging finding in healthy people. Indeed, prospective trigeminal MR imaging studies have shown that on the symptomatic side, classical TN is associated with neurovascular compression with morphological changes (distortion, indentation, atrophy) while these morphological changes are rare on the asymptomatic side. The secondary type, accounting for approximately 15% of cases, is attributable to an identifiable underlying neurological disease (except trigeminal neurovascular compression) that is known to cause TN, such as cerebellopontine angle tumour, arteriovenous malformation and multiple sclerosis. Approximately 2% of people with multiple sclerosis have symptoms similar to those of TN. The idiopathic type, accounting for approximately 10% of cases, is diagnosed when no apparent cause for TN can be found.

Idiopathic and classical TN are further subclassified in groups with purely paroxysmal pain or with concomitant continuous pain (depending on the presence or absence of continuous or near continuous interictal pain).

Several issues regarding diagnosis, pharmacological treatment, and surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) are still unsettled. The American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies launched a joint Task Force to prepare general guidelines for the management of this condition. After systematic review of the literature the Task Force came to a series of evidence-based recommendations. In patients with TN MRI may be considered to identify patients with structural causes. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes should be considered useful to disclose symptomatic TN, whereas younger age of onset, involvement of the first division, unresponsiveness to treatment and abnormal trigeminal evoked potentials are not useful in distinguishing symptomatic from classic TN. Carbamazepine (stronger evidence) or oxcarbazepine (better tolerability) should be offered as first-line treatment for pain control. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy early surgical therapy may be considered. Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife and microvascular decompression may be considered. Microvascular decompression may be considered over other surgical techniques to provide the longest duration of pain freedom. The role of surgery versus pharmacotherapy in the management of TN in patients with multiple sclerosis remains uncertain.

### Five-year prospective outcomes of medical management and microvascular decompression in trigeminal neuralgia [^115VS6Q2]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia is a severe facial pain disorder characterized by recurrent, shock-like paroxysms affecting one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. It significantly impacts quality of life, with up to 45% of patients missing daily activities and more than 50% experiencing anxiety. Trigeminal neuralgia also poses a substantial economic burden through direct medical costs and productivity loss. The management traditionally involves several specialties, including neurology, neurosurgery, radiology, and dentistry. Yet very few high-quality prospective studies evaluate treatment efficacy and side effects, and none compare medical and surgical outcomes.

First-line treatment consists of the sodium channel blockers carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, while second-line options include gabapentin, pregabalin, and lamotrigine. In a prospective study of 103 medically treated patients, 51% achieved more than 50% pain reduction after 2 years. However, side effects are common, affecting 85%, with 44% discontinuing treatment due to intolerance. Women may experience higher pain recurrence and lower tolerability to first-line drugs, though the impact of sex on long-term outcomes remains unclear.

When medical treatment fails, international guidelines recommend procedures, such as microvascular decompression (MVD), balloon compression, or radiofrequency thermocoagulation. These options carry surgical risks, particularly MVD, which is the preferred option for classical trigeminal neuralgia where neurovascular contact (NVC) causes morphological changes of the trigeminal nerve, such as displacement, indentation, or atrophy. MVD may also benefit some patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia and NVC without morphological changes.

Long-term prospective data on medical and surgical outcomes, including prognostic factors, are essential to guide treatment decisions. Building on previous research, this study aims to evaluate 5-year outcomes of medical treatment and MVD in trigeminal neuralgia patients managed within the same clinical setting. Objectives are to assess pain relief, medication use, and patient-reported outcomes, identify predictors of treatment success or failure, and, for the first time, directly compare long-term medical and surgical outcomes under standardized care.

### The IASP classification of chronic pain for ICD-11: chronic neuropathic pain [^113eRBio]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

The upcoming 11th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) of the World Health Organization (WHO) offers a unique opportunity to improve the representation of painful disorders. For this purpose, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) has convened an interdisciplinary task force of pain specialists. Here, we present the case for a reclassification of nervous system lesions or diseases associated with persistent or recurrent pain for ≥ 3 months. The new classification lists the most common conditions of peripheral neuropathic pain: trigeminal neuralgia, peripheral nerve injury, painful polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and painful radiculopathy. Conditions of central neuropathic pain include pain caused by spinal cord or brain injury, poststroke pain, and pain associated with multiple sclerosis. Diseases not explicitly mentioned in the classification are captured in residual categories of ICD-11. Conditions of chronic neuropathic pain are either insufficiently defined or missing in the current version of the ICD, despite their prevalence and clinical importance. We provide the short definitions of diagnostic entities for which we submitted more detailed content models to the WHO. Definitions and content models were established in collaboration with the Classification Committee of the IASP's Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG). Up to 10% of the general population experience neuropathic pain. The majority of these patients do not receive satisfactory relief with existing treatments. A precise classification of chronic neuropathic pain in ICD-11 is necessary to document this public health need and the therapeutic challenges related to chronic neuropathic pain.

### Psychological assessment in patients affected by trigeminal neuralgia. A systematic review [^115g5LyF]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review regarding the presence and type of psychological comorbidities in patients with trigeminal neuralgia and to determine the potential impact of surgical treatments on these conditions. We reviewed the literature following PRISMA guidelines to identify and critically examine relevant studies. The review question was formulated according to the PICO framework as follows: "For patients affected by trigeminal neuralgia (P) undergoing neuropsychological assessments (I) and potentially undergoing reassessment after surgical treatment (C), is there a correlation between psychological issues and trigeminal neuralgia, and does the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia improve psychological well-being (O)?". The literature search yielded a total of 316 results. After removing duplicates (n = 73), 243 papers were screened. Following title and abstract screening, 222 records were excluded. Ultimately, 11 studies were deemed relevant to the research purpose. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review highlighting the significant psychological burden of trigeminal neuralgia, including higher risks of sleep, depressive, and anxiety disorders. Surgical treatments effectively alleviate both pain and psychological symptoms, and multidisciplinary approaches combining psychological support and neuro-rehabilitation with medical or surgical care yield better outcomes. Standardizing psychological assessment and treatment methodologies is crucial for optimizing trigeminal neuralgia management. Clinical trial number: Not applicable.

### Neuromodulation in postherpetic neuralgia: case reports and review of the literature [^113sAf6L]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is common in the United States. Current treatment options for PHN are fairly limited. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) are considered mostly experimental and still rarely performed in patients with PHN.

Design

Two case reports and a review of the literature.

Setting

Tertiary academic medical center.

Methods

1) Pubmed, Ovid, and EBMR databases were searched for all reports that had the following key words: postherpetic neuralgia, spinal cord stimulation, and peripheral nerve stimulation. 2) A retrospective chart review was performed for all the patients that underwent PNS for PHN at Mayo Clinic Florida (MCF).

Results

There were 20 original reports that described 309 patients with PHN who were treated with SCS. Sixteen reports had a permanent implantation of SCS, with a total of 255 patients, out of which 120 had long-term pain relief. There were six reports of subcutaneous PNS for PHN (in a thoracic area). Four reports provided data on success rates where all five patients received complete pain relief. In our practice, two patients underwent subcutaneous PNS for PHN (in the thoracic area) with good pain relief for 10months and 2.5years, respectively.

Conclusions

Based on our review of the literature and the two cases at MCF, subcutaneous PNS seems to be a promising intervention in the treatment of PHN.

### Psychological assessment in patients affected by trigeminal neuralgia. A systematic review [^1131yrog]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review adhered to established guidelines, such as PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), for identifying and critically evaluating relevant studies. All procedures followed the protocols outlined in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis of Interventions (version 6.3). The review question was structured using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes) framework: "For patients affected by trigeminal neuralgia (P) undergoing neuropsychological assessments (I) and potentially undergoing reassessment after surgical treatment (C), is there a correlation between psychological issues and trigeminal neuralgia, and does the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia improve psychological well-being (O)?". Electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus) were search using comprehensive search terms: "(Trigeminal neuralgia) AND (Psychology)".

The latest search was conducted in November 2024. Two authors (R.M. and S.V.) independently conducted the abstract screening for eligibility. Any discordance was solved by consensus with a third, senior author (N.M.). Studies meeting the following criteria were included: studies that reported psychological assessment in patients affected by TN with appropriate scales, comparing evaluation between pre and postoperative period, or investigating the association between TN and psychological issues. Exclusion criteria comprised: studies published in languages other than English, systematic reviews, case reports, studies including less than 3 patients affected by TN, letters to the editor. Extracted data encompassed study characteristics, patient demographics, surgical details, type of TN, type of psychological assessment, pain relief and recurrences, and outcomes. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions) assessment tool.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^116Ho1Zg]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Recent advances in TN have led to an improvement in its classification on the basis of the neuroimaging findings. Better understanding and description of other neuralgiform disorders such as SUNCT and SUNA have made the differential diagnosis clearer. Improved care pathways involving multidisciplinary teams and potentially new medications is resulting in improved outcomes for patients with TN.

Key points

Trigeminal neuralgia is currently classified into three subgroups: idiopathic, classical and secondary, based on imaging findings; MR brain imaging with trigeminal sequences is therefore essential in the diagnostic work-up.
An accurate diagnosis is crucial because the clinical management differs among the various forms of facial pain.
Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine remain the medications of choice; lamotrigine, gabapentin, pregabalin, botulinum toxin type A and baclofen can be used as second-line treatments in monotherapy or polytherapy.
In pharmaco-resistant cases, trigeminal microvascular decompression is the first-line surgery in patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia, whereas neuroablative surgical treatments and microvascular decompression can be considered in idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia.
Pharmaco-resistant cases as well as cases where diagnosis is unclear should be referred to multidisciplinary facial pain teams led by neurologists specialising in headache disorders, where dedicated teams may confirm the diagnosis and offer advanced treatments.

### Occipital nerve stimulation for the treatment of patients with medically refractory occipital neuralgia: congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guideline [^1117Hx2d]. Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Occipital neuralgia (ON) is a disorder characterized by sharp, electrical, paroxysmal pain, originating from the occiput and extending along the posterior scalp, in the distribution of the greater, lesser, and/or third occipital nerve. Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) constitutes a promising therapy for medically refractory ON because it is reversible with minimal side effects and has shown continued efficacy with long-term follow-up.

Objective

To conduct a systematic literature review and provide treatment recommendations for the use of ONS for the treatment of patients with medically refractory ON.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed database and the Cochrane Library to locate articles published between 1966 and April 2014 using MeSH headings and keywords relevant to ONS as a means to treat ON. A second literature search was conducted using the PubMed database and the Cochrane Library to locate articles published between 1966 and June 2014 using MeSH headings and keywords relevant to interventions that predict response to ONS in ON. The strength of evidence of each article that underwent full text review and the resulting strength of recommendation were graded according to the guidelines development methodology of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons Joint Guidelines Committee.

Results

Nine studies met the criteria for inclusion in this guideline. All articles provided Class III Level evidence.

Conclusion

Based on the data derived from this systematic literature review, the following Level III recommendation can be made: the use of ONS is a treatment option for patients with medically refractory ON.

### Evaluating youTube as a resource for trigeminal neuralgia patient education [^115HoiV6]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to examine the educational value of YouTube as a source of patient information regarding trigeminal neuralgia and its treatment. We also sought to determine the degree of bias that is present in the top videos regarding this condition.

Materials and Methods

We selected 6 search terms related to trigeminal neuralgia to examine on YouTube for quality and bias using the DISCERN criteria. Filtering by relevance and total view count, we determined the top 20 results for each search term and evaluated all videos for overall educational quality and creator bias. We categorized the type of content creator and compared overall DISCERN scores and bias scores between creator type and search term.

Results

There were 80 unique and 40 duplicate videos. There were 10,745,574 total views across all videos, with an average view count of 89,546. The mean DISCERN score for all videos was 1.7, and the mean bias score was 2.2. Based on individual search terms, the highest mean DISCERN score was for trigeminal neuralgia surgery (2.1) and the highest mean bias score was for tic douloureux (2.8). Among creator types, medical professionals had significantly higher overall (2.2) and bias (2.6) scores.

Conclusions

Overall, YouTube is a relatively poor source of unbiased information about trigeminal neuralgia. Among the existing content, medical professionals provide educational material that is the highest quality and the most unbiased.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^112znau4]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Abortive treatments are not useful in the management of TN due to the brevity of the attacks. The mainstay of management is pharmacological preventive treatments. However, acute treatments that work rapidly have to be used occasionally for severe exacerbation. Surgical interventions are reserved for patients who fail to respond to or adequately tolerate medical therapies.

Pharmacological preventive treatments

The arsenal of preventive treatments for TN has now been in use for several decades but the quality of the evidence base is poor and there are few high-quality randomised controlled trials. Though these treatments are not supported by good quality randomised controlled trials, the clinical experience with some of these drugs (particularly carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin, pregabalin, baclofen and botulinum toxin type A) is good, resulting in meaningful pain control although with still a substantial unmet need for more effective and better tolerated drugs. Table 4 summarises the available data on the commonly used drugs. Table 5 outlines the preventive treatments, recommended doses, and titration and tapering regimens we use. While monotherapy is preferred, up to one-third of patients require polytherapy, emphasising these patients' unmet therapeutic need. Patients should be encouraged to keep pain diaries to enable monitoring of response to treatments.

Trigeminal reflex testing and trigeminal evoked potentials — diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) from classic trigeminal neuralgia (CTN): Across studies, trigeminal reflex testing showed sensitivity range 59 to 100% and specificity range 93 to 100%, with pooled sensitivity 94% (95% CI, 91–97) and pooled specificity 87% (95% CI, 77–93). Evoked potentials did not distinguish STN from CTN with high accuracy, with sensitivity 60 to 100% and specificity 49 to 76%, and pooled sensitivity 84% (95% CI, 73–92) and pooled specificity 64% (95% CI, 56–71), and many patients with STN had normal evoked potentials while many with CTN had abnormal evoked potentials. Abnormal trigeminal reflexes are probably useful in distinguishing STN from CTN.

### A 9 year follow up of post herpetic neuralgia and predisposing factors in elderly patients following herpes zoster [^115NRDMK]. The Journal of Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

To characterise predisposition to post herpetic neuralgia following herpes zoster.

Design

Late follow up of patients originally admitted with acute zoster to a double blind randomised placebo controlled study of oral acyclovir over 60 years of age.

Setting

Two UK cities of 1.5 million population.

Results

158 of the 298 patients from the original study were available for evaluation at a mean follow up of 9 years. Thirty four (21%) described experiencing pain from the zoster within the previous 12 months. Pain at follow up was associated with characteristics at the time of acute zoster of: moderate or severe acute pain (p = 0.006), prodromal pain > 72 h before rash (p = 0.006), severity of rash (p = 0.033) and female gender (p = 0.046). There was no association between pain at 9 year follow up and use of placebo or aciclovir nor with the presence or absence of pain at the point of discharge from the original study. Further analysis of 17 of the 34 patients with long term pain who have full data available, the median pain score was 4 out of 10 and more than 50% described persistent pain and interference with sleep.

Conclusion

Long term pain in the elderly following zoster is associated with identifiable characteristics during the acute illness.

### Design of phase 3 studies evaluating vixotrigine for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia [^111XJJXG]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

TN can be classified into types; the diagnostic criteria and terminology for the different types of TN has changed slightly over the existing editions of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. In the current third edition, classical TN is associated with vascular compression of the root of the trigeminal nerve near the pons of the brainstem, leading to morphological changes of the nerve root. Secondary TN is caused by a lesion other than vascular compression, eg, multiple sclerosis.TN may also be classified as idiopathic in cases where no neurovascular compression or other lesions are noted.

Current first-line therapies for pain control in patients with TN include the anticonvulsant drugs carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine; carbamazepine is the only drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of TN. Both are voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) blockers that raise the threshold of excitability, thus decreasing the increased frequency of neuronal firings thought to underlie TN pain. Although these drugs have proven efficacy in decreasing TN pain, their use is limited by the need for dose titration, monitoring for hyponatremia and decreased hematologic cell counts, the eventual development of tachyphylaxis in most patients, and, for many, poor tolerability, including the potential for life-threatening side effects such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, cognitive impairment, and drug interactions. In a prospective observational survey of 161 participants with TN receiving either carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, 31.3% reported tiredness and 22.7% reported memory problems.

### History of facial pain diagnosis [^112GYqxD]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

There are other causes of TN. Wartenberg had previously pointed out that several cases can be associated with tumours, yet all have classical features of TN. Subsequently, it has been noted that posterior fossa meningiomas or neuromas are found in about 2% of cases presenting with a typical TN. When tumours are located more peripherally, they are likely to be associated with sensory disturbances. Multiple sclerosis is associated with TN and is seen in 2–4% of patients with MS. It can even be the first sign of MS, and some of these patients have bilateral pain.

In 1988, the first classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders, cranial neuralgias and facial pain was published by the International Headache Society. This classification has subsequently been revised. In the third beta version from 2013, TN is now divided into three classes: Classical TN with morphological changes in the trigeminal root by a vessel, secondary TN, where the neuralgia is secondary to an identifiable neurological disease, and idiopathic TN where the etiology is unknown.

Gamma knife surgery (GKS) for trigeminal neuralgia — effectiveness, onset, and sensory adverse effects: There is one Class I randomized controlled trial comparing two different regimens, and this study showed no major differences between the gamma knife techniques used. One year after gamma knife therapy complete pain relief with no medication occurs in up to 69% of patients, falling to 52% at 3 years, and pain relief can be delayed for a mean of 1 month. In the Class III studies, sensory complications occur in an average of 6% of patients; in large Class IV series facial numbness is reported in 9 to 37% of patients and troublesome sensory loss or paresthesia in 6 to 13%, whereas anesthesia dolorosa is practically absent. Quality of life improves and 88% are satisfied with the outcome.

### Five-year prospective outcomes of medical management and microvascular decompression in trigeminal neuralgia [^111uamCe]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This prospective, real-world study strongly indicates that MVD provides superior long-term pain relief, pain freedom, and reduced medication use compared to medical therapy in trigeminal neuralgia. The male sex and the presence of NVC with morphological changes were associated with better surgical outcomes. These findings support earlier surgical consideration in selected patients and emphasize the importance of individualized, guideline-based treatment strategies.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) — diagnostic and treatment recommendations: For patients with TN, routine imaging may be considered to identify STN (Level C). The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerves should be considered useful to identify patients with STN; however, because of poor specificity, the absence of these features is not useful for excluding STN (Level B). Measuring trigeminal reflexes in a qualified electrophysiologic laboratory should be considered useful for distinguishing STN from CTN (Level B). Younger age at onset, involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve, unresponsiveness to treatment, and abnormal trigeminal evoked potentials should be disregarded as useful for accurately identifying patients with STN (Level B). To control pain in patients with TN: carbamazepine should be offered (Level A), oxcarbazepine should be considered (Level B), baclofen, lamotrigine, and pimozide may be considered (Level C), and topical ophthalmic anesthesia should not be considered (Level B). For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy: early surgical therapy may be considered (Level C), and percutaneous procedures on the Gasserian ganglion, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C).

Medication use across treatment pathways

MVD was linked to a substantial reduction in medication use. At 5 years, most surgical patients had discontinued medical treatment, while the medical cohort showed relatively stable medication use over time, with some patients continuing long-term combination therapy. The reduction in medication use following MVD might reflect its role in targeting the presumed root cause of classical trigeminal neuralgia, rather than symptom reduction. Importantly, medication discontinuation is likely to contribute to improved quality of life, given the side-effect burden observed in this study and in previous studies, of standard trigeminal neuralgia drugs. Furthermore, long-term use of AED in trigeminal neuralgia patients might impair cognition.

Sex-based differences in treatment and outcome

In the MVD cohort, men more frequently achieved pain freedom and discontinued medication, aligning with prior studies showing better surgical outcomes, lower recurrence risk, and greater medication tolerability in men. Women more often continued treatment, typically with second-line drugs. In the medical cohort, men more frequently used first-line sodium channel blockers, while women tended to use second-line drugs. At follow-up, more men remained on medication, often using combination therapy.

These sex-based differences may reflect anatomical, hormonal, or neurophysiological factors. Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia, which tends to be less responsive to MVD, is more common in women, who are also more likely to report concomitant continuous pain, possibly linked to central sensitization. Delayed referral in women, previously reported for Gamma Knife radiosurgery, may further contribute to poorer outcomes. These findings support personalized treatment and the development of better-tolerated options, including newer sodium channel agents, botulinum toxin A, and emerging therapies.

Reconsidering the natural history of trigeminal neuralgia

Our findings challenge the view of trigeminal neuralgia as a progressive disorder. With the important caveat that the medical cohort did not include patients who were deemed medically refractory and therefore referred for surgery, the medical cohort demonstrated significant pain reduction, with few worsening over time. This supports previous real-world studies suggesting that, with appropriate medical management, patients with trigeminal neuralgia who respond to medical treatment may remain stable or even improve, rather than inevitably deteriorate.

Surgical techniques for TN — classification and evidence scope, including peripheral techniques. Surgical interventions are classified by principal target into peripheral techniques, percutaneous Gasserian ganglion techniques, gamma knife radiosurgery, and posterior fossa vascular decompression; the literature search found three Class I RCTs, one Class II prospective cohort study, and a handful of Class III studies, with the majority evidence Class IV, and direct comparisons between procedures are insufficient. For peripheral techniques, which involve block or destruction of trigeminal nerve portions distal to the Gasserian ganglion, two small Class I RCTs using streptomycin and lidocaine versus lidocaine alone showed no effect on pain.

Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) — procedural efficacy evidence: Percutaneous procedures on the Gasserian ganglion, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression are possibly effective in the treatment of TN (multiple Class III studies). The evidence about peripheral techniques is either negative (two Class I studies about streptomycin/lidocaine) or insufficient (Class IV studies for all the other peripheral techniques). Indirect comparisons of multiple Class III studies suggest that patients undergoing microvascular decompression have a longer duration of pain control than patients undergoing other surgical interventions. However, the lack of direct comparative studies prohibits formal conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of the surgical techniques.

### Phenytoin and carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia: marketing-based versus evidence-based treatment [^114xiZLU]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Most review articles support carbamazepine as a first-line pharmacotherapy for idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia.–However, the empirical support for this recommendation is somewhat suspect. Phenytoin, as the prototype for all anticonvulsants, was already positioned as an analgesic compound 70 years ago. Since these initial findings, the data that have been gathered have supported the use of anticonvulsants as painkillers – from phenytoin up to and including more recent anticonvulsants such as gabapentin and pregabalin. Since 1942, a number of papers supported phenytoin's therapeutic effects in trigeminal neuralgia (Table 1). The introduction of carbamazepine in 1962 by Geigy shifted the interest of neurologists from phenytoin as a treatment for trigeminal neuralgia to carbamazepine, without sound scientific evidence. To date, no convincing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published supporting the role of carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia, and we could not identify a single study comparing the effects of phenytoin with those of carbamazepine. Accordingly, phenytoin should probably be considered more often as a viable therapy for (treatment-resistant) trigeminal neuralgia.

Trigeminal neuralgia: one of the first repositioning indications of phenytoin

The exploration of phenytoin as an analgesic in neuralgic pain started 5 years after Putnam and Merritt identified the compound in 1937 as a treatment for convulsions. In 1942, a French otolaryngologist reported that 200–300 mg phenytoin daily was effective in reducing pain in three patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia. In 1944, a case study of a patient suffering from paroxysmal abdominal pain but responding well to phenytoin was presented; the pain attacks in his case were (perhaps erroneously) interpreted as a form of focal symptomatic epilepsy. The first indication in the field of pain that was explored intensively as a new indication (repositioning) for phenytoin was trigeminal neuralgia, most likely due to its paroxysmal character – reminiscent of epileptic discharges.

Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

CTN pharmacotherapy — carbamazepine (CBZ) demonstrates robust efficacy with defined tolerability, and oxcarbazepine (OXC) yields comparable pain reduction. Four placebo-controlled studies totaling 147 patients showed CBZ efficacy, with CBZ doses 300 to 2,400 mg a day and responses of 58 to 100% versus 0 to 40% on placebo; the number needed to treat to attain important pain relief was less than 2, while numbers needed to harm were 3 for minor and 24 for severe adverse events. Two Class II masked RCTs including 130 patients compared OXC 600–1,800 mg a day to CBZ, and reduction in pain was equally good for CBZ and OXC with 88% achieving a reduction of ≥ 50%. Conclusions state that "carbamazepine is established as effective" for controlling CTN pain, "oxcarbazepine is probably effective", "baclofen, lamotrigine, and pimozide are possibly effective", "topical ophthalmic anesthesia is probably ineffective", and "there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of clonazepam, gabapentin, phenytoin, tizanidine, topical capsaicin, and valproate" for CTN.

MS, multiple sclerosis; TN, trigeminal neuralgia.

Other considerations

Patients with TN, especially those whose symptoms are proving refractory to pharmacotherapy, are best managed in multidisciplinary team setting with a neurologist specialising in headache disorders, pain specialist, neurosurgeon, nurses and psychologists. In particular, we suggest that neurosurgical procedures for TN should only be done by experts with a high volume of cases to maintain the neurosurgical experience. Patients may benefit from a pain management programme to help them live well with pain and uncertainty.

Due to the rarity of the condition, patients feel isolated and patient groups such as Trigeminal Neuralgia Association TNA UK provide further invaluable support. Patients need to be provided with evidence-based written information such as provided by the Brain and Spine Foundation and advice from skilled teams.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^115N9Yev]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary Trigeminal Neuralgia

Secondary TN is pain experienced in a trigeminal distribution caused by neurological disease other than neurovascular compression. Broadly, these etiologies may fall into inflammatory/demyelinating disease (eg, multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis), tumors (eg, meningioma, vestibular schwannoma, trigeminal schwannoma, epidermoid, metastasis, glioma), other vascular lesions (eg, aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, persistent trigeminal artery), connective tissue disorders (eg, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease), congenital diseases, and other systemic conditions (eg, Paget's disease, acromegaly, syphilis) which may affect the trigeminal nerve.

TN should not be confused with other cranial nerve syndromes such as geniculate neuralgia versus nervus intermedius neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, superior laryngeal neuralgia, paratrigeminal neuralgia (Raeder's syndrome), or occipital neuralgia. Trigeminal neuropathy due to herpes zoster, trigeminal postherpetic neuralgia, painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy, or trigeminal deafferentation pain (eg, anesthesia dolorosa), must be distinguished from TN. Pain related to the mouth such as dental pain, first bite syndrome, or burning mouth syndrome should be separately elucidated. Other headache syndromes which should be diagnosed separately from TN include cluster headaches, sphenopalatine neuralgia (Sluder's neuralgia), Short Lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform Pain with Conjunctival Injection and Tearing (SUNCT), and Short Lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform Pain with Cranial Autonomic Symptoms (SUNA). Rare other forms of facial pain syndromes such as persistent idiopathic facial pain, pain of psychological origin, and central neuropathic pain should be distinguished from TN. These entities are discussed elsewhere in the literature and their management are not addressed in this manuscript.

### Genitofemoral neuralgia: adding to the burden of chronic vulvar pain [^115inJcR]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

While chronic "unexplained" vulvar pain is a debilitating condition affecting a vast number of women of all ages, this has been mostly attributed to vulvodynia epidemiology, and hence it has not been established how often chronic vulvar pain is associated with specific neuropathic pain syndromes related to neuralgia of the genitofemoral, ilioinguinal, and pudendal nerves (Figure 1), though not a rarity at a vulvar disease clinic in our experience.

Genitofemoral neuralgia was first described by Mageeas genitofemoral causalgia, and subsequently redefined by Lyon, where the current nomenclature was introduced. Genitofemoral neuralgia in women is almost exclusively known as an iatrogenic pain disorder, complicating common lower abdominal and pelvic surgical procedures such as inguinal herniorrhaphy, cesarean section, hysterectomy, and lymph node biopsy, as recently and comprehensively reviewed by Cesmebasi et al. In the original case series by Magee, there is also mention of an 11-year-old girl who developed genitofemoral neuralgia after falling while bicycling, presumably involving direct trauma to the groin by the handle bar. Murovic et al, in their series of ten patients, also reported on four patients who developed genitofemoral neuralgia after blunt abdominal trauma. We identified only one case report on spontaneous-onset genitofemoral neuralgia, not related to surgery or blunt trauma, involving a 20-year-old woman, in which nerve compression was suspected to result from tight-fitting clothing. Interestingly, also with regard to the case presented by us, bicycle riding has also been reported as a possible factor evoking genitofemoral neuralgia. Tight-fitting clothing and bicycling are often reported as aggravating or evoking factors in patients with vulvodynia or neuropathic pain attending our vulvar disease clinic, pointing at vulvar mechanical strain through pressure and friction as an important aggravating and possibly initiating factor to chronic vulvar disease, though this is poorly addressed in the medical literature. We cannot explain how the patient presented developed genitofemoral neuralgia, though possibly resulting from a tubal ligation procedure. A relationship with Crohn's disease could not be established.

### Quality of reporting in evaluations of surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia: recommendations for future reports [^116NQtfp]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

There are numerous reports on the surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, but the studies do not use uniform outcome measures, which makes it difficult for patients and clinicians to determine which treatment may be most appropriate. The objectives of this study were to set quality criteria and standards for outcome reporting for the surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (on the basis of international expert opinion), to identify and assess all studies of the surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia and evaluate the studies against those criteria, and to provide recommendations for submitting reports on the outcomes of surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.

Methods

The types of data that 11 neurosurgeons and 2 neurologists considered essential for articles reporting the outcomes of surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia were the quality criteria used by the two authors. Standards were established in terms of the minimal number and type of criteria that studies should meet to allow their use in a potential systematic review of pain outcomes of surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Studies were identified in MEDLINE searches and from other sources and were independently scored against those criteria by the two authors. The reproducibility of the method was checked with assessments of inter- and intra-rater reliability. A checklist for the reporting of studies was formulated.

Results

A total of 281 studies were identified, of which 222 were scored. Seventy-one (32%) of the studies reached the minimal set standards, but only 28 (13%) could be used for assessment of pain outcomes, because they included actuarial analyses. There was good agreement between the two authors in the scoring of the studies, although some criteria required stricter definitions. A checklist for the reporting of future studies on the surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia was proposed.

Conclusion

When assessed against the proposed criteria and standards, the quality of reporting was generally poor. The methods for reporting surgical outcomes for trigeminal neuralgia were not uniform; therefore, the comparability of results and techniques was low. Data should be collected and reported in a standardized way. A protocol for data collection and reporting on the surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia has been proposed. Further research is needed to evaluate this tool.

### Carbamazepine (Epitol) [^111NDjtJ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal Neuralgia

(See INDICATIONS AND USAGE)

Initial: On the first day, 100 mg twice a day for a total daily dose of 200 mg. This daily dose may be increased by up to 200 mg/day using increments of 100 mg every 12 hours only as needed to achieve freedom from pain. Do not exceed 1200 mg daily. Maintenance: Control of pain can be maintained in most patients with 400 to 800 mg daily. However, some patients may be maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require as much as 1200 mg daily. At least once every 3 months throughout the treatment period, attempts should be made to reduce the dose to the minimum effective level or even to discontinue the drug.

### Familial trigeminal neuralgia-a systematic clinical study with a genomic screen of the neuronal electrogenisome [^111wwaCH]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a unique neuropathic facial pain condition, characterized by unilateral paroxysmal pain, evoked by trigger factors. A subgroup of patients suffers from TN with concomitant continuous pain, described as dull, burning or aching (atypical TN). Recent diagnostic criteria distinguish TN as "classical"; that is, related to neurovascular compression producing morphological changes on the trigeminal root, "secondary" to a major neurological disease, or "idiopathic" with unknown aetiology. Genetic factors may play a role in the pathophysiology of TN: this hypothesis is suggested by the younger age of TN patients without neurovascular conflict.

Although TN usually occurs in a sporadic fashion, rare familial occurrences have been described. The occurrence of familial TN strongly supports a genetic, presumably multifactorial and polygenic, origin of TN. In this cross-sectional study, we set out to determine, for the first time, the occurrence of familial cases in a large cohort of patients with classical and idiopathic TN, and to provide a systematic description of clinical features in these familial cases. Since hyperexcitability of trigeminal ganglion neurons may contribute to the pathophysiology of TN, we carried out whole exome sequencing, filtered to focus on the electrogenisome of trigeminal ganglion neurons, in patients with familial occurrence. Given the postulated multifactorial and polygenic origin of TN, this exploratory genetic analysis provides a stepping-stone toward future studies on larger numbers of genes and with larger numbers of patients, unrelated controls and healthy family members.

### Non-antiepileptic drugs for trigeminal neuralgia [^115USqbx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Non-antiepileptic drugs have been used in trigeminal neuralgia management since the 1970s.

Objectives

The objective was to review systematically the efficacy of non-antiepileptic drugs for trigeminal neuralgia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS (all to August 2005) and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System, the database of the Chinese Cochrane Center (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2005), conference paper databases and checked bibliographies. We handsearched ten Chinese journals.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors decided which trials fitted the inclusion criteria and graded methodological quality independently.

Main Results

Nine trials of different non-antiepileptic drugs involving 223 participants were included. Each trial investigated one non-antiepileptic drug. Two trials tested baclofen. In one, more people gained 50% reduction from baseline than with placebo (relative risk 15.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 231.84, P value = 0.05). In the other, slightly more participants on baclofen had a 75% reduction in attacks on the 10th day compared with carbamazepine (relative risk 2.38, 95% CI 0.83 to 6.85, P value = 0.11). One trial showed no significant difference in reduction in average daily frequency of attacks with L-Baclofen compared with racemic baclofen. Tizanidine was investigated in two trials. In one, the proportion of people with reduction in the average number of paroxysms per day increased with tizanidine compared with placebo (relative risk 8.00, 95% CI 1.21 to 52.69, P value = 0.03). In the other, one of five participants improved in visual analog scale score with tizanidine and four of six with carbamazepine (relative risk 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.89, P value = 0.20). One study showed that the improvement in mean values of pain scores with tocainide was similar to that of carbamazepine. In one study more participants improved during the pimozide than the carbamazepine period (relative risk 1.78, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.28). In one study, proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% instillation into the eyes was not significantly different from placebo (relative risk 1.06, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.99, P value = 0.92). In another, there was moderate or marked improvement in seven of nine participants treated with clomipramine and three of nine with amitriptyline after a 12-week treatment (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.87 to 6.27).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to show significant benefit from non-antiepileptic drugs in trigeminal neuralgia. More research is needed.

### Phenytoin and carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia: marketing-based versus evidence-based treatment [^112bUzRe]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

In 1995, a systematic review was published in the BMJ covering all RCTs related to anticonvulsants prescribed for analgesia. Since 1995, no new RCTs have been indexed in this field in PubMed. The authors were able to identify only two RCTs on the efficacy of carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia. These RCTs both followed a crossover design and recruited only 27 patients and 20 patients, respectively, gauging outcomes after 5 days of treatment and 14 days, respectively. All other studies conducted were not randomized controlled studies. The authors also identified only three comparator studies wherein carbamazepine was compared to tizanidine, tocainide, and pimozide, but none comparing carbamazepine to phenytoin.

Most recent review articles state that first-line pharmacotherapy for idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia should be carbamazepine. However, given our review of the limited literature, the alternative statement supporting phenytoin as the first choice seems equally valid.

Trigeminal Neuralgia (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE)

Initial: On the first day, either 100 mg twice a day for tablets or extended-release tablets, or ½ teaspoon four times a day for suspension, for a total daily dose of 200 mg. This daily dose may be increased by up to 200 mg/day using increments of 100 mg every 12 hours for tablets or extended-release tablets, or 50 mg (½ teaspoon) four times a day for suspension, only as needed to achieve freedom from pain. Do not exceed 1200 mg daily. Maintenance: Control of pain can be maintained in most patients with 400 to 800 mg daily. However, some patients may be maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require as much as 1200 mg daily. At least once every 3 months throughout the treatment period, attempts should be made to reduce the dose to the minimum effective level or even to discontinue the drug.

### Botulinum toxin – A for the treatment of neuralgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114CLbyv]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clinical examples of neuropathic pain include trigeminal neuralgia, diabetic neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and postsurgical neuralgia. Of note, neuropathic pain is often difficult to treat and can lead to anxiety and depression, which seriously compromise patients' quality of life.

Over the years, the pharmacotherapies used for neuropathic pain include pregabalin, gabapentin, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, opioids, and so on. However, the evidence for these interventions is often inconclusive. In addition, side effects associated with the medications such as dizziness, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, and rash can be troublesome and debilitating.

Botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A), a potent neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, blocks acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions and causes muscle relaxation. Animal studies have indicated several possible mechanisms for the analgesic effects of BTX-A: 1) it inhibits the release of pain mediators from both motor and sensory neurons, and blocks the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide and other neuropeptide;2) it reduces chronic inflammation and acute injury by inhibiting neurotransmitter release; and 3) it deactivates the sodium channel in central nerve system neurons.

Recent studies have shown promising analgesic effects of BTX-A on postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, and other types of neuralgia.–However, sample sizes of the previous studies are relatively small. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BTX-A in the treatment of neuralgia based on the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) device landscape relevant to craniofacial pain and ONS indicates that multiple wireless PNS systems have received Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of pain in the trunk and the extremities, with one device recently receiving an expanded indication for the treatment of headache and axial neck pain, yet notably no permanent device has received approval for the treatment of pain in the craniofacial region. Additionally, noninvasive devices which stimulate the occipital and trigeminal nerves have been developed, with efficacy demonstrated in the acute treatment of migraines; however, no noninvasive modality has been studied specifically for ON.

### Analysis of acupoint selection and combinations in acupuncture treatment of trigeminal neuralgia: a protocol for data mining [^114oT2cC]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia is the most common facial neuralgia classified under neuropathic pain. It is characterized by a high incidence rate and significant disability, severely affecting patients' quality of life. Trigeminal neuralgia presents with sudden, brief, and excruciating pain in the areas innervated by the trigeminal nerve on the face. The pain is often described as electric-shock-like or knife-cutting, causing involuntary facial muscle twitching. This condition greatly disrupts patients' daily activities such as eating, speaking, and washing, significantly reducing their overall comfort. Therefore, it is necessary to take active measures to solve trigeminal neuralgia clinically. Currently, treatments for trigeminal neuralgia include pharmacotherapy, surgery, and nerve block therapy. However, these approaches all carry certain risks and adverse reactions.

Acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medical therapy, has demonstrated unique advantages in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Multiple clinical studies have confirmed that acupuncture can effectively alleviate the pain intensity and reduce the frequency of pain attacks in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Nevertheless, in the clinical practice of acupuncture for trigeminal neuralgia, there is a significant disparity in acupoint selection and combinations. Even in authoritative textbooks of acupuncture, there are discrepancies in acupoint selection for this disease, such as disagreements on the choice between Chengjiang (CV24)and Jiachengjiang (an extra point near Chengjiang). Different practitioners choose various acupoints based on their own theoretical understandings and clinical experiences, resulting in a lack of a unified standard for treatment protocols and making it difficult to ensure optimal therapeutic effects. The selection and combination of acupoints are the core of acupuncture treatment. A rational combination of acupoints can enhance the synergistic effect and improve the therapeutic efficacy of acupuncture. Therefore, in-depth analysis of the rules of acupoint selection and combination in the acupuncture treatment of trigeminal neuralgia is of great significance for optimizing treatment plans and improving clinical outcomes.
