## Question

Tb treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tuberculosis treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and classification of TB disease. Then, I should verify the standard-of-care regimen for drug-susceptible pulmonary TB and its evidence base. Next, I will examine validated shorter regimens and their comparative efficacy and safety. After that, I need to consider special populations and risk stratification. Finally, I should review drug-resistant TB management, implementation considerations, and synthesize practical recommendations with appropriate caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and classification, because treatment hinges on disease site, severity, and drug susceptibility. Pulmonary TB is the most common form, but extrapulmonary disease and drug resistance patterns alter regimen choice and duration, and I need to ensure I anchor recommendations to rifampin-susceptible versus rifampin-resistant disease and to special groups such as children, people with HIV, and those with severe disease or pregnancy, since these factors change the balance of benefits and harms for shorter regimens [^e3e55e75] [^d42bfcda].

> I will now examine the standard regimen for drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. The backbone is 2 months of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, with daily dosing preferred in the intensive phase and either daily or thrice-weekly dosing acceptable in the continuation phase, and I should confirm that this remains first-line in guidelines and that completion is defined by doses rather than calendar time, which impacts how we operationalize interruptions [^d301c30b] [^0c2cf1c4] [^d42bfcda].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for the 6-month standard. Historical and contemporary data show high cure rates exceeding 95% in trials, but real-world performance is lower due to adherence and programmatic constraints, and recurrence after successful treatment varies across settings, reinforcing the need for robust case management and adherence support to preserve efficacy in practice [^fb4795f0] [^68fdb566].

> Next, I should review validated shorter regimens for drug-susceptible disease. The 4-month rifapentine–moxifloxacin regimen (2 months of isoniazid, rifapentine, pyrazinamide, and moxifloxacin followed by 2 months of isoniazid, rifapentine, and moxifloxacin) demonstrated noninferiority to the 6-month standard in a large phase 3 trial and is now conditionally recommended for adolescents and adults aged 12 years and older, with the caveat that it should not be used for severe extrapulmonary disease or in pregnancy, and I need to ensure I note the requirement for DOT and the lack of routine ECG monitoring unless clinically indicated [^bb91c34c] [^9ef3ca1a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all 4-month regimens. Earlier fluoroquinolone-substitution strategies that replaced ethambutol or isoniazid with moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin increased relapse and are not recommended, so I should distinguish the rifapentine–moxifloxacin regimen, which adds rifapentine and moxifloxacin to maintain potency, from those earlier substitution approaches that undermined efficacy [^d7fef662] [^85c6b645].

> I need to check pediatric and adolescent guidance. For children and adolescents with nonsevere, drug-susceptible pulmonary TB, a 4-month regimen using standard first-line drugs (2 months of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol followed by 2 months of isoniazid and rifampin) is strongly recommended based on the SHINE trial showing equivalent treatment success and similar adverse events, which meaningfully reduces treatment burden in this population [^cefa5536].

> Let me consider risk stratification, because not all patients have the same relapse risk. Patient-level pooled analyses show that 4-month regimens can be noninferior in minimal disease (low smear grade, noncavitary) but underperform in hard-to-treat phenotypes with high smear grade and cavitation, and models incorporating baseline smear, cavitation, HIV status, BMI, and month-2 culture can identify groups benefiting from 4, 6, or more than 6 months of therapy, suggesting a precision-medicine approach to duration could optimize outcomes [^d86f88cd] [^eb76b125].

> I should double-check HIV-specific recommendations. For people with HIV who are receiving ART, the standard 6-month daily regimen remains appropriate, and while the rifapentine–moxifloxacin regimen included people with HIV, the proportion was modest and guidelines still advise caution pending broader validation; in the uncommon scenario where ART is not given during TB treatment, extending the continuation phase to 7 months for a total of 9 months is suggested, albeit with very low certainty evidence [^a6c74d53] [^116cdd75] [^bb91c34c].

> Now, I will examine drug-resistant TB, because this is a different paradigm. For rifampin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-susceptible disease, the 6-month all-oral bedaquiline–pretomanid–linezolid–moxifloxacin regimen demonstrated substantially higher treatment success and lower toxicity than longer injectable-containing regimens in TB-PRACTECAL, leading to strong recommendations in some guidelines, though certainty remains low due to the observational nature of much of the evidence base [^b7312219] [^f2ddb5fe].

> But wait, what about even shorter initial phases with extension only for those who need it. The TRUNCATE-TB strategy tested 8-week initial regimens with post-treatment monitoring and retreatment for relapse; the bedaquiline–linezolid arm met noninferiority for the composite outcome, though relapse was more frequent and the approach should be framed as a managed strategy rather than a blanket 8-week cure for all, which I need to emphasize to avoid overgeneralization [^93cdddaf] [^a64693ba].

> Next, I should review implementation considerations that influence real-world success. Daily dosing is preferred in the intensive phase, DOT improves adherence and is standard in many programs, and fixed-dose combinations can simplify regimens, though evidence suggests similar efficacy between FDCs and single-drug formulations with a small signal for more relapse with FDCs that warrants cautious interpretation and attention to quality and bioavailability [^d301c30b] [^8feac3ee] [^81fd40bc].

> I need to ensure I address special forms of disease and populations. Severe extrapulmonary TB, miliary disease, TB meningitis, and pericardial disease generally require longer, individualized regimens and were not included in shorter-regimen trials, pregnancy warrants avoidance of fluoroquinolones and careful regimen selection, and diabetes, silicosis, or transplant recipients may merit extended therapy in select cases, so I should avoid applying 4-month regimens to these scenarios [^bb91c34c] [^c653152f].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations. For adolescents and adults with drug-susceptible pulmonary TB, either use the standard 6-month regimen or the 4-month rifapentine–moxifloxacin regimen with DOT and appropriate exclusions, tailoring to patient preference, comorbidity, and access. For children and adolescents with nonsevere disease, use the 4-month standard-drug regimen. For patients with high smear grade, cavitation, or other high-risk features, consider extending therapy beyond 6 months or using a risk-stratified approach. And for rifampin-resistant disease, prioritize all-oral shorter regimens such as BPaLM when fluoroquinolone susceptibility is confirmed, integrating DST and close monitoring [^bb91c34c] [^cefa5536] [^d86f88cd] [^b7312219].

> Finally, I should confirm monitoring and follow-up elements. Baseline and periodic clinical assessments, adherence support, and evaluation for adverse effects are essential, with heightened vigilance for hepatotoxicity, neuropathy, and QT effects when fluoroquinolones are used, and programs should plan for post-treatment follow-up to detect relapse early, especially when shorter regimens are used, to close the loop on safety and effectiveness in routine care [^bb91c34c] [^d42bfcda].

Tuberculosis treatment is tailored to drug susceptibility, disease severity, and patient factors, with **standard 6-month therapy** for drug-susceptible TB (2 months of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, then 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin) [^d42bfcda] and **shorter 4-month regimens** (e.g. rifapentine, moxifloxacin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide) now recommended for select adults and adolescents [^bb91c34c] [^9ef3ca1a]. For drug-resistant TB, **longer, individualized regimens** are used, including all-oral options such as bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and moxifloxacin [^b7312219] [^79c6a433]. Directly observed therapy improves adherence and outcomes, and monitoring for adverse effects — especially hepatotoxicity — is essential [^8feac3ee] [^96c5ee17].

## Standard treatment regimens

### Drug-susceptible tuberculosis

- **Standard regimen**: 2 months of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin (2HRZE/4HR) [^d42bfcda].

- **Shorter regimen**: 4 months of rifapentine, moxifloxacin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide (2HPZM/2HPM) is noninferior in adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years [^bb91c34c] [^9ef3ca1a].

- **Pediatric nonsevere TB**: 4 months (2HRZE/2HR) is noninferior to 6 months in children and adolescents [^cefa5536].

---

### Drug-resistant tuberculosis

- **MDR/RR-TB**: Longer regimens (18–20 months) with at least 5 effective drugs in the intensive phase and 4 in the continuation phase [^8d20122c] [^4078e812].

- **Shorter MDR regimen**: 9–12 months if fluoroquinolone resistance is excluded [^79c6a433].

- **All-oral regimens**: Bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and moxifloxacin (BPaLM) show high efficacy and safety in rifampin-resistant TB [^b7312219].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **HIV coinfection**: Standard 6-month regimen with ART; extend to 9 months if ART is not started during TB treatment [^a6c74d53] [^116cdd75].

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid pyrazinamide; use isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol for 9 months.

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dosing for renally cleared drugs (e.g. ethambutol, pyrazinamide).

---

## Monitoring and adherence

- **Directly observed therapy (DOT)**: Improves adherence and outcomes; recommended for all patients [^8feac3ee].

- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for hepatotoxicity, neuropathy, and hypersensitivity; manage promptly [^96c5ee17].

- **Response monitoring**: Clinical assessment, sputum smear/culture, and chest imaging as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

- **Pan-TB regimens**: Shorter, universal regimens are under development to simplify care and reduce resistance [^5db68a5e].

- **Host-directed therapies**: Adjuncts to enhance treatment response and reduce duration are being studied [^4fab62f3].

- **Personalized medicine**: Biomarkers and risk stratification may enable tailored durations and regimens [^eb76b125].

---

Tuberculosis treatment is **evolving toward shorter, safer, and more effective regimens**, with the 4-month rifapentine–moxifloxacin regimen now an option for select patients and all-oral therapy transforming MDR-TB care.

### Shortened treatment regimens versus the standard regimen for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis [^d7fef662]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis causes more deaths than any other infectious disease worldwide, with pulmonary tuberculosis being the most common form. Standard first-line treatment for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis for six months comprises isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (HRZE) for two months, followed by HRE (in areas of high TB drug resistance) or HR, given over a four-month continuation phase. Many people do not complete this full course. Shortened treatment regimens that are equally effective and safe could improve treatment success.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of shortened treatment regimens versus the standard six-month treatment regimen for individuals with drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 10 July 2019: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase; the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS); Science Citation Index-Expanded; Indian Medlars Center; and the South Asian Database of Controlled Clinical Trials. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Clinical Trials Unit of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, the UK Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, and the Clinical Trials Registry India for ongoing trials. We checked the reference lists of identified articles to find additional relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared shorter-duration regimens (less than six months) versus the standard six-month regimen for people of all ages, irrespective of HIV status, who were newly diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis by positive sputum culture or GeneXpert, and with presumed or proven drug-sensitive tuberculosis. The primary outcome of interest was relapse within two years of completion of anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias for the included trials. For dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When appropriate, we pooled data from the included trials in meta-analyses. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included five randomized trials that compared fluoroquinolone-containing four-month ATT regimens versus standard six-month ATT regimens and recruited 5825 adults with newly diagnosed drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis from 14 countries with high tuberculosis transmission in Asia, Africa, and Latin Ameria. Three were multi-country trials that included a total of 572 HIV-positive people. These trials excluded children, pregnant or lactating women, people with serious comorbid conditions, and those with diabetes mellitus. Four trials had multiple treatment arms. Moxifloxacin replaced ethambutol in standard four-month, daily or thrice-weekly ATT regimens in two trials; moxifloxacin replaced isoniazid in four-month ATT regimens in two trials, was given daily in one trial, and was given with rifapentine instead of rifampicin daily for two months and twice weekly for two months in one trial. Moxifloxacin was added to standard ATT drugs for three to four months in one ongoing trial that reported interim results. Gatifloxacin replaced ethambutol in standard ATT regimens given daily or thrice weekly for four months in two trials. Follow-up ranged from 12 months to 24 months after treatment completion for the majority of participants. Moxifloxacin-containing four-month ATT regimens Moxifloxacin-containing four-month ATT regimens that replaced ethambutol or isoniazid probably increased the proportions who experienced relapse after successful treatment compared to standard ATT regimens (RR 3.56, 95% CI 2.37 to 5.37; 2265 participants, 3 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). For death from any cause, there was probably little or no difference between the two regimens (2760 participants, 3 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Treatment failure was rare, and there was probably little or no difference in proportions with treatment failure between ATT regimens (2282 participants, 3 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). None of the participants given moxifloxacin-containing regimens developed resistance to rifampicin, and these regimens may not increase the risk of acquired resistance (2282 participants, 3 trials; low-certainty evidence). Severe adverse events were probably little or no different with moxifloxacin-containing four-month regimens that replaced ethambutol or isoniazid, and with three- to four-month regimens that augmented standard ATT with moxifloxacin, when compared to standard six-month ATT regimens (3548 participants, 4 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Gatifloxacin-containing four-month ATT regimens Gatifloxacin-containing four-month ATT regimens that replaced ethambutol probably increased relapse compared to standard six-month ATT regimens in adults with drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.84; 1633 participants, 2 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). The four-month regimen probably made little or no difference in death compared to the six-month regimen (1886 participants, 2 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Treatment failure was uncommon and was probably little or no different between the four-month and six-month regimens (1657 participants, 2 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Acquired resistance to isoniazid or rifampicin was not detected in those given the gatifloxacin-containing shortened ATT regimen, but we are uncertain whether acquired drug resistance is any different in the four- and six-month regimens (429 participants, 1 trial; very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events were probably no different with either regimen (1993 participants, 2 trials; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence to date does not support the use of shortened ATT regimens in adults with newly diagnosed drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis. Four-month ATT regimens that replace ethambutol with moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin, or isoniazid with moxifloxacin, increase relapse substantially compared to standard six-month ATT regimens, although treatment success and serious adverse events are little or no different. The results of six large ongoing trials will help inform decisions on whether shortened ATT regimens can replace standard six-month ATT regimens. 9 December 2019 Up to date All studies incorporated from most recent search All eligible published studies found in the last search (10 Jul, 2019) were included.

### Precision medicine for drug-resistant tuberculosis in high-burden countries: is individualised treatment desirable and feasible? [^86513e63]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis is largely delivered through standardised, empirical combination regimens in low-resource, high-burden settings. However, individualised treatment, guided by detailed drug susceptibility testing, probably results in improved individual outcomes and is the standard of care in well-resourced settings. Driven by the urgent need to scale up treatment provision, new tuberculosis drugs, incorporated into standardised regimens, are being tested. Although standardised regimens are expected to improve access to treatment in high-burden settings, they are also likely to contribute to the emergence of resistance, even with good clinical management. We argue that a balance is required between the need to improve treatment access and the imperative to minimise resistance amplification and provide the highest standard of care, through a precision medicine approach. In tuberculosis, as in other diseases, we should aim to reduce the entrenched inequalities that manifest as different standards of care in different settings.

### Tuberculosis treatment and management – an update on treatment regimens, trials, new drugs, and adjunct therapies [^f6a6fe9a]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

WHO estimates that 9 million people developed active tuberculosis in 2013 and 1.5 million people died from it. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis continue to spread worldwide with an estimated 480,000 new cases in 2013. Treatment success rates of MDR and XDR tuberculosis are still low and development of new, more effective tuberculosis drugs and adjunct therapies to improve treatment outcomes are urgently needed. Although standard therapy for drug-sensitive tuberculosis is highly effective, shorter, more effective treatment regimens are needed to reduce the burden of infectious cases. We review the latest WHO guidelines and global recommendations for treatment and management of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis, and provide an update on new drug development, results of several phase 2 and phase 3 tuberculosis treatment trials, and other emerging adjunct therapeutic options for MDR and XDR tuberculosis. The use of fluoroquinolone-containing (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) regimens have failed to shorten duration of therapy, and the new tuberculosis drug pipeline is sparse. Scale-up of existing interventions with increased investments into tuberculosis health services, development of new antituberculosis drugs, adjunct therapies and vaccines, coupled with visionary political leadership, are still our best chance to change the unacceptable status quo of the tuberculosis situation worldwide and the growing problem of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

### Tuberculosis (TB)-treatment for TB disease… [^9ef3ca1a]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Frequently Asked Questions The 4-month rifapentine-moxifloxacin tuberculosis treatment regimen consists of high-dose daily rifapentine with moxifloxacin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide. It has an intensive phase of 8 weeks, followed by a continuation phase of 9 weeks. New England Journal of Medicine, details findings from Study 31/A5349 – an international, randomized, controlled, open-label, phase 3 noninferiority clinical trial. It demonstrated that a shorter four-month daily treatment regimen with high-dose rifapentine and moxifloxacin is as effective as the standard daily six-month regimen in curing drug-susceptible TB disease. Participants were followed-up in the trial for 18 months after randomization. Recent analysis confirmed that a 4-month regimen had noninferior efficacy at 18 months compared to the standard 6-month control regimen. The substitution of these two drugs in the standard 6-month RIPE regimen made it possible to reduce the duration of treatment for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis to four months. Differences in baseline evaluations for patients treated with the 4-month rifapentine-moxifloxacin regimen as compared to the standard 6-month regimen are summarized in the Evaluation and Testing Considerations for Drug-susceptible Pulmonary TB Treatment Regimens table. In the clinical trial, there was no upper limit for weight for participants. Some experts recommend therapeutic drug monitoring in patients with obesity that are not responding to treatment. Healthcare providers should consider all aspects of the patient in initiating and monitoring the 4-month rifapentine-moxifloxacin regimen.

CDC recommends using directly observed therapy at least 5 days a week for the duration of the 4-month rifapentine-moxifloxacin regimen. CDC recommends video DOT as an equivalent alternative to in-person DOT for patients on treatment for TB. The State TB Control Offices and TB Centers of Excellence for Training, Education, and Medical Consultation can provide additional assistance and support in treating people with TB disease.

### Shortened treatment regimens versus the standard regimen for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis [^4ce4db31]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Novel drug regimens are needed to address the challenges associated with patient adherence to the current standard six‐month treatment regimen for tuberculosis (Ma 2010). Recent clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of newer regimens administered for less than six months for treatment of individuals with drug‐sensitive tuberculosis. A systematic review of these trials will help guide understanding of the efficacy and safety of these shorter regimens among individuals with drug‐sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis. A previous Cochrane Review ‐ Gelband 1999 ‐ concluded that longer periods of treatment (at least six months) resulted in higher success rates among individuals with active tuberculosis, but improvement was small when compared with regimens administered for less than six months. Another Cochrane Review on the use of fluoroquinolones for treatment of tuberculosis, published in 2013, concluded that evidence was insufficient to support conclusions, but noted that larger trials investigating short‐course fluoroquinolone‐based regimens were in progress (Ziganshina 2013). First‐line treatment with novel drug combinations administered for a shorter duration than the current standard six‐month treatment regimen could improve treatment outcomes, thereby reducing the chances of disease transmission and burden in this population.

### Treatment strategy for rifampin-susceptible tuberculosis [^fb4795f0]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

F global standard treatment for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis has been a 6-month rifampin-based regimen. This treatment has cured more than 95% of persons with tuberculosis in the context of clinical trials but has underperformed in national treatment programs, in which long-term adherence is difficult for some persons and resource constraints limit the provision of adherence support. – The unsatisfactory outcomes associated with standard treatment have contributed to the ongoing failure to meet global tuberculosis targets and to the generation of drug resistance. Exploration of new treatment approaches is essential.

A Quick Take is available at

In clinical trials, at least 85% of participants have been cured with 3-month and 4-month regimens, and the percentage is likely to be higher when these regimens contain fluoroquinolones or rifapentine. – A similar probability of cure has also been observed with 2-month regimens that are administered for the treatment of smear-negative tuberculosis. Thus, the current 6-month regimen may lead to overtreatment in the majority of persons in order to prevent relapse in a minority of persons. This approach may be misaligned with the desires of persons who have tuberculosis and with efficient functioning of programs, thereby impairing outcomes.

We hypothesized that a strategy involving initial treatment with an 8-week regimen, extended treatment for persistent clinical disease, follow-up after treatment, and prompt retreatment for the minority of persons who have a relapse might lead to long-term efficacy that would be noninferior to that of standard treatment, along with a reduced total duration of treatment and other secondary advantages for persons with tuberculosis and for treatment programs.

### Shortened treatment regimens versus the standard regimen for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis [^e83e4216]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

In May 2014, the World Health Assemby approved The 'End TB Strategy' of the World Health Organization (WHO), which aims to achieve a 95% reduction in mortality due to tuberculosis and a 90% reduction in the occurrence of new cases by the year 2035 compared with 2015 estimates (WHO 2015). This can result from a substantial decline in the numbers of tuberculosis cases and deaths in the years to come. However, the rate of decline in the incidence of tuberculosis was 1.9% from 2015 to 2016; to reach the 'End TB Strategy' targets, this rate of decline must increase to 4% to 5% yearly by 2020. Using the current standard WHO‐approved treatment regimen, the treatment success rate for individuals with new and relapsed cases of drug‐susceptible tuberculosis, as reported for the 2015 cohort, was 83% (WHO 2017 a). Although this success rate is high when compared with that of individuals with MDR‐TB (success rate of 54%), poor outcomes such as failure to respond, death, and losses to follow‐up are of great concern, given that one of the targets of WHO's sustainable development goals for 2030 is to end the global tuberculosis epidemic (WHO 2015; WHO 2018).

The current standard WHO‐approved regimen consists of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (HRZE) for two months (intensive phase), followed by isoniazid and rifampicin with ethambutol (HRE) in areas of high resistance, or without ethambutol (HR) for four months (continuation phase) (WHO 2010). This six‐month treatment duration can adversely impact patient adherence to therapy (Zumla 2014). Poor adherence leads to development of drug resistance and enhances the chance of relapse in such individuals (Ginsberg 2010; Ma 2010). Hence, new drug combinations are needed to shorten the course of treatment while maintaining high success rates and low relapse rates. Shortening the duration of treatment for individuals with drug‐sensitive or drug‐resistant tuberculosis is a global research priority and will certainly be highly beneficial for both patients and healthcare professionals. New tuberculosis drugs have begun to emerge from the clinical development pipeline, and shorter‐duration regimens containing new compounds could improve adherence to therapy while promoting infection control and leading to better disease management (Ma 2010).

### Long term efficacy of DOTS regimens for tuberculosis: systematic review [^68fdb566]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To identify published studies assessing tuberculosis recurrence after successful treatment with standard short course regimens for six months to determine the strength and sufficiency of evidence to support current guidelines.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Cochrane clinical trials register, specialist tuberculosis journals, and reference lists. Only English language publications were eligible.

Review Methods

Studies were included irrespective of methodology or quality. Abstracted information included inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, duration of follow-up, and definitions of treatment success and disease recurrence. The primary outcome was the proportion of successfully treated patients recorded with recurrent tuberculosis during the follow-up period.

Results

17 study arms from 16 studies met the inclusion criteria; 10 were controlled clinical trials and six were either studies done under programmatic conditions or observational studies from functioning tuberculosis programmes. Although several clinical trials supported the use of daily treatment regimens, studies reporting tuberculosis recurrence after intermittent regimens were limited. Few studies carried out under routine programmatic conditions reported disease recurrence. Overall there was wide variation in recurrence after successful treatment, ranging from 0% to 14%. Considerable heterogeneity across studies precluded the systematic assessment of factors contributing to tuberculosis recurrence.

Conclusions

Despite DOTS (directly observed treatment, short course) being implemented for more than 10 years and millions of patients treated for tuberculosis, few studies have assessed the ability of standard DOTS regimens to result in lasting cure for patients treated under routine programmatic conditions.

### Strategies for shortening tuberculosis therapy [^1a943de6]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the absence of effective patient-stratification approaches, tuberculosis (TB) treatment relies on overtreating most patients to ensure high cure rates. Shortening treatment duration without compromising efficacy is therefore high on the agenda of the global TB community. While new and better drugs are certainly needed, we argue that innovative but rational treatment strategies, using both new and existing therapies, will help achieve this goal. There is growing recognition that patient stratification, based on host and pathogen factors, is key to delivering the right drug regimen for the right duration. In this Perspective, we review the current knowledge on the heterogeneity of TB disease and propose approaches to optimize treatment duration in distinct patient groups, taking into consideration the realities of TB control globally. We emphasize key insights that improve the understanding of bacterial vulnerabilities in patients with easy-to-treat and hard-to-treat TB, helping to reduce diagnostic uncertainties. We explore how the TB research community can integrate disease biology, pathology and symptoms, to rethink therapeutic strategies and reduce TB treatment duration.

### New drugs for the management of tuberculosis [^08eb80b5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Tuberculosis (TB) has reclaimed its position as the leading infectious cause of death, with an estimated 10.8 million new cases and 1.3 million deaths in 2023. Despite the availability of effective treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis for several decades, long treatment durations, drug toxicity, and the emergence of drug-resistant strains continue to undermine global TB control efforts. Recent years has seen significant progress in TB drug development, particularly for drug-resistant tuberculosis. Landmark studies evaluating new drugs, repurposed agents, and optimized combinations have demonstrated the feasibility of shorter, safer, and all-oral treatment regimens. This review summarizes recent pivotal trials and emerging evidence that are redefining the tuberculosis treatment landscape and discusses their implications for clinical practice and future research priorities. Abbreviations and trial acronyms are defined in Table 1.

### Shortened treatment regimens versus the standard regimen for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis [^0e5f3f16]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs.

Types of participants

Newly diagnosed individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis, as defined by positive sputum culture or a positive GeneXpert MTB/RIF, with presumed or proven drug‐sensitive tuberculosis, of all ages, irrespective of HIV status. Trials including people with extrapulmonary tuberculosis were eligible if such participants constituted less than 10% of participants, or if disaggregated data were available.

Types of interventions

Intervention

Treatment regimens of less than six months' duration including any anti‐tuberculosis drug(s) or combinations thereof (new drugs or standard anti‐tuberculosis drugs at higher than recommended doses).

Control

Standard first‐line therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis, defined as a regimen comprising two months of HRZE and four months of HR or HRE.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Relapse of tuberculosis, defined as clinical or bacteriologic recurrence within two years of completion of anti‐tuberculosis therapy

Secondary outcomes

Death from any cause during anti‐tuberculosis therapy or within two years of end of treatment
Treatment discontinuation: rates of discontinuation of therapy at any time point during treatment
Positive sputum culture/smear at eight weeks: proportion of participants who remain smear or culture positive at the end of eight weeks of therapy
Treatment failure: persistent or recurrent positive sputum cultures at the time of treatment completion
Acquired drug resistance: development of secondary drug resistance to anti‐tuberculosis drugs, identified by drug susceptibility testing

Adverse events

Serious adverse events: adverse events that were fatal or life‐threatening, or that resulted in a change in treatment regimen
Other adverse events: other adverse events reported by trial authors, such as hepatitis, prolongation of the QT interval, hypersensitivity reactions, thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathy, ocular toxicity, and arthralgia

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

When we considered heterogeneity to be moderate or substantial, we explored potential causes in subgroup analyses based on categories of shortened treatment regimens. We subgrouped four‐month regimens according to whether they replaced components of standard ATT drugs or augmented them in comparison with standard six‐month ATT regimens.

Sensitivity analysis

We re‐analysed data using a random‐effects model in sensitivity analysis if fixed‐effect meta‐analysis revealed moderate heterogeneity but inconsistency in results of the trials was due to differences in the magnitude of effect favouring an intervention, rather than to differences in the direction of effects. Moderate inconsistency need not necessarily reduce our confidence in the pooled estimate if inconsistency is largely due to differences between large and small effects favouring an intervention (Guyatt 2011c). Thus, when we judged heterogeneity to be moderate but inconsistency in results was due to large and small effects favouring an intervention, we assessed the robustness of the results by changing from a fixed‐effect to a random‐effects meta‐analysis. If pooled effect estimates in random‐effects meta‐analysis continued to favour the intervention, and if both limits of the 95% CI continued to indicate appreciable benefit, we used the fixed‐effect model in the analysis but reported both fixed‐effect and random‐effects meta‐analysis in the results. We retained the fixed‐effect model in meta‐analysis in such instances to avoid compromising grading of imprecision in evaluating certainty of the evidence while summarizing the findings. Random‐effects meta‐analyses provide pooled estimates of the range of possible effects, with point estimates representing the mean of their distribution; this inherently denotes imprecision. Using the random‐effects model under such circumstances would warrant rating down for imprecision while assessing the certainty of evidence when this is not warranted.

We also assessed the impact of risk of bias on effect estimates of the primary outcome in sensitivity analysis by excluding studies judged to be at high risk of bias. We explored the effects of missing outcome data for the primary outcome of relapse in sensitivity analysis comparing results of the main analysis with results of the per‐protocol analysis, and including all randomized participants (excluding late screening failures, treatment failures, and deaths), and we imputed missing data using relapse rates from available data.

### Fixed-dose combinations of drugs versus single-drug formulations for treating pulmonary tuberculosis [^81fd40bc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People who are newly diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) typically receive a standard first-line treatment regimen that consists of two months of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol followed by four months of isoniazid and rifampicin. Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of these drugs are widely recommended.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of anti-tuberculosis regimens given as fixed-dose combinations compared to single-drug formulations for treating people with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, published in the Cochrane Library, Issue 11 2015); MEDLINE (1966 to 20 November 2015); EMBASE (1980 to 20 November 2015); LILACS (1982 to 20 November 2015); the metaRegister of Controlled Trials; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), without language restrictions, up to 20 November 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials that compared the use of FDCs with single-drug formulations in adults (aged 15 years or more) newly diagnosed with pulmonary TB.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, and assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. We used risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We attempted to assess the effect of treatment for time-to-event measures with hazard ratios and their 95% CIs. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool to determine the risk of bias in included trials. We used the fixed-effect model when there was little heterogeneity and the random-effects model with moderate heterogeneity. We used an I² statistic value of 75% or greater to denote significant heterogeneity, in which case we did not perform a meta-analysis. We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

We included 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the review, which enrolled 5824 participants. Trials were published between 1987 and 2015 and included participants in treatment with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB in countries with high TB prevalence. Only two trials reported the HIV status of included participants. Overall there is little or no difference detected between FDCs and single-drug formulations for most outcomes reported. We did not detect a difference in treatment failure between FDCs compared with single-drug formulations (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.00; 3606 participants, seven trials, moderate quality evidence). Relapse may be more frequent in people treated with FDCs compared to single-drug formulations, although the confidence interval (CI) includes no difference (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.64; 3621 participants, 10 trials, low quality evidence). We did not detect any difference in death between fixed-dose and single-drug formulation groups (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.39; 4800 participants, 11 trials, moderate quality evidence). When we compared FDCs with single-drug formulations we found little or no difference for sputum smear or culture conversion at the end of treatment (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.02; 2319 participants, seven trials, high quality evidence), for serious adverse events (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.33; 3388 participants, six trials, moderate quality evidence), and for adverse events that led to discontinuation of therapy (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.66; 5530 participants, 13 trials, low quality evidence). We conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding studies at high risk of bias and this did not alter the review findings.

Authors' Conclusions

Fixed-dose combinations and single-drug formulations probably have similar effects for treating people with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB.

Unit of analysis issues

The included studies were parallel‐group RCTs. For trials with multiple intervention arms, we undertook pair‐wise comparisons of only relevant interventions and when possible combined the results of trial arms with similar ATT regimens. When adverse events were reported as the numbers of events (counts) as well as the numbers of participants experiencing adverse events (rates), we recorded both but used the latter for data synthesis.

### Drug regimens identified and optimized by output-driven platform markedly reduce tuberculosis treatment time [^6d1d46f1]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The current drug regimens for treating tuberculosis are lengthy and onerous, and hence complicated by poor adherence leading to drug resistance and disease relapse. Previously, using an output-driven optimization platform and an in vitro macrophage model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, we identified several experimental drug regimens among billions of possible drug-dose combinations that outperform the current standard regimen. Here we use this platform to optimize the in vivo drug doses of two of these regimens in a mouse model of pulmonary tuberculosis. The experimental regimens kill M. tuberculosis much more rapidly than the standard regimen and reduce treatment time to relapse-free cure by 75%. Thus, these regimens have the potential to provide a markedly shorter course of treatment for tuberculosis in humans. As these regimens omit isoniazid, rifampicin, fluoroquinolones and injectable aminoglycosides, they would be suitable for treating many cases of multidrug and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.

Study 31/A5349 Evidence: Drug Regimens and World Health Organization Critical Outcomes in Treatment of Isoniazid-Susceptible, Rifampin-Susceptible Tuberculosis in Adults *

PICO Question 2: In children and adolescents with nonsevere DS pulmonary TB, is a 4-month regimen composed of standard-dose 2 months of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol followed by 2 months of isoniazid and rifampin (2HRZE/2HR) as efficacious and safe as the standard 6-month DS-TB regimen of 2 months of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin (2HRZE/4HR) endorsed by the ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA guidelines?
1 Topic/overview/background Currently recommended treatment regimens are ⩾6 months in duration, regardless of disease severity. The SHINE (Shorter Treatment for Minimal TB in Children) trial was a multicenter, randomized, controlled, two-arm noninferiority trial comparing 4 months with 6 months of standard treatment for nonsevere TB. This was defined as intrathoracic lymph node TB without airway obstruction, uncomplicated TB pleural effusion, or paucibacillary and noncavitary disease confined to one lobe of the lungs, or without a miliary pattern. Data from this clinical trial informed these recommendations. As part of the ADOLOPMENT process, we adapted the WHO guideline question, evidence table, EtD framework, and recommendation to the scope and audience of this guideline. We performed a literature search to update the evidence base. The literature search revealed no other clinical trials to include in this question, and only the one study and corresponding analysis from the WHO guideline were used.
2 Summary of evidence, benefits, and harms SHINE enrolled 1,204 children and adolescents < 16 years old weighing ⩾3 kg with nonsevere TB disease (Table 5). Exclusion criteria included known drug resistance, contact to persons with DR-TB, pregnancy, and more severe TB disease (e.g. miliary TB, TB meningitis). The SHINE trial demonstrated a success rate of 97.1% for participants receiving the 4-month regimen (2 mo of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide, with or without ethambutol, followed by 2 mo of isoniazid and rifampin [2HRZ(E)/2HR]) compared with 96.9% among those receiving the 6-month regimen (2HRZ(E)/4HR; Table 5). Noninferiority of the 4-month regimen compared with the 6-month regimen was consistent across the intention-to-treat, per-protocol, and key secondary analyses, including the analyses restricted to patients independently adjudicated to have TB disease. Adverse event incidence was similar between the 4-month (7.8%) and 6-month regimens (8.0%) (Table 5). The SHINE trial documented similar treatment success rates and adverse events between the 4-month and 6-month regimens, supporting a recommendation for the 4-month regimen. The shortened treatment duration is a significant benefit and could reduce the use of healthcare services and potentially improve adherence. Relying on the noninferior outcome between the 4-month regimen and the current standard, the Panel judged both desirable and undesirable effects to be trivial in difference. The Joint Panel agreed that implementing the regimen would be cost saving for programs, although the size of this effect is uncertain.
3 Monitoring and additional considerations Although the SHINE trial enrolled children and adolescents with symptomatic TB disease, many children are diagnosed during contact investigations with TB disease while asymptomatic. The Joint Panel agreed that, provided patients meet the demographic, radiographic, epidemiologic, and clinical criteria for nonsevere TB, without suspicion of RR/MDR-TB, these patients should also be eligible for the 4-month regimen. Recommendations for other specific subgroups are provided in Table 6. Because there is an age overlap between the RPT/MOX regimen and this 4-month regimen, some children may be eligible for either regimen. Figure 1 provides information on how to identify children eligible for the 4-month regimens, based on the data on children in the SHINE trial and Study 31/A5349. Children and adolescents who do not meet the criteria for nonsevere TB should receive the standard 6-month treatment regimen (2HRZ(E)/4HR) or other recommended regimens for which they are eligible or for severe forms of EPTB. The clinical monitoring requirements for the shorter regimen remain the same as for the 6-month regimen. Monitoring for potential recurrence is a priority for shorter regimens, and programs should have plans to monitor children after treatment. TB programs should also assess for barriers to offering this regimen.
4 Certainty of evidence The Joint Panel concurred with the WHO GDG that certainty in the estimated effect was judged to be high for treatment success. Specifically, the Joint Panel judged the certainty of the evidence to be high for treatment success and moderate for both all-cause death and adverse events. This was due to imprecision for estimates of treatment failure, relapse, adherence, and loss to follow-up. The Joint Panel agreed with the WHO that overall certainty of the evidence is moderate. This was not downgraded for indirectness, because the trial population may be representative of patients with TB treated in the countries represented by the Joint Panel. The Joint Panel concurred with the WHO GDG that the certainty in the estimated effects was judged to be moderate for all-cause death and adverse events. The Joint Panel agreed with the WHO that the overall certainty of evidence is moderate.
5 Panel Recommendation In children and adolescents between 3 months and 16 years of age with nonsevere TB (without suspicion or evidence of MDR/RR-TB), we recommend the use of a 4-month treatment regimen of 2HRZ(E)/2HR rather than the 6-month DS-TB regimen of 2HRZ(E)/4HR (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence; Table E2). See Table 1 for dosing details.

Drug-susceptible TB

PICO Question 1: In adolescents and adults with DS pulmonary TB, is a 4-month regimen composed of 2 months of isoniazid, rifapentine, pyrazinamide, and moxifloxacin followed by 2 months of isoniazid, rifapentine, and moxifloxacin (2HPZM/2HPM) as efficacious and safe as the standard 6-month DS-TB regimen of 2 months of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (2HRZE) followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin (4HR) endorsed by the ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA guidelines?
1 Topic/overview/background Standard treatment for culture-positive DS-TB has required ⩾6 months of antibiotics. Shorter, effective regimens enable patients to be cured faster and can potentially reduce treatment costs, improve patient quality of life, and increase completion of therapy. The Joint Panel reviewed evidence from Study 31/A5349, a randomized, open-label, phase III trial comparing two 4-month rifapentine-containing regimens with the standard 6-month control regimen. Participants aged 12 years and older with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB were enrolled at 34 trial sites worldwide (Table 4).
2 Summary of evidence for benefits and harms For the 4-month rifapentine and moxifloxacin (RPT-MOX)-based regimen compared with the standard 6-month regimen (consisting of 2 mo of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol followed by 4 mo of isoniazid and rifampin [2HRZE/4HR]), the Joint Panel assessed equivalent outcomes of TB disease-free survival at 12 months postrandomization (cure/favorable outcome), treatment retention, acquired drug resistance, adverse events (grade 3 or higher), and all-cause mortality within 14 days after the last dose of study medication (Tables 4 and E1). The microbiologically eligible population for analysis had 791 participants in the 4-month RPT-MOX arm and 768 participants in the 6-month control arm, all with culture-confirmed susceptibility to isoniazid, rifampin, and fluoroquinolones. RPT-MOX was noninferior to control (84.6% vs. 85.4% cure, respectively). No significant differences in outcomes were identified for RPT-MOX and 6-month standard regimens on the basis of smear grade, cavitation, radiologic extent, age, diabetes, body weight, or HIV status. However, the number of participants living with HIV infection, diabetes, or extreme weight or age was small (e.g. ∼9% of trial participants were people living with HIV infection with CD4 count ⩾100 cells/μl, and most participants were aged under 35 years) (Table E1). As part of the ADOLOPMENT process, we adapted the WHO guideline question, evidence table, EtD framework, and recommendation to the scope and audience of this guideline. We performed a literature search to update the evidence base. The literature search revealed no other clinical trials to include in this question, and only one study and corresponding analysis from the WHO guideline was used. Although other clinical trials included shorter regimens for the treatment of DS-TB, they did not address the specific PICO question regarding a rifapentine-moxifloxacin regimen.
3 Monitoring and additional considerations Individuals with TB affecting the central nervous system, bones, or joints, miliary TB, and/or pericardial TB were not included in the above study and would not usually be treated with a 6- or 4-month regimen. In low-incidence settings, more people with TB may be older than in the clinical trial and may receive concurrent medications or have underlying comorbidities with a higher risk for adverse events. Specifically, this may include fluoroquinolone-related adverse events, including neuropathology, tendinitis, QT prolongation, and dysglycemia. There was no evidence in the trial to suggest that routine baseline or subsequent electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is required. The panel did not recommend baseline ECG monitoring for those receiving the shorter regimen (unless clinically indicated, such as by older age, presence of cardiac conditions, history of prolonged QT interval, or use of additional QT prolonging medication). The Joint Panel noted that the RPT-MOX regimen avoids the potential ocular toxicity of ethambutol and decreases the time to culture conversion. Implementation of the RPT-MOX regimen may face challenges related to feasibility and cost. Although the shorter treatment duration may benefit patients and healthcare systems, the RPT-MOX regimen increases daily pill burden, especially compared with fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) that might be used in some European locations for the 6-month regimen. The trial used directly observed therapy (DOT) for at least 5 of 7 treatment days per week as recommended, which may have improved adherence. DOT may not be feasible in settings that rely on unsupervised self-administered therapy. Although the likelihood of fluoroquinolone resistance was considered small (< 5%) in otherwise DS-TB, there is widespread community use of fluoroquinolones. Therefore, obtaining samples to send for molecular and possibly phenotypic fluoroquinolone DST is advisable before starting the RPT-MOX regimen. The availability and affordability of rifapentine and other medications pose significant challenges in some settings. Nitrosamine impurities in rifampin and rifapentine may also impact availability, although joint panel opinion agreed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assessment that the benefit of treating TB with rifamycins likely exceeds the risk. ECG monitoring might be used in some patients at risk for cardiac events and could increase costs. In terms of health equity, no information was available regarding the use of RPT-MOX for extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) or during pregnancy or in young children. Rifapentine with isoniazid was not associated with unfavorable pregnancy outcomes in trials including weekly therapy for latent TB infection treatment. Pediatric studies are enrolling for pharmacokinetics underlying the 4-month RPT-MOX regimen (identifier NCT03730181), and weekly rifapentine with isoniazid is recommended therapy for latent TB infection for persons aged 2 years and older.
4 Certainty of evidence The Joint Panel concurred with the WHO GDG that the overall certainty of evidence for benefits of cure and retention in treatment is high, moderate for adverse events, and low for acquisition of drug resistance and for all-cause mortality, based on the low frequency of harmful events. Although typically overall certainty is based on the lowest certainty for the agreed critical outcomes, the panel agreed with WHO in using GRADE guidance that drug resistance and all-cause mortality would no longer rate as critical outcomes, because the range of effect would not impact the strength or direction of recommendations. Thus, the panel concurred with WHO that the overall certainty of evidence is moderate.
5 Panel recommendation In people aged 12 years or older with DS pulmonary tuberculosis, we conditionally recommend the use of a 4-month regimen of isoniazid, rifapentine, moxifloxacin, and pyrazinamide (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence; Table E1). See Table 1 for dosing details.

HIV infection — treatment regimen duration with or without antiretroviral therapy (ART) is specified as follows: For HIV-infected patients receiving ART, we suggest using the standard 6-month daily regimen consisting of an intensive phase of 2 months of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (EMB) followed by a continuation phase of 4 months of INH and RIF for the treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). In uncommon situations in which HIV-infected patients do NOT receive ART during tuberculosis treatment, we suggest extending the continuation phase with INH and RIF for an additional 3 months (ie, a continuation phase of 7 months in duration, corresponding to a total of 9 months of therapy) for treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis (conditional recommendation; very low certainty in the evidence).

### Executive summary: official American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines: treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis [^66e6763d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The American Thoracic Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Infectious Diseases Society of America jointly sponsored the development of this guideline for the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis, which is also endorsed by the European Respiratory Society and the US National Tuberculosis Controllers Association. Representatives from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Canadian Thoracic Society, the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, and the World Health Organization also participated in the development of the guideline. This guideline provides recommendations on the clinical and public health management of tuberculosis in children and adults in settings in which mycobacterial cultures, molecular and phenotypic drug susceptibility tests, and radiographic studies, among other diagnostic tools, are available on a routine basis. For all recommendations, literature reviews were performed, followed by discussion by an expert committee according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. Given the public health implications of prompt diagnosis and effective management of tuberculosis, empiric multidrug treatment is initiated in almost all situations in which active tuberculosis is suspected. Additional characteristics such as presence of comorbidities, severity of disease, and response to treatment influence management decisions. Specific recommendations on the use of case management strategies (including directly observed therapy), regimen and dosing selection in adults and children (daily vs intermittent), treatment of tuberculosis in the presence of HIV infection (duration of tuberculosis treatment and timing of initiation of antiretroviral therapy), as well as treatment of extrapulmonary disease (central nervous system, pericardial among other sites) are provided. The development of more potent and better-tolerated drug regimens, optimization of drug exposure for the component drugs, optimal management of tuberculosis in special populations, identification of accurate biomarkers of treatment effect, and the assessment of new strategies for implementing regimens in the field remain key priority areas for research. See the full-text online version of the document for detailed discussion of the management of tuberculosis and recommendations for practice.

### Current and future treatments for tuberculosis [^4fab62f3]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Guidelines on the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) have essentially remained the same for the past 35 years, but are now starting to change. Ongoing clinical trials will hopefully transform the landscape for treatment of drug sensitive TB, drug resistant TB, and latent TB infection. Multiple trials are evaluating novel agents, repurposed agents, adjunctive host directed therapies, and novel treatment strategies that will increase the probability of success of future clinical trials. Guidelines for HIV-TB co-infection treatment continue to be updated and drug resistance testing has been revolutionized in recent years with the shift from phenotypic to genotypic testing and the concomitant increased speed of results. These coming changes are long overdue and are sorely needed to address the vast disparities in global TB incidence rates. TB is currently the leading cause of death globally from a single infectious agent, but the work of many researchers and the contributions of many patients in clinical trials will reduce the substantial global morbidity and mortality of the disease.

### The role of novel approaches and new findings in the pharmacology of tuberculosis medicines in improving treatment outcomes [^fd02dcc9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

In its 2017 report on the status of tuberculosis in the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that tuberculosis causes about 1.7 million deaths each year, making it the single leading infectious cause of death. Standardized regimens with multiple antimicrobials have been the cornerstone of tuberculosis treatment for several decades, and most of the 10 million new tuberculosis cases emerging globally each year can be cured with an affordable 6-month treatment course. A massive roll-out of rifampicin-based first-line tuberculosis regimens has helped save more than 50 million lives since 2000. Nonetheless, the prospects of ending the global tuberculosis epidemic in the coming years are threatened by the spread of drug-resistant strains that complicate treatment. About 600 000 new cases of rifampicin-resistant (RR-TB) or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB; combined resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin) emerge each year, requiring treatment with multiple medicines and for much longer than with first-line regimens: often 2 years or more. Globally, only about one-half of the MDR/RR-TB cases starting treatment complete it successfully.

A core mandate of WHO is the development of evidence-based policy for public health interventions. The latest WHO treatment guidelines for tuberculosis and MDR/RR-TB were released in 2016 and 2017, using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess evidence from the most recently available data on patient outcomes. Important uncertainties critical to the safe and effective implementation of drug-resistant tuberculosis care persist, given the limitations of available evidence and the paucity of trials. These pertain to the optimization of dosages and combination of medicines to maximize benefits and limit drug-drug interactions and other harms; adapting treatment for key subpopulations, like children and patients with comorbidities such as human immunodeficiency virus, diabetes, depression, and hepatitis; and interpreting in vitro results from drug susceptibility testing and mycobacterial genome sequencing for clinical decision-making.

### Additional drug resistance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in patients in 9 countries [^7f6c4039]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Current standards for treating patients with MDR TB pose at least 2 major problems that reduce the effectiveness of treatment and treatment success rates. First, the long duration of treatment — a total of at least 20 months — places a major burden on patients and health care systems. Second, common serious adverse drug reactions contribute to reduced adherence or suspension of treatment. Given the global prevalence of MDR TB and low treatment success rates, better TB drugs and shorter regimens are urgently needed to enable more effective, less toxic, and less expensive treatment for persons with MDR TB.

### Shortened treatment regimens versus the standard regimen for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis [^0769bc43]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Potential biases in the review process

We used standard methods as provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). The literature search covered multiple databases; in addition, we evaluated reference lists of included studies and of relevant systematic reviews for potentially eligible trials. We were unable to formally assess publication bias by using funnel plots because we identified only five relevant trials with outcomes pertinent to this review. We are aware of six ongoing studies that will inform updates of this review. At least two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, and this was independently verified by a senior review author. Data extraction was done independently by two review authors and was verified independently by two other review authors.

We attempted to account for loss to follow‐up for the primary outcome of relapse by using in our main analysis data provided in each trial report's modified intent‐to‐treat (m‐ITT) analysis, because trials included more randomized participants than were included in their per‐protocol analyses. The three multi‐country trials had shown that the results of sensitivity analyses comparing per‐protocol and m‐ITT analyses were consistent. However, when data from trials are included in a meta‐analysis, pooled estimates can vary depending on how much information is missing for trial outcomes, as well as the magnitude and direction of effect estimates in individual trials. The series of sensitivity analyses that we carried out did not indicate that missing data for relapse influenced the overall results.

### Projected health and economic effects of a pan-tuberculosis treatment regimen: a modelling study [^5db68a5e]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

A pan-tuberculosis regimen that could be initiated without knowledge of drug susceptibility has been proposed as an objective of tuberculosis regimen development. We modelled the health and economic benefits of such a regimen and analysed which of its features contribute most to impact and savings.

Methods

We constructed a mathematical model of tuberculosis treatment parameterised with data from the published literature specific to three countries with a high tuberculosis burden (India, the Philippines, and South Africa). Our model simulated cohorts of newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients, including drug susceptibility testing if performed, regimen assignment, discontinuation, adherence, costs, and resulting outcomes of durable cure (microbiological cure without relapse), need for retreatment, or death. We compared a pan-tuberculosis regimen meeting the WHO 2023 target regimen profile against the standard of care of separate rifampicin-susceptible and rifampicin-resistant regimens. We estimated incremental cures; averted deaths, secondary cases, and costs; and prices below which a pan-tuberculosis regimen would be cost saving. We also assessed scenarios intended to describe which mechanisms of benefit from a pan-tuberculosis regimen (including improved characteristics compared with the current rifampicin-susceptible and rifampicin-resistant regimens and improved regimen assignment and retention in care for patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis) would be most impactful. Results are presented as a range of means across countries with the most extreme 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) from the three UI ranges.

Findings

Compared with the standard of care, a pan-tuberculosis regimen could increase the proportion of patients durably cured after an initial treatment attempt from 69–71% (95% UI 57–80) to 75–76% (68–83), preventing 30–32% of the deaths (20–43) and 17–20% of the transmission (9–29) that occur after initial tuberculosis diagnosis. Considering savings to the health system and patients during and after the initial treatment attempt, the regimen could reduce non-drug costs by 32–42% (22–49) and would be cost saving at prices below US$170–340 (130–510). A rifamycin-containing regimen that otherwise met pan-tuberculosis targets yielded only slightly less impact, indicating that most of the benefits from a pan-tuberculosis regimen resulted from its improvements upon the rifampicin-susceptible standard of care. Eliminating non-adherence and treatment discontinuation, for example via a long-acting injectable regimen, increased health impact and savings.

Interpretation

In countries with a high tuberculosis burden, a shorter, highly efficacious, safe, and tolerable regimen to treat all tuberculosis could yield substantial health improvements and savings.

### Official American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines: treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis [^7e74ed62]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis — initial regimen and culture-negative pathway: A 4-drug regimen of INH, RIF, PZA, and EMB remains the preferred initial treatment for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis, and treatment is initiated promptly even before AFB smear microscopy, molecular tests, and mycobacterial culture results are known in patients with high likelihood of having tuberculosis; initiation of treatment should not be delayed because of negative AFB smears for patients in whom tuberculosis is suspected and who have a life-threatening condition. For HIV-uninfected adult patients with AFB smear- and culture-negative pulmonary tuberculosis, we suggest that a 4-month treatment regimen is adequate (conditional recommendation; very low certainty in the evidence). Operationally, treatment is initiated with an intensive phase of INH, RIF, PZA, and EMB daily and continued even when the initial bacteriologic studies are negative; if all cultures on adequate samples are negative and there is clinical or radiographic response after 2 months of intensive phase therapy, the continuation phase with INH and RIF can be shortened to 2 months; alternatively, if there is concern about the adequacy of workup or the accuracy of the microbiologic evaluations, a standard 6-month regimen remains preferred.

### A patient-level pooled analysis of treatment-shortening regimens for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis [^d86f88cd]. Nature Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Tuberculosis kills more people than any other infectious disease. Three pivotal trials testing 4-month regimens failed to meet non-inferiority margins; however, approximately four-fifths of participants were cured. Through a pooled analysis of patient-level data with external validation, we identify populations eligible for 4-month treatment, define phenotypes that are hard to treat and evaluate the impact of adherence and dosing strategy on outcomes. In 3,405 participants included in analyses, baseline smear grade of 3+ relative to < 2+, HIV seropositivity and adherence of ≤ 90% were significant risk factors for unfavorable outcome. Four-month regimens were non-inferior in participants with minimal disease defined by < 2+ sputum smear grade or non-cavitary disease. A hard-to-treat phenotype, defined by high smear grades and cavitation, may require durations > 6months to cure all. Regimen duration can be selected in order to improve outcomes, providing a stratified medicine approach as an alternative to the 'one-size-fits-all' treatment currently used worldwide.

### Precision-enhancing risk stratification tools for selecting optimal treatment durations in tuberculosis clinical trials [^eb76b125]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale: No evidence-based tools exist to enhance precision in the selection of patient-specific optimal treatment durations to study in tuberculosis clinical trials. Objectives: To develop risk stratification tools that assign patients with tuberculosis into risk groups of unfavorable outcome and inform selection of optimal treatment duration for each patient strata to study in clinical trials. Methods: Publicly available data from four phase 3 trials, each evaluating treatment duration shortening from 6 to 4 months, were used to develop parametric time-to-event models that describe unfavorable outcomes. Regimen, baseline, and on-treatment characteristics were evaluated as predictors of outcomes. Exact regression coefficients of predictors were used to assign risk groups and predict optimal treatment durations. Measurements and Main Results: The parametric model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72. A six-item risk score (HIV status, smear grade, sex, cavitary disease status, body mass index, and Month 2 culture status) successfully grouped participants into low (1,060/3,791; 28%), moderate (1,740/3,791; 46%), and high (991/3,791; 26%) risk, requiring treatment durations of 4, 6, and greater than 6 months, respectively, to reach a target cure rate of 93% when receiving standard-dose rifamycin-containing regimens. With current one-duration-fits-all approaches, high-risk groups have a 3.7-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.7–5.1) and 2.4-fold (1.9–2.9) higher hazard risk of unfavorable outcomes compared with low- and moderate-risk groups, respectively. Four-month regimens were noninferior to the standard 6-month regimen in the low-risk group. Conclusions: Our model discrimination was modest but consistent with current models of unfavorable outcomes. Our results showed that stratified medicine approaches are feasible and may achieve high cure rates in all patients with tuberculosis. An interactive risk stratification tool is provided to facilitate decision-making in the regimen development pathway.

### Perspectives for personalized therapy for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^b26b9f83]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tuberculosis is the leading cause of death attributed to a single microbial pathogen worldwide. In addition to the large number of patients affected by tuberculosis, the emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug-resistance is complicating tuberculosis control in many high-burden countries. During the past 5 years, the global number of patients identified with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as bacillary resistance at least against rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most active drugs in a treatment regimen, has increased by more than 20% annually. Today we experience a historical peak in the number of patients affected by MDR-TB. The management of MDR-TB is characterized by delayed diagnosis, uncertainty of the extent of bacillary drug-resistance, imprecise standardized drug regimens and dosages, very long duration of therapy and high frequency of adverse events which all translate into a poor prognosis for many of the affected patients. Major scientific and technological advances in recent years provide new perspectives through treatment regimens tailor-made to individual needs. Where available, such personalized treatment has major implications on the treatment outcomes of patients with MDR-TB. The challenge now is to bring these adances to those patients that need them most.

### Shortened treatment regimens versus the standard regimen for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis [^10c667f8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Tuberculosis (TB), a chronic infectious disease caused by air‐borne transmission of aerosolized droplets of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a major global public health problem (WHO 2018). An estimated 10 million new cases of tuberculosis and 1.6 million tuberculosis‐related deaths occurred in 2017, making tuberculosis one of the top 10 leading causes of death worldwide (WHO 2018). Among the new cases identified, 90% were adults, 58% were men, 10% were children, and 9% had HIV coinfection (WHO 2018). Among communicable diseases, tuberculosis is a major cause of mortality in the economically productive age group (15 to 49 years) (WHO 2017). The top eight countries in the world identified as having a high tuberculosis burden are India, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and South Africa (WHO 2018), and 87% of tuberculosis occurs in 30 high‐burden countries (WHO 2018). To add to the existing burden, 558,000 new cases of rifampicin‐resistant tuberculosis were diagnosed in 2017, and of these patients, 82% had multi‐drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR‐TB) (WHO 2018). Although tuberculosis‐related mortality fell by 23% between 2000 and 2017 worldwide, gaps in diagnosis and treatment persist (WHO 2018).

### Treatment for latent tuberculosis infection… [^49d2d4a2]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points People with latent tuberculosis infection can be treated to prevent TB disease. CDC and the National Tuberculosis Coalition of America preferentially recommend short-course, rifamycin-based, 3- or 4-month latent TB infection treatment regimens. Overview Finding and treating people with latent TB infection is essential for controlling and eliminating TB disease. Treatment for latent TB infection prevents TB disease. For Everyone: Treating Inactive Tuberculosis. Treatment Considerations for Latent TB infection People with latent TB infection should be treated to prevent the development of TB disease. Progression from untreated latent TB infection to TB disease accounts for approximately 80% of U. S. TB cases. Do not start latent TB infection treatment until TB disease is excluded.

People with known risk factors for developing TB disease and have a positive TB blood test result, or a tuberculin skin test result should be given high priority for latent TB infection treatment. Treatment Recommendations Health care providers may consider several recommended regimens for the treatment of latent TB infection. Treatment can take three, four, six, or nine months, depending on the regimen. Regimens use one or more of the following drugs:

- Isoniazid
- Rifapentine
- Rifampin. CDC and the National Tuberculosis Coalition of America preferentially recommend short-course, rifamycin-based, 3- or 4-month latent TB infection treatment regimens over 6- or 9-month isoniazid monotherapy. Short-course regimens are effective, safe, and have higher completion rates than longer regimens.

Treatment for latent TB infection can be administered by directly observed therapy or by self-administered therapy. Isoniazid monotherapy regimens Regimens of six to nine months of isoniazid monotherapy are alternative, effective latent TB infection treatment regimens if a short-course treatment regimen is not an option. Although effective, 6H and 9H have higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates than most short-course treatment regimens. People can be treated daily or twice weekly with isonaizid. Patients being treated twice weekly should receive directly observed therapy.

### Of testing and treatment: implications of implementing new regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^d2922a5f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

A novel, shorter-course regimen for treating multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis was recently recommended by the World Health Organization. However, the most appropriate use of drug susceptibility testing (DST) to support this regimen is less clear. Implementing countries must therefore often choose between using a standardized regimen despite high levels of underlying drug resistance or require more stringent DST prior to treatment initiation. The former carries a high likelihood of exposing patients to de facto monotherapy with a critical drug class (fluoroquinolones), whereas the latter could exclude large groups of patients from their most effective treatment option. We discuss the implications of this dilemma and argue for an approach that will integrate DST into the delivery of any novel antimicrobial regimen, without excessively stringent requirements. Such guidance could make the novel MDR tuberculosis regimen available to most patients while reducing the risk of generating additional drug resistance.

### Potential of pan-tuberculosis treatment to drive emergence of novel resistance [^c1c5ddd4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

New tuberculosis (TB) drugs with little existing antimicrobial resistance enable a pan-TB treatment regimen, intended for universal use without prior drug-susceptibility testing. However, widespread use of such a regimen could contribute to an increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, potentially rendering the pan-TB regimen ineffective or driving clinically problematic patterns of resistance. We developed a model of multiple sequential TB patient cohorts to compare treatment outcomes between continued use of current standards of care (guided by rifampin-susceptibility testing) and a hypothetical pan-TB approach. A pan-TB regimen that met current target profiles was likely to initially outperform the standard of care; however, a rising prevalence of transmitted resistance to component drugs could make underperformance likely among subsequent cohorts. Although the pan-TB approach led to an increased prevalence of resistance to novel drugs, it was unlikely to cause accumulation of concurrent resistance to novel drugs and current first-line drugs.

### Treatment of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis with first-line drugs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f290f4b7]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

The results of some reports have suggested that treatment of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis with the recommended regimens of first-line drugs might be suboptimal. We updated a previous systematic review of treatment outcomes associated with use of first-line drugs in patients with tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid but not rifampicin.

Methods

In this systematic review, we updated the results of a previous review to include randomised trials and cohort studies published in English, French, or Spanish to March 31, 2015, containing results of standardised treatment of patients with bacteriologically confirmed isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis (but not multidrug-resistant tuberculosis-ie, not resistant to rifampicin) in whom failure and relapse were bacteriologically confirmed. Results in patients with drug-sensitive tuberculosis included in the same studies were also analysed. We pooled treatment outcomes with random-effects meta-analysis.

Findings

We identified 19 cohort studies and 33 trials with 3744 patients with isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis and 19012 patients with drug-sensitive disease. The pooled rates of failure or relapse, or both, and acquired drug resistance with all drug regimens were 15% (95% CI 12–18) and 3.6% (2–5), respectively, in patients with isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis and 4% (3–5) and 0.6% (0.3–0.9) in those with drug-sensitive tuberculosis. Of patients with initial isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis with acquired drug resistance, 96% (93–99) had acquired multidrug-resistant disease. Treatment of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis with the WHO standard regimen for new patients resulted in treatment failure, relapse, and acquired multidrug resistance in 11% (6–17), 10% (5–15) and 8% (3–13), respectively; treatment with the standard WHO regimen for previously treated patients resulted in treatment failure in 6% (2–10), relapse in 5% (2–8), and acquisition of multidrug resistance in 3% (0–6). For patients with drug-sensitive disease treated with the standard retreatment regimen the rates were 1% (0–2), 5% (4–7), and 0.3% (0–0.6).

Interpretation

Treatment of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis with first-line drugs resulted in suboptimal outcomes, supporting the need for better regimens. Standardised empirical treatment of new cases could be contributing substantially to the multidrug-resistant epidemic, particularly in settings where the prevalence of isoniazid resistance is high.

### Shortened treatment regimens versus the standard regimen for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis [^7e814a83]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

The need for combination therapy for tuberculosis is a result of the distinctive cellular structure of M tuberculosis (a complex array of lipids, proteins, and glycolipids) and the tendency of the bacilli to develop resistance to monotherapy (Kerantzas 2017). Combinations of drugs are required to treat M tuberculosis: combining drugs with both bactericidal activity and sterilizing activity can help target the various bacterial subpopulations (actively dividing, slow growing, and dormant bacilli) present (Mitchison 1985). The bactericidal activity of a drug refers to its ability to kill metabolically active bacilli. An effective bactericidal drug prevents transmission of the bacilli and development of resistance to other drugs given as part of the regimen. The sterilizing activity of a drug refers to its ability to kill all viable bacilli, including the micro‐organisms tolerant to treatment with drugs. Drugs with good sterilizing capacity have the potential to shorten the duration of tuberculosis treatment (Ma 2010). In recent years, various drugs have been tried in differing combinations to shorten the standard six‐month treatment regimen, and these have shown promising preliminary results (Conde 2011).

Some of the desired characteristics of new anti‐tuberculosis drug compounds include the following (Ma 2010).

Effectiveness against both replicating and dormant tuberculosis bacilli.
Novel mechanism of action.
Improved safety profile (versus the standard treatment regimen).
Good oral bioavailability.
Low resistance development barrier.
Minimal interaction with cytochrome p450 enzymes.
Low cost.

Currently 10 compounds are in clinical development for the treatment of tuberculosis, six have been specifically developed, and four existing drugs have been re‐purposed. Drugs at the forefront of this quest include the fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and gatifloxacin), rifamycins (rifabutin and rifapentine), nitroimidazoles, diarylquinolines, oxazolidinediones, and ethylenediamines. These drugs have been investigated in clinical trials in combination with, or as substitutes for, one of the standard first‐line anti‐tuberculosis drugs, with the aim of shortening treatment duration (Lienhardt 2010). Second‐line anti‐tuberculosis drugs, including amoxicillin clavulanate, linezolid, carbapenems, and clofazimine, are also potential candidates for shorter‐duration anti‐tuberculosis regimens (D'Ambrosio 2015).

### Official American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines: treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis [^a6c74d53]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis with HIV infection — antiretroviral therapy (ART) and treatment duration: patients with HIV infection and tuberculosis should receive ART in conjunction with daily antituberculosis medications. For HIV-infected patients receiving ART, we suggest using the standard 6-month daily regimen consisting of an intensive phase of 2 months of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (EMB) followed by a continuation phase of 4 months of INH and RIF (Recommendation 5a: conditional recommendation; very low certainty in the evidence). If an HIV-infected patient does NOT receive ART during tuberculosis treatment, we suggest extending the continuation phase with INH and RIF for an additional 3 months — ie, a continuation phase of 7 months in duration, corresponding to a total of 9 months of therapy — for treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis (Recommendation 5b: conditional recommendation; very low certainty in the evidence).

### Shortened treatment regimens versus the standard regimen for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis [^aab02bf4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Certainty of the evidence

We assessed the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach for the primary outcome of relapse and for the secondary outcomes important for clinical decision‐making, that is, death due to any cause, treatment failure, development of drug resistance, and serious adverse events (Guyatt 2011a). For each of these outcomes, we assessed how certain we were that pooled effect estimates were true (Balshem 2011), and that their 95% CIs represented the range of effects that were plausible and likely to be useful (Hultcrantz 2017). Certainty of evidence for each outcome is influenced by risk of bias in the studies contributing to pooled effect estimates for each outcome, as well as other factors such as unexplained inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias (Balshem 2011). Pooled effect estimates from RCTs are generally considered to provide high‐certainty evidence, but if there were serious or very serious concerns that any of the above‐mentioned factors may have compromised the certainty of effect estimates, we rated down the certainty for that outcome by one or two levels. In making these assessments, we used the overall guidance provided in Schünemann 2011 and Schünemann 2013. We also used guidance provided in Guyatt 2011b to assess the impact of imprecision on the certainty of evidence for each outcome. According to this guidance, precision is considered adequate if the 95% CI excludes an RR of 1.0, and the total number of events or patients in the total sample size is large enough to satisfy or exceed that required for an adequately powered individual trial (optimal information size, or OIS). However, when event rates are very low, as is likely with trials comparing shortened versus standard ATT regimens that were designed to assess equivalence or non‐inferiority within prespecified non‐inferiority margins, CIs around relative effects may be wide but CIs around absolute effects will be narrow. In such instances, rating down for imprecision may be inappropriate (Guyatt 2011b). For rating inconsistency, we used guidance provided in Guyatt 2011c, particularly when heterogeneity was moderate in fixed‐effect meta‐analysis but inconsistency in results was due to trials with large and small effects favouring an intervention. In such instances, if using a random‐effects model did not result in 95% CIs that now included non‐appreciable effects or no benefit associated with the intervention, we did not rate down for imprecision.

### Getting personal perspectives on individualized treatment duration in multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis [^741f6e1e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) differs from most other bacterial infectious diseases by a very long duration of combination antibiotic therapy required to achieve relapse-free cure. Although the standard recommended "short-course" treatment length for TB is 6 months, the World Health Organization recommends a duration of 20 months for the treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB (M/XDR-TB). Apart from the long duration of anti-TB therapy, treatment of M/XDR-TB is very expensive and often associated with adverse drug events. The optimal duration for treatment of TB likely differs between individuals and depends on a variety of variables, such as the extent of the disease, the immune status of the host, and the virulence and the drug resistance of the causative strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Some patients with M/XDR-TB may have to be treated with currently available antituberculosis drug regimens for more than 20 months, whereas much shorter treatment durations may be possible to achieve cure for the majority of patients with M/XDR-TB. Personalization of the duration of treatment for TB, especially for patients with M/XDR-TB, would be highly desired. Until recently there has been little interest in the identification of biosignatures that could eventually lead to individual recommendations for the duration of anti-TB therapy. This pulmonary perspective reviews the knowledge on clinical and radiological scores, host- and pathogen disease-related profiles, molecules, and signatures that are currently explored as biomarkers to personalize the duration of therapy in TB.

### Efficacy and safety of 8-week regimens for the treatment of rifampicin-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis (TRUNCATE-TB): a prespecified exploratory analysis of a multi-arm, multi-stage, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^a64693ba]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

WHO recommends a 2-month optimal duration for new drug regimens for rifampicin-susceptible tuberculosis. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of the 8-week regimens that were assessed as part of the TRUNCATE management strategy of the TRUNCATE-TB trial.

Methods

TRUNCATE-TB was a multi-arm, multi-stage, open-label, randomised controlled trial in which participants aged 18–65 years with rifampicin-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis were randomly assigned via a web-based system, using permuted blocks, to 24-week standard treatment (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) or the TRUNCATE management strategy comprising initial 8-week treatment, then post-treatment monitoring and re-treatment where needed. The four 8-week regimens comprised five drugs, modified from standard treatment: high-dose rifampicin and linezolid, or high-dose rifampicin and clofazimine, or bedaquiline and linezolid, all given with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol; and rifapentine, linezolid, and levofloxacin, given with isoniazid and pyrazinamide. Here, we report the efficacy (proportion with unfavourable outcome; and difference from standard treatment, assessed via Bayesian methods) and safety of the 8-week regimens, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This prespecified exploratory analysis is distinct from the previously reported 96-week outcome of the strategy in which the regimens were deployed. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03474198).

Findings

Between March 21, 2018, and March 26, 2020, 675 participants (674 in the intention-to-treat population) were enrolled and randomly assigned to the standard treatment group or one of the four 8-week regimen groups. Two 8-week regimens progressed to full enrolment. An unfavourable outcome (mainly relapse) occurred in seven (4%) of 181 participants on standard treatment; 46 (25%) of 184 on the high-dose rifampicin and linezolid-containing regimen (adjusted difference 21.0%, 95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 14.3–28.1); and 26 (14%) of 189 on the bedaquiline and linezolid-containing regimen (adjusted difference 9.3% [4.3–14.9]). Grade 3–4 adverse events occurred in 24 (14%) of 181 participants on standard treatment, 20 (11%) of 184 on the rifampicin-linezolid regimen, and 22 (12%) of 189 on the bedaquiline-linezolid regimen.

Interpretation

Efficacy was worse with 8-week regimens, although the difference from standard treatment varied between regimens. Even the best 8-week regimen (bedaquiline-linezolid) should only be used as part of a management strategy involving post-treatment monitoring and re-treatment if necessary.

### Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^e765866f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review describes the major developments in the rationale for treating latent tuberculosis infection; new approaches to identifying persons with latent infection who are most likely to progress to active disease; and the development of novel short-course regimens for treatment of latent tuberculosis.

Recent Findings

As many as one-third of the world's population has latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Models demonstrate that tuberculosis will not be eliminated without large-scale treatment of persons with latent TB. Current tools for identifying persons at risk for active tuberculosis disease include TST and IGRA, which have poor positive predictive values. Newer approaches using gene expression profiling show promise and are being studied in the ongoing trials. Development of short-course regimens are a major advance in treatment of latent TB. Three months of rifapentine with isoniazid, 4 months of rifampin, and 1 month of rifapentine with isoniazid have been found to be noninferior to the standard 9 months of isoniazid.

Summary

Progress towards TB elimination can be accelerated by instituting public health measures that take into account new developments in identifying and treating persons with latent tuberculosis infection who are most likely to progress to active disease.

### New drugs for the management of tuberculosis [^35fa3b38]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes recent and emerging advances in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, focusing on new therapeutics, repurposed agents, and shortened treatment regimens. It aims to contextualize key developments within the evolving TB treatment landscape and assess their potential to transform clinical management of both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant disease.

Recent Findings

Evidence from landmark trials, including Nix-TB, ZeNix, TB-PRACTECAL, STREAM, Study 31/A5349, SHINE, TRUNCATE-TB, endTB and BEAT-TB has supported the use of licensed, repurposed, and novel agents as new treatment strategies. These studies have demonstrated the feasibility of treatment-shortening regimens for drug-susceptible TB and improved outcomes for multidrug-resistant TB. Progress has expanded the therapeutic armamentarium, with promising regimens incorporating new agents, higher-dose rifamycins, and safer, all-oral combinations.

Summary

These advances have direct implications for clinical practice, offering shorter, safer, and more effective treatment options. Adoption of these new regimens into treatment guidelines will allow us to reduce treatment burden, improve adherence, and lower the risk of adverse effects. Continued optimization of drug combinations, dosing strategies, and safety profiles will be essential to achieving durable, scalable treatment options. Future research should prioritize regimen simplification, host-directed therapies, and tools for predicting and monitoring treatment response to support personalized, globally accessible TB care.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Medical Management Plan

Although the majority of medical treatment plans for TB disease begin with the standard four-drug regimen (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol [RIPE]), patient-specific drug regimens should be considered on the basis of the patient's history. For example, a history of exposure to persons with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) might change the initial medication recommendations. A history of bladder cancer treatment in a patient with disseminated disease might lead the clinician to consider that the cause of the TB disease is Mycobacterium bovis BCG rather than M. tuberculosis.

Clinicians should take a thorough medical history, conduct a complete physical examination to detect TB disease outside the lungs, and assess the patient's history of exposure to TB disease and other factors in the patient's history to select the best initial drug regimen. Subsequent decisions about the patient's regimen depend on the results of drug susceptibilities, side effects experienced by the patient, disease progression, and any new information about the patient's history and exposures that are discovered after the initial evaluation.

Initiation of the Treatment and Case Management Plans

As soon as patient specimens and bacteriology are obtained and TB disease is diagnosed or suspected, a clinician should start treatment and ensure the TB case is reported to the health department. TB programs should send smear-positive respiratory specimens for TB identification and molecular diagnostic testing to test for genetic mutations that are surrogates for drug-resistant TB. TB programs should start TB treatment either empirically or on the basis of laboratory findings such as molecular analysis or DST results. Because the majority of TB disease in the United States is pansusceptible, patients usually can be started empirically on the standard four-drug treatment regimen noted previously in the most recent version of the ATS/CDC/IDSA TB treatment guidelines.

### Economic implications of novel regimens for tuberculosis treatment in three high-burden countries: a modelling analysis [^ef79bacf]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Previous modelling analysis projected the health effects of novel tuberculosis treatment regimens meeting target profiles but did not incorporate costs. Studies have also evaluated the cost-effectiveness of specific regimens that are now in widespread use. To identify relevant cost-related studies of future novel regimens, we searched PubMed using the following search terms for the titles and abstracts: (tuberculosis OR tuberculosis) AND (cost OR economic) AND (novel OR improved) AND (model OR analysis OR estimate) AND (treatment OR therapeutic OR regimen). We did the search with no language restrictions on Jan 3, 2024 and restricted our search to human studies published between Jan 1, 2010 and Dec 31, 2023. This search yielded 156 published studies. Several studies analysed the cost or cost-effectiveness of existing regimens and programmes to treat tuberculosis disease, or interventions to improve treatment programmes that did not consist of improved regimens. We identified three studies that assessed the costs or cost-effectiveness of novel treatment regimens; all these studies focused on shorter-duration regimens to treat rifampin-susceptible tuberculosis. Two studies found that shorter regimens with otherwise similar characteristics to the standard of care would yield substantial savings, whereas one study found that a less efficacious, higher-cost, shorter-duration regimen would not be cost-effective in South Africa but could improve treatment outcomes.

Added value of this study

This study adds to the existing literature by comparing updated Target Regimen Profiles against improved standards of care (namely the bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and moxifloxacin regimen for treating rifampin-resistant tuberculosis). Reflecting these improvements, updated targets are increasingly forward-looking and include characteristics not previously analysed, such as regimen forgiveness. Importantly, this study quantifies the cost implications of improving upon individual regimen characteristics beyond duration, helping drug and regimen developers prioritise several potential advances which might present trade-offs.

Implications of all the available evidence

Improved regimens to treat tuberculosis could yield substantial cost savings, achieving net cost-neutrality even with higher drug costs. Our results suggest that reductions in regimen duration remain an important contributor to tuberculosis treatment savings, even against improved standards of care and when considering further advances in other regimen characteristics. As characteristics such as regimen efficacy continue to improve, the importance of adherence to treatment and its relationship to the probability of cure increases.

### Treatment strategy for rifampin-susceptible tuberculosis [^93cdddaf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis is usually treated with a 6-month rifampin-based regimen. Whether a strategy involving shorter initial treatment may lead to similar outcomes is unclear.

Methods

In this adaptive, open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned participants with rifampin-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis to undergo either standard treatment (rifampin and isoniazid for 24 weeks with pyrazinamide and ethambutol for the first 8 weeks) or a strategy involving initial treatment with an 8-week regimen, extended treatment for persistent clinical disease, monitoring after treatment, and retreatment for relapse. There were four strategy groups with different initial regimens; noninferiority was assessed in the two strategy groups with complete enrollment, which had initial regimens of high-dose rifampin–linezolid and bedaquiline–linezolid (each with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). The primary outcome was a composite of death, ongoing treatment, or active disease at week 96. The noninferiority margin was 12 percentage points.

Results

Of the 674 participants in the intention-to-treat population, 4 (0.6%) withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up. A primary-outcome event occurred in 7 of the 181 participants (3.9%) in the standard-treatment group, as compared with 21 of the 184 participants (11.4%) in the strategy group with an initial rifampin–linezolid regimen (adjusted difference, 7.4 percentage points; 97.5% confidence interval [CI] 1.7 to 13.2; noninferiority not met) and 11 of the 189 participants (5.8%) in the strategy group with an initial bedaquiline–linezolid regimen (adjusted difference, 0.8 percentage points; 97.5% CI, −3.4 to 5.1; noninferiority met). The mean total duration of treatment was 180 days in the standard-treatment group, 106 days in the rifampin–linezolid strategy group, and 85 days in the bedaquiline–linezolid strategy group. The incidences of grade 3 or 4 adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the three groups.

Conclusions

A strategy involving initial treatment with an 8-week bedaquiline–linezolid regimen was noninferior to standard treatment for tuberculosis with respect to clinical outcomes. The strategy was associated with a shorter total duration of treatment and with no evident safety concerns.

### Efficacy and safety of 8-week regimens for the treatment of rifampicin-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis (TRUNCATE-TB): a prespecified exploratory analysis of a multi-arm, multi-stage, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^fcedc7ee]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Background

WHO recommends a 2-month optimal duration for new drug regimens for rifampicin-susceptible tuberculosis. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of the 8-week regimens that were assessed as part of the TRUNCATE management strategy of the TRUNCATE-TB trial.

Methods

TRUNCATE-TB was a multi-arm, multi-stage, open-label, randomised controlled trial in which participants aged 18–65 years with rifampicin-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis were randomly assigned via a web-based system, using permuted blocks, to 24-week standard treatment (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) or the TRUNCATE management strategy comprising initial 8-week treatment, then post-treatment monitoring and re-treatment where needed. The four 8-week regimens comprised five drugs, modified from standard treatment: high-dose rifampicin and linezolid, or high-dose rifampicin and clofazimine, or bedaquiline and linezolid, all given with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol; and rifapentine, linezolid, and levofloxacin, given with isoniazid and pyrazinamide. Here, we report the efficacy (proportion with unfavourable outcome; and difference from standard treatment, assessed via Bayesian methods) and safety of the 8-week regimens, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This prespecified exploratory analysis is distinct from the previously reported 96-week outcome of the strategy in which the regimens were deployed. This trial is registered with.

Findings

Between March 21, 2018, and March 26, 2020, 675 participants (674 in the intention-to-treat population) were enrolled and randomly assigned to the standard treatment group or one of the four 8-week regimen groups. Two 8-week regimens progressed to full enrolment. An unfavourable outcome (mainly relapse) occurred in seven (4%) of 181 participants on standard treatment; 46 (25%) of 184 on the high-dose rifampicin and linezolid-containing regimen (adjusted difference 21.0%, 95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 14.3–28.1); and 26 (14%) of 189 on the bedaquiline and linezolid-containing regimen (adjusted difference 9.3% [4.3–14.9]). Grade 3–4 adverse events occurred in 24 (14%) of 181 participants on standard treatment, 20 (11%) of 184 on the rifampicin-linezolid regimen, and 22 (12%) of 189 on the bedaquiline-linezolid regimen.

Interpretation

Efficacy was worse with 8-week regimens, although the difference from standard treatment varied between regimens. Even the best 8-week regimen (bedaquiline-linezolid) should only be used as part of a management strategy involving post-treatment monitoring and re-treatment if necessary.

Drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis, intensive phase dosing frequency — We recommend the use of daily rather than intermittent dosing in the intensive phase of therapy (strong recommendation; moderate certainty in the evidence). Use of three-times-weekly therapy in the intensive phase may be considered in patients who are not HIV infected and are also at low risk of relapse, with disease that at the start of treatment is noncavitary and/or smear negative (conditional recommendation; low certainty in the evidence). In situations where daily or thrice-weekly DOT therapy is difficult to achieve, use of twice-weekly therapy after initial 2 weeks of daily therapy may be considered for patients who are not HIV-infected and are also at low risk of relapse (conditional recommendation; very low certainty in the evidence). Note: If doses are missed in a regimen using twice-weekly dosing, then therapy is equivalent to once weekly, which is inferior.

### Shortened treatment regimens versus the standard regimen for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis [^65f2e0da]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We included five trials that compared fluoroquinolone‐containing four‐month anti‐tuberculosis treatment (ATT) regimens versus standard six‐month ATT regimens, recruiting 5825 adults with drug‐sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis from 14 countries with high tuberculosis transmission in Asia, Africa, and Latin Ameria. Three were multi‐country trials that included a total of 572 HIV‐positive people who were not receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART).

Summary of main results

Moxifloxacin‐containing four‐month ATT regimens that substitute for ethambutol or isoniazid probably increase relapse following treatment in adults with drug‐sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis compared to standard six‐month ATT regimens (moderate‐certainty evidence; Table 1). Compared to standard six‐month ATT, four‐month ATT regimens that substitute gatifloxacin for ethambutol probably increase relapse following treatment in adults with drug‐sensitive tuberculosis (moderate‐certainty evidence; Table 2).

Compared to six‐month ATT, four‐month ATT regimens containing either moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin probably make little or no difference in treatment failure, death, or serious adverse events (moderate‐certainty evidence). Four‐month moxifloxacin‐containing regimens may not increase the incidence of acquired drug resistance (low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether gatifloxacin‐containing four‐month ATT regimens increase the incidence of acquired drug resistance (very low‐certainty evidence). See Table 1 for moxifloxacin‐containing four‐month regimens, and Table 2 for gatifloxacin‐containing four‐month regimens.

In general, treatment for patients with conditions that alter immune responsiveness is based on the standard, daily 6-month regimen, but some experts suggest extending the total duration of tuberculosis treatment to 9 months in poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, data demonstrate that cure rate is improved if the continuation phase is extended by at least 2 months for patients with silicotuberculosis, and some experts also suggest extending the total duration of tuberculosis treatment to at least 9 months for all solid organ transplant recipients.

Selecting a treatment regimen There are several treatment regimens for TB disease recommended for use in the United States. Treatment for drug-susceptible TB disease typically takes 4, 6, or 9 months depending on the regimen. Directly observed therapy is the standard of care. The goal of treatment for TB disease should be to provide the safest, most tolerable and most effective therapy for the shortest period of time. Health care providers should choose the appropriate TB treatment regimen based on:

- Drug-susceptibility results,
- Coexisting medical conditions, and
- Potential for drug-drug interactions. Guidelines For Everyone: Treating Active Tuberculosis Disease Phases of treatment Treatment regimens for drug-susceptible TB disease consist of an intensive treatment phase followed by a continuation phase. If treatment is not continued for a long enough time, the surviving bacilli may cause TB disease in the patient later.

The possibility of drug resistance increases if too many doses are missed during the period of treatment, especially if the patient is taking only some of the prescribed medicines instead of all of them.
- During the intensive phase, the TB drugs kill actively growing TB bacilli. This phase of treatment is crucial for determining the ultimate clinical outcome and preventing emergence of drug resistance. For most patients, it brings relief from the disabling symptoms of TB disease.
- During the continuation phase, the TB drugs eliminate any remaining TB bacilli. This helps to reduce treatment failure and relapse. 6- to 9-month treatment regimens The 6- to 9-month 2HRZE/4HR or 2HRZE/7HR TB treatment regimens consist of:

- Isoniazid,
- Rifampin
- Pyrazinamide, and
- Ethambutol.

These regimens for treating TB disease have an intensive phase of 2 months of isonaizid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by a continuation phase of either 4 or 7 months of isonaizid and rifampin for total of 6 to 9 months for treatment. Summary table This table describes 6-month treatment regimens for drug-susceptible TB disease.

Pulmonary tuberculosis dosing schedule — preferred daily dosing and DOT frequency: The preferred frequency is once daily for both the intensive and continuation phases, and we recommend the use of daily rather than intermittent dosing in the intensive phase of therapy for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis (Recommendation 3a: strong recommendation; moderate certainty in the evidence). For the continuation phase, we recommend use of daily or thrice-weekly dosing for the continuation phase of therapy (Recommendation 3a: strong recommendation; moderate certainty in the evidence). An administration frequency of less than daily in the intensive phase of treatment is generally not preferred, and for directly observed therapy (DOT) 5-days-a-week drug administration by DOT is an acceptable alternative to 7-days-a-week administration, and either approach may be considered as meeting the definition of "daily" dosing.

Isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis — epidemiology, historical regimen, and outcomes: Monoresistance to isoniazid is frequent worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 8% (range, 5–11%) of TB cases, and treatment with first-line drugs has been associated with higher treatment failure (11% vs. 1%) and relapse (10% vs. 5%); standardized empirical treatment may contribute to higher rates of acquired drug resistance (8% vs. 0.3%). Prior ATS, CDC, and IDSA guidelines recommended treatment with a standard four-drug regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for 6 months, with discontinuation of isoniazid after drug susceptibility testing (DST) confirmed isoniazid resistance.

Despite the introduction 40 years ago of the inexpensive and effective four-drug (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) treatment regimen, tuberculosis (TB) continues to cause considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. For the first time since the 1960s, new and novel drugs and regimens for all forms of TB are emerging. Such regimens are likely to utilize both repurposed drugs and new chemical entities, and several of these regimens are now progressing through clinical trials. This article covers current concepts and recent advances in TB drug discovery and development, including an update of ongoing TB treatment trials, newer clinical trial designs, TB biomarkers and adjunct host-directed therapies.

Randomization and Treatment Strategy

Participants were randomly assigned to undergo either standard treatment or a strategy involving initial treatment with an 8-week regimen, extended treatment for persistent clinical disease, monitoring after treatment, and retreatment for relapse. There were four strategy groups with different initial regimens; participants were randomly assigned to the standard-treatment group or to one of the four strategy groups in equal proportions. Randomization was conducted by site staff with the use of an online system and was stratified according to trial site and relapse risk (Section S2).

Standard treatment consisted of a standard dose of rifampin and isoniazid for 24 weeks in combination with pyrazinamide and ethambutol for the first 8 weeks. In the four strategy groups, initial treatment consisted of the following 8-week regimens: a high dose of rifampin and linezolid, a high dose of rifampin and clofazimine, rifapentine and linezolid, and bedaquiline and linezolid, each in combination with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. In the strategy group with an initial rifapentine–linezolid regimen, ethambutol was replaced with levofloxacin (Section S3). The rationale for regimen selection is described in the protocol. The high dose of rifampin was 35 mg per kilogram of body weight initially and was reduced to 20 mg per kilogram starting on November 1, 2019. When a participant had persistent clinical disease (symptoms and a positive sputum smear) at week 8 or had missed doses, treatment with the five-drug regimen could be extended through week 12. When a participant had persistent clinical disease at week 12 or had adverse events at an earlier point, the five-drug regimen could be switched to standard treatment to complete a 24-week course of treatment.

### Predicting tuberculosis relapse in patients treated with the standard 6-month regimen: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^1b783ab5]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Relapse continues to place significant burden on patients and tuberculosis (TB) programmes worldwide. We aimed to determine clinical and microbiological factors associated with relapse in patients treated with the WHO standard 6-month regimen and then evaluate the accuracy of each factor at predicting an outcome of relapse.

Methods

A systematic review was performed to identify randomised controlled trials reporting treatment outcomes on patients receiving the standard regimen. Authors were contacted and invited to share patient-level data (IPD). A one-step IPD meta-analysis, using random intercept logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic curves, was performed to evaluate the predictive performance of variables of interest.

Results

Individual patient data were obtained from 3 of the 12 identified studies. Of the 1189 patients with confirmed pulmonary TB who completed therapy, 67 (5.6%) relapsed. In multipredictor analysis, the presence of baseline cavitary disease with positive smear at 2months was associated with an increased odds of relapse (OR 2.3(95% CI 1.3 to 4.2)) and a relapse risk of 10%. When area under the curve for each multipredictor model was compared, discrimination between low-risk and higher-risk patients was modest and similar to that of the reference model which accounted for age, sex and HIV status.

Conclusion

Despite its poor predictive value, our results indicate that the combined presence of cavitary disease and 2-month positive smear status may be the best currently available marker for identifying individuals at an increased risk of relapse, particularly in resource-limited setting. Further investigation is required to assess whether this combined factor can be used to indicate different treatment requirements in clinical practice.

These recommendations are based on single or small studies, which may not reflect TB populations in the United States and Europe. TB clinical trial participants are younger than TB patients in the United States and Europe. Adverse events may be more common in older individuals and may differ between trial and TB programmatic settings. These studies also excluded children with severe TB or DR-TB, pregnant individuals, and patients with severe forms of EPTB. Studies of treatment of individuals excluded from these trials, new regimens, emergence of drug resistance, and other issues will inform future guidelines (Table 9).

Research Needs

This Joint Panel guideline updates the 2016 and 2019 TB treatment guidelines in specific types of DS- and DR-TB. For patients who do not fit these categories, the Joint Panel's prior guidelines should be consulted. This document's focus is TB low-incidence high-resource contexts, in contrast to WHO's TB high-burden, lower-resource settings. DOT and integrated case management remain standard of care, as noted in the Joint Panel's prior guidance. The Joint Panel offered a strong recommendation for BPaL/BPaLM for MDR-/RR-TB, whereas the WHO GDG provided a conditional recommendation. We continue to recommend DST to guide therapy and DOT as standard of care for TB treatment.

### Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^ff81f590]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: The American Thoracic Society, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, European Respiratory Society, and Infectious Diseases Society of America jointly sponsored this new practice guideline on the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB). The document includes recommendations on the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) as well as isoniazid-resistant but rifampin-susceptible TB. Methods: Published systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and a new individual patient data meta-analysis from 12,030 patients, in 50 studies, across 25 countries with confirmed pulmonary rifampin-resistant TB were used for this guideline. Meta-analytic approaches included propensity score matching to reduce confounding. Each recommendation was discussed by an expert committee, screened for conflicts of interest, according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Results: Twenty-one Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes questions were addressed, generating 25 GRADE-based recommendations. Certainty in the evidence was judged to be very low, because the data came from observational studies with significant loss to follow-up and imbalance in background regimens between comparator groups. Good practices in the management of MDR-TB are described. On the basis of the evidence review, a clinical strategy tool for building a treatment regimen for MDR-TB is also provided. Conclusions: New recommendations are made for the choice and number of drugs in a regimen, the duration of intensive and continuation phases, and the role of injectable drugs for MDR-TB. On the basis of these recommendations, an effective all-oral regimen for MDR-TB can be assembled. Recommendations are also provided on the role of surgery in treatment of MDR-TB and for treatment of contacts exposed to MDR-TB and treatment of isoniazid-resistant TB.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^94f309a6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive guidelines for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among persons living in the United States were last published in 2000 (American Thoracic Society. CDC targeted tuberculin testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000;161:S221-47). Since then, several new regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials. To update previous guidelines, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and CDC convened a committee to conduct a systematic literature review and make new recommendations for the most effective and least toxic regimens for treatment of LTBI among persons who live in the United States. The systematic literature review included clinical trials of regimens to treat LTBI. Quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) from clinical trial comparisons was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. In addition, a network meta-analysis evaluated regimens that had not been compared directly in clinical trials. The effectiveness outcome was tuberculosis disease; the toxicity outcome was hepatotoxicity. Strong GRADE recommendations required at least moderate evidence of effectiveness and that the desirable consequences outweighed the undesirable consequences in the majority of patients. Conditional GRADE recommendations were made when determination of whether desirable consequences outweighed undesirable consequences was uncertain (e.g., with low-quality evidence). These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines include the NTCA- and CDC-recommended treatment regimens that comprise three preferred rifamycin-based regimens and two alternative monotherapy regimens with daily isoniazid. All recommended treatment regimens are intended for persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is presumed to be susceptible to isoniazid or rifampin. These updated guidelines do not apply when evidence is available that the infecting M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin; recommendations for treating contacts exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were published in 2019 (Nahid P, Mase SR Migliori GB, et al. Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA clinical practice guideline. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2019;200:e93-e142). The three rifamycin-based preferred regimens are 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, or 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin. Prescribing providers or pharmacists who are unfamiliar with rifampin and rifapentine might confuse the two drugs. They are not interchangeable, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medication for the intended regimen. Preference for these rifamycin-based regimens was made on the basis of effectiveness, safety, and high treatment completion rates. The two alternative treatment regimens are daily isoniazid for 6 or 9 months; isoniazid monotherapy is efficacious but has higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates than shorter rifamycin-based regimens. In summary, short-course (3- to 4-month) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over longer-course (6–9 month) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These updated guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt them to fit individual clinical circumstances.

### New drugs for the management of tuberculosis [^c3b7b131]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The work done in past two decades is ushering in a new era in tuberculosis treatment, that we hope will deliver shorter, safer and more person-centred treatments for tuberculosis. It is important to recognize that beyond therapeutics, there are advances being made in vaccine development, host-directed therapies, and renewed interest in novel biomarker to improve diagnostics, predict treatment response, and enable personalize treatments. However, scientific progress alone will not end the tuberculosis epidemic. To fully realize the potential of these breakthroughs, there must be a coordinated effort to address the challenges of equitable drug availability, provide person-centred treatment support beyond directly observed therapy, strengthening health system capacity, and advancing the science of implementation. Only through this comprehensive, integrated approach can we accelerate progress towards eliminating tuberculosis.

Completion of therapy definition — treatment completion is determined by the total number of doses rather than time, and programs aim to administer intensive‑phase doses within 3 months, the 4‑month continuation‑phase doses within 6 months, so that the 6‑month regimen is completed within 9 months; if these targets are not met, the patient is considered to have interrupted therapy.

Rifampin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis — BPaLM versus standard-of-care evidence: The PICO question asks whether a 6-month regimen composed of bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and moxifloxacin is as effective and safe as 15-month or longer regimens. In TB-PRACTECAL, standard-of-care regimens were compared with 24-week investigational regimens including a BPaLM arm in an open-label, multicenter, randomized noninferiority trial with a primary outcome assessed at 72 weeks; SoC included 9–12-month injectable-containing regimens, 18–24-month long pre-2019 WHO regimens, a 9–12-month all-oral regimen, and an 18–20-month all-oral regimen. Participants receiving BPaLM (n = 62) versus SoC (n = 66) had treatment success 89% versus 52%, failure and recurrence 8% versus 26%, loss to follow-up 3% versus 20%, and grades 3 to 5 adverse events 21% versus 51%. Certainty in estimated effects was very low because of multiple factors.

Dealing with missing data

When data for outcomes were missing from the primary trial report, we sought these in supplementary data provided in appendices or related publications. When trials reported intention‐to‐treat (ITT) or modified intention‐to‐treat (m‐ITT) or per‐protocol analyses (available case analyses), we recorded the numbers excluded from analyses from among those randomized and allocated to each arm before and during treatment and during follow‐up. We also noted the reasons for their exclusion. Post‐randomization exclusions are not uncommon in trials comparing newer ATT regimens. One type occurs when sputum smear positive participants are randomized, but when sputum culture and drug susceptibility results become available, they may not confirm tuberculosis or may indicate infection with other mycobacteria, or the presence of drug resistance. These ineligible participants are excluded from the trials (late screening failures). Modified‐ITT analysis in such situations excludes late screening failures from ITT analyses, and all other participants are analysed in their allocated arms. In this deviation from the standard ITT analysis, post‐randomization exclusions are unrelated to compliance, withdrawals, or losses to follow‐up, or to the likelihood of getting the intervention; when ineligible participants do not represent populations to which trial results are likely to be applied, the risk of bias may not differ from traditional ITT analysis (Fergusson 2002). However, if m‐ITT analyses exclude participants post‐randomization for reasons other than late screen failure, this can lead to overestimation of treatment effects compared to standard ITT analyses (Abraha 2015). For this review, we used the data provided in ITT or m‐ITT analysis of the included trials for our main analysis, because this analysis included more eligible participants than were included in the reported per‐protocol analyses and it did not require us to make assumptions about missing data. When ITT or m‐ITT analyses reported in the trials differed from standard interpretations, we assessed the impact of missing data by performing sensitivity analysis for the review's primary outcome of relapse. In imputing missing data, we had intended to perform the commonly used 'best‐worst case' analysis, in which the 'best‐case' scenario is that all participants with missing outcomes in the experimental intervention group had good outcomes (no relapse), and all those with missing outcomes in the control intervention group had poor outcomes (relapse); the 'worst‐case' scenario is the converse. However, these are extreme assumptions, especially with rare outcomes such as relapse. Instead, we used relapse proportions in the treatment and control arms from per‐protocol analysis in these trials to impute relapse rates for the missing population.

Summary

Comprehensive guidelines for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among persons living in the United States were last published in 2000 (American Thoracic Society. CDC targeted tuberculin testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000;161:S221–47). Since then, several new regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials. To update previous guidelines, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and CDC convened a committee to conduct a systematic literature review and make new recommendations for the most effective and least toxic regimens for treatment of LTBI among persons who live in the United States.

The systematic literature review included clinical trials of regimens to treat LTBI. Quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) from clinical trial comparisons was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. In addition, a network meta-analysis evaluated regimens that had not been compared directly in clinical trials. The effectiveness outcome was tuberculosis disease; the toxicity outcome was hepatotoxicity. Strong GRADE recommendations required at least moderate evidence of effectiveness and that the desirable consequences outweighed the undesirable consequences in the majority of patients. Conditional GRADE recommendations were made when determination of whether desirable consequences outweighed undesirable consequences was uncertain (e.g. with low-quality evidence).

These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines include the NTCA- and CDC-recommended treatment regimens that comprise three preferred rifamycin-based regimens and two alternative monotherapy regimens with daily isoniazid. All recommended treatment regimens are intended for persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is presumed to be susceptible to isoniazid or rifampin. These updated guidelines do not apply when evidence is available that the infecting M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin; recommendations for treating contacts exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were published in 2019 (Nahid P, Mase SR Migliori GB, et al. Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA clinical practice guideline. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2019;200:e93–e142). The three rifamycin-based preferred regimens are 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, or 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin. Prescribing providers or pharmacists who are unfamiliar with rifampin and rifapentine might confuse the two drugs. They are not interchangeable, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medication for the intended regimen. Preference for these rifamycin-based regimens was made on the basis of effectiveness, safety, and high treatment completion rates. The two alternative treatment regimens are daily isoniazid for 6 or 9 months; isoniazid monotherapy is efficacious but has higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates than shorter rifamycin-based regimens.

In summary, short-course (3- to 4-month) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over longer-course (6–9 month) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These updated guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt them to fit individual clinical circumstances.

### Risk-stratified treatment for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis [^290752d2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

TBTC Study 31/A5349 was a Phase 3 international multicenter randomized controlled trial that compared 4-month regimens of daily isoniazid, rifapentine, and pyrazinamide plus either moxifloxacin (rifapentine-moxifloxacin regimen) or ethambutol (rifapentine-regimen) to the 6-month standard treatment of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (control regimen) for the treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. The 4-month rifapentine-moxifloxacin regimen demonstrated noninferior efficacy and comparable safety to the control (primary results published in NEJM), making it the first 4-month regimen endorsed by both the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the treatment of adolescents and adults with pulmonary tuberculosis –. While the rifapentine-regimen was not shown to have noninferior efficacy to the control, 82% of participants receiving it were cured.

Tuberculosis has long been treated with a one-size-fits-all 6-month regimen, as in the control regimen of Study 31/A5349. However, there is increasing evidence that a subset of patients are overtreated, and those with harder-to-treat TB (smear grade 3+ and cavitary disease) require longer than the prescribed treatment duration –. Similarly, it has been shown that the suboptimal efficacy of experimental regimens containing rifamycins and fluoroquinolones for persons with harder-to-treat TB is the primary reason underlying the unfavorable clinical outcomes in recent Phase 3 clinical trials. It is therefore essential that we understand the key drivers of treatment response in disease phenotypes to help define the utility of current regimens and best practices for late-stage tuberculosis drug trials. To that end, Study 31/A5349 incorporated pharmacokinetic sampling for all antituberculosis drugs among all participants, providing an unprecedented opportunity to establish the contribution of exposure-response relationships to clinical outcomes for antituberculosis drugs, and permitting insights into the complex interplay between disease severity, participant characteristics, regimen potency, and regimen duration on long-term clinical outcomes.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to management of drug-resistant tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant, choice of regimen, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to include all 3 group A agents and at least 1 group B agent in longer treatment regimens of patients with MDR-TB/rifampin-resistant tuberculosis, in order to ensure that treatment starts with at least 4 agents likely to be effective and that at least 3 agents are included for the rest of the treatment if bedaquiline is stopped. Include both group B agents if only 1 or 2 group A agents are used. Add group C agents if the regimen cannot be composed of agents from groups A and B alone.
