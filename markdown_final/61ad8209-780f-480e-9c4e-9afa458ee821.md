## Question

Hiv vaccination

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the current status, challenges, and future directions for HIV vaccination, including both preventive and therapeutic contexts, and wants clarification on what "HIV vaccination" means in practice today. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the terminology and scope so I don't conflate preventive HIV vaccines with routine immunizations for people living with HIV. Then, I should review the historical and current state of preventive HIV vaccine trials and their outcomes. Next, I will examine the core biological and translational challenges that explain those outcomes. After that, I should analyze current and emerging vaccine strategies, including broadly neutralizing antibody induction, mRNA platforms, and T-cell approaches. I will then consider therapeutic vaccination and how it differs from prevention. Finally, I need to translate this into clinical and public health implications, including diagnostics, equity, and implementation readiness, and close with a realistic timeline and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislead. "HIV vaccination" in this context refers to a vaccine to prevent HIV acquisition, which does not exist as a licensed product, whereas people with HIV still require routine vaccinations per guidelines, such as COVID-19, influenza, HPV, and others, with schedules tailored to immune status. These are distinct issues and should not be conflated [^115EZ1gs] [^112ZeDRa] [^115VTLKr].

> I will now examine the historical trajectory of preventive HIV vaccine efficacy trials to anchor expectations. Out of nine completed phase 2b/3 efficacy trials, only one, RV144 in Thailand, showed modest, transient protection with an estimated efficacy around 31% and correlates pointing to V1V2-specific antibodies, whereas subsequent trials attempting to replicate or extend that concept, including HVTN 702, HVTN 705, and HVTN 706, did not demonstrate significant efficacy, underscoring that we lack a reliable correlate of protection and that incremental tweaks to prior regimens are insufficient [^1134BzFB] [^115ZTkRS] [^116jzzH9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the biological reasons for these failures. HIV's extraordinary genetic diversity with expanding recombinants, the rapid establishment of integrated provirus within hours, the glycan shield masking conserved epitopes, and the virus's tropism for CD4+ T cells collectively undermine both humoral and cellular vaccine strategies, while the rarity and complexity of broadly neutralizing antibody lineages make them exceptionally difficult to induce via conventional immunogens [^112LsYR4] [^117U4fQx] [^112PdRyn] [^114ZpcQf].

> Next, I should review current and emerging strategies and their rationale. Germline-targeting and sequential immunization aim to shepherd rare B cell precursors toward bnAbs, native-like stabilized Env trimers and nanoparticle displays seek to present the correct conformational epitopes, and mRNA platforms are being leveraged for precision antigen delivery and iterative optimization. Meanwhile, T-cell vaccines targeting conserved regions and novel vectors such as rhCMV are being reconsidered, though prior Ad5-based approaches raised safety concerns and underscore the need for careful vector selection [^112PdRyn] [^116a92uB] [^113f4mAr] [^117WbvUb].

> Wait, let me verify the role of passive bnAbs as a proof-of-concept for active vaccination. The AMP trials demonstrated that infusion of VRC01 provided protection against infection by neutralization-sensitive strains when serum levels were high, establishing a quantitative benchmark for the antibody titers a vaccine would need to elicit, while preclinical NHP data show that vaccine-induced bnAbs can protect at high titers, reinforcing the feasibility of bnAb-mediated protection if we can reliably induce the right antibodies [^1134BzFB] [^111dZTtL].

> I need to check the status of current clinical pipelines. Multiple early-phase trials are evaluating germline-targeting primes, mRNA-encoded Env immunogens, and heterologous vector boosts, but no regimen has yet translated into durable, broadly protective efficacy in humans. The field remains in a discovery-to-validation phase, with iterative trials needed to link immunogenicity to protection [^115zYVWz] [^116a92uB].

> Let me consider therapeutic vaccination separately, because the goals and endpoints differ. Therapeutic vaccines aim to reduce viral rebound or reservoir size after ART interruption, but randomized trials to date have shown only modest immune augmentation without meaningful impact on viral control or reservoir metrics, indicating that current immunogens and strategies are insufficient to achieve ART-free remission. Nonetheless, fast-track evaluation in people with HIV on suppressive ART is being proposed to accelerate immunogen validation and correlate discovery [^114ruxw3] [^111f3iVm].

> I should double-check implementation hurdles that will shape rollout even if efficacy is achieved. Vaccine-induced seropositivity can confound HIV screening algorithms, requiring development of vaccination-status–agnostic diagnostics and clear counseling to prevent misclassification and stigma; equitable access, financing, and delivery systems must be planned proactively, especially for LMICs, and modeling suggests that even a modestly effective vaccine could have population-level impact if coverage is high, though durability and breadth across subtypes remain critical uncertainties [^112yCMCH] [^1162BxmP] [^115pRUWY] [^115hbCoK].

> But wait, what about the immediate prevention landscape and how a vaccine would fit. Highly effective biomedical prevention tools exist, including oral and long-acting injectable PrEP, with lenacapavir showing 100% efficacy in women and 96% in men over 52 weeks in recent trials, yet adherence, access, and stigma still limit real-world impact. A vaccine would complement, not replace, these strategies, and the field is increasingly emphasizing combination prevention and implementation science to close gaps for women and other key populations [^117W23fG] [^114RurS2] [^115C2Fy8].

> Let me reconsider the timeline and next steps so expectations are realistic. A licensed preventive HIV vaccine is not imminent; continued investment in basic immunology, iterative clinical testing, and cross-disciplinary collaboration are essential, and adaptive trial designs may help accelerate learning while the field converges on immunogens and regimens capable of inducing protective, durable immunity across diverse viral strains [^115C2Fy8] [^11616mEJ].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise: there is no licensed HIV vaccine to prevent acquisition, people with HIV should continue to receive standard vaccinations per guidelines, and current HIV vaccine research is focused on inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies and multi-functional cellular immunity through advanced immunogen design and platform technologies. Success will likely require breakthroughs in both scientific understanding and implementation planning before a deployable, effective vaccine is realized [^115EZ1gs] [^112PdRyn] [^1134BzFB].

There is **no approved HIV vaccine** [^115QPnAL] because the virus's extreme genetic diversity [^112LsYR4], rapid mutation [^112df6Zc], and ability to evade and suppress the immune system [^111vfTqK] have thwarted traditional approaches [^111vfTqK]. The only trial to show modest protection (RV144, ~31% efficacy) [^113f4mAr] could not be replicated [^115ZTkRS], and recent large trials (HVTN 702, HVTN 705, HVTN 706) failed [^1134BzFB]. Current efforts focus on **inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies** [^112PdRyn] via germline-targeting [^116MbDo2], sequential immunization [^115zYVWz], and mRNA platforms [^116a92uB], but no candidate has yet achieved durable, broad protection [^1134BzFB]. Until a vaccine succeeds, **prevention relies on condoms, PrEP, and treatment as prevention** [^115C2Fy8].

## Scientific challenges in HIV vaccine development

HIV vaccine development faces **unique scientific obstacles**:

- **Genetic diversity**: HIV has multiple subtypes and rapid mutation [^112LsYR4], creating extensive variability that complicates vaccine design [^112PdRyn].

- **Immune evasion**: HIV rapidly mutates to escape immune recognition [^113f4mAr] and integrates into the host genome, establishing latency and persistent infection [^117U4fQx].

- **Lack of correlates of protection**: No clear immune markers of protection have been identified [^11616mEJ], complicating vaccine evaluation [^11616mEJ].

- **Failure of traditional approaches**: Live-attenuated, inactivated, and subunit vaccines have failed due to safety concerns or lack of efficacy [^111VYWSS].

---

## Historical HIV vaccine trials and their outcomes

Several large-scale efficacy trials have been conducted, with **mostly disappointing results**:

| **Trial name** | **Year** | **Vaccine strategy** | **Outcome** |
|-|-|-|-|
| VAX003 | 2003 | gp120 subunit vaccine | No protection [^113f4mAr] |
| VAX004 | 2003 | gp120 subunit vaccine | No protection [^113f4mAr] |
| RV144 (Thailand) | 2009 | ALVAC-HIV + AIDSVAX B/E | Modest protection (~31%) [^113f4mAr] |
| HVTN 702 (South Africa) | 2020 | ALVAC-HIV + bivalent gp120 | No protection [^1134BzFB] |
| HVTN 705 (Imbokodo) | 2021 | Ad26 mosaic + gp140 | No protection [^1134BzFB] |
| HVTN 706 (Mosaico) | 2023 | Ad26 mosaic + gp140 | No protection [^1134BzFB] |

---

RV144 remains the only trial to show modest protection, but **subsequent trials have not replicated** these results [^115ZTkRS].

---

## Current strategies and technologies in HIV vaccine research

Despite setbacks, **novel strategies are under investigation**:

- **Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs)**: Efforts focus on inducing bnAbs [^112PdRyn] through germline-targeting [^116MbDo2], sequential immunization [^115zYVWz], and mRNA platforms [^116a92uB].

- **mRNA vaccines**: Rapid adaptation to HIV diversity [^notfound] and potential for strong immune responses are being explored [^notfound].

- **Viral vector vaccines**: Adenoviral vectors [^111VYWSS] and recombinant vectors are being tested to enhance immunogenicity [^111VYWSS].

- **Combination approaches**: Strategies targeting both humoral and cellular immunity are being pursued [^114ZpcQf] [^1134BzFB].

---

## Current status of HIV vaccine clinical trials

As of 2024, **no HIV vaccine has entered phase III trials** [^notfound]; early-phase trials are evaluating novel immunogens and delivery systems, but none has yet achieved durable, broad protection [^1134BzFB].

---

## Role of international organizations and funding agencies

International organizations (WHO, UNAIDS, NIH) and philanthropic groups (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) provide **critical funding, coordination, and support** for research and trials [^111oSNfx].

---

## Ethical considerations and public health implications

Ethical issues include **equitable access**, informed consent, and potential stigma from vaccine-induced seropositivity [^112yCMCH]. Public health planning must address **moderate-efficacy vaccines** [^115akJZ3] and integration with existing prevention strategies [^115pRUWY].

---

## Future directions and prospects

Key priorities include **identifying correlates of protection** [^11479DfY], designing immunogens that elicit bnAbs [^112PdRyn], and conducting rigorous trials. Continued investment and innovation are essential to overcome current barriers [^115aqA32].

---

## Alternative HIV prevention strategies

In the absence of a vaccine, **prevention relies on**:

- **Condom use**: Effective in reducing sexual transmission.

- **Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)**: Highly effective, including long-acting options like lenacapavir [^117W23fG].

- **Treatment as prevention (TasP)**: Viral suppression reduces transmission risk [^115ZTkRS].

---

There is **no approved HIV vaccine** [^115QPnAL], but ongoing research into bnAbs, mRNA platforms, and combination strategies offers hope. Until then, prevention depends on condoms, PrEP, and TasP [^115ZTkRS].

Introduction

Despite many recent advances in the HIV prevention landscape, an effective vaccine remains the most promising tool to end the HIV-1 pandemic. Areas covered: This review summarizes past HIV vaccine efficacy trials and current vaccine strategies as well as new approaches about to move into first-in-human trials. Expert opinion: Despite many setbacks in early HIV vaccine efficacy trials, the success of RV144 has provided the glimmer of hope necessary to invigorate the vaccine field, and has led to the development of a large number of vaccine strategies aiming at inducing an array of different immune responses. The follow-up pox-protein trials, developed to replicate and enhance the polyfunctional antibody responses induced by the RV144 regimen, are already reaching efficacy trials, while a large body of work providing a more complete understanding of the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies is now being translated into immunogen design using several different strategies. T-cell based vaccines, fallen out of favor after Ad5-based trials showed increased infection rates in Ad5 seropositive vaccine recipients, are experiencing a comeback based in part on the promising results from non-human primate challenge studies using rhCMV-based immunogens. This diverse array of vaccine candidates may finally allow us to identify a broadly effective HIV vaccine able to contain the epidemic.

Influenza vaccination — timing and vaccine type selection for people with HIV: Optimally, vaccination should occur before onset of influenza activity because it takes about 2 weeks after vaccination for protective antibodies to develop; health care providers should offer vaccination by the end of October if possible, and vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Information on currently available influenza vaccines is obtainable through the CDC's recommendations on the 2024–2025 influenza season, and for adults aged ≥ 65 years, high-dose IIV, adjuvanted IIV, or recombinant influenza vaccine are preferentially recommended over standard-dose unadjuvanted vaccines.

### Vaccinating people living with HIV: a fast track to preventive and therapeutic HIV vaccines [^111f3iVm]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Globally, the number of new HIV infections remains unacceptably high, and urgent new approaches are needed to advance HIV vaccine science. However, the development of a preventive HIV vaccine has proven to be an intractable scientific challenge. Recent advances in HIV immunogen design have taken the field a step closer to triggering the rare precursors of broadly neutralising antibodies, which are widely assumed to be necessary for a vaccine. Nonetheless, these same studies and previous studies in people living with HIV have also highlighted the major hurdles that must be overcome to boost the cross-reactivity and potency of these responses to sufficient levels. Here, we describe an opportunity for fast-tracking the evaluation of candidate preventive and therapeutic vaccines by immunising people with HIV who are antiretroviral therapy suppressed. We argue that such studies, unlike traditional studies of vaccines in participants not infected with HIV, will be faster and more informative and will allow the vaccine field to bypass multiple hurdles. This approach will accelerate the process of defining the capacity of immunogens to trigger relevant antibodies, currently an extremely slow and expensive pathway, and provide a quick path to creating an HIV vaccine.

### What constitutes efficacy for a human immunodeficiency virus vaccine that ameliorates viremia: issues involving surrogate end points in phase 3 trials [^1178UAJE]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Initial human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines are unlikely to prevent acquisition of HIV in all recipients. Moreover, several HIV vaccines are under evaluation that are designed to reduce viremia after acquisition of infection. Such vaccines could provide important benefits to delay HIV progression and to reduce transmission. The decision to license a vaccine on the basis of observed effects on virus load and other postinfection surrogate end points in an efficacy trial is complicated by uncertainty about whether the vaccine effects will persist and reliably predict clinical effects, and by the challenge in interpreting the data posed by treatment of some seroconverters with antiretroviral drugs. Here, we evaluate how analyses of certain surrogate end points can be used for inferring clinically significant vaccine effects and propose end points that could be evaluated in efficacy trials to support licensure. The assessment suggests that a vaccine demonstrating moderately durable effects to delay therapy and to ameliorate viremia merits consideration for licensure.

Participants in HIV vaccine trials — testing guidance: Recipients of HIV vaccines might have vaccine-induced antibodies that produce reactive HIV antibody test results, and laboratories should advise persons who order HIV testing that vaccine recipients with reactive immunoassay results should be encouraged to contact a vaccine trial site for specialized testing necessary to determine their HIV infection status.

Influenza vaccine — live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and coadministration guidance in people with HIV: Although a LAIV is available, it is contraindicated for people with HIV because of the paucity of safety data and alternative vaccines, and although unintentional LAIV administration to adults with HIV has been well tolerated, it is not recommended for people with HIV. Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) can be administered to people receiving influenza antiviral drugs for treatment or chemoprophylaxis, and concurrent administration of influenza vaccine does not interfere with the immune response to other inactivated vaccines or to live vaccines.

### HPV vaccination recommendations… [^111GqQsK]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaccination Recommendations
- HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years.
- ACIP also recommends vaccination for everyone through age 26 years if not adequately vaccinated when younger. HPV vaccination is given as a series of either two or three doses, depending on age at initial vaccination. Dosing Schedules Two doses of HPV vaccine are recommended for most persons starting the series before their 15 th birthday.
- The second dose of HPV vaccine should be given 6 to 12 months after the first dose.
- Adolescents who receive two doses less than 5 months apart will require a third dose of HPV vaccine. Three doses of HPV vaccine are recommended for teens and young adults who start the series at ages 15 through 26 years, and for immunocompromised persons.
- The recommended three-dose schedule is 0, 1–2 and 6 months.
- Three doses are recommended for immunocompromised persons aged 9 through 26 years.
- A moderate or severe acute illness is a precaution to vaccination, and vaccination should be deferred until symptoms of the acute illness improve.
- A minor acute illness is not a reason to defer vaccination.
- If a woman is found to be pregnant after starting the HPV vaccine series, second and/or third doses should be delayed until she is no longer pregnant.
- If a woman receives HPV vaccine and later learns that she is pregnant, there is no reason to be alarmed.
- Anyone who learns she is pregnant when she received an HPV vaccine can contact the manufacturer at 1–877–888–4231.
- Any suspected adverse events following HPV vaccination during pregnancy should be reported to VAERS. Vaccine Safety HPV vaccines are very safe.

Scientific research shows the benefits of HPV vaccination far outweigh the potential risks. Like all medical interventions, vaccines can have some side effects. All vaccines used in the United States, including HPV vaccines, go through extensive safety testing before the U. S. Food and Drug Administration licenses them. During clinical trials before the licensure, the 9-valent HPV vaccine Gardasil 9 was studied in more than 15, 000 males and females and was found to be safe and effective.

### HIV vaccines: new frontiers in vaccine development [^111VYWSS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine is the most promising and feasible strategy to prevent the events during acute infection that simultaneously set the course of the epidemic in the community and the course of the disease for the individual. Because safety concerns limit the use of live, attenuated HIV and inactivated HIV, a variety of alternate approaches is being investigated. Traditional antibody-mediated approaches using recombinant HIV envelope proteins have shown no efficacy in 2 phase III trials. Current HIV vaccine trials are focusing primarily on cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated products that use viral vectors, either alone or as boosts to DNA plasmids that contain viral genes. The most immunogenic of these products appear to be the recombinant adenovirus vector vaccines, 2 of which are now in advanced clinical development.

### Phase I clinical trial of an intranodally administered mRNA-based therapeutic vaccine against HIV-1 infection [^114ttaWf]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven to be highly effective to prevent HIV-associated clinical progression and death and to influence the AIDS pandemic as part of HIV prevention strategies. Despite these successes, current ART has a number of public health, economical and clinical limitations. First, although 80% of HIV-infected individuals in United States and Europe know that they are HIV-infected, only 30 and 50%, respectively, are virally suppressed (hence with low probability of sexual transmission). Second, ART is unable to cure or eradicate the infection. The high cost of lifelong treatment remains an important issue in the implementation of the the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) strategy of universal treatment. Third, suboptimal treatment adherence can lead to the development of viral resistance. Finally, the potential medium–long term adverse effects of ART have important clinical limitations.

A well tolerated, affordable and scalable cure could address both the individual and public health limitations that are associated with lifelong ART. The scientific community has acknowledged this position and there is a growing interest in developing curative strategies to tackle HIV persistence, among, which therapeutic vaccines represent one of the most promising approaches. However, although, most immunogens have been able to induce HIV-specific immune responses in clinical trials, they have shown very limited efficacy to control viral replication. The cytolytic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations and a poor antigen presentation by dendritic cells are some of the major hurdles that need to be addressed by rationally designed therapeutic vaccine candidates to improve their effectiveness. New inserts to redirect responses to vulnerable sites of HIV and vectors targeting dendritic-cell pathways could be necessary to achieve remission of HIV-1 infection.

### Key issues for a potential human immunodeficiency virus vaccine [^115akJZ3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

A safe, effective, and affordable vaccine remains the best long-term hope for bringing the global human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic under control. Recent scientific developments have suggested that the first generation of HIV vaccines available for public health care use will likely be of low to moderate efficacy, compared with currently licensed vaccines for other diseases. Nevertheless, such "partially effective" HIV vaccines could provide considerable individual and public health benefits. A consultation was held in January 2002 to advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia) about critical issues that need to be addressed in anticipation of the eventual licensure and availability of an HIV vaccine in the United States. The present article summarizes the major issues discussed at the consultation with regard to the potential use of a partially effective vaccine in HIV prevention programs in the United States and the activities that are needed to prepare for vaccine availability.

### A systematic review of T cell epitopes defined from the proteome of human immunodeficiency virus [^114YjuZp]. Virus Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Highlights

- Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a global health threat, and there is no available curative therapy currently.
- Host T cells have been proved to play a vital role in antiviral immune protection and pathology among HIV patients.
- The 321 T-cell epitope repertoires of HIV encompass the HLA polymorphisms of the main populations and subtypes in a particular geographical area, which seriously impedes the development of vaccines and specific T-cell detection systems.
- This manuscript offers a comprehensive review of T-cell epitopes covering the entire HIV proteome and global patients.
- This knowledge provides valuable insights for future studies on the development of T-cell epitope vaccines and the accurate assessment of host HIV-specific cellular immunity.

### Prospects for a globally effective HIV-1 vaccine [^116jzzH9]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A globally effective vaccine strategy must cope with the broad genetic diversity of HIV and contend with multiple transmission modalities. Understanding correlates of protection and the role of diversity in limiting protective vaccines with those correlates is key. RV144 was the first HIV-1 vaccine trial to demonstrate efficacy against HIV-1 infection. A correlates analysis comparing vaccine-induced immune responses in vaccinated-infected and vaccinated-uninfected volunteers suggested that IgG specific for the V1V2 region of gp120 was associated with reduced risk of HIV-1 infection and that plasma Env IgA was directly correlated with infection risk. RV144 and recent non-human primate (NHP) challenge studies suggest that Env is essential and perhaps sufficient to induce protective antibody responses against mucosally acquired HIV-1. Whether RV144 immune correlates can apply to different HIV vaccines, to populations with different modes and intensity of transmission, or to divergent HIV-1 subtypes remains unknown. Newer prime-boost mosaic and conserved sequence immunization strategies aiming at inducing immune responses of greater breadth and depth as well as the development of immunogens inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies should be actively pursued. Efficacy trials are now planned in heterosexual populations in southern Africa and men who have sex with men in Thailand. Although NHP challenge studies may guide vaccine development, human efficacy trials remain key to answer the critical questions leading to the development of a global HIV-1 vaccine for licensure.

### Leveraging lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic for HIV [^111AeVuL]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Science met the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic with unprecedented speed and accuracy with the development of safe and effective vaccines. Now is the time to harness the collective momentum from COVID-19 for HIV. Throughout all the approaches described here, several overarching themes emerge: flexibility is critical for responding to an ever-changing pandemic; inclusion improves equity in access to vaccines, therapeutics, and services for communities most impacted by a pandemic (although international access remains a continuing challenge), enables a diversity of thought, and improves decision-making; transparency is vital to accelerate science and promote trust; and continued investment in basic research supports the search for an efficacious HIV vaccine. By learning from these important lessons, the scientific community can capitalize on the momentum of the COVID-19 experience to re-energize HIV vaccine development.

### Vaccination in the adult patient infected with HIV: a review of vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity [^116Levcv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients infected with HIV remain at increased risk of mortality and morbidity from diseases that are preventable with vaccines partly due to the persisting immunopathology that results in impaired responses to vaccination despite virologic suppression. Because data on clinical effectiveness in patients who are immunocompromised remain limited, undervaccination of individuals with HIV poses a major concern. Multiple societies have published recommendations on vaccination in individuals infected with HIV. Many of these recommendations are based on extrapolation of data from clinical trials that usually exclude patients with HIV, although there is a growing body of data from patients infected with HIV as well. In this review, we describe the available literature on vaccine response in the adult patient with HIV as measured by immunogenicity or vaccine efficacy.

### HIV-1 vaccines and adaptive trial designs [^11616mEJ]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Developing a vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) poses an exceptional challenge. There are no documented cases of immune-mediated clearance of HIV from an infected individual, and no known correlates of immune protection. Although nonhuman primate models of lentivirus infection have provided valuable data about HIV pathogenesis, such models do not predict HIV vaccine efficacy in humans. The combined lack of a predictive animal model and undefined biomarkers of immune protection against HIV necessitate that vaccines to this pathogen be tested directly in clinical trials. Adaptive clinical trial designs can accelerate vaccine development by rapidly screening out poor vaccines while extending the evaluation of efficacious ones, improving the characterization of promising vaccine candidates and the identification of correlates of immune protection.

### Progress towards development of an HIV vaccine: report of the AIDS vaccine 2009 conference [^112GUmdY]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

The search for an HIV/AIDS vaccine is steadily moving ahead, generating and validating new concepts in terms of novel vectors for antigen delivery and presentation, new vaccine and adjuvant strategies, alternative approaches to design HIV-1 antigens for eliciting protective cross-neutralising antibodies, and identification of key mechanisms in HIV infection and modulation of the immune system. All these different perspectives are contributing to the unprecedented challenge of developing a protective HIV-1 vaccine. The high scientific value of this massive effort is its great impact on vaccinology as a whole, providing invaluable scientific information for the current and future development of new preventive vaccine as well as therapeutic knowledge-based infectious-disease and cancer vaccines.

### Prospects for an AIDS vaccine: three big questions, no easy answers [^114g4isL]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

The unremitting devastation created by the AIDS pandemic will probably only be controlled when a vaccine is developed that is safe, effective, affordable, and simple enough to permit implementation in developing countries where the impact of AIDS is most severe. Although formidable practical, political, economic, social, and ethical challenges face the AIDS vaccine development effort, the most fundamental challenges now reside at the level of the basic biology of HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis. Of these biological considerations, three questions loom especially large: can we design immunogens that will elicit neutralising antibodies that are reactive against a wide variety of primary HIV isolates; will vaccine-elicited cytotoxic T cells be fundamentally better at controlling HIV-1 replication and ameliorating disease progression than those responses that arise during natural HIV infection; and to what extent will the tremendous global genetic diversity of HIV-1 compromise the breadth of vaccine-elicited protective immunity and the overall effectiveness of an AIDS vaccine? Although these are three exceptionally challenging questions, they are now being approached with clear hypotheses whose testing is being facilitated by an ever-improving array of technologies for vaccine design and immunological characterisation. The extent to which the field of AIDS vaccine research can now come together to answer these questions in the best coordinated, most efficient manner will probably be an important determinant of how and when an effective AIDS vaccine will be developed.

### HIV / AIDS vaccines: 2018 [^117U4fQx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Challenges posed by human immunodeficiency virus‐1 for vaccine development

Development of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine faces many challenges that include the virus life cycle favoring the rapid establishment of hard to clear chronic infections, the high diversity and structure of the envelope glycoprotein limiting the ability to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), and the tropism of the virus for T helper cells facilitating infection, spread, and persistence (see Box 1).

Box 1
Challenges for HIV vaccine development

Upon infection, HIV reverse transcribes its RNA to DNA, which integrates into the host genome as a DNA provirus. The provirus, established within hours of infection, is a chronic infection that can lie latent, unable to be recognized by the immune system or eradicated by drugs. Most vaccines work by memory responses expanding and limiting disease. A protective memory response for HIV may need to prevent the establishment of proviral DNA.

---

### New approaches to HIV vaccine development [^114M2XiQ]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Development of a safe and effective vaccine for HIV is a major global priority. However, to date, efforts to design an HIV vaccine with methods used for development of other successful viral vaccines have not succeeded due to HIV diversity, HIV integration into the host genome, and ability of HIV to consistently evade anti-viral immune responses. Recent success in isolation of potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), in discovery of mechanisms of bnAb induction, and in discovery of atypical mechanisms of CD8T cell killing of HIV-infected cells, have opened new avenues for strategies for HIV vaccine design.

### Optimization of an alum-anchored clinical HIV vaccine candidate [^112df6Zc]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic began more than 40 years ago. Despite the increasing availability of antiretroviral drugs, HIV remains a leading cause of death globally, with over 37 million people currently infected with HIV worldwide. As a result, there is a significant unmet need for the development of an effective prophylactic HIV vaccine as a low-cost, facile solution to prevent infection. Previous work has demonstrated that passive transfer of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) capable of neutralizing diverse and mutated strains of HIV protects in non-human primate models of infection. Further, a human trial of bnAb VRC01 infusion provided proof-of-concept that bnAb prophylaxis can be effective against recognized strains of the virus, suggesting that a bnAb-directed vaccine approach has the potential to prevent infection. However, due to the diversity and high mutational capacity of the virus, the induction of bnAbs in the context of vaccination has remained a challenge –.

### Developing a successful HIV vaccine [^114gMbFk]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome integration indicates that persistent sterilizing immunity will be needed for a successful vaccine candidate. This suggests a need for broad antibodies targeting the Env protein. Immunogens targeting gp120 have been developed that block infection in monkeys and mimic the modest success of the RV144 clinical trial in that protection is short-lived following a decline in antibody-depending cell-mediated cytotoxicity-like antibodies. Attempts to induce antibody persistence have been complicated by a loss of efficacy, presumably by increasing the number of HIV-target cells. The key seems to be achieving an immune balance.

### Vaccines that stimulate T cell immunity to HIV-1: the next step [^117WbvUb]. Nature Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

The search for a vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has many hurdles to overcome. Ideally, the stimulation of both broadly neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses remains the best option, but no candidate in clinical trials at present has elicited such antibodies, and efficacy trials have not demonstrated any benefit for vaccines designed to stimulate immune responses of CD8(+) T cells. Findings obtained with the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) monkey model have provided new evidence that stimulating effective CD8(+) T cell immunity could provide protection, and in this Perspective we explore the path forward for optimizing such responses in humans.

### How low can you go: the impact of a modestly effective HIV vaccine compared with male circumcision [^115hbCoK]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The first evidence of modest effectiveness of an HIV vaccine was demonstrated by the RV144 trial in Thailand in 2009. Although promising, this vaccine has largely been dismissed because it only had 30% efficacy. In contrast, male circumcision is widely supported and has approximately twice the efficacy, but can only be targeted to half of the population. We question the vaccine efficacy required before being considered in prevention strategies.

Design

We forecast the expected population-level impact of implementing circumcision among males compared with a 30% effective vaccine among males and females.

Methods

A mathematical transmission model was developed to describe the HIV epidemics in two different settings, Thailand and South Africa, and to forecast the expected impact of circumcision or vaccine interventions.

Results

Interventions using a vaccine with 30% efficacy would likely have a greater population benefit than male circumcision because a proportion of males are already circumcised, thus diminishing the potential target population. Both males and females will receive considerable benefit from vaccination (for example, 33% of infections averted for males and 36% for females in South Africa), whereas females will receive only moderate benefit from male circumcision (for example, 47% of infections averted for males and 19% for females in South Africa). In both settings, it would likely take a number of years before the interventions could have a noticeable impact on HIV epidemics.

Conclusion

A moderately effective vaccine, such as the one demonstrated in the RV144 trial, may have a potential role in public health programs.

### Immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of the HPV vaccines among people living with HIV: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ft5xV]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Our results have implications for public health policy. Current evidence does not support the need for HIV testing prior to vaccination since the vaccine appears safe and immunogenic across age, sex and risk populations. PLHIV could benefit from vaccination, since PLHIV can elicit a robust immune response following vaccination, PLHIV have a high HPV disease burden, and that 90% of cervical and anal cancers are estimated to be due to HPV-16/18/33/45/52/58. Though more (higher quality) data is needed on the long-term efficacy of HPV vaccination in PLHIV, especially on HPV infection and diseases, current results suggest that PLHIV could benefit from being vaccinated against HPV even after acquiring HIV if they have not previously been offered the vaccine. More research is additionally needed to assess the extent to which existing HPV infections prior to vaccination may reduce the long-term efficacy of HPV vaccines among PLHIV who are highly burdened by HPV infection. A previous mathematical modeling study suggested that the nonavalent vaccine may reduce CIN2+ risk by 50–60% over four years in a cohort of WLHIV in South Africa. However more research is needed to evaluate the potential population-level impact of vaccinating PLHIV and determine the potential contribution of vaccinating PLHIV towards cervical cancer elimination and to determine the best age, disease stage, and HIV treatment status for vaccinating PLHIV. Furthermore, the best model of vaccine delivery (e.g. at ART clinics, or at the time of HIV diagnosis) needs to be explored to minimize the risk of HPV related cancer among PLHIV and to the resulting population-level impact in the wider population. PLHIV can develop a robust humoral immune response following HPV vaccination. The vaccine was found to be safe and well tolerated, with few serious adverse events. We identified important data gaps on vaccine effectiveness against HPV infections or related disease. Antibody titers and seropositivity declined over time, especially for HPV-18, and for the quadrivalent compared to bivalent vaccine, and more so for PLHIV than HIV-negative people. Given the lack of a formalized correlate of protection, additional data are needed to determine the effectiveness and duration of protection on clinical outcomes among PLHIV as well as the potential contribution of vaccinating PLHIV on the way towards cervical elimination goals. Though quality of studies reporting biological and clinical outcomes was limited, our results suggest that PLHIV who have not been vaccinated against HPV prior to acquiring HIV can still benefit from receiving the vaccine. This study adds to the evidence base that PLHIV who were not vaccinated before they acquired HIV infection generate an immune response to the vaccine and could benefit from HPV vaccination. However, the high prevalence of HPV in adult PLHIV, may mean the benefits of HPV vaccination could be lower in PLHIV but more evidence is needed to confirm this. Similar to recommendations for HPV vaccination of the general population, vaccination before sexual debut is important.

### Progress and obstacles in the development of an AIDS vaccine [^115g7dGA]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2006). Medium credibility.

Recent experimental observations suggest approaches to immunization that might finally result in at least a partially effective vaccine against infection with HIV-1. In particular, advances in our understanding of the contribution of vaccine-elicited cellular immunity to protecting memory CD4(+) T cells from virus-mediated destruction provide rational strategies for the development of this vaccine. This is therefore an ideal time to review our current understanding of HIV-1 and its control by the immune system, as well as the remaining problems that must be solved to facilitate the development of an effective vaccine against AIDS.

### A randomized controlled safety / efficacy trial of therapeutic vaccination in HIV-infected individuals who initiated antiretroviral therapy early in infection [^114ruxw3]. Science Translational Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Despite substantial clinical benefits, complete eradication of HIV has not been possible using antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone. Strategies that can either eliminate persistent viral reservoirs or boost host immunity to prevent rebound of virus from these reservoirs after discontinuation of ART are needed; one possibility is therapeutic vaccination. We report the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a therapeutic vaccine regimen in patients in whom ART was initiated during the early stage of HIV infection and whose immune system was anticipated to be relatively intact. The objectives of our study were to determine whether the vaccine was safe and could induce an immune response that would maintain suppression of plasma viremia after discontinuation of ART. Vaccinations were well tolerated with no serious adverse events but produced only modest augmentation of existing HIV-specific CD4 + T cell responses, with little augmentation of CD8 + T cell responses. Compared with placebo, the vaccination regimen had no significant effect on the kinetics or magnitude of viral rebound after interruption of ART and no impact on the size of the HIV reservoir in the CD4 + T cell compartment. Notably, 26% of subjects in the placebo arm exhibited sustained suppression of viremia (< 400 copies/ml) after treatment interruption, a rate of spontaneous suppression higher than previously reported. Our findings regarding the degree and kinetics of plasma viral rebound after ART interruption have potentially important implications for the design of future trials testing interventions aimed at achieving ART-free control of HIV infection.

### Enhancing anti-viral neutralization response to immunization with HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein immunogens [^116MbDo2]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) continues to spread with ~37 million people living with HIV-1 worldwide in 2021. Despite an abundance of approaches and available modalities with proven efficacy to prevent HIV-1 infection, approximately 1.5 million individuals were infected with HIV-1 in 2020. High numbers of newly infected individuals have led to intensive ongoing and innovative efforts for developing effective ways to prevent HIV-1 infection. A protective HIV-1 vaccine is yet not available but multiple approaches that emerged in parallel provide new insights to guide vaccine development. A recent study proved the feasibility/proof of concept of germline-targeting vaccine priming approach. In parallel, results from the first-in-human antibody-mediated prevention trial HVTN 703/HPTN 081 provide an estimate for the potency of elicited antibodies that would be required to prevent HIV-1 acquisition. Additionally, correlates of protection in the RV144 trial, which showed modest and temporal HIV-1 protection, suggest that non-neutralizing antibodies target HIV-1 gp120 V1/V2 loop may contribute to protection from HIV-1 infection.

### The challenges of eliciting neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 and to influenza virus [^1129qFjW]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2008). Medium credibility.

The ability to elicit broadly neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 is a crucial goal for a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine. Here, we discuss the difficulties of achieving broad HIV-1 neutralization in the context of both the effective annual human influenza virus vaccine and the need to develop a pandemic influenza vaccine. Immunogen-design strategies are underway to target functionally conserved regions of the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, and similar strategies might be applicable to pandemic influenza virus vaccine development. Efforts to develop broadly neutralizing vaccines against either HIV-1 or influenza virus might establish a paradigm for future vaccines against highly variable pathogens.

COVID-19 vaccine — available products and dosing recommendations for people with HIV: mRNA vaccines (Spikevax, Moderna; Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) and an adjuvanted protein subunit vaccine (Novavax) are listed. For adults and children > 5 years of age with HIV, administer a dose of the updated COVID-19 vaccine (once available) regardless of their CD4 count or HIV viral load (AII). Individuals with advanced or untreated HIV are considered moderately or severely immunocompromised and may receive one additional dose at least 8 weeks after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose (AIII). Advanced HIV is defined as people with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3, a history of an AIDS-defining illness without immune reconstitution, or clinical manifestations of symptomatic HIV.

### Ending the HIV / AIDS pandemic [^115gHdHn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

From a theoretical standpoint, the goal of ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic is achievable; however, it will require additional and sustained resources to make available the already existing scientific advances on local, regional, national, and global levels. From a practical standpoint, accomplishing this goal will be a substantial challenge. In this regard, the essential components in the effort toward achieving this most challenging goal would probably be development of a moderately effective HIV vaccine together with optimal implementation of existing treatment and prevention modalities. As persons living with HIV or at risk of acquiring HIV who have access to treatment and prevention continue to benefit from the fruits of scientific advances, we must not take our sights off or waiver in our pursuit of the ultimate goal of ending the epidemic as a global health catastrophe.

The WHO has adopted HPV vaccine and cervical cancer-screening based strategies to accelerate cervical cancer elimination. Given the elevated risk of anogenital cancers among PLHIV, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of HPV vaccination in PLHIV to inform clinical and public health guidelines and identify where important data gaps remain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide summary estimates in three domains: immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of HPV vaccination in PLHIV taking into account baseline HPV DNA and/or HPV serostatus, when possible. We also conducted subgroup analyses by age, sex, vaccine type and dose, and HIV disease status from available data.

Human immunodeficiency virus has infected 76 million people and killed an estimated 35 million. During its 40‐year history, remarkable progress has been made on antiretroviral drugs. Progress toward a vaccine has also been made, although this has yet to deliver a licensed product. In 2007, I wrote a review, Vaccines: 2007. This review, Vaccines: 2018, focuses on the progress in the past 11 years. I begin with key challenges for the development of anvaccine and the lessons learned from the six completed efficacy trials, only one of which has met with some success.

### Leveraging lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic for HIV [^115ZTkRS]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

HIV vaccine research is entering its fifth decade. A safe and effective HIV vaccine has been elusive, with significant challenges, but we are well positioned to adapt and learn from the COVID-19 vaccine experience. Only one HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trial undertaken to date, called RV144, has shown a modest reduction in HIV acquisition. Evidence of protection against infection was not found in a subsequent trial, HVTN 702, of a conceptually similar vaccine design. Similarly, no protection was observed in HVTN 705, a conceptually different vaccine. In total, out of the seven HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials successfully undertaken to date, six resulted in no efficacy. Other important approaches for HIV prevention include treatment to lower virus levels below that required for transmission; delivery of oral, injectable, or vaginal ring pre‐exposure prophylaxis with potent long‐acting antiretrovirals to prevent the virus from establishing infection; and passively delivered broadly neutralizing antibodies. However, these interventions require adherence, which is challenging in settings where stigma is prominent or where dependable access may be compromised due to logistics, cost, or other obstacles. We believe the only guarantee of a sustained end of the AIDS pandemic lies in a combination of nonvaccine-based prevention methods and the development and deployment of a safe and sufficiently effective HIV vaccine.

These new vaccines elicit T cells capable of recognizing and killing virus-infected cells. Brief synopses are given for six vaccines currently advancing in human trials.

### Leveraging lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic for HIV [^113q52FE]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines and their deployment in less than a year is an unprecedented scientific, medical, and public health achievement. This rapid development leveraged knowledge from decades of HIV/AIDS research and advances. However, the search for an HIV vaccine that would contribute to a durable end to the HIV pandemic remains elusive. Here, we draw from the US government experience and highlight lessons learned from COVID-19 vaccine development, which include the importance of public-private partnerships, equitable inclusion of populations impacted by the infectious pathogen, and continued investment in basic research. We summarize key considerations for an accelerated and re-energized framework for developing a safe and efficacious HIV vaccine.

### Critical issues in mucosal immunity for HIV-1 vaccine development [^111vfTqK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Development of a safe and effective vaccine for HIV-1 infection is a critical global priority. However, the nature of host-virus interactions that lead to early immunosuppression and CD4 depletion, HIV-1 diversity, and the inability of the immune system to eliminate the latently infected CD4 pool of cells has to date thwarted successful vaccine development. Moreover, both the initial antibody-inducing vaccine (protein envelope gp120) and cell-mediated vaccine (recombinant adenovirus containing HIV-1 genes) strategies have failed in efficacy trials, and the latter cell-mediated vaccine appeared to have caused enhanced HIV-1 acquisition. Thus basic and translational research to understand why current vaccines have failed and elucidation of new mechanisms of virus control at mucosal surfaces is essential for eventual successful development of a preventive HIV-1 vaccine.

### Innovations in HIV-1 vaccine design [^116a92uB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The field of HIV-1 vaccinology has evolved during the last 30 years from the first viral vector HIV gene insert constructs to vaccination regimens using a myriad of strategies. These strategies now include germline-targeting, lineage-based, and structure-guided immunogen design. This narrative review outlines the historical context of HIV vaccinology and subsequently highlights the scientific discoveries during the last 6 years that promise to propel the field forward.

Methods

We conducted a search of 2 electronic databases, PubMed and EMBASE, for experimental studies that involved new HIV immunogen designs between 2013 and 2019. During the title and abstract reviews, publications were excluded if they were written in language other than English and/or were a letter to the editor, a commentary, or a conference-only presentation. We then used ClinicalTrials.gov to identify completed and ongoing clinical trials using these strategies.

Findings

The HIV vaccinology field has undergone periods of significant growth during the last 3 decades. Findings elucidated in preclinical studies have revealed the importance of the interaction between the cellular and humoral immune system. As a result, several new rationally designed vaccine strategies have been developed and explored in the last 6 years, including native-like envelope trimers, nanoparticle, and mRNA vaccine design strategies among others. Several of these strategies have shown enough promise in animal models to progress toward first-in-human Phase I clinical trials.

Implications

Rapid developments in preclinical and early-phase clinical studies suggest that a tolerable and effective HIV vaccine may be on the horizon.

### HIV-1 immunogen: an overview of almost 30 years of clinical testing of a candidate therapeutic vaccine [^113nyByq]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although current antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV infection into a chronic, manageable disease, ART does not cure HIV infection. Furthermore, the majority of the world's infected individuals live in resource-limited countries in which access to ART is limited. Thus, the development of an effective therapeutic HIV vaccine would be an invaluable treatment alternative.

Areas Covered

Developed by the late Dr. Jonas Salk, HIV-1 Immunogen (Remune®) is a candidate therapeutic vaccine that has been studied in thousands of HIV-infected individuals in more than a dozen clinical trials during almost three decades. This Drug Evaluation, which summarizes the results of these trials that have shown the vaccine to be safe and immunogenic, also discusses the contradictory and controversial conclusions drawn from the phases 2, 2/3 and 3 trials that assessed the clinical efficacy of this vaccine.

Expert Opinion

Given the lack of unequivocal clinical benefits of HIV-1 Immunogen despite almost 30 years of extensive testing, it does not appear, in our view, that this vaccine is a clinically effective immunotherapy. However, inclusion of this vaccine in the newly proposed 'Kick/Shock and Kill' strategy for HIV eradication, or use as a prophylactic vaccine, could be considered for future trials.

### Cost effectiveness and delivery study for future HIV vaccines [^113biVMM]. AIDS (2005). Low credibility.

The survey assesses challenges and opportunities for future country-level HIV vaccination strategies, providing data on the vaccine characteristics (e.g. vaccine efficacies for susceptibility, infectiousness and disease progression) and vaccination programme strategies to be considered in the cost-effectiveness modeling analyses. The study will provide decision-makers with modeling data on vaccination policy considerations that will assist in developing country-level capacities for future HIV vaccine policy adoption and effective delivery systems, and will help delineate the long-term financial requirements for sustainable HIV vaccination programmes. The WHO-UNAIDS HIV Vaccine Initiative and the collaborating researchers welcome comments or questions from policy makers, health professionals and other stakeholders in the public and private sectors about this effort to help advance policy and capacity related to future potential HIV vaccines.

### Challenges in the development of an HIV-1 vaccine [^115aqA32]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

The development of a safe and effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 vaccine is a critically important global health priority. Despite recent advances in our understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis and immunology, however, major scientific obstacles remain. Prototype HIV-1 vaccine candidates aimed at eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses have so far failed to protect against HIV-1 infection or to reduce viral loads after infection in clinical efficacy studies. A renewed and coordinated commitment to basic discovery research, preclinical studies and clinical trials will therefore be required to overcome the hurdles currently facing the field. Here I review key challenges and future prospects in the quest to develop a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine.

### Lessons for the HIV response from structural innovations catalysed by COVID-19 [^111ZUc5B]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

A new mechanism for vaccine roll out

The most prominent component of the ACT Accelerator, the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative, is also unlikely to serve as a meaningful model for eventual roll out of future HIV prevention, treatment and cure breakthroughs, if only because COVAX fell badly short of its goals. The HIV response has already developed commodity procurement and supply management mechanisms, as well as facilities and community systems to reach the adolescents and adults who will likely be targeted by early HIV vaccination campaigns or further HIV treatment innovations. However, the failure of lessons learnt from HIV to ensure rapid, equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments poses questions regarding the confidence we can have in the ability to roll out future HIV biomedical innovations. Mechanisms to ensure equitable access to essential health technologies remains work in progress, underscoring the need for further efforts by the global community to build systems for rapid roll out.

The ability of COVAX and the broader ACT Accelerator to drive rapid, effective action suffered as a result of the global community's failure to mobilise the resources needed to ensure a globally equitable response to COVID-19. This should be of deep concern for the HIV response, which is already experiencing a reduction in international and domestic investments, leaving the response at least US$ 8 billion short of amounts needed to end AIDS by 2030. More effectively making the case for the value of HIV investments, identifying new sources of financing and galvanising investments whose benefits extend beyond individual health silos are key priorities for the HIV response.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — people with HIV should receive routine HPV vaccination using the 9-valent inactivated recombinant vaccine (Gardasil 9, Merck). Routine HPV vaccination is recommended for people with HIV. Ideally, the series should be initiated at age 11 or 12 years but may be started as early as age 9 years. For all people with HIV who are aged 13 to 26 years and who were not vaccinated previously, regardless of sex, administer three doses of the recombinant HPV nonavalent vaccine (Gardasil 9) at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months (AIII). The two-dose series is not recommended for people with HIV. Shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for people with HIV who are aged 27 to 45 years and who were not adequately vaccinated previously (AIII). At present, vaccination with commercially available HPV vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy (CIII). For people who have completed a vaccination series with the recombinant HPV bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, some experts would consider additional vaccination with recombinant HPV nonavalent vaccine, but data are lacking for defining the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach (CIII).

The immediate challenge for prevention research is to determine how to deploy the highly effective prevention tools already available (or nearly available) to ensure effective coverage among women who are at a substantial risk of infection. Evaluation of new biomedical tools including preventive vaccines will of course be required in the longer term if the goal of eradicating HIV infection is to become a reality. To maximize the impact of available and emerging technologies in the near future, equal priority must be given to efficacy and implementation research. Below, we outline key considerations for research in both of these areas.

### Human immunodeficiency virus antibodies and the vaccine problem [^111kb8c3]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the great advances made in controlling human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection with antiretroviral drug treatment, a safe and efficacious HIV vaccine has yet to be developed. Here, we discuss why clinical trials and vaccine development for HIV have so far been disappointing, with an emphasis on the lack of protective antibodies. We review approaches for developing appropriate HIV immunogens and the stimulation of long-lasting B-cell responses with antibody maturation. We conclude that candidate reagents in the pipeline for HIV vaccine development are unlikely to be particularly effective. Although the major funders of HIV vaccine research and development are placing increasing emphasis on clinical product development, a genuine breakthrough in preventing HIV infection through vaccines is more likely to come from novel immunogen research.

This article reviews recent changes in the design of HIV-I vaccine. The safety information for current vaccines has been established, and future ethical considerations are reviewed. Of recent significance, gp120 envelope vaccines are being combined with canarypox vectors in an effort to elicit a broad immune response. This will probably be the aim of future research for an ever-growing problem. A total of 10 143 AIDS cases have occurred in the USA in the year 2000.(1) The international burden is grimmer. For example, approximately 13% of South Africans between 20 and 64 years old are HIV positive. Predictions estimate this number to rise to almost 30% by 2010.(2) With many different HIV serotypes, a worldwide effective HIV vaccine is not in the near future.(3) However, the scientific community has bolstered its effort by strengthening resources and developing national and international collaboration groups focused in developing a safe and effective HIV vaccine.

### Rational antibody-based HIV-1 vaccine design: current approaches and future directions [^112uLxFw]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Many antiviral vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies as a correlate of protection. For HIV, given the huge variability of the virus, it is widely believed that the induction of a broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) response will be crucial in a successful vaccine against the virus. Unfortunately, despite many efforts, the development of an immunogen that elicits bNAbs remains elusive. However, recent structural studies of HIV-1 Env proteins, generation of novel bNAbs, maturation of technologies for the isolation of further antibodies, insights into the requirements for antibody-mediated protection, and novel vaccination approaches are providing grounds for renewed optimism.

Thus, any new TB vaccine should be evaluated in clinical trials to determine the effect of HIV coinfection on vaccine effectiveness. To reduce the severity of TB epidemics, we recommend that developing and deploying vaccines that act as both pre- and postexposure vaccines are necessary to simultaneously attack both sources that drive the TB rate. Additionally, maintaining high rates of detection and treatment of tuberculosis is necessary, as recommended by the World Health Organization; by combining treatment and vaccination strategies, eradicating TB epidemics may be possible, as we have previously shown.

Our results have implications for designing both TB vaccines and vaccination campaigns. Highly effective vaccines will be needed to have the public health impact that we have shown (i.e. to reduce the TB death rate by one third). Whether or not the vaccines currently in development will afford this level of efficacy remains to be seen. Moreover, vaccines will need to provide very long-lasting immunity; our current analysis examines the effect of fairly long-lasting vaccines (10–30 years average duration of immunity). Different types of vaccines have different durations of immunity. For example, DNA vaccines should provide lifelong immunity, whereas subunit vaccines will likely require booster vaccinations, an approach that would be more logistically difficult and expensive. Also, we have shown that preexposure vaccines are best if they prevent infection (mechanism 1) rather than allow infection but reduce the probability of fast progression to disease (mechanism 2) or reduce the rate of progression of latently infections to disease (mechanism 3). Whether or not new TB vaccines will prevent infection from occurring is not known, but BCG is clearly not able to prevent infection, and vaccines currently in development will likely not be able to do so either. As new TB vaccines and other control strategies become available, their potential benefits to TB control efforts can be evaluated by mathematical modeling. Mathematical models can be used as health policy tools to evaluate strategies for controlling TB; mathematical models also provide insights for predicting the potential public health impact of imperfect HIV vaccines. Our results show that, because of the complex pathogenic process of TB, high-incidence epidemics are unlikely to be substantially reduced by widely deploying highly effective preexposure or postexposure vaccines. We suggest that to achieve global control of TB, developing a single TB vaccine that functions as both a pre- and a postexposure vaccine is necessary.

### New hope for an AIDS vaccine [^112CFsNH]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2002). Medium credibility.

The twenty-first century has begun with considerable success for new AIDS vaccines in macaque models. A common feature of these vaccines is their ability to induce high-frequency CD8+ T-cell responses that control, rather than prevent, infection with HIV. The new vaccines, which include DNA vaccines and live viral vectors, are based on technologies that have been developed since the start of the AIDS epidemic. The ultimate promise of these vaccines will be realized only when efficacy trials in humans are conducted.

Opportunities for improvement

It is also important to acknowledge limitations present in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, by the US Government. The rapid successful development and subsequent approval of multiple vaccines precluded formal evaluation of long-term relative efficacy of different vaccines and combinations, large-scale randomized placebo-controlled trials of new vaccines, and studies in naive populations. Moreover, there was little time to optimize vaccine doses and schedules, and therefore challenges remain in determining ideal vaccine dosing intervals and how to maximize durability. Over time the relevance of vaccine efficacy in naive populations waned as did the importance of vaccine efficacy against earlier circulating viruses in this dynamic pandemic. More studies are needed that include higher proportions of special populations, such as people living with HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients, cancer patients on chemotherapy, pregnant women, and children. The timely inclusion of some of these more vulnerable populations could have better-informed vaccine strategies for wider benefit. Learning from these limitations will strengthen strategies in vaccine development for HIV and future pandemics.

### Prevention, treatment and cure of HIV infection [^115C2Fy8]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

The development of antiretroviral therapy for the prevention and treatment of HIV infection has been marked by a series of remarkable successes. However, the efforts to develop a vaccine have largely failed, and efforts to discover a cure are only now beginning to gain traction. In this Review, we describe recent progress on all fronts - pre-exposure prophylaxis, vaccines, treatment and cure - and we discuss the unmet needs, both current and in the coming years. We describe the emerging arsenal of drugs, biologics and strategies that will hopefully address these needs. Although HIV research has largely been siloed in the past, this is changing, as the emerging research agenda is marked by multiple cross-discipline synergies and collaborations. As the limitations of antiretroviral drugs as a means to truly end the epidemic are becoming more apparent, there is a great need for continued efforts to develop an effective preventative vaccine and a scalable cure, both of which remain formidable challenges.

### The role of correlates of protection in overcoming barriers to vaccine development and demonstrating efficacy [^11479DfY]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Licenced vaccines have traditionally been designed empirically, and achieved authorisation through RCT's based on clinical endpoints to demonstrate efficacy. However, such approaches are not always feasible and have not been successful against more technically challenging targets such as HIV. Alternative approaches to inform rationale vaccine design, demonstrating effectiveness and increasing probabilities of success are needed to stop new products stalling in development, and leaving vulnerable populations at risk of morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases.

Developing new methods to define protective immune responses, coupled with commitment to post-introduction studies to ensure safety and effectiveness, has the potential to improve our understanding of protective immunity in target populations which in turn will inform vaccine design, development and use.

Without new approaches to develop vaccines, many communities will continue to bear the burden of infectious diseases and are exposed to the risk of infectious diseases escalating. The COVID-19 pandemic reminded us all of the devastating impact infectious diseases can have on our lives, and whilst multiple vaccines were rapidly developed for this disease, new vaccines are still needed to prevent death and disability caused by endemic diseases such as TB, and to be prepared for future outbreaks. Given the growing threats to controlling infectious diseases such as climate change and antimicrobial resistance, it is important to act now to ensure that we are better prepared to tackle infectious diseases that affect everyone now and in the future.

### Exploring synergies between B-and T-cell vaccine approaches to optimize immune responses against HIV-workshop report [^1134BzFB]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Why are combination vaccine approaches necessary?

There are many challenges to the design and development of a broadly effective HIV vaccine. Chief among them are HIV's genetic variability and the virus's extensive immune evasion tactics.

Over the past four decades researchers have pursued multiple vaccine strategies to address these challenges, including the most recent large-scale efficacy trials of epitope mosaic vaccine candidates designed specifically to address HIV's extraordinary global diversity. None of the vaccine regimens tested to date have induced broad and durable protection. Out of nine HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials completed so far, only one demonstrated correlates of protection. The only trial that showed a small degree of estimated efficacy in reducing HIV-1 transmission (31.2%) was the RV144 HIV-1 (NCT00223080) trial of the CRFAE_01 canarypox/gp120 vaccine in Thailand. However, of three phase IIb/III clinical trials designed to improve on the RV144 trial — HIV-1 Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) 702 (NCT02968849), HVTN 705 (NCT03060629) and HVTN 706 (NCT03964415), none showed significant efficacy, suggesting that the RV144 trial may not have been a harbinger of vaccine success.

Meanwhile, results from the recently completed Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) trials showed that passive administration of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) with sufficient specificity can protect against HIV infection by neutralization-sensitive strains when serum antibody levels were present at high enough concentration. The AMP results provide an important proof of concept for the role of bNAbs in protecting against HIV. Thus, for HIV-1, the induction of antibodies that broadly protect against heterologous HIV-1 strains is a prime goal of HIV-1 vaccine development. The results suggest a high bar for protective immunity through bNAbs alone, according to Shane Crotty of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, who provided opening remarks at the workshop.

Preclinical studies corroborate this. It has been shown that vaccine-elicited antibodies can protect 90% of non-human primates (NHPs) against rectal challenge with an simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), but only at high titers of circulating neutralizing antibodies (greater than 1:500).

### HIV vaccines: current status worldwide and in Africa [^114zYULe]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

Since HIV-1 was identified, development of a preventive vaccine has been a major goal. Significant progress toward that goal has been made by 2010. In macaques, a vigorous T effector cell response has protected some animals from disease caused by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Broadly, neutralizing human anti-HIV antibodies have been isolated and their structures, and targets are rapidly being elucidated. For the first time an AIDS vaccine has shown modest protective efficacy in a human clinical trial. To reach the final goal, there is a need for a coordinated global effort, including a range of approaches including novel high-throughput screening techniques, X-ray crystallography, and monoclonal antibody isolation, analysis of T cell responses and their impact on disease progression, human epidemiology, as well as targeted studies in nonhuman primates. African research teams as well as cohorts of healthy volunteers and HIV-infected individuals have contributed to HIV vaccine research and development in many important ways. It is essential that this work continue to speed the development and deployment of a vaccine suitable for African populations.

### Future access to HIV vaccines. report from a WHO-UNAIDS consultation, Geneva, 2–3 October 2000 [^115pRUWY]. AIDS (2001). Low credibility.

Results from the first phase III efficacy trial of an HIV vaccine will be available within the next 2–3 years. Thus, it is imperative to start planning now to address how any effective vaccines should be used. In the absence of definitive information on the characteristics of the first generation of HIV vaccines, the following assumptions were made: the vaccine will (i) have only low to moderate efficacy (on the order of 50%); (ii) not be inexpensive (on the order of 10 to 30 US $ per dose); (iii) require multiple doses; and, (iv) at least initially, be available in limited quantities. A vaccine with that profile would not be suitable for general use in all countries, and it might have to be initially targeted to populations at higher risk of HIV infection. These populations will differ from region to region, according to the epidemiological situation. In most high and middle income countries potential target groups for an initial HIV immunization programme would include intravenous drug users, gay men, commercial sex workers, and high-risk heterosexuals, as well as healthcare workers exposed to blood. In sub-Saharan Africa, future HIV immunization programmes might include larger segments of the population. In order to plan future vaccination programmes it is important to estimate the need (size of target population) and the demand (uptake in target populations) for future HIV vaccines. In addition to the public sector demand for an HIV vaccine (to be used in public health programmes), there will also be a private sector demand driven by the willingness and ability of individuals and employers to pay for the vaccine. HIV vaccines would need to be delivered as part of comprehensive HIV prevention packages, including behavioral and health promotion interventions. This would be especially important with vaccines of moderate efficacy, in order to prevent increased risk behavior among vaccine recipients. To avoid false expectations, the vaccine message would need to be recast as part of the total prevention strategy, rather than the "magic bullet" that people have come to expect. Initial deployment of HIV vaccines could proceed through targeted vaccination campaigns, drawing from experience with other vaccines. These campaigns would be complex and expensive, and would require full participation and collaboration from all levels of the community, as well as considerable strengthening of the infrastructures required for vaccine delivery. Current candidate vaccines in phase III trials may not be appropriate for much of Africa and South Asia, two areas most in need of an HIV vaccine. Credible international efforts ("push and pull" mechanisms) are needed to create incentives for the industry to develop vaccines for these regions. Feasible financing mechanisms may have to be established to cover the cost of production and delivery of vaccines, in order to ensure equitable access to HIV vaccines around the world. In parallel to the deployment of the initial vaccine, additional bridging studies and effectiveness trials may be needed to expand vaccine use. Research should also continue at an increased pace to develop new generations of more effective vaccines, especially vaccines appropriate to Africa. Achieving these goals will require real political commitment from government and international organizations, to be materialized in specific actions and budget allocations. The daunting challenge of making future effective vaccines accessible to all populations in need will require a sustained collaborative effort on the part of all parties involved.

### Emerging infectious diseases: a 10-year perspective from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [^111oSNfx]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The greatest challenge in HIV/AIDS research remains developing a vaccine that can either prevent the transmission of the virus or, failing that, halt progression to AIDS. Since 1987, NIAID has funded > 70 clinical trials evaluating > 50 different HIV vaccine candidates. Unfortunately, the first large-scale phase 3 trial of an HIV vaccine reported in 2003 had disappointing results. Many different vaccine strategies, including viral and bacterial vectors, DNA vaccines, viruslike particle vaccines, and peptide vaccines are being investigated, and ≈15 clinical trials in humans are under way. The effects of various adjuvants and different routes of administration also are being tested.

HIV vaccine developers face formidable scientific obstacles, including the virus's genetic diversity and the lack of a clear understanding of the correlates of protective immunity in HIV infection. A critical and so far elusive milestone is the discovery of a stable and immunogenic conformational epitope of the HIV envelope that would elicit broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies against primary isolates of HIV. To overcome these challenges, collaborations involving government, academia, industry, and philanthropies and new cross-sector partnerships such as the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise, a virtual consortium of independent organizations, are being established to advance HIV vaccine research and foster greater collaboration among HIV vaccine researchers worldwide.

CONCLUSIONS

HIV and its subsequent prevention and surveillance continue to pose major challenges to reducing the burden of disease around the world. Future research should focus on identifying geographic trends in sampling studies over time, and how the use of various subtyping tools affects observed prevalence. Among the hurdles facing HIV vaccine development is the global HIV-1 genetic diversity, where recombinants (CRFs and URFs) now constitute the highest proportion of circulating HIV while continuing to increase in prevalence. Ideally, a globally effective HIV vaccine will need to prevent the most prevalent subtypes and recombinants. Given the dynamic nature of HIV-1, coupled with the continuous migration of populations and increases in international transmission events, similar meta-analyses should be periodically carried out.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — people with HIV: The Panel recommends that people with HIV receive a three-dose series (0, 1–2, and 6 months) because their immune response to vaccination might be attenuated (AIII), and catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for people with HIV aged 13 to 26 years (AIII). Although routine vaccination beyond age 26 is not recommended, shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for adults aged 27 to 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated and are at risk for a new HPV infection (AIII). For patients previously vaccinated with recombinant bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, some experts would give an additional full series (three doses) of the 9-valent vaccine (CIII), however no data exist to define who might benefit or how cost-effective this approach might be.

### Immunology and the elusive AIDS vaccine [^113TyP1P]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Developing a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine is critical to end the global acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, but many question whether this goal is achievable. Natural immunity is not protective, and despite immunogenicity of HIV vaccine candidates, human trials have exclusively yielded disappointing results. Nevertheless, there is an indication that success may be possible, but this will be dependent on understanding the antiviral immune response in unprecedented depth to identify and engineer the types of immunity required. Here we outline fundamental immunological questions that need to be answered to develop a protective HIV vaccine, and the immediate need to harness a much broader scientific community to achieve this goal.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^114ASM89]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Preventing disease — COVID-19 vaccination for children with HIV: COVID-19 vaccination effectively prevents severe outcomes such as hospitalization and post-acute COVID-19 syndromes in children, and while vaccine effectiveness wanes over time, protection against severe disease (ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death) is more durable; several successive formulations of COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and approved or authorized for use by the FDA to best target circulating variants. In the United States, COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for children aged ≥ 6 months since June 2022, and clinical trials evaluating COVID-19 vaccines in infants < 6 months of age are ongoing; although no COVID-19 vaccines are yet approved for children < 6 months of age, maternal immunization during pregnancy has been shown to increase antibody transfer and provide protection to infants for the first 6 months of life. All children with HIV aged ≥ 6 months should receive age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccines, including updated vaccines as part of routine prevention, regardless of CD4 T lymphocyte cell count or viral load (AII), and household members and close contacts of children with HIV aged ≥ 6 months should also receive COVID-19 vaccines to prevent exposure to the child (AIII).

### Vaccines: underlying principles of design and testing [^114ZpcQf]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

HIV immunogen design encompasses all the factors mentioned above. As noted, natural history studies of HIV have shown that HIV readily escapes from humoral immunity. Moreover, relative to other viral infections, the induction of bNAbs is rare. 73 When detected, HIV bNAbs typically exhibit extensive somatic hypermutation, which is very difficult to recapitulate with a single vaccine and vaccine immunogen. Although HIV also escapes from CD8+ T cell immunity, CD8+ T cells targeting regions of HIV that exhibit lower diversity (conserved) experience less escape most likely because virus mutation in these regions exerts a fitness cost on the virus. 74 Parallel strategies are therefore being pursued to develop preventative HIV vaccines that target both humoral and CD8+ T cell immunity. As expected, humoral vaccine strategies target the surface Envelope protein of HIV. However, different strategies are being taken to approach HIV diversity and generate bNAbs (reviewed in ref. 75). These include sequential vaccination with different immunogens to precisely direct B cells to generate bNAbs, using previously defined bNAbs as templates for trimer immunogens, and using glycans to mask irrelevant epitopes that prevent the induction of non‐neutralizing antibodies. HIV T cell immunogens are largely comprised of conserved and immunogenic regions of HIV, predominately from Gag. These designs mostly exclude the highly variable regions in Envelope and Nef proteins. 76, 77 The challenge to T cell immunogen design is to elicit high frequencies of T cells targeting multiple regions of HIV (described as breadth) to increase the chance that vaccine‐induced T cells will (i) recognize the infecting virus and (ii) be able to detect and clear virus‐infected cells prior to escape. To date, T cell vaccines have induced insufficient breadth to overcome HIV diversity. 78 The development of an efficacious HIV vaccine remains one of the greatest challenges in modern medicine.

### HIV diagnostics and vaccines: It takes two to tango [^112yCMCH]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Current serologic tests for HIV screening and confirmation of infection present challenges to the adoption of HIV vaccines. The detection of vaccine-induced HIV-1 antibodies in the absence of HIV-1 infection, referred to as vaccine-induced seropositivity/seroreactivity, confounds the interpretation of test results, causing misclassification of HIV-1 status with potential affiliated stigmatization. For HIV vaccines to be widely adopted with high community confidence and uptake, tests are needed that are agnostic to the vaccination status of tested individuals (ie, positive only for true HIV-1 infection). Successful development and deployment of such tests will require HIV vaccine developers to work in concert with diagnostic developers. Such tests will need to match today's high-performance standards (accuracy, cost-effectiveness, simplicity) for use in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, especially in low- and middle-income countries with high HIV burden. Herein, we discuss the challenges and strategies for developing modified serologic HIV tests for concurrent deployment with HIV vaccines.

Development of a safe and effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine is a persistent challenge despite decades of research. Previous strategies utilizing protein subunit and viral vector vaccines were safe but not protective. Current strategies seek to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies, with multiple early phase trials in progress seeking to achieve this through sequential vaccination, mRNA, or updated viral-vectored vaccines. A safe and effective vaccine is critical to ending the HIV epidemic.

### Measuring the public-health impact of candidate HIV vaccines as part of the licensing process [^114jMAb2]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

The full impact of vaccines against infectious diseases is manifest at both the individual and the community levels. We argue that evaluating the community-level impact of HIV vaccine candidates should be an integral part of the licensing process. We describe a framework for the public-health evaluation of an HIV vaccine, which is based on the interactive use of mathematical models and community randomised clinical trials (C-RCTs) following completion of individual-based clinical trials (I-RCTs). Mathematical models of HIV vaccine can be used to take public-health considerations into account during the licensing process and can also help to select promising vaccine candidates for testing in C-RCTs. We also describe community and individual-based measures useful for defining public-health criteria necessary to guide the licensing process. To move forward, it is crucial to reach a consensus on what should constitute adequate public-health criteria. At the very least, a suitable vaccine would provide some individual benefit to vaccinees and not be detrimental to the population at large. In future I-RCTs and C-RCTs, quantifying each protective vaccine characteristic (eg, reductions in susceptibility or viral load) is important if regulators are to evaluate adequately the potential community-level impact of the vaccine across different settings, populations, and conditions of use.

### New concepts in HIV-1 vaccine development [^116zH4xK]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

With 2 million people newly infected with HIV-1 in 2014, an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a major public health priority. HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials in humans, complemented by active and passive immunization studies in non-human primates, have identified several key vaccine-induced immunological responses that may correlate with protection against HIV-1 infection. Potential correlates of protection in these studies include V2-specific, polyfunctional, and broadly neutralizing antibody responses, as well as effector memory T cell responses. Here we review how these correlates of protection are guiding current approaches to HIV-1 vaccine development. These approaches include improvements on the ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX B/E vaccine regimen used in the RV144 clinical trial in Thailand, adenovirus serotype 26 vectors with gp140 boosting, intravenous infusions of bNAbs, and replicating viral vectors.

### Strategies for HIV-1 vaccines that induce broadly neutralizing antibodies [^112PdRyn]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2023). High credibility.

After nearly four decades of research, a safe and effective HIV-1 vaccine remains elusive. There are many reasons why the development of a potent and durable HIV-1 vaccine is challenging, including the extraordinary genetic diversity of HIV-1 and its complex mechanisms of immune evasion. HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins are poorly recognized by the immune system, which means that potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are only infrequently induced in the setting of HIV-1 infection or through vaccination. Thus, the biology of HIV-1-host interactions necessitates novel strategies for vaccine development to be designed to activate and expand rare bnAb-producing B cell lineages and to select for the acquisition of critical improbable bnAb mutations. Here we discuss strategies for the induction of potent and broad HIV-1 bnAbs and outline the steps that may be necessary for ultimate success.

### Research priorities for an HIV cure: International Aids Society global scientific strategy 2021 [^116WzjFU]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV, lifelong treatment is required and there is no cure. HIV can integrate in the host genome and persist for the life span of the infected cell. These latently infected cells are not recognized as foreign because they are largely transcriptionally silent, but contain replication-competent virus that drives resurgence of the infection once ART is stopped. With a combination of immune activators, neutralizing antibodies, and therapeutic vaccines, some nonhuman primate models have been cured, providing optimism for these approaches now being evaluated in human clinical trials. In vivo delivery of gene-editing tools to either target the virus, boost immunity or protect cells from infection, also holds promise for future HIV cure strategies. In this Review, we discuss advances related to HIV cure in the last 5 years, highlight remaining knowledge gaps and identify priority areas for research for the next 5 years.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — HIV-specific age recommendation and approval status — states that HPV vaccination is recommended for males and females with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection aged 13 through 26 years (AIII). Current data do not support vaccination for those older than 26 years, and HPV vaccines are not approved for use in men or women older than 26 years, and women with HIV infection who have been vaccinated should also have routine cervical cancer screening because the vaccine does not prevent all HPV types that may be precursors to cervical cancer, and because the vaccine may be less effective in women with HIV infection (especially those with low CD4 cell counts) than in women without HIV infection. HPV vaccination prevents initial HPV infection and is ideally administered before sexual exposure to HPV.

### HIV vaccine efficacy trials: towards the future of HIV prevention [^114zJbPx]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Past efficacy trials of HIV vaccines have attempted to generate neutralizing antibodies. With the failure of these trials to demonstrate protection, the focus for HIV vaccine development has shifted to inducing a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response (CTL). A CTL response is not expected to produce sterilizing immunity, but may delay progression to AIDS or reduce the transmission of HIV. Adenovirus vector-based regimens that induce CTLs are currently in efficacy trial testing. These efficacy trials are using surrogate end points in an innovative Phase 2B trial design.

### The challenges of host and viral diversity in HIV vaccine design [^1124rAgr]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Rational HIV vaccine design is crucially dependent on a number of factors, including a detailed understanding of the immune responses that control infection in individuals that have non-progressing disease, the impact of host genetics on these responses, and the degree of immunological cross-reactivity between the vaccine immunogen and the encountered virus antigens. Significant progress has been made in a number of these areas over the past five years, which might help in the generation of a more effective immunogen design and will provide opportunities for novel vaccine delivery options. However, the understanding of immune response(s) that can mediate protection from infection or, if infection ensues, that slow the rate of HIV disease progression is still incomplete and will require detailed studies in unprecedentedly large populations infected with different HIV clades, combining advances in virology, immunology, human host genetics and bioinformatics analyses for the optimal design of vaccine immunogens.

### Role of immune mechanisms in induction of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies [^115tqARx]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Although antibodies can be elicited by HIV-1 infection or immunization, those that are broadly neutralizing (bnAbs) are undetectable in most individuals, and when they do arise in HIV-1 infection, only do so years after transmission. Until recently, the reasons for difficulty in inducing such bnAbs have been obscure. Recent technological advances in isolating bnAbs from rare patients have increased our knowledge of their specificities and features, and along with gene-targeting studies, have also begun uncovering evidence of immunoregulatory roadblocks preventing their induction. One crucial avenue towards developing an effective HIV-1 vaccine is to harness this emerging information into the rational design of immunogens and formulation of adjuvants, such that structural and immunological hurdles to routinely eliciting bnAbs can be overcome.

The vaccine is described as safe and highly effective in preventing infection with HPV subtypes associated with genital warts and those responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers, though the efficacy data for people with HIV are limited with mixed results. One study reported that when HPV vaccination was given to those with HIV at an older age but < 45 years anal dysplasia was reduced. All persons with HIV should receive 3, rather than 2, doses of vaccine, regardless of age.

Introduction

The HIV-1 epidemic persists despite tremendous gains in understanding HIV-1 biology in addition to the use of antiretroviral medications to treat and prevent infections. As of 2020, 38 million people globally were living with HIV-1 with approximately 1·7 million new infections occurring annually. Despite decades of research, only seven late phase 2b and phase 3 HIV-1 vaccine clinical trials have occurred, with the RV144 trial (NCT00223080) resulting in the highest measurable vaccine efficacy of 31·2% after three years. This highlights the need for an effective HIV-1 vaccine capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to prevent infection from the diverse set of natural viral isolates. Induction of bnAbs through active immunization is a main goal of an effective HIV vaccine but will require innovative concepts for both vaccine regimen and immunogen design.

The HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein trimer, composed of gp120 and gp41 heterodimers, is essential for mediating viral entry into the host cell and is the principal antibody target for HIV-1. The first efficacy trials of HIV-1 vaccines designed to induce humoral protection (VAX 004, NCT00002441; VAX 003, NCT00006327) evaluated monomeric recombinant Env gp120 subunit vaccines. While these vaccines were safe and elicited neutralizing antibodies in clinical trials, the vaccine-induced antibody responses did not prevent HIV-1 infection. The failure of these vaccines in eliciting protective bnAbs can be attributed to a myriad of HIV-1 immune evasion strategies, including antigenic diversification during replication and the dense shield of surface glycans on Env preventing exposure of critical antigenic epitopes to the immune system. The Env trimer is moreover structurally dynamic, and its various conformations elicit distinct antibody responses. The closed prefusion conformation is recognized by potent bnAbs, whereas antibodies targeting regions exposed in the open conformation induced by CD4 binding (CD4-induced epitopes) are weakly or non-neutralizing and ineffective at preventing infection.

### HIV-1 vaccine clinical trials: the Brazilian experience [^116faZhZ]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

Although the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine has proved very challenging for more than two decades, it remains the best hope to control the HIV pandemic. Since Brazil has particular epidemiological features, as well as adequate policies and infrastructure, the country has been an interesting site for HIV vaccine trials. Since 1995, eight trials were performed in Brazil enrolling over 2000 subjects. Peptide vaccine candidates were initially designed to elicit neutralising antibodies as an attempt to provide sterilising immunity against HIV-1. This strategy, however, has proved extremely difficult, and candidates were poorly immunogenic. Therefore, the next vaccine candidates focused mainly on the induction of cell mediated immune responses that would limit AIDS progression and transmission by suppressing viremia. Such candidates were naked DNA or viral vectors in either prophylactic or therapeutic approaches. Even though several candidates were immunogenic, protective immune responses against HIV-1 remain to be achieved. However, several studies with non-human primates and human elite controllers demonstrate that effective immune responses against HIV-1 may be elicited, supporting the belief that an HIV-1 vaccine is possible. Much has been learned, and now the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine requires resetting priorities with focus on basic research, considering the merits of neutralising antibodies and CMI, as well as the role of innate immunity on HIV-1 protection. In this new perspective, large-scale trials should be replaced by smaller preliminary efficacy studies.

### Lessons learned from HIV-1 vaccine trials: new priorities and directions [^114haToj]. Nature Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

A vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seems to be on the horizon. Correlates of risk of infection for the RV144 vaccine trial have been found. There is understanding of what makes HIV envelope-specific antibodies broadly neutralizing and new T cell vaccine approaches can overcome virus variability.

### HIV / AIDS vaccines: 2018 [^115QPnAL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has infected 76 million people and killed an estimated 35 million. During its 40-year history, remarkable progress has been made on antiretroviral drugs. Progress toward a vaccine has also been made, although this has yet to deliver a licensed product. In 2007, I wrote a review, HIV AIDS Vaccines: 2007. This review, HIV AIDS Vaccines: 2018, focuses on the progress in the past 11 years. I begin with key challenges for the development of an AIDS vaccine and the lessons learned from the six completed efficacy trials, only one of which has met with some success.

### Clinical recommendation for the use of injectable lenacapavir as HIV preexposure prophylaxis-United States, 2025… [^117W23fG]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

HIV preexposure prophylaxis reduces HIV incidence; however, adherence to available PrEP regimens is suboptimal. In June 2025, FDA approved injectable lenacapavir administered every 6 months as HIV PrEP, based on results from two randomized controlled trials that reported LEN efficacy at reducing HIV infection as 100% among females and 96% among a primarily male trial population over a follow-up of 52 weeks. The two trials reported LEN efficacy at reducing HIV infection as 100% among females and 96% among a primarily male trial population, compared with the estimated background HIV incidence over a follow-up of 52 weeks. No significant safety concerns were identified in the trials. The most common adverse events were mild to moderate injection site reactions. The trial's primary efficacy analysis compared HIV infection incidence in the LEN group with background HIV incidence in the screened population.

The secondary efficacy analysis compared HIV infection incidence in the LEN group with the TDF/FTC group. No new HIV infections occurred among females receiving injectable LEN over 52 weeks of follow-up. Within this group, LEN was 100% efficacious compared with no use of PrEP and with TDF/FTC. In this study, LEN was 96% efficacious in preventing HIV infection compared with no PrEP use and 89% efficacious compared with TDF/FTC. Top Conclusion and Future Research LEN is a highly effective and safe PrEP option administered every 6 months, which provides the potential to improve PrEP adherence and thus enhance HIV prevention in the United States.

Additional research is needed to understand LEN's effectiveness in persons who inject drugs, its ability to inhibit early viral replication if a person receiving PrEP becomes infected, the potential for emergence of resistance, safety and efficacy over longer follow-up periods, acceptability, and optimal strategies for implementation in clinical and community settings.

### Improved outlook on HIV-1 prevention and vaccine development [^114htWje]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The development of an effective vaccine against HIV-1 has been challenging but recent advances in both the HIV prevention landscape and the partial efficacy of the recent RV144 vaccine efficacy trial in Thailand provide hope for an improved arsenal of approaches to prevent HIV-1 transmission.

Areas Covered

This review describes recent advances in HIV-1 prevention such as circumcision, microbicides and pre-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral therapy, but focuses mainly on the current state of HIV-1 vaccine development in the post-RV144 era.

Expert Opinion

The field of HIV-1 vaccine development has been plagued by the unprecedented challenges involved with designing a vaccine effective in preventing transmission of a retrovirus, due in part to sequence diversity, retroviral integration into host chromosomes, establishment of reservoir sites and glycosylation shielding of the HIV-1 envelope. The partial efficacy of the recent RV144 vaccine trial in Thailand may allow for better understanding of immune correlates of infection risk, which could enable iterative improvements to vaccine regimens in the development pipeline. In parallel, a number of promising vaccine strategies incorporating viral vectors, novel immunogens, delivery systems and adjuvants are advancing in clinical development. Vaccine development must occur in parallel with continued advances in HIV-1 prevention.

### Challenges and opportunities for development of an AIDS vaccine [^1111kqx4]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Among the devastating consequences of AIDS has been its epidemic spread in the developing world. The disease has caused unprecedented suffering, debilitation, loss of life and disruption of family, social and economic stability. Because of the considerable expense and logistical difficulty in providing antiviral drugs to populations infected with the human immunodeficiency virus throughout the world, the biomedical community is looking towards vaccines to help solve this compelling problem.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) prevention and recurrence — no measures are available to prevent HZ in children and adolescents with HIV; varicella vaccination reduces the incidence (and perhaps severity) of HZ such that the risk is lower in vaccinated children with HIV than in healthy children or children with HIV who had naturally acquired varicella, and the likelihood of initial or recurrent attacks of HZ is reduced with effective ART. In adults, a live attenuated vaccine (Zoster Vaccine Live, ZVL) and an inactive recombinant vaccine (Recombinant Zoster Vaccine, RZV) have been approved for use in adults aged ≥ 50 years; a large study of the recombinant vaccine in adults with HIV indicated it was safe and induced VZV-specific antibody and cell-mediated immunity in vaccines on ART with CD4 percentage ≥ 15, although there are no efficacy data in adults with HIV, it is frequently administered to adults with HIV who meet these criteria, and this vaccine has not been studied in children.
