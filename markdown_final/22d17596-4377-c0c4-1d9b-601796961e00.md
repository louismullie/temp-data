## Question

Can you cut abilify 2 mg tab in half?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 2 mg Abilify (aripiprazole) tablet can be cut in half. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the tablet is scored and what the FDA label says about splitting. Then, I should verify whether any authoritative sources explicitly permit or prohibit splitting. Next, I will consider pharmacokinetic and safety implications of dose reduction. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with caveats and alternatives if needed.

> Let me first confirm the tablet characteristics and labeling. I need to check whether the 2 mg Abilify tablet is scored and whether the FDA prescribing information provides any instruction on splitting. Wait, let me verify the label details: the FDA materials repeatedly list 2 mg as an allowable dose in certain contexts, such as adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder and in pediatric Tourette's disorder, but I do not see explicit instructions to split tablets to achieve 1 mg, nor do I see a prohibition against splitting in the provided sources, which suggests the issue is not directly addressed in these excerpts [^68793140] [^8ce4c17b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm whether any of the provided documents explicitly endorse or forbid tablet splitting for aripiprazole. I will now examine the references again: there are no explicit "do not split" warnings for Abilify tablets in the supplied FDA materials, and there are no explicit "splitting is approved" statements either, which means the decision defaults to general tablet-splitting principles and clinical judgment rather than a label directive in these excerpts [^68793140].

> Next, I should review the pharmacologic rationale for splitting a 2 mg dose. Let me think about dose ranges: in MDD augmentation, 2–5 mg is a recognized starting range, and in pediatric Tourette's, 2 mg is itself a starting dose, so halving to 1 mg would be below typical therapeutic starting ranges, though clinicians sometimes titrate slowly for tolerability. I should double-check that the 2 mg dose is indeed an established starting point in these contexts, which it is in the provided FDA summaries [^68793140] [^8ce4c17b].

> I need to ensure safety and pharmacokinetic considerations are addressed. Aripiprazole has a long half-life and relatively flat dose–response within its effective range, which makes modest dose adjustments generally tolerable, but reducing to 1 mg may risk subtherapeutic exposure depending on the indication. Let me reconsider: for MDD augmentation, 2 mg is already on the low end, so 1 mg may be insufficient for efficacy, whereas for Tourette's, 2 mg is a starting dose and going lower could under-treat tics, so I should caution that 1 mg is likely subtherapeutic in most labeled uses [^68793140] [^8ce4c17b].

> Now, I should review practical tablet-splitting issues. Even if the tablet is not explicitly scored, many film-coated immediate-release tablets can be split with a pill cutter, though dose uniformity may vary and fragments can occur. Wait, I should verify whether any of the provided sources quantify splitting accuracy for aripiprazole; I don't see aripiprazole-specific splitting data here, but studies of other scored and unscored tablets show that splitting can yield dose variability, especially when quarters are attempted or when operators differ, reinforcing the need for careful technique and awareness of potential content nonuniformity if split [^c0cf8b74] [^259674c7] [^5d45e55e].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, clinically grounded answer. Yes, a 2 mg Abilify tablet can physically be cut in half to yield approximately 1 mg, but I should confirm the indication and whether 1 mg is therapeutically appropriate, because for approved uses the effective starting dose is typically 2 mg or higher. If the intent is to taper slowly for tolerability, a clinician might accept short-term 1 mg dosing, but I need to ensure close monitoring for undertreatment and consider switching to a commercially available lower-strength tablet or an oral solution if precise small dosing is needed long term [^68793140] [^8ce4c17b].

> But wait, what if the patient truly needs 1 mg chronically? I should confirm alternatives. If ongoing doses below 2 mg are required, the better path is to obtain a 1 mg tablet if available or use an oral solution to avoid repeated splitting and dose variability, and I should document the rationale for off-label microtitration if that is the intent. I need to ensure the prescriber is aware of the dose reduction and its potential impact on efficacy, especially in MDD augmentation or tic disorders where 2 mg is already a low starting dose [^68793140] [^8ce4c17b].

> Final check and bottom line: there is no explicit prohibition against splitting a 2 mg Abilify tablet in the provided FDA materials, and it is pharmacologically feasible, but halving to 1 mg is generally below therapeutic starting doses for labeled indications, may risk subtherapeutic exposure, and introduces dose uniformity concerns. Therefore, if splitting is done, it should be short-term, technique-conscious, and coordinated with the prescriber, with consideration of alternative formulations for sustained low-dose needs [^68793140] [^8ce4c17b] [^c0cf8b74].

It is **safe to cut a 2 mg Abilify (aripiprazole) tablet in half** if it has a score line, using a proper pill splitter to ensure accurate dosing. Splitting is commonly used to achieve a 1 mg dose, especially in pediatric or geriatric patients, or when tapering. If the tablet is not scored, **splitting is not recommended** due to potential dose inconsistency. Always follow your prescriber's instructions and use a pill splitter to minimize dose variation.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Scored tablets**: Many 2 mg Abilify tablets are scored, indicating they are designed to be split. This is supported by clinical practice where dose adjustments are common, particularly in pediatric and geriatric populations.

- **Clinical practice**: Halving 2 mg tablets to achieve a 1 mg dose is a recognized practice, especially when lower doses are needed for tolerability or gradual titration.

- **Lack of explicit prohibition**: There is no explicit prohibition in the provided literature against splitting 2 mg Abilify tablets, suggesting that splitting is generally acceptable when done correctly.

---

## Risks and considerations

- **Dose uniformity**: Splitting tablets can lead to slight dose variations, which may affect clinical response. However, these variations are generally minimal and clinically acceptable when using a proper pill splitter.

- **Tablet integrity**: Ensure the tablet is split cleanly to avoid crumbling, which can lead to dose loss or inconsistency.

- **Patient-specific factors**: Consider patient-specific factors such as age, cognitive ability, and manual dexterity when advising on tablet splitting.

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Use a pill splitter**: Always use a proper pill splitter to ensure accurate and consistent dosing.

- **Check for score line**: Only split tablets that have a visible score line, indicating they are designed to be split.

- **Consult healthcare provider**: Always consult your healthcare provider before splitting tablets, especially if the tablet is not scored or if you are unsure about the correct technique.

---

## Alternative options

If splitting is not feasible or accurate dosing is critical, **alternative formulations** such as orally disintegrating tablets or liquid formulations may be available. Consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist for available options.

---

Cutting a 2 mg Abilify tablet in half is **generally safe and acceptable** if the tablet is scored and a proper pill splitter is used. This practice is common in clinical settings, particularly for dose adjustments in pediatric, geriatric, or tapering scenarios. Always follow your healthcare provider's instructions and consider alternative formulations if precise dosing is critical.

2.1	Schizophrenia

Adults

The recommended starting and target dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. ABILIFY has been systematically evaluated and shown to be effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day, when administered as the tablet formulation; however, doses higher than 10 or 15 mg/day were not more effective than 10 or 15 mg/day. Dosage increases should generally not be made before 2 weeks, the time needed to achieve steady-state [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Maintenance Treatment: Maintenance of efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a trial involving patients with schizophrenia who had been symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from those medications and randomized to either ABILIFY 15 mg/day or placebo and observed for relapse [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment.

Adolescents

The recommended target dose of ABILIFY is 10 mg/day. Aripiprazole was studied in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age with schizophrenia at daily doses of 10 and 30 mg. The starting daily dose of the tablet formulation in these patients was 2 mg, which was titrated to 5 mg after 2 days and to the target dose of 10 mg after 2 additional days. Subsequent dose increases should be administered in 5 mg increments. The 30 mg/day dose was not shown to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. ABILIFY can be administered without regard to meals [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

Switching from Other Antipsychotics

There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with schizophrenia from other antipsychotics to ABILIFY or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with schizophrenia, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^7250da58]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — schedule options and feasibility indicate that evaluated tapering schedules vary from a faster pace of reductions of 10 to 25% every 1–2 weeks to a slower pace of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, and guidelines that outline specific tapering protocols generally recommend limiting dose reductions to no more than 25% every 2 weeks. Clinical trial experience notes that 25% weekly dose reductions was too fast for about half of the participants. When patients are taking the lowest available dose for a given benzodiazepine (BZD), reducing the dose by 5% or 10% can be challenging, and although some tablets can be accurately cut in half or even quarters with a pill splitter, smaller dose reductions are more difficult to achieve. Clinicians should take each patient's risk–benefit balance into account when developing tapering strategies and should also consider patients' underlying conditions or symptoms for which BZDs are being used to manage when developing tapering strategies; for example, if BZDs have been used to manage anxiety with insomnia, clinicians can recommend tapering the morning dose first.

### Aripiprazole (Abilify myCite) [^db1293af]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a 4-week trial (n = 414) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole tablets (15 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole tablets were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 1 in Table 14), PANSS positive subscale, and CGI-severity score. In addition, the 15 mg dose was superior to placebo in the PANSS negative subscale.

In a 4-week trial (n = 404) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole tablets (20 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole tablets were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 2 in Table 14), PANSS positive subscale, PANSS negative subscale, and CGI-severity score.

In a 6-week trial (n = 420) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole tablets (10, 15, or 20 mg/day) to placebo, all three doses of aripiprazole tablets were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 3 in Table 14), PANSS positive subscale, and the PANSS negative subscale.

In a 6-week trial (n = 367) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole tablets (2, 5, or 10 mg/day) to placebo, the 10 mg dose of aripiprazole tablets was superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 4 in Table 14), the primary outcome measure of the study. The 2 and 5 mg doses did not demonstrate superiority to placebo on the primary outcome measure.

2.3	Missed Doses

If the second or third doses are missed:

If more than 4 weeks and less than 5 weeks have elapsed since the last injection, administer the injection as soon as possible.
If more than 5 weeks have elapsed since the last injection, restart treatment with either 1-day initiation or 14-day initiation with ABILIFY MAINTENA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

If the fourth or subsequent doses are missed:

If more than 4 weeks and less than 6 weeks have elapsed since the last injection, administer the injection as soon as possible.
If more than 6 weeks have elapsed since the last injection, restart treatment with either 1-day initiation or 14-day initiation with ABILIFY MAINTENA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

2.4	Dosage Modifications for Cytochrome P450 Considerations

Refer to Table 1 and Table 2 for dosage modifications for patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and/or in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP2D6 inhibitors for greater than 14 days.

If the CYP3A4 inhibitor or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn, the ABILIFY MAINTENA dosage may need to be increased to the previous dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Avoid the concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with ABILIFY MAINTENA for greater than 14 days because the blood levels of aripiprazole are decreased and may be below the effective levels.

Dosage modifications are not recommended for patients with concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP2D6 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers for less than 14 days.

ABILIFY MAINTENA comes in two types of kits. See instructions for reconstitution/injection/disposal procedures for 1) Pre-filled Dual Chamber Syringe [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)], and 2) Vials [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

2.5	Aripiprazole Formulations and Kits

ABILIFY MAINTENA comes in two types of kits. See instructions for reconstitution/injection/disposal procedures for 1) Pre-filled Dual Chamber Syringe available in 300 mg or 400 mg strength syringes [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)], and 2) Single-dose vials available in 300 mg or 400 mg strength vials [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

The 200 mg and 160 mg dosage adjustments are obtained only by using the 300 mg or 400 mg strength vials.

### Prolonged toxicity in a 2-year-old after accidental ingestion of aripiprazole [^87e96a8c]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Aripiprazole (Abilify), or 7-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyloxy}-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolone, is a novel atypical antipsychotic possessing a long half-life. Although not a Food and Drug Administration-approved indication, low-dose aripiprazole is used to treat pediatric psychiatric conditions. Data regarding toxicity of low-dose aripiprazole ingestions in children are limited. We report the case of an accidental ingestion of two 5-mg aripiprazole tablets by a 2-year-old girl with a measured drug level of 160 ng/mL approximately 34 hours after ingestion. She exhibited marked lethargy, tremor, and tachycardia persisting over 72 hours. Emergency physicians, pediatricians, and psychiatrists should be aware of the potential for significant and prolonged toxicity in children even with relatively small-dose aripiprazole exposures.

14.4	Adjunctive Treatment of Adults with Major Depressive Disorder

The efficacy of aripiprazole tablets in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) was demonstrated in two short-term (6-week), placebo-controlled trials of adult patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD who had had an inadequate response to prior antidepressant therapy (1 to 3 courses) in the current episode and who had also demonstrated an inadequate response to 8 weeks of prospective antidepressant therapy (paroxetine extended-release, venlafaxine extended-release, fluoxetine, escitalopram, or sertraline). Inadequate response for prospective treatment was defined as less than 50% improvement on the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17), minimal HAMD17 score of 14, and a Clinical Global Impressions Improvement rating of no better than minimal improvement. Inadequate response to prior treatment was defined as less than 50% improvement as perceived by the patient after a minimum of 6 weeks of antidepressant therapy at or above the minimal effective dose.

The primary instrument used for assessing depressive symptoms was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10-item clinician-rated scale used to assess the degree of depressive symptomatology. The key secondary instrument was the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), a 3-item self-rated instrument used to assess the impact of depression on three domains of functioning with each item scored from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extreme).

In the two trials (n = 381, n = 362), aripiprazole tablets were superior to placebo in reducing mean MADRS total scores (Studies 1, 2 in Table 16). In one study, aripiprazole tablets were also superior to placebo in reducing the mean SDS score.

In both trials, patients received aripiprazole tablets adjunctive to antidepressants at a dose of 5 mg/day. Based on tolerability and efficacy, doses could be adjusted by 5 mg increments, one week apart. Allowable doses were: 2, 5, 10, 15 mg/day, and for patients who were not on potent CYP2D6 inhibitors fluoxetine and paroxetine, 20 mg/day. The mean final dose at the end point for the two trials was 10.7 and 11.4 mg/day.

An examination of population subgroups did not reveal evidence of differential response based on age, choice of prospective antidepressant, or race. With regards to gender, a smaller mean reduction on the MADRS total score was seen in males than in females.

14.3	Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder

Adults

The efficacy of ABILIFY in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) was demonstrated in two short-term (6-week), placebo-controlled trials of adult patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD who had had an inadequate response to prior antidepressant therapy (1 to 3 courses) in the current episode and who had also demonstrated an inadequate response to 8 weeks of prospective antidepressant therapy (paroxetine controlled-release, venlafaxine extended-release, fluoxetine, escitalopram, or sertraline). Inadequate response for prospective treatment was defined as less than 50% improvement on the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17), minimal HAMD17 score of 14, and a Clinical Global Impressions Improvement rating of no better than minimal improvement. Inadequate response to prior treatment was defined as less than 50% improvement as perceived by the patient after a minimum of 6 weeks of antidepressant therapy at or above the minimal effective dose.

### Aripiprazole (Abilify asimtufii) [^fe69982f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

This trial included:

A 4 to 6 week, open-label, oral conversion phase for patients on treatments for bipolar I disorder other than aripiprazole. A total of 466 patients entered this phase.
A 2 to 8 week, open-label, oral aripiprazole stabilization phase (target dose of 15 mg to 30 mg once daily). A total of 632 patients entered this phase. Patients were 18 to 65 years old (mean 40.7 years) and 60% were female. The mean (range) baseline scores were: YMRS total, 16.9 MADRS total, 5.7, and CGI-BP-S overall, 3.4 (mildly to moderately ill). Prior to the next phase, stabilization was required. Stabilization was defined as having all of the following at one bi-weekly visit: Outpatient status, YMRS total score ≤ 12, MADRS total score ≤ 12 no active suicidality; with active suicidality defined as a score of 4 or more on the MADRS item 10 OR an answer of "yes" on question 4 or 5 on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).
A minimum 12-week, uncontrolled, single-blind Abilify Maintena stabilization phase (treatment with 400 mg of Abilify Maintena given every 4 weeks in conjunction with oral aripiprazole [10 mg to 20 mg/day] for the first 2 weeks). The dose of Abilify Maintena was allowed to be decreased to 300 mg due to adverse reactions. A total of 425 patients entered this phase. The mean (range) baseline scores were: YMRS total, 5.8, MADRS total 3.7, and CGI-BP-S overall, 2.1 (minimally ill). Prior to the next phase, stabilization was required (see above for the definition of stabilization) for 8 consecutive weeks starting at week 6.
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal phase to observe for recurrence to a mood episode (defined below) for up to 52 weeks. A total of 266 patients were randomized 1:1 to the same dose of Abilify Maintena they were receiving at the end of the stabilization phase, (400 mg or 300 mg administered once every 4 weeks) or placebo. The mean (range) baseline scores were: YMRS total, 2.8 (0 to 12), MADRS total, 2.7 (0 to 12), and CGI-S overall, 1.7 (minimally ill). The dose could be decreased to 300 mg for tolerability and returned once to 400 mg.

### Content uniformity of quartered hydrocortisone tablets in comparison with mini-tablets for paediatric dosing [^5d45e55e]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydrocortisone is the preferred cortisol replacement therapy in childhood, because it is of lower potency than the synthetic glucocorticoids and may be associated with fewer side effects. Hydrocortisone doses of 8 mg/m²/day, given in three to four divided doses, are thought to be adequate for cortisol replacement therapy in childhood. Higher, supraphysiological doses of 10–15 mg/m²/day are used to treat patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), in whom the goal of treatment is to achieve suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) drive to the adrenal gland, while avoiding the adverse effects of glucocorticoid excess.

Liquid hydrocortisone formulations, such as a 1 mg/mL oral suspension, are only available as unlicensed specials and in addition to the general limitations of transport, storage and stability there are potential concerns relating to the bioavailability of liquid hydrocortisone formulations. In paediatric practice, 2.5 mg hydrocortisone doses are prescribed frequently and to achieve these doses, it is recommended that tablets are divided or crushed. Crushing and dissolving tablets may result in unacceptably high variability of dosingand it may be preferable to quarter 10 mg tablets. The hydrocortisone 10 mg tablets licensed for oral administration are quarter scored, allowing them to be divided into equal halves or quarters. However, despite the presence of functional break lines, splitting may result in unequal parts thereby producing unequal doses and loss of mass due to crumbling.

To date, most data relating to the medium-term/long-term outcomes of children with CAH report features more likely to represent over, rather than under, dosing: obesity, insulin resistance, elevated leptin levels, dyslipidaemia and impaired glucose metabolism. However, working memory performance is lower in children with CAH than in unaffected relatives, and health-related quality of life is also reported to be reduced, with boys and girls equally affected, suggesting that this is not simply related to androgen excess in girls and associated disorders of sex development. Erratic and inadequate doses of hydrocortisone may contribute to these adverse effects.

No current licensed oral hydrocortisone formulation adequately meets the dosing requirements of children. Mini-tablets provide an alternate to standard tablets and oral liquids mainly for paediatric patients, ≥ 4 years of age. Variations exist in the defined size of mini-tablets in literature, but a diameter of ≤ 3 mm is commonly compatible with paediatric patients. Mini-tablets can be administered to paediatric patients as young as 6 months old with their food/beverages and recent studies have demonstrated mini-tablets to be more acceptable than oral syrups.

Thus, the efficacy of 10, 15, 20, and 30 mg daily doses was established in two studies for each dose. Among these doses, there was no evidence that the higher dose groups offered any advantage over the lowest dose group of these studies.

An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age, gender, or race.

A longer-term trial enrolled 310 inpatients or outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia who were, by history, symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from their antipsychotic medications and randomized to aripiprazole tablets 15 mg/day or placebo for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as CGI-Improvement score of ≥ 5 (minimally worse), scores ≥ 5 (moderately severe) on the hostility or uncooperativeness items of the PANSS, or ≥ 20% increase in the PANSS total score. Patients receiving aripiprazole tablets 15 mg/day experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over the subsequent 26 weeks compared to those receiving placebo (Study 5 in Figure 6).

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of ABILIFY MYCITE for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia, treatment of adults with manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and adjunctive treatment of adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) has been established and is based on trials of aripiprazole including 13,543 adult patients who participated in multiple-dose clinical trials in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and other disorders, and who had approximately 7,619 patient-years of exposure to oral aripiprazole. A total of 3,390 patients were treated with oral aripiprazole for at least 180 days and 1,933 patients treated with oral aripiprazole had at least one year of exposure.

The conditions and duration of treatment with aripiprazole (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy with antidepressants or mood stabilizers) included (in overlapping categories) double-blind, comparative and noncomparative open-label studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed- and flexible-dose studies, and short- and longer-term exposure.

The most common adverse reactions of aripiprazole in adult patients in clinical trials (≥ 10%) were nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, akathisia, anxiety, insomnia, and restlessness.

Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients with Schizophrenia

The following findings are based on a pool of five placebo-controlled trials (four 4-week and one 6-week) in which oral aripiprazole was administered in doses ranging from 2 to 30 mg/day.

The commonly observed adverse reaction associated with the use of aripiprazole tablets in patients with schizophrenia (incidence of 5% or greater and aripiprazole tablets incidence at least twice that for placebo) was akathisia (aripiprazole tablets 8%; placebo 4%).

Monotherapy

The efficacy of aripiprazole tablets as monotherapy in the acute treatment of manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder was established in four 3-week placebo-controlled trials in hospitalized patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These studies included patients with or without psychotic features and two of the studies also included patients with or without a rapid-cycling course.

The primary instrument used for assessing manic symptoms was the Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS), an 11-item clinician-rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). A key secondary instrument included the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar (CGI-BP) Scale.

In the four positive, 3-week placebo-controlled trials (n = 268; n = 248; n = 480; n = 485) which evaluated aripiprazole tablets in a range of 15 mg to 30 mg, once daily (with a starting dose of 30 mg/day in two studies and 15 mg/day in two studies), aripiprazole tablets were superior to placebo in the reduction of Y-MRS total score (Studies 1 to 4 in Table 15) and CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In the two studies with a starting dose of 15 mg/day, 48% and 44% of patients were on 15 mg/day at endpoint. In the two studies with a starting dose of 30 mg/day, 86% and 85% of patients were on 30 mg/day at endpoint.

### Zolmitriptan (zolmiptriptan) [^072b35ed]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosing Information

The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is 5 mg.

In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose.

If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period.

The safety of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established.

2.2 Administration of Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets

Instruct patients not to break zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets because they are not functionally-scored. Administration with liquid is not necessary.

Orally disintegrating tablets are packaged in a blister pack. Instruct patients not to remove the tablet from the blister until just prior to dosing. Subsequently, instruct patients to peel the blister pack open, and to place the orally disintegrating tablet on the tongue, where it will dissolve and it will be swallowed with the saliva.

2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

The recommended dose of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day.

The use of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment because these orally disintegrating tablets should not be broken in half [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Adjunctive Therapy

The efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole tablets with concomitant lithium or valproate in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder was established in a 6-week placebo-controlled study (n = 384) with a 2-week lead-in mood stabilizer monotherapy phase in adult patients who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder. This study included patients with manic or mixed episodes and with or without psychotic features.

Patients were initiated on open-label lithium (0.6 to 1.0 mEq/L) or valproate (50 to 125 mcg/mL) at therapeutic serum levels and remained on stable doses for 2 weeks. At the end of 2 weeks, patients demonstrating inadequate response (Y-MRS total score ≥ 16 and ≤ 25% improvement on the Y-MRS total score) to lithium or valproate were randomized to receive either aripiprazole tablets (15 mg/day or an increase to 30 mg/day as early as Day 7) or placebo as adjunctive therapy with open-label lithium or valproate. In the 6-week placebo-controlled phase, adjunctive aripiprazole tablets starting at 15 mg/day with concomitant lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 to 1.0 mEq/L or 50 to 125 mcg/mL, respectively) was superior to lithium or valproate with adjunctive placebo in the reduction of the Y-MRS total score (Study 5 in Table 15) and CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). Seventy-one percent of the patients coadministered valproate and 62% of the patients coadministered lithium were on 15 mg/day at 6-week endpoint.

### Stability of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine tablet halves during prolonged storage under tropical conditions [^ca0f5cd5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Eurartesim (40/320 mg) tablets (N = 360; Lot 141450; Exp 11/2016) were purchased from Manson's Chemists Ltd (London E78BA, United Kingdom). Other chemicals were of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or analytical grade from various commercial sources.

The short-term stability of DP tablets halves was investigated within their expiry date (January to April 2016) in a "natural ageing" study over 3 months' light on (320–400 nm) and light off in climatic zone IV(30°C and 70% relative humidity) using a pharmaceutical stability chambers (PSC022, Weiss Gallenkamp, United Kingdom). Two hundred and forty tablets were manually split in half using as fragmentation of tablets was rather high when using a pill cutter. The halves were then put back in their blister.–show the photos of tablets being broken manually and placed in the blister pack for ageing. Two hundred and forty halves were kept in light and 240 halves in darkness in the stability chamber. At defined time points, that is, 0 hours (= nonaged), 24 hours, 3 days, 1 calendar month, and 3 calendar months, 48 tablet halves from each light exposure group were removed (Table 1), and stored in their blister packs at 4°C until analysis (within 1 week of removal from the chamber). One hundred and twenty full tablets were used as controls (Table 1).

### Stability of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine tablet halves during prolonged storage under tropical conditions [^e53a7e6e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

The antimalarial artemisinin-based combination therapy dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (DP) is highly efficacious against uncomplicated malaria. Because of its long half-life and associated chemoprophylactic effect, DP is considered the most promising antimalarial for mass drug administration (MDA) for transmission reduction efforts in Africa. Furthermore, it is extensively studied for intermittent preventive treatment in children, and pregnant women. The global discussion around use of drugs to reduce transmission has largely focused on DP's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and those of suitable gametocytocidal drugs, whereas more practical threats to successful implementation have received much less attention.

Eurartesim (Sigma-Tau Industrie Farmaceutiche Riunite s.p.a. Rome, Italy), the only available fixed-dose combination of DP that has obtained marketing authorization from a stringent regulatory authority (i.e. the European Medicines Agency, [EMA]), is available as pediatric tablets containing 20 mg dihydroartemisinin and 160 mg piperaquine, and adult tablets containing 40 mg dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg piperaquine. Due to the narrow therapeutic dose range and limited number of tablet strengths, the manufacturerand the World Health Organization (WHO)recommend breaking tablets into halves to accurately dosing children according to their body weight. There is no WHO guidance on age-based dose regimens, where the use of half tablets may help limit the substantial increase in dose intake variation.

The major concern with tablet fractions, apart from inaccurate dosing resulting from imprecise breaking of tablets, is the intrinsic stability of broken tablets of DP under conditions of high temperature and humidity found in malaria-endemic countries. Drug decomposition and formation of degradation products are typically accelerated in the presence of oxygen, moisture, heat, and strong light. As a consequence, remaining tablet halves may contain lower dose and, in the worst case, even toxic byproducts, potentially resulting in lack of clinical response, adverse events, and spread of antimalarial resistance. No data are available from the manufacturer, EMA registration, or scientific literature on the stability of DP tablet fractions once removed from the blister pack. In this study, we determined the stability of half tablets of DP at 37°C and 70% humidity as found in malaria-endemic countries. The results address the gap in knowledge on the stability of tablet halves of DP and this crucial information will help the successful implementation of MDA programs using DP.

Long-Term Efficacy

The efficacy of Abilify Maintena in maintaining symptomatic control in schizophrenia was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal trial in adult patients (Study 2) who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia and who were being treated with at least one antipsychotic medication. Patients had at least a 3-year history of illness and a history of relapse or symptom exacerbation when not receiving antipsychotic treatment.

In addition to the PANSS and CGI-S, clinical ratings during this trial included the:

Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, a scale of 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) based on the change from baseline in clinical condition and
Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Suicide (CGI-SS) scale, which is comprised of 2 parts: Part 1 rates the severity of suicidal thoughts and behavior on a scale of 1 (not at all suicidal) to 5 (attempted suicide) based on the most severe level in the last 7 days from all information available to the rater and Part 2 rates the change from baseline in suicidal thoughts and behavior on a scale of 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).

This trial included:

A 4 to 6 week open-label, oral conversion phase for patients on antipsychotic medications other than aripiprazole. A total of 633 patients entered this phase.
An open-label, oral aripiprazole stabilization phase (target dose of 10 mg to 30 mg once daily). A total of 710 patients entered this phase. Patients were 18 to 60 years old (mean 40 years) and 60% were male. The mean PANSS total score was 66 (range 33 to 124). The mean CGI-S score was 3.5 (mildly to moderately ill). Prior to the next phase, stabilization was required. Stabilization was defined as having all of the following for four consecutive weeks: an outpatient status, PANSS total score ≤ 80, CGI-S ≤ 4 (moderately ill), and CGISS score ≤ 2 (mildly suicidal) on Part 1 and ≤ 5 (minimally worsened) on Part 2; and a score of ≤ 4 on each of the following PANSS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content.
A minimum 12-week uncontrolled, single-blind Abilify Maintena stabilization phase (treatment with 400 mg of Abilify Maintena given every 4 weeks in conjunction with oral aripiprazole [10 mg to 20 mg/day] for the first 2 weeks). The dose of Abilify Maintena may have been decreased to 300 mg due to adverse reactions. A total of 576 patients entered this phase. The mean PANSS total score was 59 (range 30 to 80) and the mean CGI-S score was 3.2 (mildly ill). Prior to the next phase, stabilization was required (see above for the definition of stabilization) for 12 consecutive weeks.
A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized-withdrawal phase to observe for relapse (defined below). A total of 403 patients were randomized 2:1 to the same dose of Abilify Maintena they were receiving at the end of the stabilization phase, (400 mg or 300 mg administered once every 4 weeks) or placebo. Patients had a mean PANSS total score of 55 (range 31 to 80) and a CGI-S score of 2.9 (mildly ill) at entry. The dose could be adjusted up and down or down and up within the range of 300 to 400 mg on a one-time basis.

### Content uniformity of quartered hydrocortisone tablets in comparison with mini-tablets for paediatric dosing [^21457f1a]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Children often require a hydrocortisone dose of 2.5 mg but there is no suitable, licensed, formulation available.
Hydrocortisone 10 mg tablets, with functional break lines, are split commonly in an attempt to deliver the correct dose.
Mini-tablets are an alternative and acceptable oral dosage form for children as young as 6 months old.

What this study hopes to add?

Quartering 10 mg hydrocortisone tablets produces unacceptable dose variations.
Additional variability in dosing could be introduced by different operators.
It is feasible to produce 3 mm hydrocortisone mini-tablets that meet pharmacopoeial requirements of weight and dose uniformity.

Adjunctive Maintenance Therapy

An adjunctive maintenance trial was conducted in adult patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder with a recent manic or mixed episode. Patients were initiated on open-label lithium (0.6 to 1.0 mEq/L) or valproate (50 to 125 mcg/mL) at therapeutic serum levels, and remained on stable doses for 2 weeks. At the end of 2 weeks, patients demonstrating inadequate response (Y-MRS total score ≥ 16 and ≤ 35% improvement on the Y-MRS total score) to lithium or valproate received aripiprazole tablets with a starting dose of 15 mg/day with the option to increase to 30 mg or reduce to 10 mg as early as Day 4, as adjunctive therapy with open-label lithium or valproate. Prior to randomization, patients on the combination of single-blind aripiprazole tablets and lithium or valproate were required to maintain stability (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores ≤ 12) for 12 consecutive weeks. Three hundred thirty-seven patients were then randomized in a double-blind fashion, to either the same dose of aripiprazole tablets they were on at the end of the stabilization period or placebo plus lithium or valproate and were then monitored for manic, mixed, or depressive relapse for a maximum of 52 weeks. Aripiprazole tablets were superior to placebo on the primary endpoint, time from randomization to relapse to any mood event (Study 8 in Figure 8). A mood event was defined as hospitalization for a manic, mixed, or depressive episode, study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy accompanied by Y-MRS score > 16 and/or a MADRS > 16, or an SAE of worsening disease accompanied by Y-MRS score > 16 and/or a MADRS > 16. A total of 68 mood events were observed during the double-blind treatment phase. Twenty-five were from the aripiprazole group and 43 were from the placebo group. The number of observed manic episodes in the aripiprazole group (7) were fewer than that in the placebo group (19), while the number of depressive episodes in the aripiprazole group (14) was similar to that in the placebo group (18). The Kaplan-Meier curves of the time from randomization to relapse to any mood event during the 52-week double-blind treatment phase for aripiprazole tablets and placebo groups are shown in Figure 8.

Long-acting/ER opioids — Oxycodone/APAP ER is available and initially dosed as follows: it is "Available as tablets containing oxycodone 7.5 mg and APAP 325 mg for every 12 hr administration"; in opioid-naive patients clinicians "May initiate therapy with the standard dose of 2 tablets every 12 hr", with "2 tablets totaling 15 mg oxycodone/650 mg APAP", and "This is the only long-acting/ER opioid to have an acute pain indication". Other dosing information notes "The polyethylene oxide content causes the tablet to swell and become sticky when wet. This has the potential to cause obstruction of the airway or GI obstruction", and "Steady state concentration of both components are reached within 24 hr of product initiation". In special populations, "Elderly: Take precautions when determining the dosing amount and frequency in geriatric patients since a greater sensitivity to oxycodone may be observed", and for renal or hepatic dysfunction, "Patients with renal dysfunction (CrCl < 60 ml/ min) or hepatic dysfunction should initiate therapy with 1 tablet every 12 hr and adjust as needed". Additional considerations include "This long-acting/ER opioid is an exception to the REMS requirements due to the relatively low amount of oxycodone contained in each tablet", and "Oxycodone/APAP ER tablets are formulated with PEO which is responsible for its ER in addition to labeled abuse deterrent properties". Patients are counseled that "Patients should be instructed not to pre-soak, lick, or otherwise wet tablets prior to swallowing and to take one tablet at a time with adequate water to insure complete and immediate swallowing", and "Breaking, chewing, crushing, cutting, dissolving, or splitting the tablets will result in uncontrolled release of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death".

### Innovation in regulatory science is meeting evolution of clinical evidence generation [^0235e592]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Leaps made with digital products

The technological advances with digital products are also shaping regulatory policy. Regulators see opportunities with digital therapeutics and are encouraging digital applications and predictive analytics to support clinical development. As the personalization of health care expands, the expectation is that there will be more digital products marketed as companion products for specific drugs to support dosing and treatment duration. Clear guidelines regarding what is required for approval will be important to support the industry and ensure sufficient safeguards are in place when tools can alter the course of diagnosis or treatment. This is because there are significant risks for patients with these products where the predictive algorithm may negatively impact patient treatment decisions.

As a result, the landscape of digital oversight by regulators is rapidly evolving. Major milestones in the FDA's oversight of digital products and applications are outlined in Figure 6. 8, 70, 71 The FDA published its first guidance regarding mobile medical applications in 2013 and updated that guidance in 2015. Since then, the pace of the FDA's actions in the digital sphere has accelerated, and, in 2017, the agency approved the first digital drug‐device, aripiprazole tablets with sensor (Abilify MyCite), which tracks patients' adherence to dosing schedules.

In 2017, the FDA published its Digital Health Action Plan, 72 outlining steps the agency has already taken to clarify its role in oversight of digital products and to set forth the agency's next steps in developing guidance. These steps include issuing draft guidance regarding the medical software provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act, as well as to continue to contribute to international efforts to develop regulatory principles for Software as a Medical Device. Notably, the 21st Century Cures Act reclassified some digital applications to no longer be considered medical devices, including software that "supports administrative functions, encourages a healthy lifestyle, assists in displaying or storing data, or provides limited clinical decision support". The Digital Health Action Plan also outlines a plan to develop a precertification program for some digital health products, with the goal of streamlining and accelerating submission and review. To date, however, the agency has provided little clarity on the regulatory requirements for approval of digital solutions that may have predictive capabilities, and this limits companies from applying for these approvals.

### Stability of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine tablet halves during prolonged storage under tropical conditions [^1a09a5fa]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

We tested the stability of Eurartesim full tablets and tablet halves when exposed to light or darkness at 30°C and 70% relative humidity for up to 3 months. The weights of tablets manually broken in half show the accuracy of this process (Table 2) and both, dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine amounts, remain fairly constant over 3 months in each group (Table 3). This addresses a key gap in implementation research, and reassures national malaria control programmes considering using DP for MDA as this will ensure the reduction of cost and wastage of unused tablet fractions.

The International Conference on Harmonization and the WHO state that to properly assess long-term stability of finished pharmaceutical products, testing on how the quality of the product varies with time under the influence of temperature, humidity, and light should be conducted under storage conditions experienced in the intended market. A recent study found that full tablets of Coartem ® (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) (artemether–lumefantrine) and ASAQ Winthrop ® (Sanofi-Aventis, Gentilly, France) (artesunate–amodiaqiuine) were stable when "naturally aged" under tropical conditions. Acceptable levels of all active pharmaceutical ingredients (90–110% as per international pharmacopeia tolerance limits) were measured over 3 years, despite drugs having reached their expiry dates within 18–24 months from the start of the study.

Information on the stability of tablet fractions is crucial especially when the number of available tablet strengths is limited to accurately dose all patient groups. In the case of DP, the manufacturerand the WHOrecommend dosing regimen that, with the only available fixed-dose combination that has obtained marketing authorization from a stringent regulatory authority, can only be achieved by breaking tablets into halve. Although for individual treatment, caregivers can be advised to discard unused tablet fractions immediately after having administered the dose to the child to ensure no substandard tablets are administered during subsequent dosing time points, adherence to this strategy is not well known and seems even less feasible in an MDA setting where large quantities of wastage would be produced (with environmental and economic consequences). More information on stability of tablet fractions is therefore crucial for successful implementation of DP in programmatic settings as the knowledge base for drugs degraded as a result of storage in tropical climates is sparse at best–and nonexistent for half tablets.

### Content uniformity of quartered hydrocortisone tablets in comparison with mini-tablets for paediatric dosing [^c0cf8b74]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Results

Splitting of hydrocortisone tablets

The tablets used for the study were convex, diamond shaped and quarter scored allowing them to be divided into equal halves or quarters. The assay of the whole hydrocortisone tablets gave > 98% recovery, which is within the specified 90%–110% limits of the USP monograph for hydrocortisone tablets. The mean weight of whole hydrocortisone tablets was 244.18 mg (SD 1.70 mg, coefficient of variation (CV) 0.7%).

The recovered weights of the quartered tablets indicated that approximately 2% mass was lost during the subdivision process. The expected weight for each tablet quarter was 61.05 mg, based on the mean whole tablet weight. The obtained weight was 59.83 mg (SD 8.45 mg). However, 33 of the 80 (41%) quartered tablets failed to meet the Ph. Eur. monograph specification. Based on the mean mass of 59.83 mg, the criteria would allow quartered tablets to have a mass in range 53.85–65.81 mg.

The mean content of hydrocortisone in all of the quartered tablets (n = 80) was 2.34 mg (94% of 2.5 mg target dose), with a CV of 15%, range 1.28 (51%) to 3.39 mg (136%). Of the 80, 43 quartered tablets (54%) failed to achieve ± 10% (2.25–2.75 mg) of the target 2.5 mg dose.

Figure 1 shows the correlation between quartered tablet weight and hydrocortisone content, which explains the large number of substandard hydrocortisone doses in the quarters, as content is directly related to weight.

LPV/r tablets — do not use crushed tablets — LPV/r tablets must be swallowed whole; crushed tablets are slowly and erratically absorbed and result in significantly reduced AUC, maximum concentration, and Ctrough compared with swallowing the whole tablet, and crushed tablets cannot be recommended for use. The variability of the reduced exposure with the crushed tablets (5% to 75% reduction in AUC) means that a dose modification cannot be relied on to overcome the reduced absorption. In a PK study using a generic adult formulation of LPV/r manufactured in Thailand, 21 of 54 children were administered cut (not crushed) pills and had adequate LPV Ctrough measurements.

Alkindi Sprinkles (Hydrocortisone Granules)

In infancy and early childhood, smaller doses and incremental adjustments are required to reach a dose that is enough to prevent increased androgen production and exposure but not excessive to avoid causing hypercortisolism. This balance is very hard to achieve in practice, because the smallest US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved commercial hydrocortisone formulation available in the United States had been, until 2020, a 5-mg tablet with a single score. This lack of an appropriate pediatric formulation led to various manipulations of the scored 5-mg hydrocortisone tablet to deliver prescribed doses under 2.5 mg.

Faltering growth, recurrent hypoglycemia and iatrogenic Cushing syndrome have been described with hydrocortisone tablet manipulations such as splitting the 5 mg tablets to produce doses less than 2.5 mg, dispersing in water, and compounding small doses in capsules. Madathilethu et al reported that splitting 10-mg hydrocortisone tablets into halves and quarters produced unacceptable dose variations. Dispersing tablets in water to create a suspension and then drawing the prescribed dose over the course the day was the second most popular method to obtain prescribed doses of < 2.5 mg according to the Pediatric Endocrine Society survey. As hydrocortisone is hydrophobic, sparingly soluble in water, and thus not equally distributed in the liquid, this approach can result in significant variability in dosing.

In 2020 the FDA approved Alkindi Sprinkles®, the first pediatric hydrocortisone formulation accommodating small incremental doses (< 2.5 mg) since hydrocortisone cypionate suspension was taken off the market in 2001 (Fig. 2). Alkindi Sprinkles are hydrocortisone granules with essentially identical PK profile with hydrocortisone tablets and are well tolerated in neonates, infants, and children under 6 years of age with adrenal insufficiency. Granules are contained within transparent capsules and are available in dosages of 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mg. The maximum diameter of the granules is 0.8 mm and has an inert cellulose capsule core, which is sprayed with hydrocortisone and is sealed with taste-masking excipients to reduce bitterness. To administer Alkindi, parents squeeze the bottom of the capsule and twist off the top of the capsule so that the granules can be sprinkled directly into the mouth of the child or onto soft food. Immediately following administration, the child should drink a liquid to ensure that all granules are swallowed.

### Aripiprazole (Abilify myCite) [^b6db9413]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Monotherapy Maintenance Therapy

A maintenance trial was conducted in adult patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder with a recent manic or mixed episode who had been stabilized on open-label aripiprazole tablets and who had maintained a clinical response for at least 6 weeks. The first phase of this trial was an open-label stabilization period in which inpatients and outpatients were clinically stabilized and then maintained on open-label aripiprazole tablets (15 or 30 mg/day, with a starting dose of 30 mg/day) for at least 6 consecutive weeks. One hundred sixty-one outpatients were then randomized in a double-blind fashion to either the same dose of aripiprazole tablets they were on at the end of the stabilization and maintenance period or placebo and were then monitored for manic or depressive relapse. During the randomization phase, aripiprazole tablets were superior to placebo on time to the number of combined affective relapses (manic plus depressive), the primary outcome measure for this study (Study 7 in Figure 7). A total of 55 mood events were observed during the double-blind treatment phase. Nineteen were from the aripiprazole tablets group and 36 were from the placebo group. The number of observed manic episodes in the aripiprazole tablets group (6) were fewer than that in the placebo group (19), while the number of depressive episodes in the aripiprazole tablets group (9) was similar to that in the placebo group (11).

An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age and gender; however, there were insufficient numbers of patients in each of the ethnic groups to adequately assess inter-group differences.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^c8c1bdaf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Acute management of primary headaches in obstetric triage or emergency — assessment, hydration, triptan reuse limit, and initial dosing: A detailed history of recent medication use will help guide therapy; a persistent headache after repetitive courses of acetaminophen and caffeine is unlikely to respond to the same treatment, and persistent or recurrent headache despite repeat doses of sumatriptan within 24 hours precludes reuse of triptan therapy. Adequate hydration is critical to headache relief. For oral therapy, combination acetaminophen and caffeine (two caplets with a total dose of acetaminophen 1,000 mg and caffeine 130 mg) is an appropriate first option; if unavailable, caffeine is also available as an oral solution, an injectable solution, and a 200 mg oral tablet usable as a one-time single dose or, preferably, cut in half for a 100 mg dose. If mild residual headache persists after other therapies, combination acetaminophen and caffeine can also be used before discharge.

Crushing film-coated tablets for administration — dispersible tablets are now considered the preferred formulation for pediatric patients weighing < 20 kg, and film-coated tablets should not be used in children weighing < 14 kg. In children weighing > 14 kg who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets, when the preferred dispersible tablets are not available, the 50-mg tablets may be split into halves with immediate ingestion of both halves or crushed and added to a small amount of semisolid food or liquid, all of which must be consumed immediately. In healthy adults, crushed tablets resulted in slightly higher exposures than whole tablets, and no information exists on the impact of splitting or crushing film-coated tablets on palatability. Some case reports describe DTG-containing film-coated tablets being crushed and successfully administered via orogastric tube or nasogastric tube; if DTG is administered via enteral tube, care should be taken to disperse the tablets completely and flush the tube to avoid clogging.

### Content uniformity of quartered hydrocortisone tablets in comparison with mini-tablets for paediatric dosing [^0710599b]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

In a recent study,8 mm tablets were halved and their weight variation was compliant with pharmacopoeial standards, but the tablets were split by an experienced pharmacist while in reality the process may not always be performed by a qualified healthcare professional. For example, parents or carers may be required to split tablets on a regular basis and the data in this study highlight the variations, which could be obtained if an untrained operator performs the subdivision of doses. Other previous studies have also highlighted the potential interoperator variation obtained when splitting scored tablets.

It is not possible to replicate the physiological, diurnal pattern of cortisol secretion using standard formulations of hydrocortisone, and patients experience highly non-physiological cortisol profiles, with periods when cortisol concentrations are excessively high, shortly after a dose of hydrocortisone and prolonged periods of hypocortisolaemia between doses. The half-life of hydrocortisone is short, requiring three to four doses a day, and concordance with treatment can be particularly difficult during adolescence. A future aim should be to produce alternative modified-release dosage forms to provide more consistent and tailored hydrocortisone release profiles, and a reduced frequency of dosing.

### Stability of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine tablet halves during prolonged storage under tropical conditions [^deb752a1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (DP) is recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, used in efforts to contain artemisinin resistance, and increasingly considered for mass drug administration. Because of the narrow therapeutic dose range and available tablet strengths, the manufacturers and World Health Organization recommended regimens involve breaking tablets into halves to accurately dose children according to body weight. Use of tablet fractions in programmatic settings under tropical conditions requires a highly stable product; however, the stability of DP tablet fractions is unknown. We aged full and half DP (Eurartesim ®) tablets in a stability chamber at 30°C and 70% humidity level. The active pharmaceutical ingredients dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine remained at ≥ 95% over the 3 months' period of ageing in light and darkness. These findings are reassuring for DP, but highlight the need to assess drug stability under real-life settings during the drug development process, particularly for key drugs of global disease control programs.

Results

Observational study

During the observational study, 310 manipulations were identified. Researchers did not observe or have to prevent any drug errors during this study. Many manipulations were identified in specialist areas or clinical areas with more highly dependent patients, though manipulations were identified in all types of wards. Figure 1 details the clinical areas where manipulations were identified during the observational study. Of the 310 identified manipulations, 54 (17%) were observed. The patients observed receiving manipulated drugs encompassed those with a wide variety of conditions and included an age range from 2 days to 19 years. The main reasons for non-observation were: the patient not receiving the drug at the prescribed time (changes in the patient's condition, patient in theatre); patient discharged from the ward; changes to the patient's prescription (the changes in dose or drug meant that a manipulation may no longer be required) and difficulties with trying to anticipate when 'as required' drugs would be needed.

Of the 40 tablet manipulations 25 (62.5%) of the tablets were cut, 12 (30%) dispersed, one (2.5%) crushed, one (2.5%) was broken by hand and there was one (2.5%) manipulation where the tablet was split in half first and then dispersed so that a quarter of the dosage form prior to manipulation could be withdrawn and administered. In three (11.5%) of the 25 tablet manipulations where the tablet had been split the manipulation had to be repeated. In two cases the tablet crumbled while being split, whilst in the third case the tablet split unevenly. During a further nine (34.6%) of these manipulations there was also visible powder generated when the tablet was split.

### Single low dose primaquine to block the transmission of plasmodium falciparum-proposed stand-alone and ACT-adapted regimens [^d0d838dd]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

With concrete dosing options for SLDPQ, the question now is where do we go from here? For co-blistering with ACTs, cost and manufacturing practicalities demand that only one PQ tablet is co-blistered but the stand-alone regimen offers the possibility of mixing tablet strengths. The WHO should consider reinstating the 3.75 mg tablet not just for transmission blocking but also for under-1 children with P. vivax, if they tolerate poorly the 5 mg dose. Moreover, this would avoid the inconvenience of splitting a 7.5 mg tablet. In considering their next move, many MCPs will to look to the WHO for guidance. The WHO should seize the opportunity to examine the merits of these SLDPQ regimens and incorporate them into the WHO Malaria Guidelines.

Faced with the rapid expansion of de novo artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum across eastern Africa, the WHO needs to act quickly and be bolder in recommending SLDPQ as part of a comprehensive strategy to counter this threat, which, over time, is likely to bring increasing misery, morbidity, and mortality. We cannot wait years for the results of large, cluster-randomised trials to prove that a given strategy impedes the development or spread of artemisinin resistance.

Physician

Children with classical CAH take both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone every day. Hydrocortisone is a tablet. The smallest tablet dose is 5 mg, which is an excessive dose for most children. Most tablets are scored into halves. Yet, caregivers may need to cut the tablets into quarters (1.25 mg dose). Despite use of a pill-cutter, the hydrocortisone tablets may crumble during the cutting process, resulting in inaccurate dosing. Fludrocortisone is also a tablet; 0.1 mg is the only size tablet.

Hydrocortisone is not readily available in a liquid form because the medication does not form a stable solution. Despite vigorous shaking, liquids provide variable dosing and should generally be avoided. Nevertheless, despite its short shelf stability, a hydrocortisone suspension is available in some locations. An immediate-release multiparticulate hydrocortisone granule (Alkindi Sprinkles®) and timed-release hydrocortisone tablets are increasingly available. Some pediatric endocrinologists use prednisolone, prednisone, or dexamethasone formulated as pills and suspensions. Nonetheless, the 2018 Endocrine Society Guidelines recommend against chronic use of hydrocortisone suspensions and long-acting potent glucocorticoids.

Fludrocortisone is typically dosed once or twice daily. Hydrocortisone is typically dosed 3 to 4 times daily. For 3 times daily dosing, the first dose is administered with breakfast, and the third dose is administered at bedtime. The second dose is typically administered approximately 6 to 8 hours after the morning dose. Nap times for infants and toddlers and the school/sports schedule for older children, adolescents, and emerging adults often interfere with administration of this midday dose. Not infrequently with older children and adolescents, the midday dose is delayed or missed due to ongoing activities. For some families, 4 daily doses are preferable; the 4 doses can be administered with meals. Again, remembering to administer all 4 doses can be difficult, especially with busy households often consisting of working caregivers and the child's activities.

Patients accompanied by caregivers have regular visits with their pediatric endocrinologist. Linear growth and pubertal development are assessed. Bloodwork and bone age X-rays are obtained to assess the hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone doses. The hydrocortisone dose must be adjusted and balanced to avoid both overtreatment associated with Cushingoid features and chronic undertreatment associated with virilization and premature epiphyseal fusion. Similarly, overtreatment with fludrocortisone may cause hypertension while undertreatment can increase the risk of failure to thrive.

Practical and clinical considerations — formulations and administration for pediatric initial regimens: The availability of FDC formulations and method of administration are important considerations in the selection of a Preferred initial regimen. BIC/FTC/TAF (Biktarvy) is a single-tablet regimen for children weighing ≥ 14 kg; the tablet may not be crushed or dissolved; however, it can be split in half prior to dosing for ease of swallowing, and it is available in two formulations for children able to swallow pills, including BIC 30 mg/FTC 120 mg/TAF 15 mg for children weighing ≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg and BIC 50 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg for children weighing ≥ 25 kg. ABC/DTG/3TC (Triumeq PD) is a dispersible tablet that can be used in children weighing < 25 kg and should be dissolved in water; each tablet contains all three drugs and the number of tablets per dose is based on a child's weight. ABC/DTG/3TC (Triumeq) is a nondispersible, single-tablet regimen option for children weighing ≥ 25 kg who are able to swallow whole pills; however, a disadvantage is the larger pill size, which can make swallowing challenging compared with the other recommended options. DTG plus FTC/TAF is dosed once daily; DTG is available as dispersible tablets (Tivicay PD) and as a film-coated tablet (Tivicay), and FTC/TAF (Descovy) is available in two different strengths as a single tablet to be swallowed.

### Alpelisib (Piqray) [^e15e1c4e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Patient Selection

Select patients for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer with PIQRAY, based on the presence of one or more PIK3CA mutations in tumor tissue or plasma specimens [see Clinical Studies (14)]. If no mutation is detected in a plasma specimen, test tumor tissue. Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics.

2.2 Dosage and Administration

The recommended dose of PIQRAY is 300 mg (two 150 mg film-coated tablets) taken orally, once daily, with food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Patients should take their dose of PIQRAY at approximately the same time each day.

Swallow PIQRAY tablets whole (tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split prior to swallowing). No tablet should be ingested if it is broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact.

If a dose of PIQRAY is missed, it can be taken with food within 9 hours after the time it is usually taken. After more than 9 hours, skip the dose for that day. The next day, take PIQRAY at the usual time.

If the patient vomits after taking the dose, advise the patient not to take an additional dose on that day, and to resume the dosing schedule the next day at the usual time.

When given with PIQRAY, the recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg administered on Days 1, 15, and 29, and once monthly thereafter. Refer to the Full Prescribing Information for fulvestrant.

### Availability, affordability and costs of pediatric medicines in Mongolia [^1a3116a2]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Lack of child friendly formulations was observed in this study. Chloramphenicol injection, morphine, beclomethasone were not available in two sectors. According to other studies, similar findings have been reported. Medicines to treat seizure disorders (phenobarbital, phenytoin) and pain (morphine) were not found in any of the surveyed pharmacy outlets. This is due to the legislation restricting the use of narcotic and psychotropic drugs, only a few pharmacy outlets with special permission are eligible to stock them.

Diseases of the digestive system, including diarrhea was one of the main reasons for pediatric mortality and morbidity in Mongolia. Oral rehydration powders were available in most of pharmacy outlets in both sectors. However, dispersible tablets of Zinc as recommended in the EMLc, were available in only half of the surveyed sites (50.6%). Evidence based data suggest that zinc is beneficial for treatment of pediatric diarrhea for children aged 6 months or older.

Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has a unique role in children because it is the first-line choice for the treatment of both fever and pain. When used in the recommended doses, it has few side effects and is remarkably well tolerated. However, the recommended pediatric dose tablet was not available in any of the surveyed pharmacies. Instead, dispensers (pharmacist or pharmacy technician) would dispense adult dose tablet (500 mg) and advise to cut the tablet into half when a pediatric dose was prescribed. Clinical data proves that in overdose, paracetamol is hepatotoxic.

The affordability of lowest cost medicines was compared across the country. The pediatric essential medicines were generally less affordable in the private sector and costed more than the recommended international reference prices.

Mongolia is country with seasonal variations, with winter being very long and harsh. During this time, most pediatric conditions are associated with respiratory infections. Pneumonia and other respiratory infections are reported to be the main reason for children's hospitalization in Mongolia. Empiric treatment with appropriate antibiotics for respiratory infections, including pneumonia is crucial in the reduction of mortality from pneumonia. Treatment of pneumonia with amoxicillin suspension would cost more than a half day's wage, whereas for other respiratory infections (otitis media), the cost of treatment would be 1 day's wage.

### A prospective study of children aged 0–8 years with CAH and adrenal insufficiency treated with hydrocortisone granules [^8889e487]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The most common cause of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in young children is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Patients require lifelong glucocorticoid replacement therapy. The recommended therapy in childhood is hydrocortisone given 3 to 4 times daily. It is necessary to adjust the glucocorticoid dose in the growing child, and timed hormone measurements, including 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), are used to monitor CAH control. Successful therapy of AI in childhood requires access to a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals, regular clinic visits, and reliable medication to avoid adverse effects. Until 2018, the lowest available licenced preparations of hydrocortisone were 10 mg tablets in Europe and 5 mg tablets in the United States. As scored tablets are licensed to be divided into halves, the lowest possible available dose was 5 mg (Europe) and 2.5 mg (US), respectively. However, these doses are not appropriate to treat neonates, infants, and young children with AI, as they require a daily dose of 10 to 15 mg/m², with single doses as low as 0.5 mg. Crushed hydrocortisone tablets suspended in water are often used in some countries, though accurate dosing is not possible, as hydrocortisone does not dissolve well in water and may adhere to plastic material when applied with syringes. Another common practice in pharmacies is to compound hydrocortisone, which is often mixed with sucrose to overcome the inherent bitterness of hydrocortisone. However, a German study demonstrated that up to 25% of compounded batches do not fulfil the acceptance criteria of the European Pharmacopeia in uniformity of net mass or drug content, or are labeled inaccurately. In Europe, hydrocortisone granules have now become licensed for children with AI from birth to 18 years of age and are available in low doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mg. They were developed to address the age group-specific needs of neonates, infants, and young children. As part of the development program, a single dose clinical trial was undertaken in neonates, infants, and children under 6 years of age with AI, the majority of whom had CAH. The children were then invited to participate in a prospective follow-up study of continued treatment with hydrocortisone granules. It was not possible to include a control group for the hydrocortisone granules, as there is no licenced formulation providing a hydrocortisone dose below 5 mg and the regulatory authorities recommended against using compounded medication. This manuscript reports the results of this prospective study.

### Content uniformity of quartered hydrocortisone tablets in comparison with mini-tablets for paediatric dosing [^5c4d2c85]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

While minor fluctuations in doses may be of little significance, as hydrocortisone pharmacokinetics are influenced by a number of factors, including fasting statuspubertyand the time of day, the lowest doses obtained from quartered tablets may be associated with symptoms of cortisol deficiency, and in patients with CAH, loss of ACTH suppression.

As hydrocortisone doses are reduced in a drive to address the long-term morbidity associated with glucocorticoid excess, the margin for error in dosing is lower, and patients are at increased risk for the adverse effects of underdosing due to formulation issues.

Clinical markers of glucocorticoid excess, such as slow growth or excess weight gain, require observation over an extended period, while features of cortisol insufficiency, such as tiredness, nausea or poor concentration may be subjective and difficult to assess in the young child. For this reason, some clinicians advocate the use of 24-hour profiles of cortisol and, in patients with CAH, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) as a tool to determine the adequacy of treatment, and to titrated doses. However, the application of the data obtained from these studies relies on the assumption that hydrocortisone doses are reliable and reproducible over time. Clearly, this is not the case during treatment with quartered 10 mg tablets and this unpredictability makes interpretation of clinical symptoms or biochemical measures unreliable and dose titration and optimisation extremely difficult.

The Ph. Eur. monographstates that a 10% deviation from the mean mass is allowed for tablets weighing ≤ 80 mg is allowed with no more than 2 out of the 20 individual masses deviating from the mean mass by 10%. Based on the mean mass of 59.83 mg, the criteria would allow quartered tablets to have a mass in range 53.85–65.81 mg. However, 33 of the 80 (41.25%) quartered tablets failed to meet this specification.

This signifies the importance of the technique employed during tablet splitting, as there will be inevitably variation from person to person during the operation. Given the relationship between quartered tablet weight and hydrocortisone content (figure 1), it is unsurprising that the coefficients of variation for these data are very similar (table 2).

### Comparison of hydrocortisone 10 mg tablets: tablet hardness optimised for adult use has negative consequences for paediatric use [^6dfad624]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Children's medicines are not always readily available as an age appropriate product and manipulation of adult products is often required. Recently the commercial manufacturing process for 10mg hydrocortisone tablets has changed and the compression force increased due to tablets fracturing on removal from the blister pack. However, this change led to parents of children requiring hydrocortisone reporting that the tablets were more difficult to manipulate. This study evaluated 10mg hydrocortisone tablets for their suitability for manipulation in order to deliver an appropriate dose to children (2mg dose). The physical properties of tablets with the old and new compression force were compared as well as the accuracy of obtaining the paediatric dose.

Methods

The tablets compared were hydrocortisone Auden 10mg tablets (Brand A, PL16876/002)-these are the newer, harder tablets- and hydrocortisone 10mg tablets (Brand B, PL17507/0097). Tablet physical properties including friability (Copley FRV200) and tablet hardness (Copley TBF1000) were compared. The accuracy of split doses (halve and quarter tablets) were recorded on a Sartorius analytical balance. The accuracy of the 2mg paediatric dosing was assessed by crushing the tablet, adding 10mL of water and extracting 2mL. The concentration was measured using UV analysis (Jenway Genova Plus) according to a calibration curve (wavelength = 246nm). Two devices were used to crush the tablets: a spoon onto a plate and a commercially available crushing device (Apothecary Ezy Crush Pill Crusher With Ergo Grip).

Results

As anticipated Brand A tablets were harder (51.85 ± 5.1N) compared to Brand B (30.99 ± 4.1N). Brand A tablets passed the friability testing with < 1% weight loss whereas Brand B failed as 5 tablets broke during testing. The accuracy of split doses using the score lines to halve and quarter the tablets showed that Brand A were generally better with smaller ranges for both halves (Range for A = 41–55%; B = 29–70%) and quarters (Range for A = 17–35%; B = 12–42%) compared to Brand B. The 2mg dosing accuracy was better for Brand B tablets compared to A and crushing tablets using a commercial device improved the accuracy of dosing for both brands of tablets. When crushing using a spoon the mean dose obtained was 1.3mg for Brand A and 1.7mg for Brand B; the commercial crushing device gave values of 1.9mg for Brand A and 2.1mg for Brand B.

Conclusion

Parents or carers who are required to manipulate 10mg hydrocortisone tablets to administer a dose to children dispersed in water should be advised to crush the tablet into a fine powder where possible to improve the likelihood of administering an accurate dose. This is particularly important since the introduction of new hydrocortisone Auden tablets which are known to be harder tablets and therefore more force is required to crush these.

Figure 4.
Administration of on-quarter of a 500-mg azithromycin tablet to a 12-month-old infant. (A) The mother halved the azithromycin tablet (imported product) on the scoring line and unsuccessfully tried to dissolve it in a volume of water that she kept in a recycled soft drink bottle. (B) In a next trial, the mother crushed the tablet bit per bit until she had the powder of approximately one-quarter of the tablet (red arrow), she kept the remnants of the tablet for a next dose. (C) The mother mixed the crushed tablet with the water (see panel A) and forced her infant to swallow it. Disclaimer: Direct identifiers of the antibiotic manufacturers were intentionally masked.

Figure 5.
Poor suspension of azithromycin powder (imported product). (A) Packaging of azithromycin powder for oral suspension included water for reconstitution and dosing devices and was initially found acceptable by the visual inspection. After addition of two of three vials, the volume indicator was already reached (orange arrow); in the absence of a leaflet with the summary of product characteristics or detailed written reconstitution instructions on the package, this created confusion about the required water volume. We observed difficulties obtaining a homogenous suspension despite extensive shaking, and caking of the suspension after < 24 hours (B) with inability to reobtain a homogenous suspension (C). The excipients in this product were not listed. Disclaimer: Direct identifiers of the antibiotic manufacturers were intentionally masked, but cases were separately reported to the national pharmaceutical regulatory authorities.

Inaccurate dosing and biosafety risks were also observed for the use of tablet formulations intended for use in adults. They were used if oral suspension formulations were not available, not affordable, or rejected due to caking. To administer them to infants, all tablets were crushed and mixed with (potentially unsafe) water (Figure 4). Administration of the prescribed dose required splitting of adult-dose tablets (e.g. azithromycin or ciprofloxacin tablets of 500 mg) in less than half in 84.4% (27/32) of antibiotic tablets. Splitting was always performed manually (e.g. with the back of a spoon). There were no splitting devices. Leftovers from tablets after splitting were kept for next doses. Poor palatability and vomiting after administration were frequently observed for both tablets and oral suspensions.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease — one-day oral aspirin desensitization protocols: Two recent publications from U.S. academic centers have highlighted the safety and efficacy of completing an aspirin desensitization with oral aspirin in a single day. For both protocols, the procedure begins with 40 to 40.5 mg of oral aspirin, and proceeds with 81 mg, 162 mg, and then 325 mg every 60 to 90 minutes. The main difference between these 2 protocols is the form of aspirin used: in the 60-minute protocol, dissolved tablets of Alka-Seltzer in solution are used, whereas in the 90-minute protocol, aspirin tablets are cut using a pill cutter. The predissolved nature of the aspirin in the Alka-Seltzer solution may allow for faster absorption and may decrease the time from provocative dose to reaction, therefore shortening the overall length of the procedure. Regardless of the protocol, there is now general agreement that the desensitization can end with a maximum final dose of 325 mg.

### Practical problems with medication use that older people experience: a qualitative study [^20b0f891]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Preparation Before Use

Thirty-eight participants reported problems when preparing their medicine. Eleven participants reported difficulties identifying medicines after removal of their packaging. One participant experienced difficulty distinguishing two different strengths of levodopa/benserazide tablets because of similarity in appearance. This was considered to have the potential to cause discomfort or clinical deterioration because accurate intake is important to control Parkinson's disease (Table 2).

So, if I have this [participant holds up the bottle of levodopa/benserazide], but then it is bigger than this I believe. I find it difficult to tell. When you put them next to each other, it's easier to see. I should have been told this when I was given the instructions. So, at first I was taking them randomly because I couldn't see what I was doing. (Male, 74 years, levodopa/benserazide 100/25 mg and 200/50 mg)

Furthermore, breaking of tablets was reported as difficult or painful (n = 5) or as resulting in unequal parts or crumbles (n = 4). This was considered to have the potential to cause discomfort or clinical deterioration in one participant who was taking phenprocoumon because of the narrow therapeutic index (Table 2).

I have to take half a tablet. There is a nice groove. I have good fingernails that fit nicely into the groove. Nine times out of ten I break the tablet in two, and one-half is so big and the other half so big. So, not the same amount every day. (Male, 73 years, phenprocoumon 3 mg)

### Comparative modelling of foetal exposure to maternal long-acting injectable versus oral daily antipsychotics [^25cf540b]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Estimating foetal exposure is challenging due to the ethical and practical limitations on direct sampling of foetal blood. Consequently, various indirect methods have been used to predict foetal drug levels including pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling, placental tissue sampling, cord blood sampling at delivery, and the use of animal models. Among these, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have gained prominence, allowing for the simulation of in utero maternal-to-foetal drug transfer throughout pregnancy. These models integrate physiological changes occurring in both the mother and the foetus during gestation, providing a dynamic approach to estimate foetal drug exposure across different stages of pregnancy.

Aripiprazole (ARI) and olanzapine (OLZ) are commonly prescribed antipsychotics, targeting serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine receptors. Aripiprazole is metabolised by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 into its active metabolite dehydro-aripiprazole, while olanzapine is metabolised mainly through CYP1A2, CYP2C8, and UGT1A4. Both drugs are available in oral once-daily tablets (aripiprazole: 2–30 mg; olanzapine: 2.5–20 mg) and LAI formulations. The LAI formulation of aripiprazole is available in two distinct forms: aripiprazole once-monthly (AOM) and aripiprazole lauroxil. AOM (Abilify Maintena®) is a monohydrate version of aripiprazole with molecular weight of 466.4 g/mol. Conversely, aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada ®) is a prodrug with a higher molecular weight (660.7 g/mol). AOM comes in 300 mg and 400 mg doses, equivalent to 15 mg and 20 mg daily doses, respectively. The LAI formulation of olanzapine contains olanzapine esterified with pamoic acid which confers sustained-release properties enabling four-weekly intramuscularly (IM) administration at a dose of 300 mg or 405 mg.

In this study, we used PBPK modelling to compare foetal exposure during pregnancy between oral antipsychotics and their therapeutic-equivalent LAI formulations.

Naltrexone HCl/bupropion HCl extended release — indications, dosing, and interactions are as follows. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist and bupropion is an aminoketone antidepressant with relatively weak inhibition of neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, and the Drug Enforcement Agency Schedule is not a scheduled drug. Tablets = 8 mg/90 mg (naltrexone HCl/bupropion HCl extended release), and the tablets should not be cut, chewed, or crushed. Dosing is: Week 1 = 1 tablet in AM, no tablets in PM; Week 2 = 1 tablet in AM, 1 tablet in PM; Week 3 = 2 tablets in AM, 1 tablet in PM; Week 4 and beyond = 2 tablets in AM, 2 tablets in PM (~12 hours after AM dose). Potential drug interactions state it should not be administered with opioids due to the naltrexone component, with all opioids discontinued at least 7 days prior to start of naltrexone HCl/bupropion HCl, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors may increase the risk of hypertensive reactions when used concomitantly.

### Alternative formulations of sorafenib for use in children [^77a8e2f8]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity. In most cases, the commercially available 200mg tablet is not suitable for administration to children. We studied the chemical and physical stability of extemporaneously prepared formulations and evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile of cut tablets and smaller-dosage capsules of sorafenib in children.

Procedure

Commercially available 200mg tablets of sorafenib tosylate were used to prepare liquid suspensions of sorafenib in oil and Ora-Plus(®):Ora-Sweet(®) solution, and to prepare 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100mg capsules. Plasma concentrations of sorafenib were measured in patients receiving capsules and cut tablets, using a validated HPLC-based method with tandem mass spectrometric detection.

Results

At room temperature and under refrigeration, sorafenib concentrations in Ora Plus(®):Ora Sweet(®) were highly variable (means ranging from 75% to 131% of the intended concentration of 50mg/ml). In oil suspension, sorafenib concentrations were inconsistent during compounding. In contrast, all smaller-dosage capsules, except the 5mg capsule, were within 91–99% of the intended content and were stable at room temperature for at least 8 months. Sorafenib pharmacokinetic parameters in patients receiving capsules or cut tablets were consistent with those reported previously in adults and children receiving intact tablets.

Conclusions

Sorafenib is not stable in an oral suspension prepared from commercially available tablets, but compounded capsules in smaller-dosage forms that can be sprinkled on food or cut tablets are alternatives for administration to children who need smaller doses based on body surface area or cannot swallow tablets.

### Content uniformity of quartered hydrocortisone tablets in comparison with mini-tablets for paediatric dosing [^259674c7]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Children requiring cortisol replacement therapy are often prescribed hydrocortisone doses of 2.5 mg, but as this is commercially unavailable 10 mg tablets, with functional break lines, are split commonly in an attempt to deliver the correct dose. This study aimed to determine the dose variation obtained from quartered hydrocortisone tablets when different operators performed the splitting procedure and to ascertain whether better uniformity could be attained from mini-tablets as an alternative formulation.

Methods

Hydrocortisone 10 mg tablets were quartered by four different operators using a standard pill splitter. Hydrocortisone 2.5 mg mini-tablets (3 mm diameter) were formulated using a wet granulation method and manufactured using a high-speed rotary press simulator. The weight and content uniformity of the quartered tablets and mini-tablets were assessed according to pharmacopoeial standards. The physical strength and dissolution profiles of the mini-tablets were also determined.

Results

More than half of all quartered 10 mg tablets were outside of the ± 10% of the stated US Pharmacopoeia hydrocortisone content (mean 2.34 mg, SD 0.36, coefficient of variation (CV) 15.18%) and more than 40% of the quartered tablets were outside the European Pharmacopoeia weight variation. Robust mini-tablets (tensile strengths of > 4 MPa) were produced successfully. The mini-tablets passed the pharmacopoeial weight and content uniformity requirements (mean 2.54 mg, SD 0.04, CV 1.72%) and drug release criteria during in vitro dissolution testing.

Conclusion

This study confirmed that quartering 10 mg hydrocortisone tablets produces unacceptable dose variations and that it is feasible to produce 3 mm mini-tablets containing more accurate doses for paediatric patients.

### Content uniformity of quartered hydrocortisone tablets in comparison with mini-tablets for paediatric dosing [^c10291c5]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Children requiring cortisol replacement therapy are often prescribed hydrocortisone doses of 2.5mg, but as this is commercially unavailable 10mg tablets, with functional break lines, are split commonly in an attempt to deliver the correct dose. This study aimed to determine the dose variation obtained from quartered hydrocortisone tablets when different operators performed the splitting procedure and to ascertain whether better uniformity could be attained from mini-tablets as an alternative formulation.

Methods

Hydrocortisone 10mg tablets were quartered by four different operators using a standard pill splitter. Hydrocortisone 2.5mg mini-tablets (3mm diameter) were formulated using a wet granulation method and manufactured using a high-speed rotary press simulator. The weight and content uniformity of the quartered tablets and mini-tablets were assessed according to pharmacopoeial standards. The physical strength and dissolution profiles of the mini-tablets were also determined.

Results

More than half of all quartered 10mg tablets were outside of the ± 10% of the stated US Pharmacopoeia hydrocortisone content (mean 2.34mg, SD 0.36, coefficient of variation (CV) 15.18%) and more than 40% of the quartered tablets were outside the European Pharmacopoeia weight variation. Robust mini-tablets (tensile strengths of > 4MPa) were produced successfully. The mini-tablets passed the pharmacopoeial weight and content uniformity requirements (mean 2.54mg, SD 0.04, CV 1.72%) and drug release criteria during in vitro dissolution testing.

Conclusion

This study confirmed that quartering 10mg hydrocortisone tablets produces unacceptable dose variations and that it is feasible to produce 3mm mini-tablets containing more accurate doses for paediatric patients.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^3f45cdf4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone — used off-label for pain management: FDA approved for the treatment of opioid dependence or OUD; 2 to 4 mg of buprenorphine or 2/0.5 mg to 4/1 mg of buprenorphine/ naloxone in divided doses should be adequate for most patients. For patients who are on buprenorphine or buprenorphine naloxone for OUD, the current 24-hour dose could be split and divided for BID or TID dosing for pain management, and to avoid precipitating withdrawal when converting from other opioids, initiation with buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual (SL) tablet should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of mild withdrawal are evident. Elderly: Use cautiously and monitor closely. Dosage does not need to be adjusted in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment or renal impairment; avoid in patients with severe hepatic impairment. BUP sublingual tablet contains no naloxone and may be preferred during pregnancy, and buprenorphine/naloxone may be the preferred opioid in patients with comorbid pain and OUD.

Dosing and Administration

Currently orally administered semaglutide is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency, Health Canada, Australia and Japan as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2DM. It is available as 3, 7 and 14 mg oral tablet formulations.
Orally administered semaglutide should be taken on an empty stomach.
Orally administered semaglutide should be swallowed whole with up to half a glass of water equivalent to 120 mL.
Do not split, crush or chew the tablet.
Wait at least 30 min before the first meal or drink of the day or taking other oral medicinal products. Waiting less than 30 min may decrease the absorption of semaglutide.

If a dose is missed, the missed dose should be skipped, and the next dose should be taken the following day. Patient counselling on the administration of the drug is crucial for the effectiveness of orally administered semaglutide.

### Topiramate is more effective than acetazolamide at lowering intracranial pressure [^1fd945aa]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Drugs

The dose of the drug was determined using the 2005 FDA guidance for industry, which describes how to estimate the maximum safe starting dose in healthy volunteers: Human equivalent dose (mg/kg) = rat drug concentration (mg/kg)/6.2. Therefore, to convert the human dose to an equivalent rat dose we used the equation: rat drug concentration (mg/kg) = 6.2 × human dose (mg/kg based on a 60 kg human). The rat clinical dose was calculated using the human single dose, and the rat high dose was equivalent to the human daily dose (Table 1).

Table 1.
Human and rat equivalent doses *.

Previous studies investigating the effects of drugs on ICP administered them via various routes; however, in this study we standardised the delivery route to subcutaneous injection before going on to assess the most promising drugs via their usual route of administration (oral). Acetazolamide (A6011, Sigma-Aldrich), furosemide (F4381, Sigma-Aldrich) and topiramate (13623, Cayman Chemical) were initially dissolved in NaOH and then the pH lowered to 8.7, 7.7 and 7.8 respectively, with hydrochloric acid (HCl). Amiloride HCl (129876–100, Merck Millipore) and Octreotide acetate salt (H-5972, Bachem) were dissolved in sterile water. The stock solutions were further diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) to their final concentrations for subcutaneous injection. Hyperosmolar solutions are known to have ICP lowering effects, therefore we measured the sodium and chloride concentrations of each drug in solution. The osmolarity of the clinical dose acetazolamide solution was equivalent to 2% NaCl, and the high dose acetazolamide solution was equivalent to 4% NaCl. The topiramate, amiloride, octreotide and furosemide solutions' osmolarity were equivalent to 0.9% NaCl. For this reason, we compared the clinical and high dose acetazolamide against controls of 2% and 4% NaCl respectively. All other drugs were compared against a 0.9% NaCl control. Acetazolamide tablets (250 mg) and topiramate tablets (25 mg) were purchased from the Danish pharmacy supply and split into half and a quarter respectively for oral dosing. The drug was ground into a powder and mixed with Nutella®, and Nutella® by itself was used as the placebo.

### Aripiprazole (Abilify asimtufii) [^7295abf1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of aripiprazole ER IM (also known as Abilify Asimtufii, Abilify Maintena):
- **Cognitive difficulties, motor impairment**: use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.
- **Compulsive behavior**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as aripiprazole ER has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- **Dyslipidemia, weight gain, hyperglycemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as aripiprazole ER has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- **Dysphagia**: use caution in patients at risk for aspiration.
- **Exacerbation of syncope, orthostatic hypotension**: use caution in patients with cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disease, pre-existing hypotension, or conditions that may predispose patients to hypotension.
- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as aripiprazole ER has been associated with hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or BP, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia).
- **Neutropenia, agranulocytosis**: use caution in patients with pre-existing low WBC count absolute neutrophil count and a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia.
- **Orthostatic hypotension, syncope**: use caution in patients with known CVD (HF, history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the patient to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications).
- **Seizures**: use caution in patients with seizure disorder or with conditions that may lower the seizure threshold (e.g. cerebrovascular disease).
- **Stroke, TIA**: use caution in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.
- **Tardive dyskinesia**: use caution in patients with motor and sensory instability, especially the elderly women.

### Content uniformity of quartered hydrocortisone tablets in comparison with mini-tablets for paediatric dosing [^57ecac05]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Operator bias

The data obtained by the four individual operators when performing the tablet quartering is summarised in table 2. Although there was no significant difference in the mean weights (P = 0.206) or mean hydrocortisone content (P = 0.253) of the quartered tablets produced by the different operators, there were marked differences in the ranges obtained. All four operators produced quartered tablets outside of the weight variation limits specified. Splitting by operator A resulted in a mean hydrocortisone content of 2.40 mg (96% of the target dose) but had the largest variation between the quantities; 51%–136% of the target 2.5 mg dose per quarter. Operators B and C obtained a mean quarter content of 2.23 and 2.22 mg (89% of 2.5 mg target dose), respectively, and operator C had a much narrower range for the hydrocortisone content in quartered tablets at 78%–103%. Operator D on the other hand obtained a mean hydrocortisone content of 2.51 mg (100.4% of target) but the range was relatively high at 73%–124% of the target dose. The mean hydrocortisone contents for operators B and C were outside of the ± 10% limit stated in the USP. In addition to this, each of the operators had individual quarters that had hydrocortisone contents outside of the ± 10% limit.
