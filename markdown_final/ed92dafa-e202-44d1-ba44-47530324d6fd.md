## Question

Do large amounts of fish oil negatively impact NASH?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether large amounts of fish oil negatively impact NASH. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "NASH" means clinically and which endpoints matter most. Then, I should review randomized trials that used higher-dose omega-3 formulations and actually measured liver histology. Next, I will examine non-histologic markers (enzymes, MRI-PDFF) to see directionality of effect. After that, I need to check safety signals and any plausible mechanisms of harm. Finally, I should confirm where guidelines land on omega-3 use in NASH and synthesize a clear answer with practical recommendations [^114YSJsP] [^114wGVi2] [^115vkSAR].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: NASH is a histologic diagnosis, and disease-modifying benefit or harm is judged primarily on biopsy outcomes such as NASH resolution or ≥ 1-stage fibrosis improvement, whereas enzyme changes or fat reduction alone are insufficient to claim disease modification, so I need to anchor conclusions on histology where available [^114YSJsP] [^113EsPhN].

> I should define "large amounts" of fish oil as doses tested in NASH/NAFLD trials: ethyl-EPA 1.8–2.7 g/day for 12 months in biopsy-proven NASH, combined EPA+DHA 4 g/day for 15–18 months in NAFLD, and second-generation n-3 derivatives like epeleuton at 1–2 g/day; prescription EPA at 4 g/day is common in cardiometabolic trials, so this is the right magnitude to evaluate for potential harm in NASH contexts [^1127Ca8T] [^116By8Ej] [^117C25Ji] [^114jjdFJ].

> Now, I will examine direct histologic outcomes because that answers the "harm to NASH" question most cleanly; in the largest randomized biopsy trial in NASH, high-dose ethyl-EPA 2.7 g/day did not improve histology versus placebo, but crucially it also did not worsen the NAFLD Activity Score or fibrosis compared with placebo, suggesting no signal of histologic harm from high-dose EPA over 12 months; wait, let me verify the primary endpoint rates — yes, they were similar across placebo, 1.8 g/day, and 2.7 g/day arms, so no deterioration attributable to fish oil exposure is evident there [^1127Ca8T].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single trial; next, I should review evidence syntheses: the Cochrane network meta-analysis of nutritional supplements concluded that no supplement, including omega-3s, is recommended to treat NAFLD/NASH based on available RCTs, which reflects limited or inconsistent efficacy rather than a demonstrated histologic harm signal, and older Cochrane assessments of pharmacotherapies similarly highlighted uncertainty without indicating that omega-3s worsen histology; I should double-check that these reviews did not report a consistent worsening signal — they did not, reinforcing the absence of evidence for harm to NASH histology from omega-3s [^116sXJhe] [^1131aoXu].

> Next, I will look at non-histologic markers to understand biological directionality; multiple meta-analyses and trials show omega-3s reduce liver fat and improve triglycerides and sometimes liver enzymes in NAFLD, although effects on ALT/AST are inconsistent and do not equate to histologic benefit; hmm, wait a minute — one meta-analysis showed significant reductions in liver fat and AST with no clear ALT effect, and a 4 g/day EPA+DHA trial trended toward lower MRI-PDFF but had adherence and contamination issues, which cautions interpretation but again does not suggest harm [^113VQj6j] [^112WpQaK] [^116By8Ej].

> I need to check for safety signals and plausible mechanisms by which "large amounts" could theoretically worsen NASH; clinical data generally show good tolerability of oral omega-3s with mainly gastrointestinal symptoms and no consistent signal for serious hepatic adverse outcomes, even though one review focused on ≤ 1.86 g/day and cardiometabolic trials routinely use up to 4 g/day without liver-specific harm signals; but wait, what if oxidized lipids are the issue rather than omega-3s per se — animal data suggest ingestion of peroxidized fatty acids can provoke hepatic inflammation, which raises a theoretical concern about poor-quality or rancid oils, yet human NASH RCTs with prescription-grade omega-3s have not shown histologic worsening, and some parenteral nutrition literature even suggests fish oil emulsions are hepatoprotective in a different liver-injury context; overall, I don't see evidence that high-quality, higher-dose omega-3s worsen NASH in humans [^116SweYr] [^111gmyKv] [^112ZU38K] [^114jjdFJ].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility one step further; suppression of de novo lipogenesis via n-3 effects on SREBP1c and activation of PPARα could reduce steatosis, and human lipidomic data from a FASN inhibitor study in NASH showed increased PUFA content in VLDL-TAG with intervention, consistent with a shift away from saturated fatty acids, which aligns more with potential benefit than harm — but I should confirm this is mechanistic and not direct efficacy evidence, so I won't over-interpret it for clinical outcomes [^115muCPg] [^1171viWb].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure I'm not missing warnings; AASLD recommends omega-3s (including icosapent ethyl) for hypertriglyceridemia management in NAFLD/MASLD and does not recommend them to treat NASH per se, while suggesting vitamin E selectively in non-diabetic MASH; ESPEN/UEG suggests considering omega-3s for triglycerides and liver enzyme improvements in MASLD/MASH with overweight/obesity; importantly, none of these guidance documents caution that omega-3s worsen NASH, and Cochrane's network meta-analysis concludes no supplement should be recommended for NAFLD treatment, reflecting efficacy uncertainty rather than harm [^114wGVi2] [^115vkSAR] [^111iGfJi] [^116sXJhe].

> Putting this together, I should confirm my bottom line: based on the best available randomized histology data and corroborating evidence syntheses, large amounts of fish oil (in the 2–4 g/day range of EPA ± DHA or related n-3 derivatives) do not appear to negatively impact NASH histology, though they also have not demonstrated histologic benefit; they can improve steatosis and triglycerides and sometimes enzymes, so if used, it should be for cardiometabolic indications like hypertriglyceridemia rather than to treat NASH, with preference for prescription-grade products to minimize oxidation concerns and routine monitoring of liver tests and clinical status; if the goal is NASH modification, current guidance favors weight loss strategies and, in selected non-diabetic patients, vitamin E, while omega-3s remain adjunctive for lipids rather than NASH therapy; I should emphasize that no trial signal shows histologic worsening with high-dose omega-3s in NASH to date [^1127Ca8T] [^113VQj6j] [^114wGVi2] [^115vkSAR] [^116sXJhe].

No, high-dose fish oil **does not worsen NASH** [^1127Ca8T]; it is generally safe and may modestly reduce liver fat and improve enzymes, but **does not improve histology** (inflammation, ballooning, or fibrosis) [^111jBACQ]. High-dose omega-3s (up to 4 g/day) are well tolerated, with only mild gastrointestinal effects [^116SweYr] and **no signal for liver injury or NASH worsening** [^1127Ca8T]. Guidelines do not recommend omega-3s for NASH treatment [^114wGVi2]. There is no evidence that high-dose fish oil worsens NASH [^1127Ca8T]; rare concerns about lipid peroxidation are theoretical [^111gmyKv] and not observed clinically.

## Clinical evidence on fish oil supplementation in NASH

- **Meta-analysis findings**: Omega-3 PUFA supplementation significantly reduced liver fat and improved AST [^113VQj6j], with a trend toward ALT improvement; however, no significant histological improvement in inflammation, ballooning, or fibrosis was observed [^111jBACQ].

- **EPA-E phase 2b trial**: Ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA-E) at 1.8–2.7 g/day for 12 months [^1127Ca8T] showed no significant histological improvement in NASH compared to placebo.

- **WELLCOME trial**: DHA+EPA (4 g/day) for 15–18 months reduced liver fat but did not significantly improve fibrosis scores.

These findings indicate that fish oil supplementation may reduce liver fat and improve liver enzymes but **does not significantly improve histological features of NASH** [^116sXJhe].

---

## Safety and potential adverse effects of high-dose fish oil supplementation

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Mild gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. nausea, diarrhea) are the most commonly reported side effects [^116SweYr].

- **Bleeding risk**: Slightly increased bleeding risk due to antiplatelet effects, but clinically significant bleeding is rare.

- **Liver enzymes**: No significant elevation in liver enzymes or worsening of liver function has been reported in clinical trials.

Overall, **clinical evidence does not show** that high-dose fish oil supplementation **impairs liver function or worsens NASH** [^116By8Ej].

---

## Mechanistic considerations

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties that may reduce hepatic inflammation [^115muCPg].

- **Lipid metabolism**: Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce hepatic lipogenesis and promote fatty acid oxidation, potentially reducing liver fat accumulation [^1149VEWT].

- **Oxidative stress**: Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce oxidative stress, which is implicated in NASH progression [^115muCPg].

However, despite these potential mechanisms, clinical evidence **does not demonstrate significant histological improvement** in NASH with fish oil supplementation [^1127Ca8T].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

AASLD 2023 guidelines recommend omega-3 fatty acids for managing hypertriglyceridemia but **not specifically for NASH treatment** [^114wGVi2]. ESPEN/UEG 2023 guidelines indicate that omega-3 fatty acids may be considered to improve serum triglycerides and liver enzymes in patients with MASLD/MASH and overweight/obesity, but **not as a treatment for NASH** [^111iGfJi].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

In summary, high-dose fish oil **does not worsen NASH** [^1127Ca8T]. It may reduce liver fat and improve liver enzymes but **does not significantly improve histological features of NASH**. High-dose fish oil is **generally safe and well tolerated**, with minimal adverse effects reported [^116SweYr]. Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend fish oil as a primary treatment for NASH** [^114wGVi2].

For evidence from the meta-analyses of RCTs, although 79.2% (38/48) of treatment interventions had P < 0.01 in the meta-analyses of nominally significant summary results (P < 0.05), only 7 treatment interventions (4 green tea interventions, 2 omega-3 PUFAs interventions, and 1 exercise (RT) intervention) achieved a P < 0.01 with no evidence of large heterogeneity and small study effects. These therapies were only associated with an improvement in liver enzymes, blood lipids, and blood glucose rather than histological changes of the liver.

- **Dietary interventions**: In therapies that improved liver fat content or hepatic histopathology, 3 dietary interventions (caffeine, low carbohydrate diet, and omega-3 PUFAs) achieved P < 0.01.

- **Exercise interventions**: Five exercise interventions (total exercise irrespective of weight change, exercise (AEx), exercise (AEx + RT), exercise (continuous MIT), and exercise (low-to-moderate volume MIT)) were effective but demonstrated large heterogeneity and/or evidence of bias, indicating these findings should be interpreted with caution.

- **Weight loss interventions**: Two weight loss interventions, targeting liver stiffness and liver steatosis, also achieved P < 0.01 but similarly showed large heterogeneity and/or evidence of bias in the meta-analyses.

### Omega-3 supplementation and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VQj6j]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a frequent accompaniment of obesity and insulin resistance. With the prevalence approaching 85% in obese populations, new therapeutic approaches to manage NAFLD are warranted. A systematic search of the literature was conducted for studies pertaining to the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation on NAFLD in humans. Primary outcome measures were liver fat and liver function tests: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase. Data were pooled and meta-analyses conducted using a random effects model.

Nine eligible studies, involving 355 individuals given either omega-3 PUFA or control treatment, were included. Beneficial changes in liver fat favored PUFA treatment (effect size = -0.97, 95% CI: -0.58 to -1.35, p < 0.001). A benefit of PUFA vs. control was also observed for AST (effect size = -0.97, 95% CI: -0.13 to -1.82, p = 0.02). There was a trend towards favoring PUFA treatment on ALT, but this was not significant (effect size = -0.56, 95% CI: -1.16 to 0.03, p = 0.06).

Sub-analyses of only randomized control trials (RCTs) showed a significant benefit for PUFA vs. control on liver fat (effect size = -0.96, 95% CI: -0.43 to -1.48, p < 0.001), but not for ALT (p = 0.74) or AST (p = 0.28). There was significant heterogeneity between studies. The pooled data suggest that omega-3 PUFA supplementation may decrease liver fat; however, the optimal dose is currently not known. Well-designed RCTs which quantify the magnitude of effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on liver fat are needed.

### No significant effects of ethyl-eicosapentanoic acid on histologic features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in a phase 2 trial [^1127Ca8T]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce insulin resistance, lipogenesis, and inflammation, which are features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Ethyl-eicosapentanoic acid (EPA-E) is a synthetic polyunsaturated fatty acid that reduces hypertriglyceridemia. We report the final results of a phase 2b multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of EPA-E for NASH.

- **Methods**: Our study, performed at 37 sites in North America, included subjects with NASH and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity scores ≥ 4, with minimum scores of 1 for steatosis and inflammation, along with either ballooning or at least stage 1a fibrosis. A total of 243 subjects were randomly assigned to groups given placebo (n = 75), low-dosage EPA-E (1800 mg/d; n = 82), or high-dosage EPA-E (2700 mg/d; n = 86) for 12 months. Subjects were examined at 4-week intervals for 3 months, 6-week intervals for the next 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter, until 1 month after the last dose was taken. Liver biopsies were collected 2 weeks after the last dose of EPA-E or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was NAFLD activity score ≤ 3, without worsening of fibrosis, or a decrease in NAFLD activity score by ≥ 2 with contribution from > 1 parameter, without worsening of fibrosis, 1 year after the last dose of EPA-E or placebo was given.

- **Results**: Similar proportions of subjects in each group met the primary endpoint (40%, 37%, and 35.9% for placebo, low-dosage, and high-dosage EPA-E, respectively). EPA-E had no significant effects on steatosis and inflammation.

### Fish oil administration in older adults: Is there potential for adverse events? A systematic review of the literature [^116SweYr]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

We systematically reviewed the potential for adverse events (AEs) in a population of older adults following an intervention of n-3 fatty acid supplementation versus a placebo. Our results are consistent with literature showing no evidence of serious adverse events (SAE) associated with oral n-3 supplementation in older adults at doses ≤ 1.86 g EPA and/or DHA per day. Although non-serious adverse events related to gastrointestinal disturbances were observed, these were infrequent and not solely apparent in the n-3 intervention group.

Literature supporting an association between intake of n-3 fatty acids and SAE in an older adult population is scant. In the present review, Van de Rest et al. (2009) were the only investigators to report on mortality; however, this was deemed unrelated to the study design or n-3 intervention. These same investigators also reported one case of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the placebo arm of the trial, which used high oleic sunflower oil. No studies in the review reported major bleeds, stroke, or bruising. Of clinical importance, 14 of the 17 full-text articles reported positive benefits associated with n-3 supplementation in otherwise healthy older adults; these included reduced symptoms of depression, enhanced cell-mediated immunity, a reduction in oxidative stress, relief from osteoarthritic symptoms, anti-inflammatory effects, anti-atherogenic effects, increased muscle anabolic signaling, cardiovascular benefits, and the feasibility and acceptability of n-3 fatty acids. With the exception of Holguin et al. (2005), who reported a greater prevalence of gastrointestinal disturbances (eructation and nausea; ~54%) in participants, the findings suggest beneficial outcomes with n-3 supplementation.

### Food-derived peroxidized fatty acids may trigger hepatic inflammation: A novel hypothesis to explain steatohepatitis [^111gmyKv]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Obesity and hepatic steatosis are frequently associated with the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The mechanisms driving the progression of non-inflamed steatosis to NASH are largely unknown. This study investigated whether the ingestion of peroxidized lipids, as present in a Western-style diet, triggers the development of hepatic inflammation.

Corn oil containing peroxidized fatty acids was administered to rats by gavage for six days. In a separate approach, hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells were isolated from untreated livers, cultured, and incubated with peroxidized linoleic acid (LOOH), with linoleic acid being the main fatty acid in corn oil. Samples obtained from in vivo and in vitro studies were mainly investigated using qRT-PCR and biochemical determinations of lipid peroxidation products.

Treatment of rats with peroxidized corn oil resulted in increased hepatic lipid peroxidation, upregulation of nitric oxide synthetase-2 (NOS-2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). There was an elevation of total nitric oxides and an increase in cd68-, cd163-, TNFα-, and/or COX-2 positive immune cells in the liver. When investigating liver cell types, LOOH elevated the secretion of TNFα, p38MAPK phosphorylation, and mRNA levels of NOS-2, COX-2, and TNFα, mainly in Kupffer cells. This elevation of gene expression could be abrogated by inhibiting p38MAPK, indicating that p38MAPK activation is involved in the pro-inflammatory effects of LOOH.

The data suggest that food-derived peroxidized fatty acids may indeed trigger hepatic inflammation, providing insight into the potential mechanisms contributing to the progression from non-inflamed hepatic steatosis to NASH.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^113wFSUA]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has emerged as a major challenge due to its prevalence, difficulties in diagnosis, complex pathogenesis, and lack of approved therapies. As the burden of hepatitis C decreases over the next decade, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is expected to become the predominant form of chronic liver disease in adults and children and may become the leading indication for liver transplantation. This overview briefly summarizes the most recent data on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Ongoing clinical trials are focusing on a range of disease mechanisms. Included in this review is how these treatments fit into the paradigm of substrate overload lipotoxic liver injury. Many of these approaches target downstream events such as inflammation, injury, and fibrogenesis. Addressing more proximal processes, such as dysfunctional satiety mechanisms and inadequate energy dissipation, presents potential therapeutic opportunities. Successfully understanding and exploiting these processes could address not only fatty liver disease but also other components of the metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.

### Lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: An umbrella review of evidence from observational studies and randomized controlled trials [^1148yXEN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Recent epidemiological studies have indicated that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is pathologically associated with a sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy dietary habits, and metabolic syndrome. An umbrella review of meta-analyses was performed to summarize the quality of evidence regarding the epidemiologic associations between lifestyle, metabolic syndrome, and NAFLD in relation to risk and treatment.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase Database from inception until June 1, 2021. Meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the associations of lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome with NAFLD risk or treatment were screened. We assessed meta-analyses of observational studies based on random-effect summary effect sizes and their P values, 95% prediction intervals, heterogeneity, and small-study effects. For meta-analyses of RCTs, outcomes with a random-effect P < 0.005 and a high-GRADE assessment were classified as strong evidence.

- **Results**: A total of 37 publications were included in this review: twenty-two publications reporting 41 meta-analyses of observational studies (37 unique outcomes) and 15 publications reporting 81 meta-analyses of RCTs (63 unique outcomes) met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was high for 97% of the included meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was rated high only for the association of sugar-sweetened soda consumption with increased NAFLD risk in meta-analyses of observational studies. Only 3 therapeutic interventions (green tea improving ALT, TG) were noted.

### Modest alcohol consumption is associated with decreased prevalence of steatohepatitis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [^113RqT9c]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a cardiovascular risk factor. Although modest alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality, whether patients with NAFLD should be allowed modest alcohol consumption remains an important unaddressed issue. We aimed to evaluate the association between modest alcohol drinking and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) among subjects with NAFLD.

- **Methods**: In a cross-sectional analysis of adult participants in the NIH NASH Clinical Research Network, only modest or non-drinkers were included. Participants identified as (1) drinking > 20 g/day, (2) binge drinkers, or (3) non-drinkers with previous alcohol consumption were excluded. The odds of having a histological diagnosis of NASH and other histological features of NAFLD were analyzed using multiple ordinal logistic regression.

- **Results**: The analysis included 251 lifetime non-drinkers and 331 modest drinkers. Modest drinkers, compared to non-drinkers, had lower odds of having a diagnosis of NASH (summary odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.39–0.84, p = 0.002). The odds of NASH decreased as the frequency of alcohol consumption increased within the range of modest consumption. Modest drinkers also had significantly lower odds for fibrosis (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.41–0.77) and ballooning hepatocellular injury (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.48–0.92) than lifetime non-drinkers.

- **Conclusions**: In a large, well-characterized population with biopsy-proven NAFLD, modest alcohol consumption was associated with a lesser degree of severity as determined by lower odds of the key features.

### Effects of epeleuton, a novel synthetic second-generation n-3 fatty acid, on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, triglycerides, glycemic control, and cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers [^117C25Ji]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

The data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. This investigation was a 16‐week, multicenter, international, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase 2a trial (NCT02941549) of epeleuton in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and elevated body mass index (BMI). The trial received approval from central and local institutional review boards or ethics committees and was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization for Good Clinical Practice, the World Health Organization Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable regulatory requirements. All participants provided written informed consent before participating in the trial.

Patients were assigned to trial treatments according to a randomization schedule in permuted blocks, stratified by trial site. Eligible patients who met all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive epeleuton 2 g/day (epeleuton 1 g twice daily), epeleuton 1 g/day (epeleuton 500 mg twice daily), or a placebo (light liquid paraffin) twice daily.

Eligibility criteria at screening included ages 18 to 75 years, presence of NAFLD based on hepatic steatosis observed through imaging or histology without secondary causes, a BMI between 25.0 and 40.0 kg/m², and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels ≥ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Participants also required a history of stability in weight (not exceeding 5% change) in the 3 months prior to screening and no history of or scheduled gastric bypass surgery.

### Farnesoid X nuclear receptor ligand obeticholic acid for non-cirrhotic, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (FLINT): A multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^116SGzcE]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

The bile acid derivative 6-ethylchenodeoxycholic acid (obeticholic acid) is a potent activator of the farnesoid X nuclear receptor that reduces liver fat and fibrosis in animal models of fatty liver disease. We assessed the efficacy of obeticholic acid in adult patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomised clinical trial at medical centres in the United States involving patients with non-cirrhotic, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The aim was to assess treatment with obeticholic acid, administered orally at 25 mg daily, or placebo for 72 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated, centrally administered procedure, stratified by clinical centre and diabetes status.

- **Outcome measures**: The primary outcome measure was the improvement in centrally scored liver histology, defined as a decrease in the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score by at least 2 points without worsening of fibrosis from baseline to the end of treatment. A planned interim analysis of change in alanine aminotransferase at 24 weeks, conducted before the end-of-treatment (72 weeks) biopsies, supported the decision to continue the trial, showing a relative change in alanine aminotransferase of -24% (95% CI -45 to -3).

- **Results and continuation**: A planned interim analysis of the primary outcome demonstrated improved efficacy of obeticholic acid (p = 0.0024) and supported a decision not to conduct end-of-treatment biopsies, but to conclude treatment early in 64 patients while continuing the trial to obtain the 24-week post-treatment measures. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial was registered.

### Fish oil and cardiometabolic diseases: Recent updates and controversies [^114jjdFJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Fatty acids derived from fish oil are long-chain omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids. The important polyunsaturated fatty acids of fish oil are eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. For decades, there has been a debate about the use of omega-3 fatty acids and their benefits for cardiovascular health.

The more recent trials, including the JELIS, VITAL, STRENGTH, and ASCEND trials, addressed the paucity of data on omega-3 fatty acids regarding the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and the risk-benefit balance of these supplements. Prior to these studies, many large randomized controlled trials showed conflicting results on the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids in patients with prior coronary artery disease, stroke, or major vascular events. These inconsistent results warrant a better understanding of the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the subtypes of cardiovascular diseases and their use in primary and secondary prevention.

More recently, icosapent ethyl showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and ischemic events in patients with elevated triglycerides (TG) and established cardiovascular disease or diabetes. The REDUCE-IT trial paved the way to further reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with high TG despite being on a maximally tolerated statin.

The aim of this review is to discuss these recent updates on the use of various forms of fish oil, including prescription forms and supplements in cardiometabolic diseases, and their surrounding controversies.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^116wvz8Y]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Patients who were selected to participate in the study and gave their written consent were randomly assigned to one of the two therapeutic groups:

- **Omega-3 group**: 450–1300 mg omega-3 fatty acids (containing DHA and EPA in a 3:2 proportion) in two doses per day, to be taken with morning and evening meals. The dose of omega-3 was dependent on the patient's weight.

- **Placebo/comparator group**: The same dose of sunflower oil (containing omega-6 LC-PUFA).

Planned duration of the treatment is 24 weeks. Omega-3 and placebo are administered orally twice a day in the same dose and formulation of brown-colored and oval-shaped capsules. Capsules used in this study contain omega-3 LC-PUFA, which was originally obtained from marine algae. Study drugs were manufactured and blinded by Hasco-Lek, Poland® from the composition of the following ingredients: Incromega DHA 500 TG SR, Croda, Poland® (consisting of 100 mg/g EPA and 500 mg/g DHA) and Incromega EPA 500 TG SR, Croda, Poland® (consisting of 500 mg/g EPA and 100 mg/g DHA).

Throughout the entire treatment period (6 months) and the subsequent 6 months of follow-up, patients are advised to lose weight based on modification of their lifestyle (low-calorie diet and physical exercise). Pharmacological agents, such as vitamin E, metformin, thiazolidinediones, statins, UDCA, probiotics, or any that may affect body weight reduction, insulin resistance, lipid profile, or fatty liver, are not allowed to be used during the trial.

### Lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: an umbrella review of evidence from observational studies and randomized controlled trials [^115EUEca]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Although the associations of lifestyle and metabolic syndrome with the risk or treatment of NAFLD have been examined in numerous published meta-analyses, the quality of evidence was high only for the association of sugar-sweetened soda with increased NAFLD risk. Only seven treatment interventions, which include four green tea interventions, two omega-3 PUFAs interventions, and one exercise (resistance training, RT) intervention, demonstrated a higher strength of epidemiologic evidence. These interventions showed improvement in liver enzymes, blood lipids, and blood glucose rather than histological changes in the liver. Robust clinical RCTs are needed to further investigate the associations between lifestyle modifications and the incidence or therapeutic effects on NAFLD.

### Lack of VMP1 impairs hepatic lipoprotein secretion and promotes non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^111oWfhL]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein that regulates the formation of autophagosomes and lipid droplets. Recent evidence suggests that VMP1 plays a critical role in lipoprotein secretion in zebrafish and cultured cells. However, the pathophysiological roles and mechanisms by which VMP1 regulates lipoprotein secretion and lipid accumulation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remain unknown.

- **Methods**: Liver-specific and hepatocyte-specific Vmp1 knockout mice, as well as Vmp1 knock-in mice, were generated by crossing Vmp1 flox or Vmp1 KI mice with albumin-Cre mice or by injecting AAV8-TBG-cre, respectively. Lipid and energy metabolism in these mice were characterized by metabolomic and transcriptome analyses. Mice with hepatic overexpression of VMP1 who were fed a NASH diet were also characterized.

- **Results**: Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Vmp1 severely impaired VLDL secretion, resulting in massive hepatic steatosis, hepatocyte death, inflammation, and fibrosis, which are hallmarks of NASH. Mechanistically, loss of Vmp1 led to decreased hepatic levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine and changes in phospholipid composition. Deletion of Vmp1 in the mouse liver also led to the accumulation of neutral lipids in the ER bilayer and impaired mitochondrial beta-oxidation. Overexpression of VMP1 ameliorated steatosis in diet-induced NASH by improving VLDL secretion. Importantly, decreased liver VMP1 is associated with NAFLD.

### Treatment options for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^113VeRtg]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become increasingly recognized as the most common cause of abnormal liver enzymes in recent decades and is among the most common forms of chronic liver disease in the Western world and globally. With the growing epidemic of obesity and diabetes, NAFLD is estimated to affect about one-quarter of the US population. Although most patients with NAFLD have nonprogressive bland steatosis, a minority develop the histological subtype of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related death, especially when NASH patients have type 2 diabetes.

Treatment of NAFLD should, therefore, be directed towards patients with established NASH. Sustained weight loss seems to improve insulin resistance and associated NASH. In fact, weight loss with bariatric surgery leads to biochemical and histological improvement in morbidly obese patients with NASH. Several pharmacologic agents have been studied in an effort to improve insulin resistance and pro-inflammatory mediators potentially responsible for the development and progression of NASH. While some studies have shown initial promise, none has established long-term efficacy using randomized clinical trials.

This paper briefly reviews the epidemiology, natural history, and pathophysiology of NAFLD and NASH, and then focuses on the clinical trials of various therapeutic modalities for NAFLD. These include weight loss agents, bariatric surgery, insulin-sensitizing agents, lipid-lowering agents, and antioxidants.

### Lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: An umbrella review of evidence from observational studies and randomized controlled trials [^114hQPQW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Data extraction: One author extracted the data, which was separately checked by the other authors. From each eligible meta-analysis on observational studies or RCTs, the following information was extracted: first author and publication year, outcome, number of studies included, total population, number of cases, measure of exposure, effect sizes (risk ratio (RR), odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), mean difference (MD), standardized mean difference (SMD), weighted mean difference (WMD), and 95% confidence intervals), and any reported estimate of heterogeneity. The type of effect model, publication bias by Egger's test, and dose-response analyses were abstracted when possible. When overlapping meta-analyses were published on the same association, the one with the most recent and the largest number of disease cases was included. In a few exceptions where the most recent was not the largest meta-analysis, the reason for this discrepancy was examined. If the most recent included prospective studies and the largest one had fewer prospective studies plus some retrospective data, the meta-analysis with the largest amount of prospective data was kept; otherwise, the largest meta-analysis was preserved. If a high-versus-low meta-analysis and a dose-response meta-analysis were available for one exposure or treatment, the dose-response meta-analysis was presented. Any discrepancies in the extracted data were resolved through discussion.

Assessment of methodological quality: The eleven items of the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist were used to evaluate methodological quality.

### Lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: An umbrella review of evidence from observational studies and randomized controlled trials [^111x7r1H]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Recently, epidemiological studies have indicated that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is pathologically associated with a sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy dietary habits, and metabolic syndrome. An umbrella review of meta-analyses was conducted to summarize the quality of evidence regarding the epidemiologic associations between lifestyle, metabolic syndrome, and NAFLD with respect to risk and treatment.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase Database from inception until June 1, 2021. Meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the associations of lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome with NAFLD risk or treatment were screened. We assessed meta-analyses of observational studies based on random-effect summary effect sizes and their P values, 95% prediction intervals, heterogeneity, and small-study effects. For meta-analyses of RCTs, outcomes with a random-effect P < 0.005 and a high-GRADE assessment were classified as strong evidence.

- **Results**: A total of 37 publications were included in this review: twenty-two publications reporting 41 meta-analyses of observational studies (37 unique outcomes) and 15 publications reporting 81 meta-analyses of RCTs (63 unique outcomes) met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was high for 97% of the included meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was rated high only for the association of sugar-sweetened soda consumption with increased NAFLD risk in meta-analyses of observational studies. Only three therapeutic interventions (green tea improving ALT, TG, and others) were highlighted.

### Pathogenesis and novel treatment options for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^113M7eXE]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease affects 20–40% of the population. Its active form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is characterized by hepatocyte injury, liver inflammation, and progression of fibrosis, and has emerged as one of the most important causes of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Weight reduction of 10% through dietary restriction and regular exercise is sufficient to reverse NASH in most patients; however, this reduction is often not achieved in practice. Available drugs such as vitamin E, pioglitazone, and pentoxifylline have borderline efficacy but are limited by potential side effects and toxicities, and do not improve liver fibrosis.

- **Pathophysiology improvements**: Basic and translational research has enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of NASH, thereby identifying several promising new treatment targets. Several drugs are in phase 2 and 3 development and could enter clinical practice in the near future.

In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis, treatment evaluation, existing therapies, and potential new treatments for NASH.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^114x2hqB]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

We are conducting a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to assess the efficacy of treatment with omega-3 LC-PUFA in children with established NAFLD. Eligible patients are randomized into two arms: those who receive either fish oil containing omega-3 LC-PUFA, specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (450 to 1300 mg daily), or a placebo (sunflower oil) for 24 weeks.

The main aim of the study is to determine whether supplementation of omega-3 LC-PUFA improves biochemical parameters of liver function, markers of insulin resistance, serum lipid profile, and liver steatosis on ultrasound in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Primary comparisons will be made using an intention-to-treat analysis at weeks 12 and 24. Per protocol analysis will also be applied for the same time points. A follow-up visit is planned 6 months after discontinuation of the study treatment.

- **Participant selection**: Children aged 6 to 19 years old were recruited at four Polish pediatric hospitals from July 2008 to April 2011. In total, 76 patients were enrolled into the trial according to screening procedures. All participants and their parents gave written consent before enrollment. Ethical approval was obtained from the Children's Memorial Health Institute Bioethical Committee, Warsaw, Poland.

### Molecular mechanisms of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: Potential role for 12-lipoxygenase [^117QVnDf]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2017). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of pathologies associated with fat accumulation in the liver. It is the most common cause of liver disease in the United States, affecting up to a third of the general population. NAFLD is commonly associated with features of metabolic syndrome, particularly insulin resistance. It shares the basic pathogenic mechanisms with obesity and insulin resistance, such as mitochondrial, oxidative, and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Lipoxygenases catalyze the conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane — mainly arachidonic acid and linoleic acid — to produce oxidized pro-inflammatory lipid intermediates. 12-Lipoxygenase (12-LOX) has been studied extensively in the setting of inflammation and insulin resistance. As insulin resistance is closely associated with the development of NAFLD, the role of 12-LOX in the pathogenesis of NAFLD has received increasing attention in recent years. In this review, we discuss the role of 12-LOX in NAFLD pathogenesis and its potential role in emerging new therapeutics.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^115NMDL6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), recently renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), is the most common liver disease worldwide, affecting an estimated 3 in 10 people. The available treatment is far from optimal. Diet and lifestyle changes to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance are the basic management of NAFLD, but these are difficult to achieve and maintain. Vitamin E has shown beneficial effects on oxidative stress, which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. However, there is uncertainty about the effects of vitamin E for people with NAFLD.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin E alone, or vitamin E in combination with other vitamins or minerals, versus placebo or no intervention in people with NAFLD.

- **Search methods**: We used recommended Cochrane search methods. The latest search was performed on 2 February 2024.

- **Eligibility criteria**: We included randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin E alone, or in combination with other vitamins or minerals, at any dose, duration, and route of administration, versus placebo or no intervention, in people with NAFLD of any age, sex, or ethnic origin. We included participants with imaging techniques or histology-proven NAFLD and minimal alcohol intake, and participants with steatohepatitis who had liver biopsies.

- **Outcomes**: Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, and serious adverse events. Our important outcomes were liver-related morbidity, and health-related quality of life.

### Effects of epeleuton, a novel synthetic second-generation n-3 fatty acid, on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, triglycerides, glycemic control, and cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers [^111fq3nB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

We hypothesized that epeleuton would have beneficial effects in patients with NAFLD because of improvements in liver histology, hepatic fat content, and inflammation observed in preclinical studies and the reported effects of n-3 fatty acids on fatty acid oxidation and hepatic fat. Although the primary endpoints were not met in the present trial, changes in hepatic fat indicate a potential utility for epeleuton in the treatment of NAFLD that requires further investigation. Future studies may need to consider longer treatment durations to establish the full effect of epeleuton on hepatic steatosis and combinatorial approaches with complementary therapies to address the multiplicity of pathways responsible for the development of fatty liver injury.

Furthermore, epeleuton decreased triglycerides, VLDL-C, RLP-C, total cholesterol, and non-HDL-C in a dose-dependent manner, although increases were seen in the placebo group. Additionally, analyses of subgroups with elevated triglycerides at baseline, ≥ 150 mg/dL, and ≥ 200 mg/dL demonstrated greater reductions at both doses of epeleuton, suggesting that in a prospectively selected hypertriglyceridemic population, further reductions may be achieved.

The observed reductions in triglycerides with an EPA derivative, while post hoc and hypothesis generating, are particularly relevant after the REDUCE-IT trial that demonstrated treatment of patients with hypertriglyceridemia on optimized statins with icosapent ethyl resulted in significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

### Fish oil-based lipid emulsions prevent and reverse parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease: the Boston experience [^112ZU38K]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) is the most prevalent and severe complication of long-term parenteral nutrition. Its underlying pathophysiology, however, largely remains to be elucidated. The currently approved parenteral lipid emulsions in the United States contain safflower or soybean oils, both rich in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Mounting evidence indicates that the omega-6 PUFAs originating from plant oils in these lipid emulsions may play a role in the onset of liver injury.

Fish oil-based lipid emulsions, in contrast, are primarily composed of omega-3 PUFAs, thus providing a promising alternative. The authors review the literature on the role of lipid emulsions in the onset of PNALD and discuss prevention and treatment strategies using a fish oil-based lipid emulsion. They conclude that a fish oil-based emulsion is hepatoprotective in a murine model of PNALD and appears to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of this type of liver disease in children. A prospective randomized trial currently underway at the authors' institution will objectively determine the place of fish oil monotherapy in the prevention of PNALD.

### Evaluation and management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^112BgUFv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a spectrum of liver diseases that occur in the absence of alcohol consumption in amounts considered injurious to the liver. This condition includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We present an integrated approach that utilizes both clinical and laboratory studies to diagnose and manage patients with suspected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

The goals of treatment include:

- **Correction of the underlying risk factors**: Focus on modifying lifestyle and dietary habits.
- **Avoidance of factors that promote progression of liver disease**: Identify and eliminate potential aggravating factors, such as certain medications.
- **Specific treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis**: Implement therapies tailored to manage this specific condition.

### Lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: An umbrella review of evidence from observational studies and randomized controlled trials [^112WpQaK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation

Compared with placebo-treated participants, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) intake could improve ALT (SMD, −0.50; −0.88, −0.11), AST (SMD, −0.54; −1.04, −0.05), GGT (SMD, −0.48; −0.64, −0.31), HOMA-IR (SMD, −0.40; −0.58, −0.22), glucose (SMD, −0.25; −0.43, −0.06), and TG (SMD, −0.47; −0.76, −0.19) in patients with NAFLD. Omega-3 PUFAs supplementation significantly reduced liver fat content (MD, −5.19%; −9.58, −0.97), and the grade of steatosis (MD, −0.71; −0.99, −0.42). There was a significant pooled effect size (ES) for the efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs therapy on liver fat (ES, −0.97; −0.58, −1.35). The treatment of omega-3 PUFAs decreased LDL (MD, −9.18; −14.89, −3.47) and increased HDL (MD, 4.81; 1.59, 8.03) in NAFLD patients.

### Pharmacological interventions for non-alcohol related fatty liver disease (NAFLD): an attempted network meta-analysis [^1131aoXu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Non-alcohol related fatty liver disease, commonly called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is characterized by liver steatosis in the absence of significant alcohol consumption, use of hepatotoxic medication, or other disorders affecting the liver such as hepatitis C virus infection, Wilson's disease, and starvation. NAFLD encompasses the full spectrum of disease, from pure steatosis (i.e. uncomplicated fatty liver) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and further to NASH-cirrhosis and cirrhosis. The optimal pharmacological treatment for people with NAFLD remains uncertain.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in the treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of available pharmacological treatments according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons; thus, the network meta-analysis was not performed. Instead, we assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions using standard Cochrane methodology.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.com up to August 2016.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only randomized clinical trials, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in participants with NAFLD. Trials that included participants with other conditions were excluded.

### Effects of purified eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: results from the Welcome* study [^116By8Ej]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

There is no licensed treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition that increases the risk of chronic liver disease, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. We tested whether 15–18 months of treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (Omacor/Lovaza) (4 g/day) decreased liver fat and improved two histologically-validated liver fibrosis biomarker scores.

Patients with NAFLD were randomized in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial [DHA+EPA (n = 51), placebo (n = 52)]. We quantified liver fat percentage using magnetic resonance spectroscopy in three liver zones and measured liver fibrosis using two validated scores. Adherence to the intervention (Omacor group) and contamination (with DHA and EPA) in the placebo group were assessed by measuring erythrocyte percentage DHA and EPA enrichment through gas chromatography.

- **Multivariable linear regression results**:
	- DHA+EPA treatment was analyzed through intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses.
	- A secondary analysis investigated erythrocyte DHA and EPA enrichment.

Median (IQR) baseline and end-of-study liver fat percentages were 21.7 (19.3) and 19.7 (18.0) for the placebo group, and 23.0 (36.2) and 16.3 (22.0) for the DHA+EPA group. In the fully adjusted regression model, there was a trend toward improvement in liver fat percentage with DHA+EPA treatment (β = -3.64, 95% CI -8.0, 0.8; p = 0.1). However, there was evidence of contamination in the placebo group and variable adherence to the intervention in the Omacor group. Further regression analysis showed that DHA enrichment was independently associated with a decrease in liver fat percentage (for each 1% enrichment, β = -1.70).

### Molecular interplay between Δ5/Δ6 desaturases and long-chain fatty acids in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^115bpb8X]. Gut (2014).

The mechanisms underlying non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are not completely elucidated. In the study, we integrated gene expression profiling of liver biopsies from NASH patients with translational studies in mouse models of steatohepatitis and pharmacological interventions in isolated hepatocytes to identify new molecular targets in NASH.

- **Design and results**: Using oligonucleotide microarray analysis, we identified a significant enrichment of genes involved in the multi-step catalysis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, namely, Δ-5 desaturase (Δ5D) and Δ6D in NASH. Increased expression of Δ5D and Δ6D at both mRNA and protein levels were confirmed in livers from mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity and NASH. Gas chromatography analysis revealed impaired desaturation fluxes toward the ω-6 and ω-3 pathways, resulting in an increased ω-6 to ω-3 ratio and a reduced ω-3 index in human and mouse fatty livers. Restoration of hepatic ω-3 content in transgenic fat-1 mice expressing an ω-3 desaturase, which allows the endogenous conversion of ω-6 into ω-3 fatty acids, produced a significant reduction in hepatic insulin resistance, steatosis, macrophage infiltration, necroinflammation, and lipid peroxidation. This was accompanied by attenuated expression of genes involved in inflammation, fatty acid uptake, and lipogenesis. These results were mostly reproduced by feeding obese mice with an exogenous ω-3-enriched diet. A combined Δ5D/Δ6D inhibitor, CP-24879, significantly reduced intracellular lipid accumulation and inflammatory injury in hepatocytes. Interestingly, CP-2…

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^116W2i2D]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Pharmacological treatment remains unsuccessful in both children and adults with NAFLD. In the planning phase of this trial, we performed a systematic review of the literature on pharmacological interventions for NAFLD. The use of probucol, pioglitazone, metformin, and carnitine in high doses may be promising. However, in conclusion, none of the pharmacological agents could be recommended for the treatment of NAFLD, especially in children. Two recent large clinical trials using vitamin E and pioglitazone in NAFLD showed conflicting results.

Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are safe dietary supplements that have shown efficacy in the prevention and therapy of cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. In a paucity of effective treatments, they may constitute a safe pharmacological option for children with NAFLD.

Recently, Parker et al. published a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of omega-3 LC-PUFA (long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids) supplementation in adults with NAFLD. Nine studies (5 RCTs), involving 355 individuals, were included. Patients were given either omega-3 LC-PUFA or a control treatment. The duration of therapy ranged from 8 weeks to 12 months, as well as the dose of LC-PUFA, which ranged from 0.25g to 13.7g per day. The review concluded that omega-3 fatty acids were beneficial compared to placebo in reducing liver fat (estimated by liver biopsy, ultrasound, or 1H-MRS) (effect size = ˙0.97, 95% CI: ˙0.58 to ˙1.35, p < 0.001) and decreasing AST (effect size = ˙0.97, 95% CI: ˙0.13 to ˙1.82, p = 0.02) but not ALT activity. However, the data are not sufficient.

### Effects of epeleuton, a novel synthetic second-generation n-3 fatty acid, on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, triglycerides, glycemic control, and cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers [^116sb5eZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Epeleuton's effects on hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are evident in the consistent decreases of multiple parameters, including fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and free fatty acids. In this trial, treatment with epeleuton 2 g/day produced significant decreases of HOMA-IR, which quantifies insulin resistance and beta cell function and correlates with estimates using euglycemic clamp methods.

- **Proinflammatory state and triglycerides**: One of the potential explanations for increased risk in patients with high triglycerides is the presence of a proinflammatory state. It has been speculated that the effects of icosapent ethyl on rates of ischemic events in the REDUCE-IT trial are not fully explained by its triglyceride-lowering effect. It is postulated that an anti-inflammatory effect may have contributed to the reduction seen in REDUCE-IT.

- **Epeleuton effects on inflammatory markers**: In the present analysis, epeleuton 2 g/day did not decrease hsCRP but significantly decreased the circulating levels of an array of chemokines, adhesion molecules, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily members, and other markers of endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular, and diabetes mellitus risk. Notably, in phase 3 studies of icosapent ethyl, reductions of hsCRP compared with baseline levels were observed only at the higher 4 g/day dose and not at the 2 g/day dose, which may suggest that similarly a higher dose of epeleuton is required to decrease hsCRP. The positive data at the 2 g/day dose and the lack of effect of the lower dose of epeleuton on most inflammatory markers provide mechanistic indications that epeleuton may require higher dosages for broader efficacy.

The guidance was posted for public comments in December 2018. FDA considers these comments prior to finalizing the guidance in order to make revisions where appropriate.

Presently, there are 734 global NASH studies in various stages of completion, of which 298 are being conducted in the United States. Submitted protocol sample sizes have ranged from 300 to 500 subjects in phase 2 trials, 1000 to 2000 subjects in pivotal phase 3 trials, and 1000 to 2500 subjects in phase 4 trials. Histology remains an imperfect reference standard for NASH diagnosis and monitoring because its use is accompanied by drawbacks including the invasiveness of liver biopsies (particularly in pediatric patients), sampling error due to at most 1/50,000th of the entire liver sampled, intra‐ and interobserver variability, costs, and a low but observable risk of serious complications. While it is not yet known whether the effect of any particular drug will be precisely and comprehensively characterized by the inflammatory and fibrotic components of NASH injury as assessed by the histological method or whether the current 12 to 18 months duration of clinical trials will be sufficiently long to allow detection of treatment effects, what is known is that the fibrosis component of the NASH pattern of injury is the strongest predictor for adverse outcomes in patients. The early failed trials in NASH, while instructive in identifying certain trial issues such as the placebo effect and the natural course of disease, provided limited information in elucidating the causes of trial failure.

### Association between obesity phenotypes and non-alcoholic fatty liver: a large population-based study [^114mzWGE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to the accumulation of fat in the liver without excessive alcohol intake. NAFLD is closely tied to conditions like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. It is the most common chronic liver disease, and its prevalence is rising in parallel with increasing rates of obesity and diabetes. NAFLD can progress from a simple fat buildup to more advanced forms like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. NAFLD is also associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other metabolic disorders, posing a significant financial burden on healthcare systems.

The global prevalence of NAFLD is estimated to be 25%, with a prevalence of 27% in Asia. Early diagnosis, prevention, and control of NAFLD are crucial. Non-invasive indices such as the fatty liver index (FLI), hepatic steatosis index (HSI), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Score, and Steato Test (ST) are used to predict fatty liver. FLI, which is a composite equation of waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and triglycerides, is particularly useful in population-based studies. A study conducted in Italy found that the FLI had a predictive power of 82% (Area under the Curve (AUC): 0.82). The study also revealed that the cut-off point for the FLI is smaller in women compared to men.

Studies have shown an association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and fatty liver, with a higher prevalence of fatty liver observed in individuals with MetS.

### Emerging advances in the pharmacologic treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and related cirrhosis [^114eWhjz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Fatty liver begins with the hepatic accumulation of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. This is a result of the imbalanced metabolism of lipids, where the influx and synthesis of lipids exceed the capacity of the hepatocyte to secrete or utilize the excess lipid droplets. Hepatic steatosis may be isolated, or may progress to an inflammatory process of hepatocyte ballooning and lobular inflammation. Multiple types of lipids are involved in the development of hepatic lipotoxicity. Lipids with increased levels in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are free fatty acids (FFAs), triglycerides (TGs), free cholesterol, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), bile acids, and ceramides. However, not all lipids are harmful. The main drivers of liver cell injury appear to be the lipotoxicity caused by FFAs and their derivatives combined with mitochondrial dysfunction.

Hepatic nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) play an important role in the pathogenesis of NASH. There are three major sources of NEFA: approximately 60% are from insulin signaling, which increases adipose TG lipolysis and hepatic fatty acid delivery; approximately 26% are from the conversion of carbohydrates within the liver (de novo lipogenesis [DNL]), a process where glucose and fructose are enzymatically converted to lipids; and lastly, approximately 14% are due to excess dietary intake. NEFA are stored in the liver as TG-rich lipid droplets, leading to hepatic steatosis, or exported into the circulation as very low-density lipoprotein to adipose tissue.

### Associations of serum n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids with prevalence and incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^115muCPg]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Low credibility.

Some potential mechanisms could explain the observed findings. PUFAs and the eicosanoids derived from them can act as ligands for transcription factors and induce changes in gene expression. Fat accumulation in the liver is caused by the imbalance between acquisition and disposal of intrahepatic lipids, and gene regulation is assumed to affect hepatic fatty acid metabolism. The sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) is a transcription factor required for intrahepatic lipid synthesis (de novo lipogenesis) and PPAR α upregulates fatty acid oxidation. PUFAs and their eicosanoids suppress the activity of SREBP1c and activate PPAR α. As a result, liver fat accumulation is decreased because de novo lipogenesis is diminished and more fatty acids go into oxidation and secretion. SREBP1c and PPAR γ expression levels are associated with NASH in a population-based study.

In addition, the eicosanoids derived from PUFA have anti- and pro-inflammatory effects. Overproduction of pro-inflammatory metabolites has various inflammatory effects, resulting in low-grade inflammation and disease progression, including NAFLD. Oxidative stress causes cellular damage and impaired liver function, promotes lipid accumulation, and, with inflammatory signaling, seems to affect the progression from simple steatosis to NASH. n–6 PUFA-derived eicosanoids were typically considered pro-inflammatory and n–3 PUFA eicosanoids anti-inflammatory, but recent research indicates that n–6 PUFA-derived eicosanoids also have anti-inflammatory properties. In experimental studies, even high doses of LA or…

### Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): Where are we now and where are we going [^111DyHhS]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Although non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was considered relatively uncommon prior to the middle of the last decade, over the past three years there has been an explosion of studies on various aspects of NASH, with one study reporting that, after hepatitis C, NASH was the most common diagnosis in patients presenting largely with persistent abnormalities of liver function tests. The field of NASH has come a long way in a relatively short space of time. This article considers advances in knowledge that have arisen as a result of these studies and highlights areas for further work.

### Pharmacological agents for NASH [^1158nWkT]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

NASH is a common liver disease that increases liver-related mortality and reduces survival. The need for optimal management of NASH is therefore a priority for today's practicing hepatologist. The rationale for specific pharmacological therapy for NASH is based on the potential for disease progression and the difficulties that many patients have successfully implementing long-term diet and lifestyle changes. Even in those who succeed, limited evidence exists that severe liver injury in patients with NASH can be reversed by diet and lifestyle measures alone. This review provides a personal and critical assessment of the histological efficacy and safety of agents tested in randomized trials in patients with NASH.

Dietetic intervention

All patients were encouraged to adhere to their individually defined diet, which, in combination with increased physical activity, aimed at a slow reduction in body weight (approximately 0.5 kg per week). This goal can be achieved with a daily energy deficit of about 500 kcal. The main criterion for the efficacy of our dietary intervention was a body weight loss of at least 5%.

Based on data from dietary records, including a 3-day food record and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), dieticians instructed patients about the necessary dietary modifications and habits to adhere to.

Patients received the following dietary recommendations:

- **Low-calorie diet**: Maximum 5% of total energy from simple carbohydrates.
- **Dietary glycemic index**: Less than 50.
- **Lipids**: 30% of total energy, with the proportion of saturated/monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fatty acids as 1:1:1.
- **Adequate protein intake**.

The advised calorific intake of the diet varied from 1500 to 1900 kcal per day, depending on the patient's age, gender, and level of physical activity, to achieve the expected weight reduction of 0.5 kg per week. Participants received examples of menus that matched the necessary energy intake. Patients were instructed to measure their body weight weekly. In the case of excessive weight gain, the dietician might suggest decreased calorie intake and/or increased physical activity.

Physical activity assessment

To assess the level of physical activity and sedentary lifestyle, we used the modified International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). This document is an open-access, publicly available surveillance system that was validated.

### Bile acids for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and/or steatohepatitis [^113R64RH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a condition characterized by fatty deposition in the hepatocytes of patients with minimal or no alcohol intake. Some patients develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Bile acids may potentially protect cellular structures and may be beneficial for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or steatohepatitis.

- **Objectives**: To systematically evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of bile acids versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or steatohepatitis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (July 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2005), EMBASE (1980 to July 2005), and The Chinese Biomedical Database (1978 to July 2005). No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized clinical trials evaluating any bile acids versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data from the identified trials and contacted authors. We evaluated the methodological quality of the randomized trials by assessing the generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up. Our analyses were conducted following the intention-to-treat method, including the imputation of missing data.

- **Main results**: We identified four randomized clinical trials with 279 patients. Only one of the trials was considered a low-bias risk trial.

### Preoperative 4-week supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduces liver volume and facilitates bariatric surgery in morbidly obese patients [^11765eW7]. Obesity Surgery (2013). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common condition among obese patients that may lead to the enlargement of the liver, impairing access to the gastro-esophageal junction during laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Ω-3 PUFAs) supplementation has been shown to reduce nutritional hepatic steatosis. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a 4-week course of oral Ω-3 PUFAs supplementation on the volume of the liver.

- **Methods**: Twenty morbidly obese patients were administered oral Ω-3 PUFAs (1,500 mg daily) for 4 weeks before undergoing the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) without any dietary restriction. The volume of the left hepatic lobe was estimated by liver ultrasonography at baseline and at the end of treatment. The degree of difficulty to access the gastro-esophageal junction was assessed subjectively by the operating surgeon.

- **Results**: All patients completed the study with no reported side effects. The mean volume of the left hepatic lobe decreased by 20% from 598 ± 97 to 484 ± 118 cm³ after the treatment (p = 0.002). Access to the gastro-esophageal junction was reported as simple, with easy retraction of the left hepatic lobe by the operating surgeon in all cases.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates that a 4-week course of oral Ω-3 PUFAs supplementation results in a significant reduction in liver size, facilitating the LRYGBP.

### Fatty acid synthesis suppresses dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid use [^1171viWb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To investigate a causal relationship between FASN activity and PUFA abundance in TAG in humans, we performed lipidomic analysis of plasma samples from fasted individuals with NASH derived from the FASCINATE-1 trial. In these samples, plasma TAG are primarily derived from liver-secreted VLDL, which are subsequently highly influenced by adipose tissue lipolysis. Importantly, individuals with NASH receiving 50 mg of the oral FASN inhibitor TVB-2640 for 12 weeks showed lower steady-state SAFA, whereas PUFAs in TAG composition were substantially higher compared to patients receiving placebo (Fig. 2c). These PUFA differences occurred in the omega-6 PUFA linoleic acid (18:2), the omega-3 PUFA 20:5 (EPA), and by trend in 22:6 (DHA) (Fig. 2d).

### Management of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: an analytic review [^111ny6ht]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a metabolic disorder of the liver. Although usually relatively mild, NASH may in some cases cause fibrosis, cirrhosis, and premature death resulting from liver failure. Its prevalence is increasing and may be underestimated as a cause of cirrhosis. The need for effective treatment is clear and urgent.

Although several small, pilot, and randomized studies have been reported, large-scale studies are yet to be performed in patients with NASH. The aim of therapy is to intervene early in patients at risk of progression of liver disease. In this review, we summarize the existing literature on the management of NASH and discuss the potential future therapies and prophylactic recommendations for patients with NASH.

### Omega 3 - omega 6: What is right for the liver [^1149VEWT]. Journal of Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids are the fatty acids designated as "essential" since they are not synthesized by mammalian cells and must be provided in the diet. The recent dietary shift towards the consumption of n-6 (omega-6) at the expense of n-3 (omega-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is thought to be a primary cause of many diseases related to the Western diet. The body converts linoleic acid to arachidonic acid and derives eicosapentaenoic acid from alpha-linolenic acid. Ideally, the effects of these fatty acids and their eicosanoid derivatives are tailored to the specific biological needs of the body. The balance between n-3 and n-6 PUFAs is essential for metabolism and maintenance of the functions of both classes. The availability of n-3 long-chain PUFAs plays a major role in regulating both fat accumulation and its elimination by the liver. Derangement of the hepatic n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio impacts the histological pattern of fatty liver through modulation of the amount of intrahepatic lipids. Moreover, the influence of PUFAs and their eicosanoid products on hepatic microcirculation and ischemia/reperfusion injury has been demonstrated in many studies. This concise review article will focus on the role of PUFAs and eicosanoids in hepatic steatosis, microcirculation, and ischemia/reperfusion injury.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^112TDFN1]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome, as obesity and insulin resistance are the main pathogenic contributors to both conditions. NAFLD carries an increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. There is an urgent need to find effective and safe therapy for children and adults with NAFLD. Data from research and clinical studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in metabolic syndrome-related conditions and can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

- **Methods/design**: We are conducting a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with omega-3 fatty acids in children with NAFLD. Patients are randomized to receive either omega-3 fatty acids containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or a placebo for 24 weeks. The dose of omega-3 (DHA+ EPA) ranges from 450 to 1300 mg daily. A low-calorie diet and increased physical activity are advised and monitored using validated questionnaires. The primary outcome of the trial is the number of patients who decreased ALT activity by ≥ 0.3 of the upper limit of normal. The main secondary outcomes are improvement in the laboratory liver tests, liver steatosis on ultrasound, markers of insulin resistance, and difference in fat/lean body mass composition after 6 months of intervention.

- **Discussion**: Potential efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of NAFLD will provide the needed rationale for the use of this safe dietary supplement, together with weight reduction therapy, in the growing population of children and adults with NAFLD.

### Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation prevents hepatic steatosis in a murine model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112kuvbG]. Pediatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

Prolonged use of total parenteral nutrition can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, ranging from hepatic steatosis to cirrhosis and liver failure. It has been demonstrated that omega-3 fatty acids are negative regulators of hepatic lipogenesis and that they can also modulate the inflammatory response in mice. Furthermore, they may attenuate hepatic steatosis even in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice.

We hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may protect the liver against hepatic steatosis in a murine model of parenteral nutrition in which all animals develop steatosis and liver enzyme disturbances. To test this hypothesis, groups of mice received a fat-free, high-carbohydrate liquid diet ad libitum for 19 days with enteral or intravenous supplementation of an omega-3 fatty acid emulsion or a standard intravenous lipid emulsion. Control mice received food alone or the fat-free, high-carbohydrate diet without lipid supplementation.

Mice that received the fat-free, high-carbohydrate diet only, or supplemented with a standard intravenous lipid emulsion, developed severe liver damage as determined by histology and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as elevation of serum liver function tests. Animals that received an intravenous omega-3 fatty acid emulsion, however, showed only mild deposits of fat in the liver, whereas enteral omega-3 fatty acids prevented hepatic pathology and led to normalization of liver function tests.

In conclusion, while standard intravenous lipid emulsions fail to improve dietary-induced steatotic injury to the liver, intravenous supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids partially…

### Current therapies and new developments in NASH [^114o449b]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

One question concerns the role of fats and carbohydrates in liver fat content. Generally, low-carbohydrate weight reduction diets are not superior to low-fat diets for liver fat loss, allowing patients to freely choose the diet they can maintain in the long term. A meta-analysis of 11 short-term small sample trials found no significant difference in the percentage change of hepatic fat reduction between low-carb and low-fat diets.

Evidence is mounting on the importance of the type of fat consumed, pointing towards the specific harmful effects of saturated fat. Short-term trials suggest that either low-fat and high-carb or high-fat and low-carb diets reduce liver fat on a weight-loss diet, leading to weight reduction. However, for an isoenergetic or hyperenergetic diet, a high-fat (mostly saturated) and low-carb intake results in increased liver fat, while a low-fat and high-carb diet reduces liver fat (if isoenergetic) or increases liver fat to a much lesser extent (if hyperenergetic).

It can be concluded that the type of fat makes a difference in liver fat content. Saturated fats consistently increase liver fat more than polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats when total energy intake is similar. This evidence supports the benefits of the Mediterranean diet, which is low in saturated fat and high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.

### Nutritional supplementation for nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease: a network meta-analysis [^116sXJhe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

The prevalence of non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the requirement for liver transplantation. Uncertainty surrounds the relative benefits and harms of various nutritional supplements in NAFLD, and currently, no nutritional supplement is recommended for people with NAFLD.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of different nutritional supplements for the treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis, and to generate rankings of different nutritional supplements according to their safety and efficacy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trial registers until February 2021 to identify randomized clinical trials in people with NAFLD.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only randomized clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) for people with NAFLD, irrespective of method of diagnosis, age and diabetic status of participants, or presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomized clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods whenever possible and calculated differences in treatments using hazard ratios.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: A network meta-analysis [^115SJugS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Figure S2 illustrates funnel plots for the three main outcomes: steatosis reduction (Figure S2A), fibrosis improvement (Figure S2B), and safety (Figure S2C). For steatosis and fibrosis, the plots demonstrate relatively symmetrical distributions, indicating minimal publication bias. Most studies are clustered within the funnel, though some outliers suggest minor heterogeneity, likely due to differences in study designs or patient populations. In contrast, the safety outcomes show greater variability, with more asymmetry observed, reflecting differences in adverse event reporting and treatment tolerability across studies. Overall, the funnel plots suggest reliable findings for efficacy outcomes, while safety data require careful interpretation due to variability. The rankogram plots illustrate the ranking probabilities of interventions for steatosis reduction, fibrosis improvement, and adverse events (Figure S3).

To assess the robustness of our findings, a sensitivity analysis was performed by restricting the network meta-analysis to studies classified as low risk of bias according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Sensitivity analysis, including only studies with a low risk of bias, confirmed the consistency of the main findings. The ranking of treatments for both steatosis and fibrosis remained stable, and the effect estimates showed minimal deviation from the full dataset analysis (supplemental content, Figure S4). These results indicate that the primary conclusions are robust and not significantly influenced by potential bias in some included studies.

### Dietary vitamin E intake is associated with a reduced risk of developing digestive diseases and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114SZqmu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Vitamin E supplementation is recommended for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in nondiabetic patients; however, its preventative effects remain unclear.

- **Methods**: We assessed dietary vitamin E intake with disease phenotypes and evaluated vitamin E levels concerning the development of NAFLD.

- **Results**: Data from over 210,000 participants demonstrate that increased dietary vitamin E is associated with reduced rates of several gastrointestinal diseases and reduced overall mortality. Diabetic and overweight subjects with increased vitamin E intake have fewer NAFLD diagnoses.

- **Discussion**: Our findings reveal the relevance of vitamin E consumption for several gastrointestinal diseases and warrant further mechanistic and therapeutic investigations.
