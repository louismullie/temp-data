## Question

What were the depression subgroup results in the NOVA-X trial?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the depression subgroup results were in a trial called "NOVA-X", and to summarize them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "NOVA-X" appears anywhere in the corpus. Then, I should verify if any similarly named trial, like "NOVA", could be related to depression rather than another therapeutic area. Next, I should review depression-specific subgroup analyses present in the packet to ensure I'm not overlooking an indirect mention. After that, I need to consider whether "NOVA-X" could be an alias or sub-study of better-known depression trials. Finally, I will assess source credibility and provide a determination with guidance on next steps [^112xrko9] [^113JASNL] [^116K5Hw7] [^1146Pc4U] [^113WvZpR] [^112cuhKm].

> Let me first confirm the presence of the exact trial name. I systematically scanned the provided materials for "NOVA-X" and found no direct matches; wait, let me verify that I also checked for spacing or hyphen variants like "NOVA X" and "NOVAX" — yes, still negative. I did note a single partial match for "NOVA" in the Zejula label, but I need to ensure that this pertains to depression outcomes before proceeding, because names can mislead across therapeutic areas [^112xrko9] [^113JASNL] [^116K5Hw7] [^1146Pc4U].

> At first glance I wondered if the "NOVA" trial might be related to psychiatric outcomes; hold on, I should verify the drug and indication. The Zejula document's "NOVA" refers to niraparib, a PARP inhibitor evaluated in oncology with subgroup observations in older adults, which clearly places it outside the depression domain, so this is not relevant to depression subgroup analyses; I need to be careful not to conflate oncology trial names with psychiatry trials that sometimes share acronyms by coincidence [^112xrko9].

> Next, I should review depression-specific subgroup analyses actually present in the packet to see what kind of subgroup reporting is available, even if it's unrelated to "NOVA-X". I will now examine the pharmacogenomic-guided antidepressant treatment meta-analyses, which report subgroup differences by region and MDD severity with forest plots indicating stronger effects in Asian countries and in difficult-to-treat MDD, although some subgroup differences are not statistically definitive; this gives a template for how subgroup effects are presented in depression trials and meta-analyses. Let me also consider other exemplars: a curcumin RCT showing a signal in atypical depression, a duloxetine IPD cluster analysis showing larger effects in somatic symptom clusters, and an ICU cohort where a high-symptom subgroup had markedly higher odds of downstream depression, all of which illustrate the styles of subgroup or phenotype-driven results one might expect if "NOVA-X" existed in depression [^113WvZpR] [^112cuhKm] [^113dCRnh] [^114wQSBt] [^113YFxxA].

> But wait, what if "NOVA-X" is an alternative name or sub-study within a labeled depression program, such as esketamine for TRD or MDD with suicidality; I should double-check the canonical naming conventions. The Spravato labeling and pivotal trials are consistently referenced as Study 1 for TRD and Studies 4 and 5 for MDSI, with an additional monotherapy Study 3; I see no alias or cross-reference to "NOVA-X", which makes it unlikely that "NOVA-X" is a hidden or alternative label for these programs [^113JASNL] [^116K5Hw7] [^1146Pc4U].

> I need to assess the credibility hierarchy to ensure I'm not missing a high-level reference. FDA labels, major guidelines, and high-credibility meta-analyses in the packet do not mention a depression trial called "NOVA-X", and the only "NOVA" identified is the niraparib oncology study; given how consistently depression programs are named in FDA labeling and in large network meta-analyses, the absence of "NOVA-X" across these sources further argues that it is not represented in the provided materials [^112xrko9] [^113aeNQ6] [^11644Lxx].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the final determination. There is no information in the provided documents about depression subgroup results from a trial named "NOVA-X"; the only "NOVA" present pertains to an oncology indication and is not relevant to depression outcomes. Recommendation-wise, I would verify the exact trial name and sponsor, consider whether "NOVA-X" is a preliminary, unpublished, or internal designation, and, if the goal is to understand subgroup methodologies or likely reporting formats in depression, refer to the pharmacogenomic meta-analyses and related subgroup or phenotype-stratified studies in this set as exemplars for outcome reporting and interpretation [^112xrko9] [^113WvZpR] [^112cuhKm].

I can't find a depression trial named "NOVA-X" or any **depression subgroup results**. Could you **clarify**:

- **The exact trial name** (e.g. NOVA vs NOVA-X)?
- **The condition studied** (oncology vs depression)?
- **The intervention/drug and population**?

If you meant the oncology NOVA trial (niraparib) [^112xrko9], the label notes no overall safety or effectiveness differences by age but **it doesn't report depression subgroup results**. If you meant a different depression trial, **please specify the drug/intervention and population** so I can locate the correct subgroup data [^113WvZpR].

- **Geriatric use**: In PRIMA, 39% of patients were aged 65 years or older and 10% were aged 75 years or older. In NOVA, 35% of patients were aged 65 years or older and 8% were aged 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness of Zejula were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild (CLcr: 60 to 89 mL/min) to moderate (CLcr: 30 to 59 mL/min) renal impairment. The degree of renal impairment was determined by creatinine clearance as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation. The safety of Zejula in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis is unknown.

- **Hepatic impairment**: For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, reduce the starting dosage of niraparib to 200 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Niraparib exposure increased in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x upper level of normal (ULN) to 3.0 x ULN and any aspartate transaminase (AST) level]. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicity and reduce the dose further if needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ULN), no dose adjustment is needed. The recommended dose of Zejula has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3.0 x ULN and any AST level) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs for the acute treatment of adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113aeNQ6]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

For studies published more than once (i.e. duplicates), we included only the report with the most informative and complete data. Full details of the applied statistical approaches are provided in the protocol. We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and standardized mean differences (SMD, Cohen's d) for continuous outcomes using pairwise and network meta-analysis. In network meta-analysis, we used group-level data; the binomial likelihood was used for dichotomous outcomes, and the normal likelihood was used for continuous outcomes.

The study effect sizes were then synthesized using a random-effects network meta-analysis model. We accounted for the correlations induced by multi-group studies by using multivariate distributions. The variance in the random-effects distribution (heterogeneity variance) was considered to measure the extent of across-study and within-comparison variability on treatment effects. Additionally, in network meta-analysis, we assumed that the amount of heterogeneity was the same for all treatment comparisons. To assess the amount of heterogeneity, we compared the posterior distribution of the estimated heterogeneity variance with its predictive distribution.

To rank the treatments for each outcome, we used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and the mean ranks. The transitivity assumption underlying network meta-analysis was evaluated by comparing the distribution of clinical and methodological variables that could act as effect modifiers across treatment comparisons. We conducted a statistical evaluation of consistency.

### Multimodal fusion of structural and functional brain imaging in depression using linked independent component analysis [^111pQ7vi]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Low credibility.

In conclusion, based on the fusion of structural, diffusion-weighted, and resting-state fMRI data from 241 individuals with or without a history of depression, we identified multimodal and modality-specific components that revealed strong associations with age and sex. None of the components showed a significant association with categorical or dimensional measures of depression, nor any interaction effects with age and sex. Similarly, machine learning revealed low prediction accuracy for classifying patients from controls and predicting symptom loads. This study supports accumulating evidence of small effect sizes when comparing brain imaging features between patients with a history of depression and healthy controls, and indicates the need for more precise methods of stratifying individuals with depression, as well as large sample sizes.

- **Forest plots analysis**: The study includes forest plots of subgroup analyses comparing the efficacy of pharmacogenomic-guided (PGx) and treatment as usual (TAU) antidepressant treatments.

	- **By geographic region**:
		- Subgroup analysis of the 8-week treatment response demonstrated a greater benefit of PGx-guided treatment over TAU in Asian countries (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.81, I² = 0%) compared with non-Asian countries (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.30, I² = 44%). The subgroup difference is significant (p = 0.02, common effect; p < 0.01, random effects).
		- Subgroup analysis of the 8-week treatment remission showed a greater benefit of PGx-guided treatment over TAU in Asian countries (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.07, I² = 0%) compared with non-Asian countries (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.91, I² = 58%). However, the subgroup difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.14, common effect; p = 0.21, random effects).

	- **By MDD severity**:
		- In terms of the 8-week treatment response, PGx-guided treatment was favoured over TAU in the difficult-to-treat MDD group (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.48, I^2 = 0%). However, the effect in the MDD not specified group was uncertain (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.57, I^2 = 68%).

These findings provide critical insights into the advantages of pharmacogenomic-guided treatment in specific subgroups, paving the way for more personalized antidepressant therapies.

### Radiological outcome measures indicate advantages of precontoured locking compression plates in elderly patients with split-depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau (AO41B3) [^1173qoKX]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

Implant-specific subgrouping of elderly patients revealed that open reduction and internal fixations (ORIFs) using precontoured locking compression plates (LCP) were utilized in 20 cases, whereas conventional implants were used in 13 cases. No significant differences were found between the two subgroups regarding age, gender distribution, or the mean size and depression depth of the lateral joint surface fragments. Additionally, there were no significant differences in calculated void volume or frequency of void filling.

The mean Rasmussen Radiological Score (RRS) values were 9.3 ± 0.6, 8.9 ± 0.7, and 8.2 ± 0.8 on the first, second, and third X-rays in the precontoured LCP subgroup, compared to 9.0 ± 0.6, 7.5 ± 1.1, and 5.7 ± 1.6 in the conventional implant subgroup. On the second and third X-rays, the precontoured LCP subgroup displayed significantly higher RRS values than the conventional implant subgroup (P < .001 in both cases).

The corresponding medial proximal tibial angles (MPTAs) were 88.7 ± 0.9, 89.1 ± 1.4, and 89.2 ± 1.4° in the precontoured LCP group, and 88.6 ± 0.9, 91.2 ± 2.7, and 92.6 ± 4.2° in the conventional implant group. The MPTA was significantly higher in the conventional implant group on the second and third X-rays compared to the precontoured LCP group (P = 0.007 and .002, respectively).

Based on the third X-ray, the distribution of the nominal RRS results (excellent, good, fair, and poor outcomes) differed significantly between the two subgroups. In the precontoured LCP group, the distribution was 5, 15, 0, and 0. In contrast, in the conventional implants group, it was 0, 4, 6, and 3 (P < .001).

### The contribution of depressive 'disorder characteristics' to determinations of prognosis for adults with depression: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^113VbJTf]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Meta-analyses of individual patient data (IPD) collected from RCTs can provide an improved understanding of factors associated with prognosis independent of treatment, as they are able to deliver greater power and therefore more precise estimates than individual studies or study-level meta-analyses. A meta-review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including IPD meta-analyses, was conducted to inform the methods and focus of the study. This meta-review established that there is strong evidence of an association between the severity of depressive symptoms pre-treatment and prognosis with particular treatments. However, there is uncertainty over the strength and the clinical importance of the association due to a lack of reporting of effect sizes, and wide confidence intervals (CIs) in the studied effects. As noted, there is also the possibility that these associations are limited to patients receiving particular types of treatment only, given the focus of past studies. Consequently, the evidence may not be useful for clinicians wanting to inform patients of their prognosis before deciding on the type of treatment to start, or in settings where the particular treatments…

### Spravato [^116K5Hw7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Spravato was evaluated in two identical Phase 3 short-term (4-week), randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies: Study 4 (NCT03039192) and Study 5 (NCT03097133), involving adults with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder (MDD) who had active suicidal ideation and intent (MADRS total score > 28). In these studies, patients received treatment with Spravato 84 mg or a placebo nasal spray twice weekly for four weeks. After the first dose, a one-time dose reduction to Spravato 56 mg was permitted for patients unable to tolerate the 84 mg dose. All patients received comprehensive, standard care treatment, including an initial inpatient psychiatric hospitalization and a newly initiated or optimized oral antidepressant (AD) as determined by the investigator. After completing the 4-week treatment period with Spravato or placebo, study follow-up continued through Day 90.

The baseline demographic and disease characteristics of patients in Study 4 and Study 5 were similar between the Spravato plus standard care and placebo nasal spray plus standard care treatment groups. The median patient age was 40 years (range 18 to 64 years); 61% were female; 73% Caucasian and 6% Black; and 63% of patients had at least one prior suicide attempt. Before entering the study, 92% of the patients were receiving antidepressant therapy. During the study, as part of standard care treatment, 40% of patients received AD monotherapy.

### Comparative effectiveness of pharmacogenomic-guided versus unguided antidepressant treatment in major depressive disorder: New insights from subgroup and cumulative meta-analyses [^112cuhKm]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

- **Question**: How effective is pharmacogenomic (PGx)-guided antidepressant treatment compared with treatment-as-usual (TAU) in major depressive disorder (MDD), and how do ethnicity, disease severity, and genetic panel scope influence outcomes?

- **Study selection and analysis**: This systematic review and meta-analysis comprised 13 randomized controlled trials (2013–2024) comparing PGx-guided therapy with TAU in MDD. PubMed, Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Ovid PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched up to December 2024. Outcomes included response and remission rates at 8 and 12 weeks. Subgroup analyses examined ethnicity and MDD severity. Cumulative meta-analyses assessed gene panel size. The pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were calculated to estimate the overall effect.

- **Findings**: PGx-guided treatment significantly improved response rates at 8 weeks (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.43) and 12 weeks (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.43). Remission was significant at 8 weeks (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.57) but not at 12 weeks (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.61). Benefits appeared stronger in the Asian country subgroup compared with the non-Asian country subgroup (interaction p = 0.02), but this requires validation due to the smaller Asian country sample size. No significant subgroup differences were observed between the MDD not-specified and MDD difficult-to-treat subgroups, despite the latter demonstrating significant improvements in both response and remission rates with PGx-guided treatment compared with TAU at 8 weeks. Cumulative analyses showed effect sizes plateaued, with broader panels offering no additional benefit.

### Spravato [^113JASNL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Spravato was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, short-term (4-week), Phase 3 study (Study 1; NCT02418585) in adult patients aged 18 to < 65 years with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Patients in Study 1 met DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) and, during the depressive episode, had not responded adequately to at least two different antidepressants of adequate dose and duration. After discontinuing prior antidepressant treatments, patients in Study 1 were randomized to receive twice-weekly doses of intranasal Spravato (flexible dose; 56 mg or 84 mg) or intranasal placebo. All patients also received open-label concomitant treatment with a newly initiated daily oral antidepressant (AD) (duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, or extended-release venlafaxine) as determined by the investigator based on the patient's prior treatment history. Spravato could be titrated up to 84 mg starting with the second dose based on investigator discretion.

The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of patients in Study 1 were similar for the Spravato and placebo nasal spray groups. Patients had a median age of 47 years (range 19 to 64 years) and were 62% female, 93% Caucasian, and 5% Black. The newly initiated oral AD was an SSRI in 32% of patients and an SNRI in 68% of patients.

In Study 1, the primary efficacy measure was the change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at the end of the 4-week double-blind induction phase. The MADRS is a ten-item, clinician-rated scale.

### Prevention of insulin resistance in adolescents at risk for type 2 diabetes with depressive symptoms: 1-year follow-up of a randomized trial [^112zF3xL]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

Depression is associated with poor insulin sensitivity. We evaluated the long-term effects of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program for prevention of depression on insulin sensitivity in adolescents at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) with depressive symptoms.

- **Methods**: One-hundred nineteen adolescent females with overweight/obesity, T2D family history, and mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms were randomized to a 6-week CBT group (n = 61) or a 6-week health education (HE) control group (n = 58). At baseline, posttreatment, and 1 year, depressive symptoms were assessed, and whole body insulin sensitivity (WBISI) was estimated from oral glucose tolerance tests. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry assessed fat mass at baseline and 1 year. Primary outcomes were 1-year changes in depression and insulin sensitivity, adjusting for adiposity and other relevant covariates. Secondary outcomes were fasting and 2-hour insulin and glucose levels. We also evaluated the moderating effect of baseline depressive symptom severity.

- **Results**: Depressive symptoms decreased in both groups (P < .001). Insulin sensitivity was stable in CBT and HE (ΔWBISI: 0.1 vs. 0.3) and did not differ between groups (P = 0.63). However, among girls with greater (moderate) baseline depressive symptoms (N = 78), those in CBT developed lower 2-hour insulin than those in HE (Δ-16 vs. 16 μIU/mL, P < .05). Additional metabolic benefits of CBT were seen for this subgroup in post hoc analyses of posttreatment to 1-year change.

- **Conclusions**: Adolescent females at risk for T2D decreased depressive symptoms and stabilized insulin resistance through this intervention.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^111VHb8G]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder (MDD), more specifically concerning therapies with no evidence for benefit, the APA 2019 guidelines highlight insufficient evidence to recommend any of the following for patients with MDD:

- **Tai chi**
- **Acupuncture monotherapy**
- **Omega-3 fatty acid monotherapy**
- **SAM monotherapy**
- **Combination of second-generation antidepressants and acupuncture**
- **Combination of second-generation antidepressants and omega-3 fatty acid**
- **Combination of second-generation antidepressants and exercise**

### Association of dietary patterns with depressive symptoms: A harmonised meta-analysis of observational studies [^114FWs3H]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

We developed a standardized protocol to define the analytic sample, create the determinant and outcome variables, select confounders, and perform statistical analyses. The protocol was shared with consortium members and approved prior to starting the analyses. Three studies measured diet and depressive symptoms at a single moment (LASA, NESDA, HELIUS), while the other three studies had measures of depression at multiple moments.

In prospective analyses, we used data from the following cohorts:

- **Whitehall II**: Phase 7 (2002–2004) and phase 9 (2007–2009).
- **InCHIANTI**: Baseline (1998–2000) and phase 2 (2004–2006).
- **ALSWH**: Survey 3 (2001) and survey 5 (2007).

The choice of cohort phase for inclusion in this analysis was based on the availability of diet and depressive symptoms data, a similar follow-up time, and, if possible, a comparable age range of participants.

- **Measures of depressive symptoms**: Four cohorts measured depressive symptoms using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD) scale: Whitehall II, LASA, and InCHIANTI used CESD-20, while ALSWH used CESD-10. In NESDA, depressive symptoms were assessed with the 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS). HELIUS measured depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Anti-depressive medication was self-reported, except in HELIUS, where research staff noted medication as brought in by participants.

Definitions used in the study included:

1. 'Depressive symptoms' – A continuous variable based on the number of depressive symptoms measured.

### Curcumin for the treatment of major depression: a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study [^113dCRnh]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). High credibility.

Curcumin, the principal curcuminoid derived from the spice turmeric, influences several biological mechanisms associated with major depression, namely those related to monoaminergic activity, immune-inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, and neuroprogression. We hypothesized that curcumin would be effective for treating depressive symptoms in individuals with major depressive disorder.

- **Methods**: In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 56 individuals with major depressive disorder were treated with curcumin (500 mg twice daily) or a placebo for 8 weeks. The primary measure was the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated version (IDS-SR30). Secondary outcomes included IDS-SR30 factor scores and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).

- **Results**: From baseline to week 4, both curcumin and placebo were associated with improvements in IDS-SR30 total score and most secondary outcome measures. From weeks 4 to 8, curcumin was significantly more effective than the placebo in improving several mood-related symptoms, demonstrated by a significant group x time interaction for IDS-SR30 total score (F1, 53 = 4.22, p = .045) and IDS-SR30 mood score (F1, 53 = 6.51, p = .014), and a non-significant trend for STAI trait score (F1, 48 = 2.86, p = .097). Greater efficacy from curcumin treatment was identified in a subgroup of individuals with atypical depression.

- **Conclusions**: Partial support is provided for the antidepressant effects of curcumin in people with major depressive disorder.

### Inflammatory exposure and depression in older adults with insomnia: A randomized clinical trial [^111KbkE5]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Within the endotoxin condition, between-group (insomnia vs control) AUC effect sizes were calculated for POMS-D. Insomnia showed greater increases in POMS-D (d = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.16–1.12) and observer-rated mood (d = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.15–1.11). Subgroups categorized by age (60–70 or 71–80 years), sex, race and ethnicity (White or non-White), and BMI (18–24.9 or 25–34.9) showed similar effects; however, the effect was weaker in the oldest subgroup. Further testing of differences in the non-White subgroup was not possible due to the small number of participants in these subgroups.

- **Insomnia effect on depressed mood within the endotoxin condition**: The figure illustrates the effect size of differences in depressed mood between insomnia and control participants in the endotoxin condition across the overall sample and subgroups. Race was self-reported by the participant. The no-effect point is represented as 0 on the x-axis by the dashed vertical line. Some subgroups had wide 95% confidence intervals due to the small sample sizes. BMI indicates body mass index.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (third edition) [^116Puzoy]. APA (2010). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, particularly in relation to peripartum depression, the APA 2010 guidelines recommend offering depression-focused psychotherapy to pregnant or breastfeeding patients. It is advised to consider this as an initial option for patients with mild-to-moderate depression, those preferring psychotherapy, or individuals with a prior positive response to psychotherapy.

### Trajectories of relapse in randomised, placebo-controlled trials of treatment discontinuation in major depressive disorder: an individual patient-level data meta-analysis [^112eZdW4]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

The protective effect of antidepressant medications on depressive relapse is a cornerstone of psychiatry and one that has yielded the recommendation that patients with depression remain on antidepressant treatment for the remainder of their lives. This study analyzed data from four clinical trials aimed at evaluating the risk for relapse when patients who had responded to treatment with fluoxetine or duloxetine were blindly maintained on their medication or switched to placebo. The principal finding was that trajectory-based analyses revealed the same three response trajectories in patients who stayed on their medications or were switched to placebo. This suggests that there is no specific relapse signature associated with antidepressant discontinuation.

The first two trajectories we identified constituted the majority of patients, showed sustained clinical response over 26 weeks, and respected traditional symptom thresholds for remission extremely closely. Individuals in the lowest severity trajectory had low scores and low variability of scores from visit to visit. The middle severity trajectory showed more score instability and slightly higher depression scores (still in the subclinical range). Since both groups had good outcomes, we did not explore differences in characteristics between them in this study. Our main focus was on the relapse trajectory of increasing depression scores, in which about 46% of patients treated with placebo and 33% of patients treated with active medication were categorized.

### Comparative effectiveness of pharmacogenomic-guided versus unguided antidepressant treatment in major depressive disorder: new insights from subgroup and cumulative meta-analyses [^111G67TL]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). Low credibility.

Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the potential effect of prespecified modifiers, including region (Asian countries and non-Asian countries) and the presence of difficult-to-treat major depressive disorder (MDD). Subgroup analysis of 8-week treatment response by geographic region revealed a statistically significant subgroup effect (p = 0.02, common effect; p < 0.01, random effects), indicating that region significantly modifies the comparative effectiveness of PGx-guided versus treatment-as-usual (TAU) approaches. While PGx-guided treatment was favored in both Asian and non-Asian countries, the effect size was greater in Asian countries (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.81, I² = 0%) than in non-Asian countries (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.30, I² = 44%). However, Asian countries included fewer trials and participants (three trials, 384 vs. 387 participants) compared with non-Asian countries (six trials, 2238 vs. 2181 participants), highlighting the need for future validation.

Similar findings were observed for 8-week treatment remission, with both subgroups favoring PGx-guided treatment and a larger effect in Asian countries (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.07, I² = 0% vs. RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.91, I² = 58%), although the test for subgroup differences was not significant (p = 0.14, common effect; p = 0.21, random effects). The uneven distribution of sample sizes between subgroups further underscores the need for additional validation. Due to the limited number of studies reporting response and remission rates at 12 weeks, subgroup analyses were not conducted.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus and peripartum depression: a longitudinal study of a bidirectional relationship [^11443Tsb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

We conducted a multigroup path analysis on normal-weight (n = 247) and overweight/obese (n = 113) subgroups, testing the same model as in the total sample and adjusting for depression scores from a previous time point. The model had a good fit (χ² (4) = 7.03, χ²/df = 1.76, RMSEA = 0.07, SRMR = 0.04, CFI = 0.98). Different results were obtained for the two subgroups.

In the group of women with a normal pre-pregnancy BMI, depression symptoms at T1 predicted GDM at T2 (β = 0.27, p = .005) and GDM at T2 predicted postpartum depression symptoms at T3 (β = 0.22, p = .023). In the overweight/obese subgroup, neither antenatal depression symptoms at T1 predicted GDM at T2 (β = -0.07, p = .683), nor did GDM at T2 predict postpartum depression symptoms at T3 (β = -0.03, p = .837). After adjusting the models for parity, as it was correlated with depression scores at T3, the results remained the same.

### The contribution of depressive 'disorder characteristics' to determinations of prognosis for adults with depression: An individual patient data meta-analysis [^114f11ew]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

There were three sets of variables adjusted for in models of each outcome built for each prognostic factor:

- **The disorder characteristic**: Adjusted for age, gender, and the specific randomized treatment(s) in each study.
- **Addition of depressive symptom severity**: As in the previous model, with the addition of depressive symptom severity.
- **Addition of covariates specific to each prognostic indicator**: As in the previous model, with covariates added specific to each prognostic indicator.

Covariates were added to the models above if they were independently associated with the outcome and prognostic indicator, not multi-collinear with prognostic indicators in the model, not systematically missing, and if they impacted the effect estimate for the association between the prognostic indicator and outcome when included compared to when excluded from the model. Two factors considered a priori to be important covariates (age and gender) were controlled for in all models.

Final models were built with the primary outcomes, adding each prognostic indicator to the model in the order of magnitude of effect from model 3 (one-by-one), and removing those no longer significantly associated with prognosis (at the 5% significance level) after adding subsequent factors. If two items were highly collinear, the one contributing least to the model was removed. In the final models, ordinal variables were re-categorized to assess the associations with prognosis in clinically meaningful groups (e.g. duration items were re-categorized into durations at baseline of less than or equal to 1 year, and greater than 1 year). The explanatory utility of the final models was assessed by considering the amount of variance in depressive outcomes.

### Prevention of incident and recurrent major depression in older adults with insomnia: A randomized clinical trial [^117F9SLB]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Older adults without depression but with insomnia were randomized to receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) or sleep education therapy (SET). All participants fulfilled DSM-IV insomnia disorder criteria. For the subsample who also fulfilled DSM-5 insomnia disorder criteria, results were similar (Figure 3; eFigure 1 in Supplement 2).

- **Survival benefit**: Other exploratory subgroup analyses found a survival benefit in the CBT-I group that was generally consistent with the overall sample; some subgroups (e.g. races other than White) had greater variability, possibly because of small sample sizes.

Race was reported by the participant. Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding. Since 241 individuals (82.8%) in the sample were White, sizes for other ethnic groups (i.e. 7 [2.4%] Asian, 32 [11.0%] Black, 3 [1.0%] Pacific Islander, 6 [2.1%] multiracial) were too small for statistical comparisons. Comorbidity was evaluated by the Charlson Comorbidity Index, with higher scores indicating greater comorbidity disability. All participants fulfilled International Classification for Sleep Disorders, Second Edition, and DSM-IV criteria for insomnia; a subsample met the duration criteria for insomnia disorder as specified by DSM-5.

- **Hazard ratio (HR)**: The no-effect point is 1 on the x-axis; the dashed vertical line indicates the hazard ratio (HR) of 0.51 for the total sample. The HRs were estimated based on an unadjusted Cox proportional hazards regression.

### Pharmacogenomic testing and depressive symptom remission: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective, controlled clinical trials [^116w3kYC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). High credibility.

The systematic review adhered to the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. In PubMed, we used the following search string to identify clinical trials published up to July 12, 2022, assessing the efficacy of PGx-guided antidepressant therapy: ((major depressive disorder OR mood disorder) AND (antidepressant) AND (pharmacogenetic OR pharmacogenomic) AND (prospective OR randomized OR open label OR open-label) AND (trial)). Bibliographies of all research articles were manually reviewed for additional references not identified in our primary search.

Two reviewers independently assessed all articles identified by the search strategy for eligibility using these criteria: (i) prospective, controlled trials examining the efficacy of PGx-guided antidepressant therapy, (ii) inclusion of only adult participants (aged ≥ 18), (iii) availability of remission data or accessible upon request from the corresponding author of the trial, and (iv) publication in English with full-text availability. Articles lacking consensus on eligibility between the two reviewers were evaluated by a third reviewer.

A custom data extraction template was designed to summarize the selected articles, which included authors, year, study design, sample size, trial eligibility criteria, trial duration, and sample characteristics.

### Prozac [^116DWMN4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Prozac was studied in 5- and 6-week placebo-controlled trials with depressed adult and geriatric outpatients (≥ 18 years of age) whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III (currently DSM-IV) category of major depressive disorder. Prozac was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). It was also significantly more effective than placebo on the HAM-D subscores for depressed mood, sleep disturbance, and the anxiety subfactor.

Two 6-week controlled studies (N = 671, randomized) comparing Prozac 20 mg and placebo have shown Prozac 20 mg daily to be effective in the treatment of elderly patients (≥ 60 years of age) with major depressive disorder. In these studies, Prozac produced a significantly higher rate of response and remission as defined, respectively, by a 50% decrease in the HAM-D score and a total endpoint HAM-D score of ≤ 8. Prozac was well tolerated and the rate of treatment discontinuations due to adverse reactions did not differ significantly between Prozac (12%) and placebo (9%).

The efficacy of Prozac 20 mg/day in children and adolescents (N = 315 randomized; 170 children ages 8 to < 13, 145 adolescents ages 13 to ≤ 18) was studied in two 8- to 9-week placebo-controlled clinical trials in depressed outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III-R or DSM-IV category of major depressive disorder.

### An approach to revealing clinically relevant subgroups across the mood spectrum [^113xRx5M]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Individuals diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder (BP1), bipolar 2 disorder (BP2), or major depressive disorder (MDD) experience varying levels of depressive and (hypo)manic symptoms. Clarifying symptom heterogeneity is meaningful, as even subthreshold symptoms may impact quality of life and treatment outcomes. The MOODS Lifetime self-report instrument was designed to capture the full range of depressive and (hypo)manic characteristics.

- **Methods**: This study applied clustering methods to 347 currently depressed adults with MDD, BP2, or BP1 to reveal naturally occurring MOODS subgroups. Subgroups were then compared based on baseline clinical and demographic characteristics, as well as depressive and (hypo)manic symptoms over twenty weeks of treatment.

- **Results**: Four subgroups were identified: (1) high depressive and (hypo)manic symptoms (N = 77, 22%), (2) moderate depressive and (hypo)manic symptoms (N = 115, 33%), (3) low depressive and moderate (hypo)manic symptoms (N = 82, 24%), and (4) low depressive and (hypo)manic symptoms (N = 73, 21%). Individuals in the low depressive/moderate (hypo)manic subgroup had poorer quality of life and greater depressive symptoms over the course of treatment. Those in the high and moderate severity subgroups had greater substance use, longer duration of illness, and greater (hypo)manic symptoms throughout treatment. Treatment outcomes were primarily driven by individuals diagnosed with MDD.

- **Limitations**: The sample was drawn from three randomized clinical trials, and validation is required for this exploratory study.

### WellbutrinXL [^111d3b8i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In these three trials, the percentage of patients who were depression-free (did not have an episode of MDD) at the end of treatment was significantly higher in the bupropion group compared to the placebo group: 81.4% vs. 69.7% for Trial 1, 87.2% vs. 78.7% for Trial 2, and 84.0% vs. 69.0% for Trial 3. When the results from the three trials were combined, the depression-free rate was 84.3% in the bupropion group versus 72.0% in the placebo group.

### Elavil 25 mg [^114z5dWf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

- **Clinical worsening and suicide risk**: Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications. This risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.

Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18–24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients.

### Abilify [^117J8ftB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Abilify in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) was demonstrated in two short-term (6-week), placebo-controlled trials of adult patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD. These patients had an inadequate response to prior antidepressant therapy (1 to 3 courses) during the episode and also showed an inadequate response to 8 weeks of prospective antidepressant therapy with medications such as paroxetine controlled-release, venlafaxine extended-release, fluoxetine, escitalopram, or sertraline. An inadequate response for prospective treatment was defined as less than a 50% improvement on the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17), a minimum HAMD17 score of 14, and a Clinical Global Impressions Improvement rating of no better than minimal improvement. An inadequate response to prior treatment was defined as less than a 50% improvement as perceived by the patient following a minimum of 6 weeks of antidepressant therapy at or above the minimal effective dose.

The primary instrument used for assessing depressive symptoms was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10-item clinician-rated scale used to evaluate the degree of depressive symptomatology. The key secondary instrument was the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), a 3-item self-rated instrument used to assess the impact of depression on three domains of functioning, with each item scored from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extreme).

In the two trials (n = 381, n = 362), Abilify was superior to placebo in reducing mean MADRS total scores.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, specifically concerning therapies with no evidence for benefit, the DoD/VA 2022 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the following treatments in patients with MDD:

- **Meditation**: Insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against use.
- **Biofeedback**: Insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against use.
- **Theta-burst stimulation**: Insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against use.

### Remeronsoltab [^112Eg4oZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Remeron as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in four placebo-controlled, six-week trials in adult outpatients meeting DSM-III criteria for major depressive disorder. Patients were titrated with Remeron from a dose range of 5 mg to 35 mg/day. The mean mirtazapine dose for patients who completed these four studies ranged from 21 to 32 mg/day. Overall, these studies demonstrated Remeron to be superior to placebo on at least three of the following four measures: 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total score; HDRS Depressed Mood Item; CGI Severity score; and Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Superiority of Remeron over placebo was also found for certain factors of the HDRS, including anxiety/somatization factor and sleep disturbance factor.

Examination of age and gender subsets of the population did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings.

In a longer-term study, patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder who had responded during an initial 8 to 12 weeks of acute treatment on Remeron were randomized to continuation of Remeron or placebo for up to 40 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open phase was defined as having achieved a HAM-D 17 total score of ≤ 8 and a CGI-Improvement score of 1 or 2 at two consecutive visits beginning with week 6 of the 8 to 12 weeks in the open-label phase of the study. Relapse during the double-blind phase was determined by the individual investigators.

### Invega [^1143D2D5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Efficacy was evaluated using the PANSS, a validated multi-item inventory composed of five factors to evaluate positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized thoughts, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression. As secondary outcomes, mood symptoms were evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-21) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS).

- **Efficacy results**: The Invega® group in the flexible-dose study (dosed between 3 and 12 mg/day, with a mean modal dose of 8.6 mg/day) and the higher-dose group of Invega® in the two-dose level study (12 mg/day with the option to reduce to 9 mg/day) were each superior to placebo in the PANSS. Numerical improvements in mood symptoms were also observed, as measured by the HAM-D-21 and YMRS. In the lower-dose group of the two-dose level study (6 mg/day with the option to reduce to 3 mg/day), Invega® was not significantly different from placebo, as measured by the PANSS.

Taking the results of both studies together, Invega® improved the symptoms of schizoaffective disorder at the endpoint relative to placebo when administered either as monotherapy or as an adjunct to mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants. An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any evidence of differential responsiveness based on gender, age, or geographic region. There were insufficient data to explore differential effects based on race.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for depression in adults [^116cyWXQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly debilitating, difficult to treat, has a high rate of recurrence, and negatively impacts both the individual and society. One potential treatment for MDD is n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFAs), also known as omega-3 oils, which are naturally found in fatty fish, some other seafood, and certain nuts and seeds. Various lines of evidence suggest a role for n-3PUFAs in MDD; however, the evidence is not conclusive. Reviews and meta-analyses clearly demonstrate heterogeneity between studies. Investigations into this heterogeneity suggest varying effects of n-3PUFAs, depending on the severity of depressive symptoms. No effects of n-3PUFAs are found in studies of individuals with mild depressive symptomatology, but there may be possible benefits in individuals with more severe depressive symptoms. Hence, establishing their effectiveness in treating MDD is important. This review updates and incorporates an earlier review with the same research objective by Appleton in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (also known as omega-3 fatty acids) versus a comparator (e.g. placebo, antidepressant treatment, standard care, no treatment, wait-list control) for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, including trial registries and grey literature sources up to 9 January 2021. We checked reference lists and contacted authors of included studies for additional information.

### Self-reported symptoms in ICU patients and their impact on long-term outcomes-a prospective multicenter study [^113YFxxA]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The aim was to identify possible associations between patient symptom subgroups, identified while in the ICU, adjusted for clinical and demographic variables, and PICS outcomes three months after ICU admission.

- **Methods**: A prospective multi-center cohort study was conducted. Based on reported symptom prevalence in the ICU, patients were categorized into Low, Middle, or High symptom subgroups. PICS outcomes were measured using validated questionnaires, including the Katz Index, Cognitive Failure Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Impact of Event Scale, three months after ICU admission. Possible associations between ICU symptom subgroups and dichotomized PICS outcomes were modeled using conditional backward logistic regression.

- **Results**: We included 175 patients with a median age of 62 years (interquartile range 49–70), and 65.1% were males. Three months after ICU admission, 23.5% had physical disability, 12.1% cognitive failure, 18.3% anxiety, 16.6% depression, and 16.7% post-traumatic stress. In multivariate analyses, patients in the High symptom subgroup compared to Low/Middle symptom subgroups had higher odds for worse outcomes in all PICS domains. The odds ratios (95% CI) were 3.31 (1.25–8.78) for physical disability, 3.56 (1.20–10.60) for cognitive failure, 3.70 (1.41–9.67) for anxiety, 4.74 (1.79–12.58) for depression, and 4.38 (1.49–12.84) for post-traumatic stress, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: A subgroup of patients with a high symptom burden during ICU stay had worse physical, cognitive, and mental health outcomes three months after ICU admission compared to patients with lower symptom burdens.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^112uaLqC]. APA (2019). High credibility.

For the management of major depressive disorder, particularly in elderly patients with minor depression, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following options for patients with subthreshold or minor depression:

- **CBT (internet)**: For treating subthreshold depression.
- **CBT (individual) and usual care**: Recommended for minor depressive disorder.
- **CBT (group) and usual care**: Effective for treating minor depressive disorder.
- **Combination**: Suggests combining CBT and usual treatment over a combination of individual talking control and usual care in older adult patients with minor or major depressive disorder (MDD).
- **Life review course (group)**: Preferred over an educational video in older adult patients with subclinical depression.
- **Problem-solving therapy (individual)**: Recommended as an effective intervention.
- **Paroxetine**: A suggested pharmacological option.

### Rexulti [^113gSSLa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Rexulti in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) was evaluated in two 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies of adult patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD, with or without symptoms of anxiety, who had an inadequate response to prior antidepressant therapy (1 to 3 courses) in the episode and who had also demonstrated an inadequate response throughout the 8 weeks of prospective antidepressant treatment (with escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine controlled-release, sertraline, duloxetine delayed release, or venlafaxine extended release). Inadequate response during the prospective antidepressant treatment phase was defined as having persistent symptoms without substantial improvement throughout the course of treatment.

Patients in Study 1 (NCT01360645) were randomized to receive Rexulti 2 mg once a day or placebo. Patients in Study 2 (NCT01360632) were randomized to receive Rexulti 1 or 3 mg once a day, or placebo. For patients randomized to Rexulti, all initiated treatment at 0.5 mg once daily during Week 1. At Week 2, the Rexulti dosage was increased to 1 mg in all treatment groups and either maintained at 1 mg or increased to 2 mg or 3 mg once daily, based on treatment assignment, from Week 3 onwards. The dosages were then maintained for the 4 remaining weeks.

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 6 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10-item clinician-related scale used to assess the degree of depressive symptoms.

### Psychological interventions to prevent the onset of major depression in adults: A systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis [^112E61t3]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Psychological interventions are increasingly discussed as a method to prevent major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults who already experience subthreshold depressive symptoms. In this individual participant data meta-analysis, we quantify the effect of preventive interventions against control on MDD onset in this population and explore effect modifiers.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis, we screened full texts of eligible studies within the Metapsy research domain for articles on psychological interventions for depression, from database inception to May 1, 2023. The studies were published in English, German, Spanish, and Dutch. We included individual participant data from randomized trials comparing psychological interventions with a control group regarding their effects on MDD onset in adults with subthreshold depressive symptoms but no MDD at baseline, confirmed by standardized diagnostic interviews. The risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool. Effect on the onset of MDD (the primary outcome) and moderators were analyzed using one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis. Survival analyses were conducted to examine effects on time to MDD onset within 12 months. We involved people with related lived experience in the study design and implementation.

- **Findings**: 30 of 42 eligible randomized controlled trials with 7,201 participants (2,227 [30.9%] male, 4,957 [68.9%] female, and 17 [0.2%] preferred not to report their sex) were included in our analysis.

### Evidence for a vagal pathophysiology for bulimia nervosa and the accompanying depressive symptoms [^1123Jwk1]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

The bilateral vagus nerves (Cranial X) provide both afferent and efferent connections between the viscera and the caudal medulla. The afferent branches are increasingly recognized for their significant input to the central nervous system in modulating complex behaviors. In this paper, we review evidence from our laboratory that increases in vagal afferent activity are involved in perpetuating binge-eating and vomiting in bulimia nervosa. Preliminary findings also suggest that a subgroup of depressive disorders may have a similar pathophysiology.

- **Methods**: Two main approaches were used to study the role of vagal afferents. Ondansetron (ONDAN), a 5-HT3 antagonist, was employed as a pharmacological tool for inhibiting or reducing vagal afferent neurotransmission. In addition, somatic pain detection thresholds were assessed to monitor a physiological process modulated by vagal afferents, including the gastric branches involved in meal termination and satiety. High levels of vagal activity result in an increase in pain detection thresholds. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) was used to identify higher cortical brain areas activated by vagal stimulation due to proximal gastric distention in normal eating subjects.

- **Results**: Double-blind treatment of severe bulimia nervosa subjects with ONDAN resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in binge-eating and vomiting compared to placebo controls. The reduction in abnormal eating episodes was accompanied by a rapid decrease in depressive symptoms, as measured by BDI scores.

### The prevalence and risk of developing major depression among individuals with subthreshold depression in the general population [^113sPfVR]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Statistically significant differences in prevalence estimates were found among different age groups (Q = 14.32, p = 0.008), with the youth group exhibiting the highest prevalence [6287/32,037, (14.17%, 95% CI 8.82–20.55%)], followed by the elderly group [13,725/10,522, (12.95%, 95% CI 11.41–14.58%)], and the adult group [58,247/997,462, (8.92%, 95% CI 7.51–10.45%)] (see Fig. 2).

In studies conducted in the United States, the prevalence was [30,757/274,144, (15.36%; 95% CI 12.66–18.26%)] compared to those conducted outside the United States [47,502/860,577, (8.99%, 95% CI 7.77–10.28%)] (Q = 14.51, p = 0.001). When further stratified by continent or region, statistically significant differences were evident (Q = 274.16, p < 0.001), with North America showing the highest prevalence (15.36%, 95% CI 12.66–18.26%) (see Fig. 2 and online Supplementary Fig. S2 in the supplemental data).

Meta-analytic analysis between cross-sectional studies [57,725/686,501, (11.01%, 95% CI 9.6%–12.5%)] and longitudinal studies [20,534/448,220, (11.1%, 95% CI 8.46–14.05%)] did not reveal statistically significant differences (Q = 0.00, p = 0.951). Furthermore, prevalence estimates from primary-care samples [759/4752, (12.50%, 95% CI 6.85–19.54%)] were similar to those from community-based samples [76,741/1,125,217, (10.89%, 95% CI 9.61–12.22%)] (test for subgroup differences, Q = 0.35, p = 0.618) (see Fig. 2).

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1137zVc3]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, particularly in elderly patients with comorbidities, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following options for patients with both depression and a complicating factor:

- **Combination of CBT and usual care**: This approach is suggested for patients with minor or major depressive disorder (MDD) combined with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

- **Multicomponent intervention for depression**: This intervention is recommended for treating symptoms of depression in temporarily homebound African American adults.

- **Coping improvement rather than psychotherapy on request**: For older adults with mild-to-severe depressive symptoms and HIV, group-based coping improvement is advised over individual psychotherapy upon request.

### Symbyax [^114hQEtj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.

Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients.

### Highlights of the international consensus statement on major depressive disorder [^116Z6gJu]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The International Consensus Group on Depression gathered to outline a universal treatment algorithm for depression, aiming to merge the evidence base and standards of clinical practice from various countries, including the United States, Europe, the Middle East, China, and Japan. This brief summary includes the following recommendations made by the consensus group:

- **Periodically screen** all patients for depression.
- **Use measurement-based tools** and conduct full psychiatric assessments to complete differential diagnoses.
- **Refer patients** to psychiatric specialists when appropriate.
- **Establish a therapeutic alliance** with patients and their families.
- **Begin treatment with an antidepressant** for moderate or severe depression.
- **Treat patients to remission** and continually monitor patients' symptomatic improvement.

### Spravato [^1146Pc4U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

SPRAVATO was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study (Study 3; NCT04599855) to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SPRAVATO nasal spray, 56 mg and 84 mg, when administered as monotherapy in adult patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Patients met DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) and had not responded adequately to at least two different antidepressants of adequate dose and duration. Upon discontinuation of prior antidepressant treatments, patients were randomized in a 1:1:2 ratio to receive twice-weekly doses of intranasal SPRAVATO 56 mg, SPRAVATO 84 mg, or intranasal placebo for four weeks.

The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of patients were similar across the SPRAVATO and placebo nasal spray groups. The median age was 46 years (range 19 to 76 years), with 61% of patients being female, 87% Caucasian, and 7% Black.

The primary efficacy measure was the change from baseline in the MADRS total score at Day 28. SPRAVATO 56 mg and 84 mg monotherapy demonstrated statistical superiority on the primary efficacy measure compared to placebo nasal spray.

- **Time course of treatment response**: In Study 3, the key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline to Day 2 (approximately 24 hours) in the MADRS total score. The improvement at Day 2 demonstrated by SPRAVATO 56 mg and 84 mg monotherapy showed statistical superiority when compared to placebo nasal spray.

### Radiological outcome measures indicate advantages of precontoured locking compression plates in elderly patients with split-depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau (AO41B3) [^112DpWUc]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: All patients aged 18 years or older with tibial plateau fractures and who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) between January 2010 and December 2016 were retrospectively identified in the hospital's database. Preoperative X-rays and CT-scans were used to classify the fractures according to the AO/OTA classification system. The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied:

- **Inclusion criteria**: AO41B3-fractures to the lateral tibial plateau as classified according to the AO/OTA; ORIF utilizing either precontoured locking compression plates (LCP) or conventional dynamic compression plates and lag screws; complete radiological assessment including preoperative X-rays and CT scans, as well as X-rays taken immediately postoperatively (1st X-ray), approximately 6–8 weeks postoperatively (2nd X-ray), and approximately 12 months postoperatively (3rd X-ray).

- **Exclusion criteria**: Tibial plateau fractures classified as other than AO41B3; polytraumatized patients; patients with open fractures, pathologic fractures, or chain injuries of the affected limb; incomplete radiological assessment.

Age, gender, date of surgery, void filling, and dates of subsequently conducted postoperative radiological examinations were collected from the patients' records. Initial grouping was conducted based on the patients' age. Patients between 18 and 49 years of age were categorized as young, and patients aged 50 and above were considered elderly. In order to analyze the implant-specific effect on the radiological outcome, further investigations were carried out after subgrouping both age groups according to the implant utilized (precontoured LCP).

### Viagra [^115Jd3sM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

A review of population subgroups demonstrated efficacy regardless of baseline severity, etiology, race, and age. Viagra was effective in a broad range of patients with erectile dysfunction (ED), including those with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, other cardiac diseases, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, depression, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), radical prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), spinal cord injury, and in patients taking antidepressants/antipsychotics and antihypertensives/diuretics.

### Association between depression and concurrent Type 2 diabetes outcomes varies by diabetes regimen [^114bdA2p]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The study aims to explore the hypothesis that depression has a relationship with glycaemic control and diabetes-related quality of life (DQOL) in patients prescribed injected insulin, as opposed to those on oral glucose-lowering agents alone. Although depression displays weak correlations with various Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) outcomes, these associations may be concentrated within certain vulnerable patient subgroups.

Participants in this study included 103 individuals on insulin and 155 on oral glucose-lowering agents alone, all recruited from a large US healthcare system. They underwent assessments of glycaemic control, including glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), medication adherence, diabetes self-care behaviours, DQOL, and levels of depression categorized as none, mild, or moderate/severe.

The results revealed a significant interaction between diabetes regimen and depression on HbA(1c) (P = 0.002), indicating that depression was associated with HbA(1c) in insulin users (beta = 0.35, P < 0.001) but not in those on oral agents alone (beta = -0.08, P = NS). A similar interaction was observed when analyzing quality of life as an outcome (P = 0.002). Notably, neither of these effects was mediated by regimen adherence.

In conclusion, while the general association between depression and glycaemic control is weak, it is particularly pronounced among patients using insulin. Likewise, the association between depression and life quality related to illness is most substantial in patients prescribed insulin. Given that the findings are not linked to adherence issues stemming from depression, psychophysiological mechanisms unique to insulin-prescribed patients may be at play.

### Anafranil [^114CQtC5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience a worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide.

There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing the worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders.

Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24. In fact, there was a reduction in suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients.

### Depression symptom clusters and their predictive value for treatment outcomes: Results from an individual patient data meta-analysis of duloxetine trials [^114wQSBt]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2014). Low credibility.

We evaluated individual patient data from phase II to IV clinical trials of duloxetine in major depressive disorder (MDD) (34 studies, 13,887 patients). Our goal was to identify clusters of patients with similar depressive symptom patterns at baseline, as measured by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), and to investigate their respective predictive value of outcomes as measured by the HAMD-17 total score. Five clusters were identified at baseline: 1) "Lack of insight"; 2) "Sleep/sexual/somatic"; 3) "Typical MDD"; 4) "Gastrointestinal/weight loss"; and 5) "Mild MDD". However, it should be noted that cluster descriptors are not mutually exclusive.

Analyses of the HAMD-17 total score results over time were performed using the 18 randomized placebo and/or actively controlled studies representing 6723 patients. At the end of acute treatment (ranging from 4 to 36 weeks), different levels of effect sizes for active therapy (64.5% duloxetine) vs. placebo were detected by cluster. In 3 out of 5 clusters (representing about 80% of the patients), the effect size was significantly different from 0, in favor of active therapy. The effect size was largest in those clusters with severe somatic symptoms ("Sleep/sexual/somatic" cluster [-0.4170] and "Gastrointestinal/weight loss" cluster [-0.338]).

In conclusion, our cluster analysis identified 5 clinically relevant MDD patient clusters with specific mean treatment outcomes. Identification of MDD clusters may help to improve outcomes by adapting MDD treatment to particular clinical profiles.

### Discriminating bipolar depression from major depressive disorder with polygenic risk scores [^116VwF6j]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Although accurate differentiation between bipolar disorder (BD) and unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) has important prognostic and therapeutic implications, the distinction is often challenging based on clinical grounds alone. In this study, we tested whether psychiatric polygenic risk scores (PRSs) improve clinically based classification models of BD versus MDD diagnosis.

- **Methods**: Our sample included 843 BD and 930 MDD subjects similarly genotyped and phenotyped using the same standardized interview. We performed multivariate modeling and receiver operating characteristic analysis, testing the incremental effect of PRSs on a baseline model with clinical symptoms and features known to associate with BD compared with MDD status.

- **Results**: We found a strong association between a BD diagnosis and PRSs drawn from BD (R² = 3.5%, p = 4.94 × 10⁻¹²) and schizophrenia (R² = 3.2%, p = 5.71 × 10⁻¹¹) genome-wide association meta-analyses. Individuals with top decile BD PRS had a significantly increased risk for BD versus MDD compared with those in the lowest decile (odds ratio 3.39, confidence interval 2.19–5.25). PRSs discriminated BD versus MDD to a degree comparable with many individual symptoms and clinical features previously shown to associate with BD. When compared with the full composite model with all symptoms and clinical features, PRSs provided modestly improved discriminatory ability (ΔC = 0.011, p = 6.48 × 10⁻⁴).

- **Conclusions**: Our study demonstrates that psychiatric PRSs provide modest independent discrimination between BD and MDD cases, suggesting that PRSs could be a valuable tool in distinguishing these conditions.

### Effect of long-term supplementation with marine omega-3 fatty acids vs placebo on risk of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms and on change in mood scores: A randomized clinical trial [^115iepyd]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

The study VITAL-DEP was published in 2021 in JAMA. It addresses major depressive disorder. The study question was: what is the effect of long-term supplementation of marine omega-3 fatty acids in older adults without clinically relevant depressive symptoms? The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT).

The population included 18,353 patients (9,023 female and 9,330 male). Inclusion criteria were adults aged ≥ 50 years at risk of incident depression or risk of re-depression. Key exclusion criteria were significant depressive symptoms, history of alcohol or substance disorder, use of psychotropics, hypothyroidism, major neurologic disorder, or delirium episode in the past 12 months.

The interventions were as follows: 9,171 participants received omega-3 (1 g/day of fish oil, including 465 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 375 mg of docosahexaenoic acid); 9,182 received a matching omega-3 placebo. The primary outcome measured a significant increase in the incidence of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms (13.9 events/1000 person-years vs. 12.3 events/1000 person-years; HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.26).

Safety outcomes showed no significant differences in suicide, gastrointestinal bleeding, easy bruising, stomach upset, or pain. The conclusion was that in adults aged ≥ 50 years at risk of incident depression or re-depression, omega-3 was inferior to placebo.

### Radiological outcome measures indicate advantages of precontoured locking compression plates in elderly patients with split-depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau (AO41B3) [^114TJDGb]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

The radiological follow-up of all patients included revealed no significant differences in the Rasmussen radiological score (RRS) or the medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) between young and elderly patients prior to implant-specific subgrouping.

- **Precontoured LCP versus conventional implants in young patients**: Implant-specific subgrouping of the young patients revealed open reduction and internal fixation (ORIFs) utilizing precontoured locking compression plates (LCP) and conventional implants in 13 cases of each group. Across the two subgroups, no significant differences were found regarding age, gender distribution, mean size and depression depth of the lateral joint surface fragments, calculated void volume, or frequency of void filling.

The mean RRS value was 9.3 ± 1.0, 9.0 ± 1.0, and 8.5 ± 1.5 on the first, second, and third X-ray in the precontoured LCP subgroup compared to 9.3 ± 0.8, 8.0 ± 0.8, and 6.9 ± 1.6 in the conventional implant subgroup. On the second and third X-ray, the precontoured LCP subgroup featured significantly higher RRS values compared to the conventional implant subgroup (P = 0.02 and 0.015, respectively).

The corresponding MPTAs were 88.6 ± 2.2, 89.1 ± 2.2, and 89.1 ± 2.1° in the precontoured LCP group and 88.2 ± 0.8, 91.1 ± 2.0, and 91.5 ± 1.9° in the conventional implant group. The MPTA was significantly higher in the conventional implant group on the second and third X-rays compared to the precontoured LCP group (P = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively).

### Hypothalamic volume, sleep, and APOE genotype in cognitively healthy adults [^115i7sPt]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Because age is the most important predictor of AD pathology, we undertook a subgroup analysis to assess sleep in younger versus older participants. The cohort with complete PSQI scores, depression, APOE genotype, and hypothalamic volume was split into two groups based on the median age and analyzed separately ("older": ≥ 55 years, n = 437; "younger": < 55 years, n = 420). Due to the small number of APOE ε4 homozygotes in each group (older: n = 19, younger: n = 31), we combined APOE ε4 homozygotes and heterozygotes for this analysis.

In both subgroups, depressive symptoms were associated with more sleep dysfunction (P [FDR] < 0.01 for PSQI global and all component scores). Within the younger subgroup, age, sex, or APOE ε4 status did not significantly predict PSQI global or component scores. However, in the older subgroup, increasing age was associated with less sleep disturbances (B = 0.19[SE = 0.04], P [FDR] < 0.001) and more frequent use of sleeping medications (B = -0.12[SE = 0.04], P [FDR] < 0.01).

In addition, in the older subgroup, APOE ε4 carriers had a higher PSQI global score (B = 0.43[SE = 0.22], P = 0.047) compared to non-carriers, which was driven by worse sleep quality (B = -0.66[SE = 0.26], P [FDR] = 0.07) and sleep latency (B = -0.58[SE = 0.26], P [FDR] = 0.09). This effect remained significant when adding the volume of each hypothalamic subunit to the model. APOE genotype significantly moderated the association between the anterior-superior (B = 0.13[SE = 0.04], P [FDR] = 0.02) and superior-tubular regions.

### Effect of dexmedetomidine on postpartum depression in women with prenatal depression: A randomized clinical trial [^115DyopJ]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study "Dexmedetomidine in PPD" was published by Yingyong Zhou and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Network Open. This study is related to peripartum depression.

- **Study question**: What is the effect of dexmedetomidine on postpartum depression in women with prenatal depression?
- **Study design**: Multi-center, open-label, RCT.
- **Population**: A total of 338 female patients. The inclusion criteria were adult women with prenatal depression undergoing Cesarean delivery.
- **Interventions**:
	- **Dexmedetomidine group (n = 169)**: Loading dose of intravenous infusion of 0.5 mcg/kg for 10 minutes after delivery, followed by dexmedetomidine plus sufentanil via patient-controlled intravenous analgesia for 48 hours.
	- **Control group (n = 169)**: Loading dose of intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline for 10 minutes after delivery, followed by sufentanil via patient-controlled intravenous analgesia for 48 hours.
- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant decrease in the incidence of positive postpartum depression screening at 7 days postpartum (12.6% vs. 32.1%; RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.62).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- A significant decrease in positive postpartum depression screening incidence at 42 days postpartum (11.4% vs. 30.3%; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61).
	- A significant decrease in the rate of suicidal ideation at postpartum day 7 (1.2% vs. 5.5%; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 1).

### Modifiable dementia risk factors associated with objective and subjective cognition [^111Wg8E4]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

In the secondary analyses, we first tested whether the associations between risk factors and objective and subjective cognition change after controlling for depression. The analyses, as described in the primary analysis section, were run again, with the addition of controlling for depression as measured by the CES‐D scale. This was conducted for 12 of the 13 original risk factors, excluding depression itself.

Next, we evaluated whether the associations between all 13 risk factors and cognition differed by age. This subgroup analysis focused only on those combinations of independent and dependent variables whose associations were previously significant. We conducted the same series of regressions as in the primary analysis, predicting objective and subjective cognition from each of this reduced set of risk factors. This time, we controlled for gender and age, including an added interaction term (i.e. age × risk factor). A Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple comparisons, dividing α = 0.05 by the number of interaction terms of interest, understanding each combination of independent and dependent variables as one comparison.

### Lexapro [^114satPV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcomes and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness based on these patient characteristics.

In a longer-term trial, 274 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder, who had responded during an initial 8-week, open-label treatment phase with Lexapro 10 mg or 20 mg daily, were randomized to continuation of Lexapro at their same dose or to placebo for up to 36 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open-label phase was defined by having a decrease of the MADRS total score to ≤ 12. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase of the MADRS total score to ≥ 22 or discontinuation due to insufficient clinical response. Patients receiving continued Lexapro experienced a statistically significant longer time to relapse compared to those receiving placebo.

- **Pediatric patients 12 years of age and older**: The efficacy of Lexapro as a treatment for major depressive disorder in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years was established in an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study. This study compared Lexapro (10 mg to 20 mg daily) to placebo in outpatients aged 12 to 17 years who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). The primary outcome was the change from baseline to endpoint in the Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRS-R). In this study, Lexapro showed a statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the CDRS-R.

### Continuation of antidepressants vs sequential psychological interventions to prevent relapse in depression: An individual participant data meta-analysis [^117Kqkz9]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Depression frequently recurs, and to prevent relapse, antidepressant medication is often taken long-term. Sequentially delivering a psychological intervention while tapering antidepressant medication might be an alternative to long-term antidepressant use. However, evidence is lacking on which patients may benefit from tapering antidepressant medication while receiving a psychological intervention, and which should continue the antidepressant therapy. A meta-analysis of individual patient data with more power and precision than individual randomized clinical trials or a standard meta-analysis is warranted.

- **Objectives**: To compare the associations between using a psychological intervention during and/or after antidepressant tapering versus antidepressant use alone on the risk of relapse of depression. Additionally, to estimate associations of individual clinical factors with relapse.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and PsycInfo were last searched on January 23, 2021. Requests for individual participant data from included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were sent.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials that compared the use of a psychological intervention while tapering antidepressant medication with antidepressant monotherapy were included. Patients had to be in full or partial remission from depression. Two independent assessors conducted screening and study selection.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Of 15,792 screened studies, 236 full-text articles were retrieved, and 4 RCTs that provided individual participant data were included.
