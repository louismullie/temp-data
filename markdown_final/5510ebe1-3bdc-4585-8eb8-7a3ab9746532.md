## Question

I have a child 18 months old required boluses 60ml/lg and still hypotensive, i can not give inotropes. But I need to give more boluses can I and what is my limit

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether additional fluid boluses can be given to an 18‑month‑old who remains hypotensive after 60 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid, and what the safe upper limit should be if inotropes cannot be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is septic shock versus another shock phenotype. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for fluid limits in settings with and without intensive care. Next, I will review the FEAST trial and related evidence to understand the harm signal and how it applies here. After that, I need to check physiologic considerations in toddlers, including blood volume and the risk of fluid overload. Then, I should outline a cautious, reassessment‑driven approach if fluids must continue without inotropes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and explicitly state the upper limit and monitoring plan, anchoring to Surviving Sepsis Campaign and WHO‑aligned guidance [^113icEQE] [^1123NGhr].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. An 18‑month‑old with persistent hypotension after 60 mL/kg of boluses is in fluid‑refractory shock; in pediatrics, hypotension is a late sign, so ongoing poor perfusion despite this volume already signals high severity and likely myocardial dysfunction or vasoplegia, which is precisely where inotropes/vasopressors are typically indicated in higher‑resource settings [^1177TWRh] [^114X2k49].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline thresholds before jumping to more fluids. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests up to 40–60 mL/kg total bolus in the first hour in PICU‑available settings, titrated to perfusion and stopped if overload appears; beyond this, they advise initiating vasoactive support rather than escalating fluids further, which directly addresses this scenario of persistent hypotension after 60 mL/kg [^112cjA4o] [^1178Adns] [^116CwrXY]. In low‑resource settings without PICU, the panel suggests a more conservative cap of up to 40 mL/kg total bolus if hypotension is present, again with strong caution and frequent reassessment; importantly, in the absence of hypotension, they recommend against boluses altogether in such settings [^115sMxGw] [^115ceCYM].

> Hold on, I should review the harm data to ensure I'm not over‑extending fluids. The FEAST randomized trial in sub‑Saharan African children without PICU access showed a 45% relative increase in 48‑hour mortality with 20–40 mL/kg boluses versus no bolus, with excess deaths largely from cardiovascular collapse rather than fluid overload; this is the pivotal evidence underpinning the conservative stance in non‑PICU environments and the caution against liberal bolusing beyond early, limited volumes [^1141yL8i] [^1126o3Vx]. Let me double‑check the WHO perspective as well; multiple analyses have argued that continuing to recommend routine boluses despite FEAST risks harm, reinforcing the need to individualize and limit total bolus exposure when advanced support is unavailable [^114yYSur] [^112MUxYd].

> I need to ensure the physiologic context is sound. A toddler's estimated blood volume is roughly 80 mL/kg, so 60 mL/kg already approaches three‑quarters of circulating volume; beyond this, the likelihood of hemodilution, interstitial leak, and pulmonary edema rises, especially in sepsis‑related capillary leak, and the hemodynamic response to additional crystalloid becomes progressively blunted as filling pressures increase [^notfound]. But wait, what if the child is profoundly vasodilated and "needs" more preload? Even then, without inotrope support, further boluses may not restore MAP and can worsen edema and respiratory failure, so the risk‑benefit balance shifts against more fluids after this point [^111rt34K].

> Let me consider the scenario of no inotropes available. I should confirm that guidelines still advise moving to vasoactives after 40–60 mL/kg if shock persists; if vasoactives truly cannot be given, the default is not unlimited fluids but a cautious, reassessment‑driven approach with a hard cap and vigilant monitoring for overload, recognizing that this is suboptimal and carries high risk [^116CwrXY] [^1123NGhr]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "give up to 20 mL/kg more", but I should correct that impulse; even 10–20 mL/kg beyond 60 mL/kg pushes total volume into a range associated with harm in FEAST and with diminishing returns in septic shock physiology, so any additional bolus must be exceptional, small, and contingent on clear, transient improvement in perfusion [^1141yL8i] [^111rt34K].

> Next, I should review what to monitor so I don't miss fluid overload. I need to check for rales, new or worsening hepatomegaly, jugular venous distension, gallop rhythm, and escalating oxygen requirements; serial lactate, capillary refill, heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output should guide whether any additional small bolus is justified, and any sign of overload should immediately halt further boluses [^116hTqFZ] [^114VAo5u]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines emphasize stopping when overload appears; yes, SSC explicitly instructs discontinuation of boluses if signs of fluid overload develop, which is critical here [^1123NGhr].

> I will now examine a practical, harm‑minimizing path if absolutely no vasoactives are available. Let me first confirm that the current total is indeed 60 mL/kg; if so, I would not give more now. If, after reassessment, there remains severe hypotension with clear signs of inadequate perfusion and absolutely no signs of overload, I would consider a single, small rescue bolus of 5–10 mL/kg over 15–30 minutes with immediate reassessment, not to exceed a cumulative total of 70 mL/kg in the first hour; if there is no meaningful improvement in blood pressure, capillary refill, or lactate, I would stop and pivot to supportive care, blood products if anemic, and urgent transfer to a center with PICU and vasoactive capability, acknowledging that this strategy is extrapolated and lower‑certainty [^116iTHvP] [^114X2k49]. Wait, I should double‑check that 70 mL/kg sits within accepted ranges; in low‑resource guidance, caps around 40 mL/kg are advised, so exceeding that is a risk‑tolerant compromise justified only by dire hypotension and absent alternatives, with explicit documentation of rationale and monitoring [^115sMxGw].

> Let me reconsider the upper limit and state it plainly. Given the totality of evidence and guidance, the practical ceiling without inotropes should be 70 mL/kg total in the first hour, delivered in 5–10 mL/kg aliquots with strict reassessment, and only if there is a transient, clinically meaningful response; beyond this, the risk of harm clearly outweighs benefit in septic shock without vasoactive support, and fluids should be stopped in favor of supportive care and transfer [^116iTHvP] [^1141yL8i]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with both high‑ and low‑resource recommendations; yes, both SSC and WHO‑aligned analyses converge on limiting total bolus exposure and prioritizing vasoactives thereafter, which supports this cap as a conservative, safety‑focused threshold in the absence of inotropes [^114X2k49] [^112MUxYd].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses alternatives and escalation. If any vasoactive support becomes available, epinephrine or norepinephrine should be started peripherally or intraosseously without delay, as this is the recommended next step after 40–60 mL/kg in persistent shock; if not, arrange urgent PICU transfer, correct anemia with transfusion if indicated, and maintain strict fluid balance surveillance to avoid fluid accumulation, which itself is associated with worse outcomes in critically ill children [^116CwrXY] [^114X2k49] [^115xFudM].

You **should not give more fluid boluses** to an 18-month-old who remains hypotensive after 60 mL/kg of boluses, especially if inotropes cannot be used. The maximum safe total is **60 mL/kg in the first hour** [^112cjA4o]; beyond this, the risk of fluid overload and harm is high [^notfound]. If hypotension persists, prioritize **early inotrope/vasopressor support** [^116CwrXY] via peripheral or intraosseous access [^114X2k49] and escalate to ECMO or transfer to a tertiary center if available. If inotropes are absolutely unavailable, use small, cautious boluses (5–10 mL/kg) only with close monitoring for signs of fluid overload, and stop immediately if there is no improvement or if overload develops [^116hTqFZ].

---

## Recommended fluid resuscitation limits

- **Initial resuscitation**: 10–20 mL/kg boluses over 5–10 minutes, up to 40–60 mL/kg in the first hour [^112cjA4o], titrated to clinical response and stopped if signs of fluid overload develop [^1178Adns].

- **Maximum total fluid**: 60 mL/kg in the first hour [^112cjA4o]; exceeding this increases risk of fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and respiratory failure [^notfound].

- **Reassessment**: After each bolus, reassess for improved perfusion, blood pressure, and signs of fluid overload (hepatomegaly, pulmonary edema, respiratory distress) [^116hTqFZ].

---

## Risks of exceeding recommended fluid limits

Exceeding 60 mL/kg in the first hour **increases the risk of**:

- **Fluid overload**: Pulmonary edema, respiratory distress, and worsening cardiac function [^116hTqFZ].

- **Increased mortality**: The FEAST trial showed higher 48-hour mortality with bolus fluids in pediatric septic shock [^1141yL8i].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, and hypernatremia [^111CJgFx].

---

## Alternative interventions when inotropes cannot be used

If inotropes are contraindicated or unavailable, **consider**:

- **Vasopressors**: Epinephrine or norepinephrine via peripheral or intraosseous access [^114X2k49] if central access is not available [^116CwrXY].

- **ECMO**: Early consideration for refractory shock if available.

- **Transfer**: Urgent transfer to a tertiary center with pediatric critical care capabilities.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends 40–60 mL/kg in the first hour [^112cjA4o], titrated to response, with **early initiation of vasoactive support** if shock persists [^116CwrXY]. The **FEAST trial** found increased mortality with bolus fluids in pediatric septic shock, underscoring the need for caution and close monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Stop fluids**: Do not exceed 60 mL/kg total in the first hour [^112cjA4o].

- **Monitor closely**: Watch for signs of fluid overload after each bolus [^116hTqFZ].

- **Use vasoactives**: Start epinephrine or norepinephrine if shock persists after 60 mL/kg [^116CwrXY].

- **Consider ECMO or transfer**: If refractory shock persists, escalate support and transfer as needed.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Do not exceed **60 mL/kg of fluid boluses** in the first hour for an 18-month-old with persistent hypotension. The risk of harm outweighs benefit beyond this threshold. Prioritize early vasoactive support and escalate to ECMO or transfer if shock persists.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric guidelines — fluid bolus in low-resource settings: For children without signs of fluid overload where advanced supportive and intensive care is not available, the panel recommends against bolus fluid administration in the first hour if hypotension is not present, and suggests administering up to 40 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10–20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour if hypotension is present; for the subset with septic shock and hypotension, the panel suggests cautious administration of fluid bolus therapy as a weak recommendation based on low quality of evidence. For this weak recommendation, hypotension can be defined as systolic blood pressure less than 50 mm Hg in children younger than 12 months old, less than 60 mm Hg in children 1 to 5 years old, and less than 70 mm Hg in children older than 5 years old, or by World Health Organization criteria of cold extremities with prolonged capillary refill greater than 3 seconds and weak, fast pulse; WHO recommends 10–20 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid over 30–60 minutes, followed by an additional 10 mL/kg over 30 minutes if condition has not improved and there are no signs of fluid overload, cardiac failure, or neurologic deterioration. In a FEAST analysis of children with moderate hypotension, fluid bolus therapy was not beneficial or harmful compared with maintenance fluid only (RR of death = 1.48; 95% CI, 0.61–3.66; p = 0.41), while among children reclassified as meeting all three WHO shock criteria mortality was 48% in the bolus groups versus 20% in the control group (p = 0.07), a very small proportion of FEAST participants (only 72 [2.3%] with moderate hypotension and 65 [2%] meeting full WHO shock criteria).

### Fluid bolus administration in children, who responds and how? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Hc3qX]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid boluses are frequently utilized in children. Despite their frequency of use, there is little objective data regarding the utility of fluid boluses, who they benefit the most, and what the effects are.

Aims

This study aimed to conduct pooled analyses to identify those who may be more likely to respond to fluid boluses as well as characterize clinical changes associated with fluid boluses.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis was conducted to identify pediatric studies investigating the response to fluid boluses and clinical changes associated with fluid boluses.

Results

A total of 15 studies with 637 patients were included in the final analyses with a mean age of 650days ± 821.01 (95% CI 586 to 714) and a mean weight of 10.5 kg ± 7.19 (95% CI 9.94 to 11.1). The mean bolus volume was 12.14ml/kg ± 4.09 (95% CI 11.8 to 12.5) given over a mean of 19.55min ± 10.16 (95% CI 18.8 to 20.3). The following baseline characteristics were associated with increased likelihood of response [represented in mean difference (95% CI)]: greater age [207.2days (140.8 to 273.2)], lower cardiac index [-0.5 ml/min/m 2 (-0.9 to -0.3)], and lower stroke volume [-5.1 ml/m 2 (-7.9 to -2.3)]. The following clinical parameters significantly changed after a fluid bolus: decreased HR [-5.6 bpm (-9.8 to -1.3)], increased systolic blood pressure [7.7mmHg (1.0 to 14.4)], increased mean arterial blood pressure [5.5mmHg (3.1 to 7.8)], increased cardiac index [0.3 ml/min/m 2 (0.1 to 0.6)], increased stroke volume [4.3 ml/m 2 (3.5 to 5.2)], increased central venous pressure [2.2mmHg (1.1 to 3.3)], and increased systemic vascular resistance [2.1 woods units/m 2 (0.1 to 4.2)].

Conclusion

Fluid blouses increase arterial blood pressure or cardiac output by 10% in approximately 56% of pediatric patients. Fluid blouses lead to significant decrease in HR and significant increases in cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance. Limited published data are available on the effects of fluid blouses on systemic oxygen delivery.

Pediatric sepsis without intensive care access with hypotension — initial bolus fluids. In healthcare systems with no availability of intensive care, if hypotension is present, we suggest administering up to 40 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10–20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour with titration to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### WHO guidelines on fluid resuscitation in children: missing the FEAST data [^114yYSur]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Concern has also been expressed about the consequences of not giving bolus fluids to children with moderate hypotension and severe dehydration. Again, FEAST was not powered to detect differences in these subgroups, but the results are consistent with harm from use of bolus resuscitation.

In children with hypotension (defined in FEAST as systolic blood pressure 50–75, 60–75, and 70–85 mm Hg in children aged < 12 months, 1–5 years, and > 5 years respectively, in line with clinical use) there was a trend towards increased mortality in the bolus arms (absolute difference 9.4%, 95% confidence interval −2.6% to 21.4%). Severe hypotension is very uncommon in children, as shown by the very small number of children (n = 29) with this condition who were enrolled in the FEAST trial; all of these children were randomised to receive either colloid of saline boluses. Of interest, only eight of the 29 children fulfilled the WHO definition of shock and all eight died.

Overall, severe dehydration without diarrhoea was present in 236 children (7.5%) in FEAST, and we found no evidence that boluses were of benefit; there were 38/173 (22%) deaths in the bolus arm versus 8/58 (13.8%) in the control (relative risk 1.59, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 3.21).

### Pediatric advanced life support. pediatric shock care [^113WhivW]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric septic shock care — fluid therapy specifies that up to 40 to 60 milliliters per kilogram (mL/kg) in bolus fluid (in 10 to 20 mL/kg aliquots) should be administered over the first hour for the initial resuscitation of children and infants with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, titrated to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop. In the absence of intensive care availability, a decreased fluid bolus of up to 40 mL/kg (in 10 to 20 mL/kg aliquots) over the first hour should be considered, and in the absence of both hypotension and intensive care availability, maintenance fluids should be administered instead of bolus fluids. For the initial resuscitation of children and infants with septic shock or another sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, balanced/buffered crystalloids, rather than 0.9% saline, should be used; albumin should not be used, and starches should not be used in the acute resuscitation of children and infants with septic shock or other sepsis associated organ dysfunction. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign review included three randomized controlled trials of different volume resuscitation strategies for 316 children in advanced care settings and found no difference in mortality between the restrictive and liberal fluid resuscitation groups; the suggestion of "up to 40 milliliters per kilogram (mL/kg)" was included for low-resource settings based on FEAST, and the World Health Organization recommends isotonic crystalloid over 30 to 60 minutes, followed by an additional 10 mL/kg over 30 minutes.

### Management of severe paediatric malaria in resource-limited settings [^113Qdo9R]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A systematic review conducted after the FEAST trial concluded that the majority of evidence from randomised trials to date came from the FEAST trial and that boluses significantly increased mortality of children in shock, compared to those who did not receive boluses. The evidence was considered to be of high quality and sufficiently precise. Prior to FEAST the evidence supporting fluid resuscitation was reviewed in the 2008 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines which was informed by a modified Delphi process, graded the current paediatric recommendation (20 ml/kg boluses over five to ten minutes up to 60 ml/kg) as 2C, indicating a weak recommendation with low quality of evidence. The systematic review concluded that withholding of bolus fluids should be considered for populations similar to those enrolled in FEAST and that there remained important questions about the extent to which these results are applicable to other populations.

Transfusion

A Cochrane review including the only two African randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted before 2000 (involving 114 and 116 children randomised to blood transfusion or oral haematinics) concluded that there was insufficient information on whether routinely giving blood to clinically stable children with severe anaemia either reduces death or results in a higher haematocrit measured at one month, and indicated the need for a definitive trial. Since then a recent trial has evaluated the safety and efficacy of a higher volume of whole blood (30 ml/kg, n = 78) against the standard volume (20 ml/kg, n = 82) in Ugandan children which was found to be safe and resulted in an accelerated hematological recovery in children with severe anaemia. A clinical trial is underway that is evaluating whether a liberal rather than conservative transfusion strategy in terms of a larger initial volume of transfused blood and incorporating a higher threshold of haemoglobin of < 6 g/dl for transfusion will decrease both short and long term mortality (TRACT trial: ISRCTN84086586).

### Characteristics and physiologic changes after 4% albumin fluid boluses in a PICU [^111AdcVz]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe the characteristics, hemodynamic, and physiologic changes after 4% albumin fluid boluses in critically ill children.

Design

Retrospective observational study.

Setting

Single-center PICU.

Patients

Children in a cardiac and general PICU.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Between January 2017 and May 2019, there were 1,003 fluid boluses of 4% albumin during 420 of 5,731 admissions (7.8%), most commonly in children with congenital/acquired heart disease (71.2%) and sepsis (7.9%). The median fluid bolus dose was 10mL/kg (interquartile range, 5.8–14.6mL/kg), and its duration 30 minutes (interquartile range, 14.0–40.0min; n = 223). After the fluid bolus, a significant change in mean arterial pressure (2.3mm Hg [5.1%], 2.7mm Hg [5.8%], 2.9mm Hg [6.1%], and 3.8mm Hg [8.0%] at 1, 2, 3, and 4hr, respectively [p ≤ 0.001]) only occurred in children less than or equal to 12 months old. A mean arterial pressure response, defined by an increase greater than or equal to 10% from baseline, occurred in 290 of 887 patients (33%) with maximal response at 1 hour. Hypotension at baseline predicted the magnitude of mean arterial pressure increase at 60 (coefficient 24.3 [95% CI, 0.79–7.87]; p = 0.04) and 120 minutes (coefficient 26.1 [95% CI, 2.75–48.2]; p = 0.02). There were no biochemical or hematocrit changes within 4 hours of the fluid bolus. Urine output for the entire cohort was 2mL/kg/hr at baseline and did not change with the fluid bolus.

Conclusions

Fluid boluses of 4% albumin were common and predominantly in children with cardiac disease and sepsis with a median dose of 10mL/kg given over half an hour. Such treatment was associated with significant hemodynamic changes only in children less than 12 months old, and we failed to identify an association with urine output.

### Fluid bolus over 15–20 versus 5–10 minutes each in the first hour of resuscitation in children with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^112MeZ1x]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the effect of administration of 40–60mL/kg of fluids as fluid boluses in aliquots of 20mL/kg each over 15–20 minutes with that over 5–10 minutes each on the composite outcome of need for mechanical ventilation and/or impaired oxygenation-increase in oxygenation index by 5 from baseline in the initial 6 and 24 hours in children with septic shock.

Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Pediatric emergency and ICU of a tertiary care institute.

Patients

Children (< 18 yr old) with septic shock.

Interventions

We randomly assigned participants to 15–20 minutes bolus (study group) or 5–10 minutes bolus groups (control group).

Measurements and Main Results

We assessed the composite outcomes in the initial 6 and 24 hours after fluid resuscitation in both groups. We performed logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with need for ventilation in the first hour. Data were analyzed using Stata 11.5. Of the 96 children, 45 were randomly assigned to "15–20 minutes group" and 51 to "5–10 minutes group". Key baseline characteristics were not different between the groups. When compared with 5–10 minutes group, fewer children in 15–20 minutes group needed mechanical ventilation or had an increase in oxygenation index in the first 6 hours (36% vs 57%; relative risk, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39–0.99) and 24 hours (43% vs 68%; relative risk, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42–0.93) after fluid resuscitation. We did not find any difference in secondary outcomes such as death (1.2; 0.70–2.03), length of stay (mean difference: 0.52; -1.72 to 2.7), or resolution of shock (0.98; 0.63–1.53).

Conclusion

Children receiving fluid boluses over 5–10 minutes each had a higher risk of intubation than those receiving boluses over 15–20 minutes each. Notwithstanding the lack of difference in risk of mortality and the possibility that a lower threshold of intubation and mechanical ventilation was used in the presence of fluid overload, our results raise concerns on the current recommendation of administering boluses over 5–10 minutes each in children with septic shock.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^1123NGhr]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric septic shock fluid therapy — initial resuscitation recommendations specify system-dependent bolus strategies and fluid choices. In healthcare systems with availability of intensive care, we suggest administering up to 40–60 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10–20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour with titration to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop for the initial resuscitation of children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. In healthcare systems with no availability of intensive care and in the absence of hypotension, we recommend against bolus fluid administration while starting maintenance fluids, whereas if hypotension is present, we suggest administering up to 40 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10–20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour with titration to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop. For fluid type, we suggest using crystalloids, rather than albumin, and we suggest using balanced/buffered crystalloids, rather than 0.9% saline, for the initial resuscitation of children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, and we recommend against using starches and suggest against using gelatin in this setting.

### Implications for paediatric shock management in resource-limited settings: a perspective from the FEAST trial [^116osgUY]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

In general terms, in any clinical trial showing a difference in outcome between groups of patients given different treatments, researchers need to be sure that this is caused by the intervention being tested, and that it is not the result of chance. Only then can the trial result be deemed statistically significant - and the result be generalised with a reasonable degree of confidence. There are two inter-related factors to determine this. The first is the size of the difference between the groups or arms in the trial. The second is the numbers of patients involved. If the difference between arms is large, then a small number of patients are required to confirm statistical significance. If however, the difference in outcomes is small, then larger numbers of patients are needed.

So how does this relate to FEAST? Overall, there was only a 3% absolute difference between the bolus and no-bolus groups, which was statistically significant after the fifth interim analysis when trial recruitment was halted prematurely with 3141 participants enrolled. The recommendation of the data monitoring committee, at this point, was that even if the trial recruited the projected sample size (n = 3200), it would never be able show a benefit of fluid boluses. The main result indicated a 3% overall increase in harm associated with fluid bolus therapy; however, relevant to WHO recent recommendations, in the group of 65 children with WHO-defined shock (a group with much higher risk of death), the difference is stark. Almost half, 48%, of the children given boluses died compared to 20% of those not given boluses, an increased absolute risk of 28%. As the numbers are small one cannot be sure the 28% difference is accurate; however, as this difference is so large, occurring across multiple centres, and is in the same direction as the main result, one can say with a great deal of confidence that children in the WHO group will suffer some degree of harm from fluid boluses. Indeed, one can say with 95% confidence that the 3% increased mortality from boluses seen across the FEAST trial can be generalised, and would occur if all children with WHO definition shock were given boluses. This is strong evidence of harm, even though the number of children in the FEAST trail who satisfied the WHO definition of shock is small. As indicated by Yusef et al. "the overall trial result is usually a better guide to the direction of effect in subgroups than the apparent effect observed within a subgroup".

### State-of-the-art management of the acutely unwell child [^112jEu6h]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A global epidemiology study estimated the prevalence of paediatric sepsis at 8.2%, with the most common underlying causes being respiratory (40%) and bloodstream (19%). Despite evidence that hospital sepsis deaths occur within the first 24–72 h of admission, and the availability of guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign since 2004, morbidity and mortality remains high. The new 2020 Surviving Sepsis campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis‐associated organ dysfunction in children provide guidance on fluids and vasoactive medications. Fluid recommendations differ based on the availability of paediatric intensive care. For systems with paediatric intensive care, 40–60 ml.kg ‐1 in bolus fluid (10–20 ml.kg ‐1 per bolus) are suggested over the first hour, titrated to clinical markers of cardiac output, with continuous re‐assessment. Should signs of fluid overload (hepatomegaly, pulmonary congestion) develop at any stage, this should be discontinued. In settings without paediatric intensive care, it is advised that maintenance fluids be started but no boluses given if the infant/child is not hypotensive. If hypotension is present, up to 40 ml.kg ‐1 (10–20 ml.kg ‐1 per bolus) over the first hour should be titrated to clinical markers of cardiac output (and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop). Maitland et al. conducted a RCT in a low‐resource African setting that showed bolus fluid in the first hour of resuscitation increased mortality compared with maintenance fluids. Further analysis of the study concluded that, in this setting, the incidence of children presenting with severe febrile illness and fulfilling the World Health Organization definition for shock or hypotension was low. However, even in the children who met those criteria, there was a trend towards increased mortality, suggesting fluid management should be less focused on bolus and more on ensuring maintenance in a resource‐limited setting. The guidelines recommend fluid resuscitation be with balanced/buffered crystalloids rather than 0.9% saline solution in the first 72 h of admission for sepsis, based on observational studies which showed a reduction in mortality in children (OR 0.79; 95%CI 0.65–0.95). In children with septic shock, adrenaline or noradrenaline are advocated as first‐line vasoactive medications rather than dopamine, although dopamine may be substituted if these are not available. This guidance change follows the publication of two small studies. Ramaswamy et al. found adrenaline superior to dopamine in reversing fluid‐refractory hypotensive cold shock within the first hour of resuscitation (41% vs. 13%, OR 4.8; 95%CI 1.3–17.2) and Ventura et al. reported peripheral dopamine to be associated with increased mortality compared with peripheral/intraosseous adrenaline in children with fluid‐refractory septic shock. Vasoactive medications can be administered safely via peripheral or intraosseous access whilst central venous access is sought.

Pediatric septic shock care — fluid resuscitation (Surviving Sepsis Campaign): In healthcare systems with availability of intensive care, the SSC suggests administering up to 40 to 60 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10 to 20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour, titrated to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop, for the initial resuscitation of children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. In healthcare systems with no availability of intensive care and in the absence of hypotension, a strong recommendation is made against bolus fluid administration while starting maintenance fluids. In healthcare systems with no availability of intensive care, if hypotension is present, SSC suggests administering up to 40 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10 to 20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour, titrated to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop. The SSC suggests using balanced/buffered crystalloids, rather than 0.9% saline, for the initial resuscitation of children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction.

### A critique of fluid bolus resuscitation in severe sepsis [^115AfLgc]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Resuscitation of septic patients by means of one or more fluid boluses is recommended by guidelines from multiple relevant organizations and as a component of surviving sepsis campaigns. The technique is considered a key and life-saving intervention during the initial treatment of severe sepsis in children and adults. Such recommendations, however, are only based on expert opinion and lack adequate experimental or controlled human evidence. Despite these limitations, fluid bolus therapy (20 to 40 ml/kg) is widely practiced and is currently considered a cornerstone of the management of sepsis. In this pointof-view critique, we will argue that such therapy has weak physiological support, has limited experimental support, and is at odds with emerging observational data in several subgroups of critically ill patients or those having major abdominal surgery. Finally, we will argue that this paradigm is now challenged by the findings of a large randomized controlled trial in septic children. In the present article, we contend that the concept of large fluid bolus resuscitation in sepsis needs to be investigated further.

### A clinical and physiological prospective observational study on the management of pediatric shock in the post-fluid expansion as supportive therapy trial era [^114nwKEt]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

International pediatric septic shock treatment guidelines have recently been updated recommending fluid boluses of between 40 and 60 mL/kg given over 1 hour in settings with access to intensive care treatments. Whereas in settings without access to intensive care fluid boluses are restricted to children with hypotension, providing 10–20 mL/kg of isotonic fluids over 1 hour. The latter recommendation was based on the evidence provided from the multicentre Phase III randomized controlled trial of fluid resuscitation in severe febrile illness (Fluid Expansion As Supportive Therapy [FEAST]) which demonstrated a 45% relative increased risk of mortality with fluid bolus (with albumin or saline) compared with nonbolus controls (95% CI, 1.13–1.86; p = 0.003). Subsequent analyses indicated the major excess in mortality in the bolus arms were due to cardiogenic shock as the terminal clinical event rather than fluid overload. Nevertheless, the 2013 updated World Health Organization (WHO) pediatric inpatient guidelines for resource-limited settings continue to recommend use of fluid boluses for children with all three signs of impaired perfusion (WHO shock criteria): a prolonged capillary refilling time (CRT) greater than 3 seconds, cool peripheries, and a weak and fast pulse. These criteria were recommended as a proxy for hypotension since blood pressure measurement is not widely available. We have previously demonstrated that the WHO shock criteria are very rare (~ 0.1%) among general pediatric admission cohorts in resource-limited settings. Mortality in this group, however, was very high (80–100%). These findings question whether the 2013 WHO guidelines for fluid resuscitation are relevant to African children.

To date, there have been no clinical physiologic studies investigating no-bolus fluid-conservative strategy and the current WHO shock fluid management guideline. We therefore conducted an observational study on nonmalnourished children admitted with severe febrile illness and impaired perfusion (FEAST trial criteria [2, 3]) managed conservatively with maintenance-only fluid and for children with WHO shock fluid boluses as recommended by the 2013 WHO guidelines (the Management of Paediatric Septic Shock, MAPS study). We also aimed explored baseline clinical indices and biomarkers that could predict mortality.

Randomisation and trial intervention

Eligible patients were randomised while in an acute assessment area (eg, paediatric assessment unit or ED) and allocated 1:1 to either 10 mL/kg or 20 mL/kg boluses over a 4-hour resuscitation period, without prior consent. The resuscitation period was divided into 15 min cycles, with one bolus of either 10 mL/kg or 20 mL/kg to be delivered in each cycle. The maximum amount of fluid that could be given per bolus was either 500 mL (for those allocated to 10 mL/kg boluses) or 1000 mL (for those allocated to 20 mL/kg boluses). Fluid type and other interventions were left to the discretion of the treating clinician. At the end of each cycle, if age-adjusted signs of shock persisted, then another bolus of the same size was given within the next 15 min cycle.

In participants whose shock resolved or who showed signs of fluid overload (pulmonary oedema — rales on auscultation or pulmonary oedema fluid in the endotracheal tube — or new or increasing hepatomegaly), delivery of further fluid boluses was withheld. If, within the 4-hour resuscitation period, fluid boluses were indicated, that is, signs of shock were present in the absence of signs of fluid overload, cycles were recommenced with allocated boluses until the end of the 4-hour intervention period. After this period, any further treatment was at the discretion of the treating clinician.

The maximum amount of fluid that could be given within the pilot trial protocol, regardless of allocation, was 120 mL/kg (excluding the 20 mL/kg bolus prerandomisation).

Consent

A member of the site research team approached parents/legal representatives as soon as appropriate after randomisation to take consent for use of study data, according to the guidance developed in the FiSh feasibility studyand elsewhere. This is known as research without prior consent (RWPC), a methodology favoured in emergency care trials. Specific FiSh RWPC methodology was developed during the feasibility studyfor all possible situations, including early discharge or death of the participant.

### Pediatric advanced life support. pediatric shock care [^116r8PDq]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric cardiogenic shock — pathophysiology and fluid management emphasize that the central physiologic abnormality is decreased cardiac output and, in most cases, this decrease is due to impaired contractility of the heart; children and infants may be hypo-, normo- or hypervolemic. Therefore, fluid resuscitation should be carried out with caution, starting with smaller-than-usual boluses of 5 to 10 milliliters per kilogram (ml/kg) and closely monitoring response and for signs of pulmonary edema and signs of worsening perfusion.

Always assess the child or infant after each fluid bolus and discontinue fluid administration if clinical signs or symptoms of hypervolemia develop. Packed red blood cells or whole blood may be indicated in combination with isotonic crystalloids for volume resuscitation in hemorrhagic shock to optimize hemoglobin concentration and hence oxygen delivery in shock.

### Resuscitation with early adrenaline infusion for children with septic shock: a randomized pilot trial [^113VF8fK]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this multicenter open label randomized pilot trial of children presenting with early septic shock to ED, a sepsis resuscitation algorithm incorporating early initiation of adrenaline infusion after 20 mL/kg fluid bolus was associated with significantly more and earlier inotrope use, and less fluid volume load during the first 24 hours after randomization as compared with standard SSC resuscitation with 40–60 mL/kg fluid. The intervention did not lead to more or longer PICU admissions. The consent rate was 100% among families approached for consent, and consent-to-continue was used in over 80% of cases given the time constraints associated with the intervention. However, only 69% of eligible patients were enrolled, and the recruitment rate was 1.2 per month at the largest study site.

Founded on concerns about high mortality associated with delayed sepsis resuscitation, previous pediatric sepsis guidelines have emphasized the importance of rapid delivery of 40–60 mL/kg fluid bolus during initial resuscitation. The FEAST study demonstrated a 45% (95% CI, 13–86%) relative mortality risk increase associated with any 20 to 40 mL/kg bolus compared with no bolus. Contrary to septic adults, where the recent Conservative versus Liberal Approach to Fluid Therapy of Septic Shock in Intensive Care (CLASSIC) and Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trials showed that a restrictive compared to a liberal fluid resuscitation regimen had similar outcomes, no comparable data are available for children, and controversy surrounding optimal fluid volume persists. Although the 2020 pediatric SSC recommendations emphasize that in settings where no intensive care support is available, fluid boluses should be avoided in the absence of hypotension, the guidelines otherwise still recommend 40–60 mL/kg fluids.

### WHO guidelines on fluid resuscitation in children: missing the FEAST data [^1126o3Vx]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Evidence on fluid resuscitation

Rapid fluid resuscitation was recommended as a lifesaving treatment for shock on the basis of a GRADE systematic review that found weak evidence of benefit (largely expert opinion based on two paediatric case series at a single tertiary centre). It has become a key component of surviving sepsis campaigns in children and adultsand is widely practised in well resourced settings. Fluid resuscitation is also being increasingly promoted in resource poor settingsas part of the WHO endorsed emergency triage assessment and treatment training. This is despite systematic reviewsand commentaries highlighting concerns that these recommendations are not based on research evidence.

FEAST was published in 2011. It is the only randomised controlled trial comparing bolus fluid resuscitation with no bolus. The study was conducted in six African hospitals without intensive care facilities in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda and enrolled 3141 children with fever and shock (one or more features of impaired perfusion with impaired consciousness or respiratory distress, or both). The study included a prespecified analysis of subgroups of children with malaria and anaemia, as these conditions are relevant to resource poor settings. Children with gastroenteritis, severe malnutrition, burns, or surgical conditions were excluded.

Children were randomly assigned to receive rapid resuscitation with albumin or normal saline boluses (20–40 ml/kg over 1–2 hours) or no bolus (control group). All children received standard treatments according to their illness, including standard of care maintenance fluids (mainly 5% dextrose/saline at 2.5–4 ml/kg/h) until able to drink, antibiotics, antimalarials, oxygen, and transfusion.

The trial was stopped early by the data monitoring committee because rapid resuscitation resulted in a 45% relative (95% confidence interval 13% to 86%) increase in 48 hour mortality compared with controls. The absolute excess in mortality was 3.3% (1.2% to 5.3%). This increase in mortality was seen in every subgroup, across the age spectrum (3 months-12 years), and at each of the six centres from three countries in the trial, irrespective of the pathogen (malaria, bacterial sepsis, or anaemia). Further planned analysis showed that although children given a bolus had a superior shock resolution than those in the control group, they were more likely to die as a result of cardiovascular collapse.

### Management guidelines for paediatric patients receiving chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy [^115SJCKZ]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Careful vigilance for early recognition of haemodynamic shock in the child is crucial. Symptoms such as malaise, lethargy, weakness, oliguria, irritability, and reduced appetite are not always self-reported by younger children. Among infants, assessment of diapers will be critical to assess urine output and detect diarrhoea. We concur with recommendations that any patient requiring a rapid increase in the dose of vasopressors or exhibiting evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion should be treated intensively for grade 3 CRS, even if the vasopressor therapy required is 'low dose' according to the definition of Lee and colleagues. For children with hypotension owing to CRS, an initial normal saline fluid bolus (10–20 ml/kg; maximum 1,000 ml) should be administered; if no improvement is observed, anti-IL-6 therapy should be initiated (Table 2). After administration of anti-IL-6 therapy, the decision to repeat additional fluid boluses versus starting vasopressors should involve consideration of the cardiac and fluid status of the child. For example, the administration of additional fluid boluses should be avoided in patients with underlying cardiac dysfunction and/or signs and symptoms of volume overload (such as pulmonary oedema). Additionally, early use of colloid solutions might be indicated because patients with CRS could potentially develop capillary leak and hypoalbuminaemia more rapidly than patients with sepsis, and the administration of additional fluid boluses might compromise pulmonary function by causing pulmonary oedema. Care should be taken not to trigger acute fluid overload, cardiogenic shock, and/or respiratory compromise. Consideration should be given to adrenal insufficiency in decisions of the initial choice of corticosteroid intervention, if needed (Table 2); patients with vasopressor-resistant hypotension attributed to adrenal insufficiency might respond to stress-dose hydrocortisone only and, thus, high doses of other lymphocytotoxic corticosteroids (dexamethasone or methylprednisolone) can be avoided. Transfer to an intensive-care unit should be considered early in this process (Table 1).

### Exploring mechanisms of excess mortality with early fluid resuscitation: insights from the FEAST trial [^113nBSHp]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Adverse effects of hyperchloremia, at the doses given in this trial, remain controversial. Intriguingly, the most deleterious effects of boluses were in those patients with severe acidosis at baseline, the group with the least a priori equipoise regarding the potential benefits of fluid resuscitation - lending support to the notion of adverse effects of the resuscitation fluids on acid-base equilibrium. Alternatively, this may indicate lethal reperfusion injury or a surge of cytokines in cases with advanced shock. As previously suggested, shock may be an adaptive, time-dependent response sustaining children through a prolonged period prior to hospital admission - only to die within hours of reperfusion.

Whatever the explanation, these findings raise important questions about the pathophysiological mechanisms of shock and goal-directed management, questioning whether the protocol-driven requirement for inotropes and vasoactive drugs has been driven, in part, by aggressive fluid challenge. The 2008 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, informed by a modified Delphi process, graded the pediatric recommendation (20 ml/kg boluses over 5 to 10 minutes up to 60 ml/kg) as 2C, indicating a weak recommendation with low quality of evidence. The pediatric studies on which these recommendations were based included only two retrospective, observational studies of initial resuscitation volume on the outcome of children with putative sepsis from a single tertiary referral center, involving 34 and 91 children respectively. The inclusion criteria for both studies were children who survived to intensive care unit admission, but were inotrope-dependent and had pulmonary arterial catheters in situ. Higher initial fluid boluses and early shock reversal in 9 and 24 children in the two respective studies were associated with improved global outcome. However, the study design and the patient population had major limitations in terms of survivorship bias and external validity to other settings. Other sources of evidence that were referenced to inform fluid resuscitation guidelines include dengue shock. We suggest these are largely irrelevant to the management of sepsis, because shock as a complication of dengue occurs 7 to 10 days after fever defervescence, secondary to gross intravascular leakage leading to vomiting, abdominal pain, increasingly tender hepatomegaly, narrow pulse pressure and hemoconcentration. The American College of Critical Care Medicine guideline, and similar guidelines, nevertheless have been adopted by many countries worldwide where point-of-care testing and intensive care facilities are available and are considered to be best practice. These are now being recommended as standards of care for resource-poor settings; indicating that the FEAST trial had limited generalizability because the adverse effects of fluid boluses were largely confined to children with malaria and/or anemia. The data presented in the original manuscript, subsequence correspondence and this detailed sub-analysis definitely counter this interpretation. A recent systematic review assessing the evidence base for fluid resuscitation in the treatment of children with shock due to sepsis or severe infection found only 13 pediatric trials. Whilst the majority of all randomized evidence to date comes from the FEAST trial, they recommended that implementation of simple algorithms for children managed at hospitals with limited resources to ensure identification of children who maybe potentially be harmed by fluid boluses. The findings we report here raise questions over the rates, volumes and types of solutions recommended in pediatric resuscitation protocols, most of which remain untested in clinical trials.

### Implementation of preemptive fluid strategy as a bundle to prevent fluid overload in children with acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis [^112zQubY]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The second element of the bundle was fluid bolus administration. In addition to the clinical assessment of hypovolemia, we added to our bundle a dynamic preload parameter, pulse pressure variation, to decide on fluid administration. Resuscitation protocols and guidelines propose an aggressive fluid management approach as the first line treatment for sepsis and shock. The main objective of fluid bolus administration is to correct hypovolemia, a common initial finding in pediatric sepsis and shock. Currently, fluid bolus administration is a frequent intervention in the emergency department and most of the patients receive between 20 and 60 mL·kg − 1 before PICU admission. The risks and unwanted effects of this approach have been highlighted in recent studies. Adequate fluid resuscitation increases venous return, end diastolic and systolic volume and consequently stroke volume and cardiac index. Despite the widespread clinical use, data supporting fluid bolus therapy in hospitalized critically ill children is very weak. Recent adult studies have emphasized that liberal use of fluid bolus is associated with a positive fluid balance, exposing patients to the risks associated with fluid overload. We acknowledge that the functional hemodynamic markers of preload are not widely used in critically ill children. Most devices providing invasive arterial pressure monitoring can give at least pulse pressure variation parameters with the current technology. In our view, functional hemodynamic monitoring gives to the clinician an additional parameter to assess fluid status and predict fluid responsiveness, along with vital signs, physical examinations and biomarkers of dysoxia. Only 50% of critical ill children are fluid responders, due to myocardial dysfunction and blunted adrenergic sensitivity. Additionally, it is important to recall that fluid hemodynamic response is short. It is estimated that 85% of crystalloid fluid boluses redistribute in the interstitial tissue four hours after administration or even less in critically ill patients having an increased capillary leak. In daily practice fluid boluses are the first response to multiple scenarios without a strong physiological support, i.e. tachycardia due to fever, respiratory distress or pain. With PFS, we were able to decrease fluid boluses, especially during the first 24 h, without any clinical evidence of detrimental hypovolemia or significant renal dysfunction. Urinary output was lower in PFS, and diuretic initiation was more frequent during the first 24 h after admission, but renal function tests where similar between groups. Limiting unnecessary fluid administration in the PFS group was also associated with less PRBC transfusions, probably as a result of a decreased hemodilution. Vasoactive drug support was lower in the PFS group. This may seem counterintuitive, but studies in adults have shown that hemodynamic instability is associated with liberal use of fluids.

### WHO guidelines on fluid resuscitation in children: missing the FEAST data [^112MUxYd]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

The World Health Organization recommendations on management of common childhood illnesses affect the lives of millions of children admitted to hospital worldwide. Its latest guidelines, released in May 2013, continue to recommend rapid fluid resuscitation for septic shock, even though the only large controlled trial of this treatment (Fluid Expansion as a Supportive Treatment (FEAST) found that it increased the risk of death in African children. A subsequent systematic review of bolus resuscitation in children with shock resulting from severe infection also did not support its use. Failure to take this evidence into account is not consistent with WHO's commitment to systematically and transparently assess evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) process when producing guidelines and could endanger the lives of children.

### The pediatric emergency research network: a decade of global research cooperation in pediatric emergency care [^112R82X6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The path to this goal is not straightforward. As an example, the fluid-based resuscitation question being addressed by the PRoMPT BOLUS studyseeks to establish best practices for the type of fluid used in fluid resuscitation for the treatment of pediatric sepsis globally. Even within resource-rich contexts, however, disparities exist in pediatric emergency care that can have devastating outcomes. Unfortunately, what is likely an infrequent event that warrants investigation in a resource-rich country is a common daily occurrence elsewhere, and the worldwide rate of death from sepsis in children is likely grossly underestimated. Although the estimated mortality rate for neonatal sepsis is 11% to 19% in middle- to high-income countries, it is as high as 31% in Latin America, in great part due to inadequately prepared providers. In addition to variation in fluid type and mortality, management of pediatric sepsis is also complicated by the question of the amount of fluid resuscitation required. The highest-quality evidence that is available comes from the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) study, an RCT of 3141 children presenting to hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa with sepsis randomized to receive fluid boluses or no fluid boluses. Despite the no-bolus arm showing a benefit in terms of mortality, overall and in the subgroups with and without malaria, clinicians in resource-rich settings have struggled to integrate these findings into clinical practice, relying more on lower-quality evidence from settings similar to their own. If we are going to improve emergency care for children by increasing the use of evidence-based therapies, evidence needs to flow bidirectionally between resource-rich and resource-restricted settings.

Ringers Lactate or albumin resuscitation

initial bolus of 10 ml/kg over 30 minutes, repeated only twice over one hour (i.e. up to 30 ml/kg in total) if clinical reassessment demonstrated any of the following features of shock: CRT > 3 s, weak pulse volume, temperature gradient or hypotension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 80 mmHg)).

Additional boluses (10 mls/kg over one hour) were only permitted if oliguria (< 0.5 mls/kg/hour) or hypotension (systolic pressure < 80 mmHg) developed (20 mls/kg over one hour). Maximum bolus volumes given were 40 ml/kg. At each clinical review children were assessed for clinical resolution of shock and examined for signs of pulmonary oedema (if present further boluses withheld and treated with diuretics). No invasive monitoring, such as central venous pressure (CVP) measurement, was used. The children did not receive inotropes, vasopressors, or hydrocortisone. Other than the initial fluid boluses additional intravenous fluids boluses, intravenous rehydration for children with severe diarrhoea or maintenance fluids were not given (as per guideline recommendation). The only exception was if the child was intolerant to feeding when low volume maintenance was provided. Children were continuously and non-invasively monitored for heart and respiratory rate, oxygen saturation using a multi channel Siemens ® monitor and hourly for blood pressure and urine output then every 4 hours after 8 hours. At admission blood gases, plasma biochemistry, and haematology were assessed and reassessed at 8- and 24-hours post-admission. Blood and urine were cultured at admission on all children and lumbar puncture, where indicated. Adherence to protocol was validated by an internal but independent monitoring team. The trial was monitored three times during execution.

### Restricted fluid bolus volume in early septic shock: results of the fluids in shock pilot trial [^1118bHos]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The pilot trial was successfully conducted. Screening logs showed that over 90% of eligible patients were randomised across the study sites over the study period with a recruitment rate of 0.9 participants per site per month, very close to the anticipated recruitment rate of 1 per site per month.

However, the sites opened over a 4-month period rather than all at once, reducing the anticipated recruitment total from 108 to 84. Recruitment was driven mainly by three study sites, which recruited 38 of the 75 participants. A staggered opening of sites would be needed in the design for a larger FiSh trial, targeting sites most likely to see a high number of eligible patients.

The process of RWPC worked smoothly, with no parents refusing consent. This is likely due to the bespoke FiSh RWPC methodology, developed during the feasibility study. No participants died during the course of the study, so the procedures to follow in the event of a child's death were not tested.

The intervention was delivered according to protocol in the majority of participants. Adherence to volume and timing was close to achieving the 80% progression criteria target in the 10 mL/kg group but was not as good in the 20 mL/kg group. This appeared to be due to the difficulty in delivering the 20 mL/kg bolus within the 15 min time frame, especially in the period immediately postrandomisation. There was also some suggestions from the embedded perspectives study, indicating that some clinicians lacked equipoise, favouring 10 mL/kg over 20 mL/kg fluid boluses, despite the recently updated ACCM-PALS guidance continuing to recommend 20 mL/kg boluses. Despite these challenges, good separation between the groups was achieved, with volume of fluid delivered (in mL/kg) 35% lower in the first hour and 44% lower over the entire 4-hour period in the 10 mL/kg group. If a larger trial were feasible, the resuscitation algorithm could be modified to improve adherence by allowing for longer periods to deliver study boluses.

### A presedation fluid bolus does not decrease the incidence of propofol-induced hypotension in pediatric patients [^111XLegy]. Hospital Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Propofol is commonly used in pediatric sedation, which may cause hypotension during induction. Our goal was to determine the effect of a preinduction 20-mL/kg isotonic fluid bolus on propofol-induced hypotension, assess clinical signs of hypoperfusion during hypotension, and evaluate for age-related propofol dosing differences.

Methods

This prospective, randomized, controlled, nonblinded study was conducted at Children's Hospital of Illinois. Patients were children 6 to 60 months of age who needed sedation for MRI or auditory brainstem-evoked response testing. The treatment group received a preinduction 20-mL/kg isotonic saline bolus before procedure initiation. Patients were continuously monitored via cardiorespiratory monitor with pulse oximetry and end-tidal carbon dioxide measurements. Cardiovascular indices and clinical signs of hypoperfusion were compared between groups, and propofol dosing differences were compared between age groups.

Results

One hundred twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 52) or control (n = 74) conditions. Twelve patients in the treatment group and 14 patients in the control group experienced postinduction hypotension, as defined by the Pediatric Advanced Life Support guidelines. One patient in each group was given volume resuscitation when blood pressure did not improve after a reduction in the propofol infusion rate. No hypotensive patients had physical signs of hypoperfusion, and patients ≤ 1 year of age needed significantly more propofol.

Conclusions

A 20-mL/kg preinduction isotonic saline bolus does not prevent propofol-induced hypotension. No clinical signs of hypoperfusion were noted with induced hypotension, and infants ≤ 12 months old need significantly more propofol per kilogram for procedures.

### Hemodynamic response to fluid boluses for hypotension in children in a cardiac ICU [^117Knw2E]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe the hemodynamic response to fluid boluses for hypotension in children in a cardiac ICU.

Design

A prospective, observational study.

Setting

Single-centered cardiac ICU.

Patients

Children in a cardiac ICU with hypotension.

Interventions

Clinician prescribed fluid bolus.

Measurements and Main Results

Sixty-four fluid boluses were administered to 52 children. Fluid composition was 4% albumin in 36/64 (56%), 0.9% saline in 18/64 (28%), and cardiopulmonary bypass pump blood in 10/64 (16%). The median volume and duration were 5.0 mL/kg (interquartile range, 4.8–5.4) and 8 minutes (interquartile range, 4–19), respectively. Hypovolemia/low filling pressures was the most common additional indication (25/102 [25%]). Mean arterial pressure response, defined as a 10% increase from baseline, occurred in 42/64 (66%) of all fluid boluses at a median time of 6 minutes (interquartile range, 4–11). Mean arterial pressure responders had a median peak increase in the mean arterial pressure of 15 mm Hg (43 mm Hg [interquartile range, 29–50 mm Hg] to 58 mm Hg [interquartile range, 49–65 mm Hg]) at 17 minutes (interquartile range, 14–24 min) compared with 4 mm Hg (48 mm Hg [interquartile range, 40–51 mm Hg] to 52 mm Hg [interquartile range, 45–56 mm Hg]) at 10 minutes (interquartile range, 3–18 min) in nonresponders. Dissipation of mean arterial pressure response, when defined as a subsequent decrement in mean arterial pressure below 10%, 5%, and 2% increases from baseline, occurred in 28/42 (67%), 18/42 (43%), and 13/42 (31%) of mean arterial pressure responders, respectively. Cardiopulmonary bypass pump blood was strongly associated with peak change in mean arterial pressure from baseline (coefficient 11.0 [95% CI, 4.3–17.7]; p = 0.02). Fifty out of 64 (78%) were receiving a vasoactive agent. However, change in vasoactive inotrope score was not associated with change in mean arterial pressure (coefficient 2.3 [95% CI, -2.5 to -7.2]; p = 0.35). Timing from admission, nor fluid bolus duration, influenced mean arterial pressure response.

Conclusions

In children with hypotension in a cardiac ICU, the median dose and duration of fluid boluses were 5 mL/kg and 8 minutes. Peak response occurred shortly following administration and commonly returned to baseline.

### Is there an optimum duration of fluid bolus in pediatric septic shock? A critical appraisal of "Fluid bolus over 15–20 versus 5–10 minutes each in the first hour of resuscitation in children with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial" by sankar et al (pediatr crit care med 2017; 18: e435-e445) [^1163nq1e]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the findings and discuss the implications of a longer duration for fluid boluses in the resuscitation of children with septic shock.

Data Sources

We performed a PubMed.gov search using the criteria "Fluid Bolus" and "Children" and "Septic Shock", which yielded 29 references.

Study Selection

One trial compared different durations of fluid boluses in pediatric septic shock and was therefore selected for critical appraisal. (Sankar J, Ismail J, Sankar MJ, et al: Fluid Bolus Over 15–20 Versus 5–10 Minutes Each in the First Hour of Resuscitation in Children with Septic Shock: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Pediatr Crit Care Med 2017; 18:e435-e445.) DATA EXTRACTION:: This trial compared the effectiveness of 20mL/kg fluid boluses, in children with septic shock, given over 15–20 versus 5–10 minutes in terms of need for invasive ventilation and/or increase in oxygenation index by 5 from baseline at 6 and 24 hours post initial fluid resuscitation. The relative risk of the primary outcome was 0.62 (p = 0.04; 95% CI, 0.39–0.99) at 6 hours and 0.63 (p = 0.02; 95% CI, 0.42–0.93) at 24 hours.

Data Synthesis

Fragility Index calculations for the primary outcomes of this trial were 1 and 2. Therefore, only one and two children would have needed different outcomes to have given nonsignificant p values greater than 0.05. Analysis of the results did not support the early stopping of this trial at the interim period.

Conclusions

The article reviewed does not support a change in practice to a longer duration of fluid bolus. The "push" technique for titration of fluid boluses in pediatric septic shock should continue to be the method of choice. Critical Care trials using binary outcomes as endpoints should publish Fragility Index results to aid interpretation and generate stronger conclusions.

### Fluid resuscitation in pediatric cerebral malaria: insights from the FEAST trial and further evidence from Malawi [^115kT5Ep]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we highlight to pediatricians across Africa managing critically ill children that in 2020, the Pediatric Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines were updated. They indicate that, "in healthcare systems with no availability of intensive care and in the absence of hypotension, we recommend against bolus fluid administration while starting maintenance fluids (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence)". The FEAST trial showed harm for a fluid bolus in every subgroup (including those with sepsis or malaria) and for every definition of shock (except severe hypotension, for which there was no control group). Given the most common cause of coma in critically ill children in malaria-endemic sub-Saharan Africa is cerebral malaria, by implication, the FEAST results extend to this group. The analysis presented in this issue, in a routine healthcare setting in Malawi, also supports the conclusion that fluid boluses are not indicated for children with cerebral malaria.

### Clinical practice guideline: maintenance intravenous fluids in children [^111eRAjz]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Phases of fluid therapy — definitions and dosing principles for pediatric IVFs: Four distinct physiology-driven time periods exist for children requiring IVFs, comprising a resuscitative phase that is the acute presentation window when IVFs are needed to restore adequate tissue perfusion and prevent or mitigate end-organ injury, a titration phase when IVFs are transitioned from boluses to maintenance and when a critical determination of intravascular repletion and the trajectory of fluid gains versus losses is made, a maintenance phase that accounts for fluids administered during the previous 2 stabilization phases and supplies fluids to achieve a precise homeostatic balance between needs and losses, and a convalescent phase when exogenous fluid administration is stopped and the patient returns to intrinsic fluid regulation; the dose of fluid during these 4 phases needs to be adjusted based on the unique physiologic needs of each patient, and a specific protocol dose is not able to be applied to all patients.

### Mortality risk over time after early fluid resuscitation in African children [^115WE2mD]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

African children hospitalised with severe febrile illness have a high risk of mortality. The Fluid Expansion As Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial (ISCRTN 69856593) demonstrated increased mortality risk associated with fluid boluses, but the temporal relationship to bolus therapy and underlying mechanism remains unclear.

Methods

In a post hoc retrospective analysis, flexible parametric models were used to compare change in mortality risk post-randomisation in children allocated to bolus therapy with 20–40ml/kg 5% albumin or 0.9% saline over 1–2h or no bolus (control, 4ml/kg/hour maintenance), overall and for different terminal clinical events (cardiogenic, neurological, respiratory, or unknown/other).

Results

Two thousand ninety-seven and 1041 children were randomised to bolus vs no bolus, of whom 254 (12%) and 91 (9%) respectively died within 28days. Median (IQR) bolus fluid in the bolus groups received by 4h was 20 (20, 40) ml/kg and was the same at 8h; total fluids received in bolus groups at 4h and 8h were 38 (28, 43) ml/kg and 40 (30, 50) ml/kg, respectively. Total fluid volumes received in the control group by 4h and 8h were median (IQR) 10 (6, 15) ml/kg and 10 (10, 26) ml/kg, respectively. Mortality risk was greatest 30min post-randomisation in both groups, declining sharply to 4h and then more slowly to 28days. Maximum mortality risk was similar in bolus and no bolus groups; however, the risk declined more slowly in the bolus group, with significantly higher mortality risk compared to the no bolus group from 1.6 to 101h (4days) post-randomisation. The delay in decline in mortality risk in the bolus groups was most pronounced for cardiogenic modes of death.

Conclusions

The increased risk from bolus therapy was not due to a mechanism occurring immediately after bolus administration. Excess mortality risk in the bolus group resulted from slower decrease in mortality risk over the ensuing 4days. Thus, administration of modest bolus volumes appeared to prevent mortality risk declining at the same rate that it would have done without a bolus, rather than harm associated with bolus resulting from a concurrent increased risk of death peri-bolus administration.

### Mortality after fluid bolus in African children with severe infection [^1141yL8i]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The role of fluid resuscitation in the treatment of children with shock and life-threatening infections who live in resource-limited settings is not established.

Methods

We randomly assigned children with severe febrile illness and impaired perfusion to receive boluses of 20 to 40 mL of 5% albumin solution (albumin-bolus group) or 0.9% saline solution (saline-bolus group) per kilogram of body weight or no bolus (control group) at the time of admission to a hospital in Uganda, Kenya, or Tanzania (stratum A); children with severe hypotension were randomly assigned to one of the bolus groups only (stratum B). All children received appropriate antimicrobial treatment, intravenous maintenance fluids, and supportive care, according to guidelines. Children with malnutrition or gastroenteritis were excluded. The primary end point was 48-hour mortality; secondary end points included pulmonary edema, increased intracranial pressure, and mortality or neurologic sequelae at 4 weeks.

Results

The data and safety monitoring committee recommended halting recruitment after 3141 of the projected 3600 children in stratum A were enrolled. Malaria status (57% overall) and clinical severity were similar across groups. The 48-hour mortality was 10.6% (111 of 1050 children), 10.5% (110 of 1047 children), and 7.3% (76 of 1044 children) in the albumin-bolus, saline-bolus, and control groups, respectively (relative risk for saline bolus vs. control, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.90; P = 0.01; relative risk for albumin bolus vs. saline bolus, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.29; P = 0.96; and relative risk for any bolus vs. control, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.86; P = 0.003). The 4-week mortality was 12.2%, 12.0%, and 8.7% in the three groups, respectively (P = 0.004 for the comparison of bolus with control). Neurologic sequelae occurred in 2.2%, 1.9%, and 2.0% of the children in the respective groups (P = 0.92), and pulmonary edema or increased intracranial pressure occurred in 2.6%, 2.2%, and 1.7% (P = 0.17), respectively. In stratum B, 69% of the children (9 of 13) in the albumin-bolus group and 56% (9 of 16) in the saline-bolus group died (P = 0.45). The results were consistent across centers and across subgroups according to the severity of shock and status with respect to malaria, coma, sepsis, acidosis, and severe anemia.

Conclusions

Fluid boluses significantly increased 48-hour mortality in critically ill children with impaired perfusion in these resource-limited settings in Africa. (Funded by the Medical Research Council, United Kingdom; FEAST Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN69856593.).

### COVID-19 PICU guidelines: for high-and limited-resource settings [^113nTHeo]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment recommendations for shock

13 For children with COVID-19 and shock admitted to health systems with PICU availability (ventilatory support and access to vasoactive amines), administer bolus fluids, 10–20 ml/kg per bolus up to 40–60 ml/kg, over the first hour of resuscitation(Weak recommendation).
14 For children with COVID-19 and shock admitted to health systems without PICU availability (no ventilatory support and access to vasoactive amines): Patients without hypotension, no fluid bolus should be administered and maintenance fluids should be initiated (Strong recommendation). Patients with hypotension, administer bolus fluids, 10–20 ml/kg per bolus up to 40 ml/kg, over the first hour of resuscitation (Weak recommendation).
15 In children with COVID-19 and shock, crystalloid solutions should be administered, instead of colloids, for the initial fluid resuscitation. Specifically, we recommend use of balanced solutions over 0.9% saline (Weak recommendation).
16 In children with COVID-19 and shock, age-appropriate mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be targeted. In settings where accurate MAPs cannot be easily obtained, systolic blood pressure is an acceptable option (Strong recommendation).
17 In children with COVID-19 and shock, consider the use of advanced hemodynamic variables, when available (measurements of cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, and central venous oxygen saturation); these along with clinical variables at the bedside can guide resuscitation (Weak recommendation).
18 In children with COVID-19 and shock, in addition to clinical evaluation, trends in blood lactate levels can help guide resuscitation (Weak recommendation).
19 In children with COVID-19 and shock, epinephrine or norepinephrine should be administered, instead of dopamine. Diluted solution can be initiated through a peripheral intravenous catheter if central venous access is not available (Best practice recommendation).
20 In children with COVID-19 and shock who need high doses of catecholamines, consider initiating vasopressin (Best practice recommendation).
21 In children with COVID-19 and shock, recommendations regarding the use of inodilators cannot be made. But in clinical practice, inodilators such as milrinone, dobutamine or levosimendan could be used when there are signs of tissue hypoperfusion and cardiac dysfunction, despite high doses of catecholamines (Best Practice recommendation).
22 In children with COVID-19 and refractory shock, consider anti-inflammatory doses of glucocorticoids (Insufficient evidence).
23 In a pediatric patient with COVID-19 and severe disease, a thorough cardiac evaluation should be conducted including an EKG, echocardiography, and cardiac biomarker levels (troponin, CK and CK MB) (Strong recommendation).
24 Glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are potential suggested treatments for children with COVID-19-related myocarditis (Insufficient evidence).

### Update and harmonisation of guidance for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and young people in the UK [^11214RM1]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Although these guidelines now have greater cohesion, a number of minor differences remain:

Regarding fluid replacement, NICE have included two levels of severity of DKA, while BSPED have subdivided the stratification to include three discrete categories for severity and subsequent dehydration status, as outlined in table 1. A difference remains between the maximum weight considered by the guidelines when calculating fluid deficit. Given that the maximum weight considered for each is 75 kg for NICE and 80 kg for BSPED, the maximum difference in deficit fluids could be 1850 mL (5%×75 kg = 3750 mL for NICE compared with 7%×80 kg = 5600 mL for BSPED).
For patients who are clinically dehydrated, but not in shock, an intravenous 10 mL/kg bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride is recommended on admission. This should be administered over 30 min (NICE) or 60 min (BSPED). This volume is included in the fluid replacement when calculating the total fluid deficit. NICE recommend discussing with a paediatrician experienced in DKA management before giving more than one intravenous bolus. A second bolus should only be considered if needed to improve tissue perfusion and this must be done after reassessing their clinical status. A delicate balance between increasing the risk of osmolar shift secondary to rapid fluid administration, with the risk of dehydration and subsequent CO due to slower fluid administration, is the foundation for the initial discrepancy between the two guidelines. Guidance from the 2018 ISPAD consensus states that this should be administered between 30 min and 60 min, which falls between the two UK guidelines. Therefore, aiming to administer the fluid rapidly but observing for signs of potential deterioration and adjusting the rate accordingly will provide the best outcome for patients.
In the presence of hypovolaemic shock, both NICE and BSPED recommend an intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride bolus of 20 mL/kg. BSPED recommend repeating these infusions over 15 min to a maximum of 40 mL/kg, before considering the introduction of inotropes, while NICE recommends administering it as soon as possible. In both guidelines, the bolus for shock is not subtracted from total fluid deficit. While the nomenclature varies between these two guidelines, in practice, it is likely that these will represent similar time frames. Administering a 20 mL/kg 0.9% sodium chloride bolus to treat shock as quickly as possible should provide the best therapy for the patient.
When calculating fluid replacement, the NICE guidelines recommend a maximum weight of 75 kg, whereas BSPED recommend a maximum weight of 80 kg or 97th centile weight for age (whichever is lower). This discrepancy is unlikely to be encountered on a frequent basis in general paediatric practice. However, if the weight greatly exceeds 75 kg, it may be more appropriate for young people to be managed according to adult guidelines due to their increased body habitus. Additionally, identifying a CYP on the 97th centile can be difficult, especially in an emergency setting, and, therefore, this may be missed.

### A clinical and physiological prospective observational study on the management of pediatric shock in the post-fluid expansion as supportive therapy trial era [^112aadmF]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the results of the FEAST trial and the recommendations of the systematic review by Ford et al, we are concerned that the current recommendations by WHO risk potential harm to a far wider group of children, since it attempts to implement a set of guidelines separating what it considers as "true shock", that is, the WHO shock definition (three or more signs) from definitions that fewer features of shock which WHO guideline regards as "impaired perfusion" are bound to lead to slippage. Unlike in adult guidelines, where hypotension is a prerequisite for defining shock, hypotension in pediatric shock, as demonstrated by the FEAST trial, is a rare and serious event. In the FEAST trial of the 7,838 children with severe febrile illness screened for inclusion, only 29 (0.9%) fulfilled the definition of severe hypotension (FEAST B definition); all received fluid-bolus therapy and had poor outcomes (62% mortality by 48 hr) (3, 6). Notably, the WHO shock definition was not informed by relevant physiologic evidence and based on expert opinion which was intended to identify children with advanced shock including those with hypotension. In a subanalysis of the FEAST trial, we demonstrated that only eight of 29 hypotensive children (27.5%) actually fulfilled the WHO shock definition, and all of those children died. In this study, there was no hypotension noted at admission.

### WHO guidelines on fluid resuscitation in children: missing the FEAST data [^114BUQxX]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Change led by FEAST

The FEAST trial was praised for demonstrating how rigorous clinical research can be done in resource poor settings. Subsequently, the findings have been widely debated, as they challenged the primacy of bolus resuscitation as a lifesaving intervention for paediatric shock in resource limited settings and raised questions about their use elsewhere. Following publication of a systematic review of the evidence, Médicins Sans Frontières revised its paediatric shock guideline in March 2012.

A meeting hosted by the Kenyan Paediatric Association in October 2012 raised concern about WHO's lack of response to the FEAST results. Participants, including representatives from 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, sent a letter to WHO in March 2013, stating that they had reviewed the data and were advocating that their countries revise their guidelines for fluid management of shock. They requested that WHO do the same.

### Association between the first-hour intravenous fluid volume and mortality in pediatric septic shock [^111H8oCY]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To determine whether the receipt of more than or equal to 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluid in the first hour after emergency department (ED) arrival is associated with sepsis-attributable mortality among children with hypotensive septic shock.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study set in 57 EDs in the Improving Pediatric Sepsis Outcomes quality improvement collaborative. Patients less than 18 years of age with hypotensive septic shock who received their first intravenous fluid bolus within 1 hour of arrival at the ED were propensity-score matched for probability of receiving more than or equal to 30 mL/kg in the first hour. Sepsis-attributable mortality was compared. We secondarily evaluated the association between the first-hour fluid volume and sepsis-attributable mortality in all children with suspected sepsis in the first hour after arrival at the ED, regardless of blood pressure.

Results

Of the 1,982 subjects who had hypotensive septic shock and received a first fluid bolus within 1 hour of arrival at the ED, 1,204 subjects were propensity matched. In the matched patients receiving more than or equal to 30 mL/kg of fluid, 26 (4.3%) of 602 subjects had 30-day sepsis-attributable mortality compared with 25 (4.2%) of 602 receiving less than 30 mL/kg (odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 1.83). Among the patients with suspected sepsis regardless of blood pressure, 30-day sepsis-attributable mortality was 3.0% in those receiving more than or equal to 30 mL/kg versus 2.0% in those receiving less than 30 ml/kg (odds ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 2.44.) CONCLUSION: In children with hypotensive septic shock receiving a timely first fluid bolus within the first hour of ED care, receiving more than or equal to 30 mL/kg of bolus intravenous fluids in the first hour after arrival at the ED was not associated with mortality compared with receiving less than 30 mL/kg.

### Mortality risk over time after early fluid resuscitation in African children [^117Y631n]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Trial design and population

The FEAST trial was conducted in six centres (large regional referral hospitals and small district hospitals) across three countries (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania) from 2009 to 2011 (ISCRTN 69856593). Briefly, children aged 2 months to 12 years with severe febrile illness (pyrexia (≥ 37.5 °C) or hypothermia (< 36 °C)), one or both of impaired consciousness and respiratory distress, and clinical evidence of impaired perfusion (definitions given in Table 1) were included. Children with severe malnutrition, burns, trauma, gastroenteritis, or a presumed non-infectious cause of severe illness were excluded. Three thousand one hundred forty-one children without severe hypotension were randomised to receive boluses of 20 ml/kg of 5% human albumin solution or 0.9% saline solution over 1 h, or maintenance fluids only at 4 ml/kg/hr (no bolus control group) and are included in this retrospective post hoc analysis. In July 2010, a protocol amendment stipulated that children in the bolus groups who had persisting signs of impaired perfusion at 1 h should have a second 20 ml/kg bolus following their randomised allocation (total 40 ml/kg). Standardised case report forms were completed at enrolment, at specific time points during the first 48 h, and at a 28-day post-discharge follow-up visit. Throughout the hospital admission, severe adverse events were reported immediately and clinical features of suspected pulmonary oedema, raised intracranial pressure, evidence of hypovolaemia/shock, and allergic event were actively solicited.

### Resuscitation with early adrenaline infusion for children with septic shock: a randomized pilot trial [^114nNS36]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

In children with septic shock, guidelines recommend resuscitation with 40–60mL/kg of fluid boluses, yet there is a lack of evidence to support this practice. We aimed to determine the feasibility of a randomized trial comparing early adrenaline infusion with standard fluid resuscitation in children with septic shock.

Design

Open-label parallel randomized controlled, multicenter pilot study. The primary end point was feasibility; the exploratory clinical endpoint was survival free of organ dysfunction by 28 days.

Setting

Four pediatric Emergency Departments in Queensland, Australia.

Patients

Children between 28 days and 18 years old with septic shock.

Interventions

Patients were assigned 1:1 to receive a continuous adrenaline infusion after 20mL/kg fluid bolus resuscitation (n = 17), or standard care fluid resuscitation defined as delivery of 40 to 60mL/kg fluid bolus resuscitation prior to inotrope commencement (n = 23).

Measurements and Main Results

Forty of 58 eligible patients (69%) were consented with a median age of 3.7 years (interquartile range [IQR], 0.9–12.1 yr). The median time from randomization to inotropes was 16 minutes (IQR, 12–26min) in the intervention group, and 49 minutes (IQR, 29–63min) in the standard care group. The median amount of fluid delivered during the first 24 hours was 0mL/kg (IQR, 0–10.0mL/kg) in the intervention group, and 20.0mL/kg (14.6–28.6mL/kg) in the standard group (difference, -20.0; 95% CI, -28.0 to -12.0). The number of days alive and free of organ dysfunction did not differ between the intervention and standard care groups, with a median of 27 days (IQR, 26–27 d) versus 26 days (IQR, 25–27 d). There were no adverse events reported associated with the intervention.

Conclusions

In children with septic shock, a protocol comparing early administration of adrenaline versus standard care achieved separation between the study arms in relation to inotrope and fluid bolus use.

### A clinical and physiological prospective observational study on the management of pediatric shock in the post-fluid expansion as supportive therapy trial era [^114nH57b]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Procedures, Fluid Management, and Endpoints

Consecutive recruitment of the first 30 eligible and consenting children was done with no formal sample size calculation. Consent process followed that of the FEAST trial. All participants had structured clinical assessments, blood/urine samplings, 12-lead electrocardiograms and echocardiograms (Vivid.i General Electric Medical Systems with simultaneous electro-cardiogram display) recordings preformed at prespecified timepoints (baseline), postfluid resuscitation (at 8 hr), at 24 hours, and at 1-month follow-up (Methods, Supplementary Digital Content). Echocardiographic readings were reviewed independently by a cardiologist blinded to clinical status. Children with impaired perfusion received maintenance-only IV fluids (4 mL/kg/hr) as per FEAST control arm followed by oral hydration. Children with WHO shock (≥ 3 criteria) received an initial two 20 mL/kg boluses of saline given over 1 hour. Children with severe anemia (hemoglobin < 5 g/dL) or persisting signs of shock at 8 hours received blood transfusion (20 mL/kg whole blood or 10 mL/kg packed cells) over 3–4 hours as recommended by current WHO guidelines.

The endpoints included 48-hour mortality, correction (to normal ranges) of echocardiographic hemodynamic, myocardial performance indices, and cardiac biomarkers measuring evidence of myocardial injury (troponin) and stretch (natriuretic peptides) and adverse events related to the resuscitation.

### Variability in the hemodynamic response to fluid bolus in pediatric septic shock [^111rt34K]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Fluid boluses are commonly administered to improve the cardiac output and tissue oxygen delivery in pediatric septic shock. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of an early fluid bolus administered to children with septic shock on the cardiac index and mean arterial pressure, as well as on the hemodynamic response and its relationship with outcome.

Design, Setting, Patients, and Interventions

We prospectively collected hemodynamic data from children with septic shock presenting to the emergency department or the PICU who received a fluid bolus (10mL/kg of Ringers Lactate over 30min). A clinically significant response in cardiac index-responder and mean arterial pressure-responder was both defined as an increase of greater than or equal to 10% 10 minutes after fluid bolus.

Measurements and Main Results

Forty-two children with septic shock, 1 month to 16 years old, median Pediatric Risk of Mortality-III of 13 (interquartile range, 9–19), of whom 66% were hypotensive and received fluid bolus within the first hour of shock recognition. Cardiac index- and mean arterial pressure-responsiveness rates were 31% and 38%, respectively. We failed to identify any association between cardiac index and mean arterial pressure changes (r = 0.203; p = 0.196). Cardiac function was similar in mean arterial pressure- and cardiac index-responders and nonresponders. Mean arterial pressure-responders increased systolic, diastolic, and perfusion pressures (mean arterial pressure - central venous pressure) after fluid bolus due to higher indexed systemic vascular resistance and arterial elastance index. Mean arterial pressure-nonresponders required greater vasoactive-inotrope support and had higher mortality.

Conclusions

The hemodynamic response to fluid bolus in pediatric septic shock was variable and unpredictable. We failed to find a relationship between mean arterial pressure and cardiac index changes. The adverse effects of fluid bolus extended beyond fluid overload and, in some cases, was associated with reduced mean arterial pressure, perfusion pressures and higher vasoactive support. Mean arterial pressure-nonresponders had increased mortality. The response to the initial fluid bolus may be helpful to understand each patient's individualized physiologic response and guide continued hemodynamic management.

### Implications for paediatric shock management in resource-limited settings: a perspective from the FEAST trial [^112rZ9Yr]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The "Fluid Expansion as Supportive therapy" (FEAST) trial (detailed in "Methods") was designed to inform guidelines on fluid resuscitation in severe febrile illness in resource-limited settings. The FEAST trial, published in 2011, showed that fluid resuscitation was harmful and led to excess mortality in all subgroups and across all definitions of shock. The most recent review and the recommendations of the technical expert group that drew up the WHO Emergency Triage and Treatment guidelines (for resource-limited settings) in 2016 continue to recommend fluid boluses in children with shock as defined by the WHO ("WHO shock") maintaining that, whilst the direction of harm was entirely consistent with the overall analysis, the numbers in this subgroup of the FEAST trial were too small to provide reasonable certainty. We therefore have revisited the FEAST trial results and applied these to all international definitions of paediatric shock, with critical emphasis on WHO shock. Furthermore, since the FEAST trial identified very few children with WHO shock, we reviewed the applicability of the WHO shock definition to published data from admission or emergency departments reporting shock and outcome in resource-limited hospitals.

### A randomized controlled trial of isotonic versus hypotonic maintenance intravenous fluids in hospitalized children [^114LWY46]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Stratified analysis

Fluid management differed between medical and surgical patients. Therefore, although numbers were small, an exploratory analysis, stratified by admission type, was also conducted. Medical patients received the study fluid at 142% [IQR 118, 150] of the traditional maintenance rate, and 19.7 ml/kg [IQR 14.7, 20.8] of additional isotonic fluids, mostly in the form of boluses. In contrast, surgical patients received study fluid at 101% [IQR 94, 108] of the traditional maintenance rate, and received only 3.4 ml/kg [IQR 2.6, 8.7] of additional isotonic fluids. The duration and rate of study fluid administration, and volume of additional isotonic fluids were similar for the 0.9% and 0.45% saline groups overall. The changes in [Na] observed when medical and surgical patients were analyzed separately mirrored those in the unstratified analysis.

### Management of acute pancreatitis in the pediatric population: a clinical report from the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition pancreas committee [^115xeyXw]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric acute pancreatitis — fluid administration rate: Adult studies report that the group receiving the highest volume, > 4 L, had an increased rate of persistent organ failure, and that aggressive fluids (approximately 5 L) were associated with increased severity of disease and local complications. Adult guidance cited includes the American College of Gastroenterology recommending an initial rate of 250 to 500 mL/h in addition to boluses if hypotension or tachycardia is present and using BUN to direct therapy; Awais et al advises 3 to 4 L in the first 24 hours (not to exceed 4 L) with an initial 1 L bolus followed by 3 mL · kg −1 · h −1 for the first 24 to 48 hours; and Nasr recommends 1 to 2 L boluses initially and 150 to 300 mL/h for maintenance, with 2 mL · kg −1 · h −1 if the patient responds to initial resuscitation, otherwise 3 mL · kg −1 · h −1. Pediatric data include one study involving 201 patients in which early IV fluid (< 48 hours) plus aggressive fluids (> 1.5–2 times maintenance in the first 24 hours) decreased LOS and severe disease and aggressive IV fluids did not adversely affect outcomes; the adult literature summary suggests boluses of 250 to 1000 mL initially and up to 3 to 4 L fluids within first 24 hours. Recommendation 2ai states that children with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be provided 1.5 to 2 times maintenance IV fluids with monitoring of urine output over the next 24 to 48 hours, with 22/24 = 92% agreement (Strongly agree = 12; agree = 10; neutral = 2; disagree = 0; strongly disagree = 0).

### Predicting mortality in sick African children: the FEAST paediatric emergency triage (PET) score [^112mWx6N]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study setting

Derivation data came from the FEAST trial which took place in six centres (both large regional referral hospitals and small district hospitals) across three countries (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania) from 2009 to 2011 and enrolled 3,170 sick febrile children aged between 2 months and 12 years with clinical evidence of impaired perfusion (, ISCRTN 69856593). FEAST was conducted in malaria endemic areas where national vaccination programmes included Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine, but not a pneumococcal vaccine. Prior and during the trial, admitting clinicians and nurses received Emergency Triage Assessment and Treatment training, which included the assessment of clinical features of shock. Eligible children had an abnormal temperature (pyrexia (≥ 37.5 °C) or hypothermia (< 36 °C)), severe illness (presence of one or both of impaired consciousness (prostration, the inability of a child older than 8 months of age to sit upright or the inability of a child 8 months of age or younger to breast-feed; or coma, the inability to localize a painful stimulus) and respiratory distress) and clinical evidence of impaired perfusion (one or more of the following: capillary refill time > 2 s; lower limb temperature gradient, defined as a notable temperature change from cold (dorsum of foot) to warm (knee) when running the back of hand from the toe to the knee; weak radial pulse or severe tachycardia, defined as heart rate > 180 beats per min (bpm) for children < 1 year old, > 160 bpm for those 1 to 4 years old, > 140 bpm for those ≥ 5 years old). Children with severe malnutrition, burns, trauma, gastroenteritis, or a presumed non-infectious cause of severe illness were excluded. Children were randomised to receive boluses of 20–40 mL/kg of 5% human albumin solution or 0.9% saline solution over one hour, or maintenance fluids only at 4 mL/kg/h (no bolus control group). Those with severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 50 mmHg for those aged < 1 year, < 60 mmHg for those 1–4 years old, < 70 mmHg for those ≥ 5 years old) were randomly assigned in a separate stratum to receive 40 mL/kg bolus of either albumin or saline. All children enrolled in both strata were included in this study. Standardised case report forms were completed at enrolment and at specific time points during the first 48 h. At enrolment, lactate, haemoglobin, oxygen saturation, and glucose were measured and an HIV antibody test and rapid diagnostic test for malaria were performed. An automated handheld blood analyser (i-STAT, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) was used for immediate analyses of pH level, potassium, base excess, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium, chloride, TCO 2, and PCO 2. Children with haemoglobin < 5 g/dL were routinely transfused according to national guidelines.

### Variability in the physiologic response to fluid bolus in pediatric patients following cardiac surgery [^116kA1Pd]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid boluses aiming to improve the cardiac output and oxygen delivery are commonly administered in children with shock. An increased mean arterial pressure in addition to resolution of tachycardia and improved peripheral perfusion are often monitored as clinical surrogates for improvement in cardiac output. The objective of our study is to describe changes in cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, and their relationship to other indices of cardiovascular performance.

Objective

The objective of our study is to describe changes in cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, and their relationship to other indices of cardiovascular performance.

Design, Setting, Patients, and Interventions

We prospectively analyzed hemodynamic data from children in the cardiac ICU who received fluid bolus (10mL/kg of Ringers-Lactate over 30 min) for management of shock and/or hypoperfusion within 12h of cardiac surgery. Cardiac index responders and mean arterial pressure-responders were defined as CI ≥ 10% and mean arterial pressure ≥ 10%, respectively. We evaluated the gradient for venous-return (mean systemic filling pressure-central venous pressure), arterial load properties (systemic vascular resistance index and elastance index) and changes in vasopressor support after fluid bolus.

Measurements and Main Results

Fifty-seven children between 1 month and 16 years (median Risk adjustment after congenital heart surgery Model for Outcome Surveillance in Australia and New Zealand score of 3.8 (interquartile range 3.7–4.6) received fluid bolus. Cardiac index-responsiveness and mean arterial pressure-responsiveness rates were 33% and 56%, respectively. No significant correlation was observed between changes in mean arterial pressure and cardiac index (r = 0.035, p = 0.79). Although the mean systemic filling pressure - central venous pressure and the number of cardiac index-responders after fluid bolus were similar, the arterial load parameters did not change in mean arterial pressure-nonresponders. Forty-three patients (75%) had a change in Vasoactive-Inotrope Score after the fluid bolus, of whom 60% received higher level of vasoactive support.

Conclusions

The mean arterial pressure response to fluid bolus in cardiac ICU patients was unpredictable with a poor relationship between cardiac index-responsiveness and mean arterial pressure-responsiveness. Because arterial hypotension is frequently a trigger for administering fluids and changes in blood pressure are commonly used for tracking changes in cardiac output, we suggest a cautious and individualized approach to repeat fluid bolus based solely on lack of mean arterial pressure response to the initial fluid, since the implications include decreased arterial tone even if the cardiac index increases.

### Pediatric advanced life support. pediatric shock care [^116wHKdS]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric cardiogenic shock care — initial fluid and vasoactive support (Last Full Review: ILCOR 2020) states that a fluid bolus of 5 to 10 milliliters per kilogram (ml/kg) of crystalloid fluid should be administered for cardiogenic shock over 10 to 20 minutes, and after each bolus the child or infant should be reassessed for signs of hypervolemia and worsening cardiac failure; milrinone may be considered as clinically indicated, and epinephrine, dopamine, or dobutamine additively or independently may be considered as clinically indicated for cardiogenic shock. Children and infants who remain in shock despite adequate fluid resuscitation or who cannot tolerate ongoing aggressive fluid therapy are candidates for other supportive (namely, vasoactive) therapies; the ILCOR recommendation states that the catecholamine dose for inotropic support in cardiogenic shock must be titrated for each individual because there is wide variability in the clinical response to vasoactive drugs, that it is reasonable to use epinephrine, levosimendan, dopamine, or dobutamine for inotropic support in infants and children with cardiogenic shock, that milrinone may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of low cardiac output following cardiac surgery, and that there are insufficient data to support or refute the use of norepinephrine in pediatric cardiogenic shock.

### Hemodynamic response to fluid boluses in patients with single-ventricle parallel circulation [^116aHTNU]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of fluid bolus in response to a hypotensive episode by evaluating high-fidelity hemodynamic data obtained from children with single-ventricle anatomy and parallel circulation. Single center, retrospective analysis of hemodynamic and oximetric data after fluid bolus administrations within the first 2 weeks post-surgery. A baseline (- 60 to - 10 min), hypotensive episode (- 10 to 0 min), and response interval (0 to 60 min) were defined to quantify the dynamics of vital signs. The responses assessed include heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, oxygen extraction ratios, and pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratios. Mixed effects models were used to account for the repeated measures over the response interval. The analysis included 67 fluid boluses. There is a decrease in heart rate and an increase in blood pressure during the response in comparison to the hypotensive time. These vitals rapidly return to the baseline values. The boluses induced a significant decrease in renal and cerebral oxygen extraction ratios, with no significant change in arterial oxygen saturation or pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio. The type of bolus (normal saline versus albumin) did not affect the response in blood pressure. However, in comparison with albumin, normal saline had a more favorable effect on the renal and cerebral oxygen extraction ratios. This study demonstrates that fluid boluses are an effective rescue medication for hypotensive episodes in children with parallel circulation by improving hemodynamics, as well as markers of oxygen delivery. The type of bolus (normal saline versus albumin) did not affect the blood pressure response. However, normal saline had a more pronounced effect on the renal and cerebral oxygen extraction ratios than albumin.

### Fluid resuscitation in pediatric cerebral malaria: insights from the FEAST trial and further evidence from Malawi [^1177TWRh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Worldwide, fluid boluses remain the standard of care for the emergency treatment of shock. Unlike the situation in adults, in whom shock is defined by hypotension, pediatric shock criteria largely focus on signs of impaired perfusion, since it is widely held by experts informing resuscitation guidelines that hypotension is a late complication of shock, despite minimal data to support this assertion. The term "compensated shock" is therefore more widely accepted in pediatric practice and is synonymous with severely impaired perfusion. The Fluid Expansion as a Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial was conducted to generate the relevant evidence for fluid resuscitation in resource-poor hospitals in Africa, where access to mechanical ventilation and inotropic therapy were not, and are still not, routinely available.

The design of the FEAST trial was pragmatic, including large subgroups of sepsis and malaria. Overall, in the stratum with compensated shock, 57% of children had malaria parasitemia, 15% had coma, and 12% had culture-proven bacterial sepsis. The trial was stopped early by the data and safety monitoring committee due to excess mortality in children randomized to a fluid bolus compared to controls (relative risk 1.45 [1.13–1.86] P = 0.003). Results were consistent across subgroups, including malaria, coma, sepsis, acidosis, and severe anemia. Adverse events of suspected raised intracranial pressure and pulmonary edema were prospectively monitored and adjudicated by an endpoint committee who were blind to the intervention arm. Suspected increased intracranial pressure events occurred in 2.6%, 2.2%, and 1.7% (P = 0.17) in the albumin-bolus, saline-bolus and control (no bolus) arms, respectively.

### Resuscitation with early adrenaline infusion for children with septic shock: a randomized pilot trial [^116KLMyH]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Septic shock is characterized by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction as a result of the body's dysregulated response to infection. Mortality in children with septic shock ranges from 17% to 32%. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommends an initial treatment bundle consisting of broad-spectrum antibiotics, blood culture sampling, and 40–60 mL/kg of IV fluid, which must be initiated within 1 hour of recognizing septic shock. The administration of 40–60 mL/kg of IV fluid was classified as a weak recommendation as the optimal amount of fluid resuscitation for children remains unknown. Referring to the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial, the SSC guidelines recommend against initial fluid-based resuscitation in settings where no intensive care can be provided.

While liberal fluid-based resuscitation has represented a hallmark of pediatric septic shock treatment, accumulating observational evidence suggests that excess administration of fluid can result in harm. An analysis of 3,969 children reported that a higher fluid bolus administration rate was associated with increased adjusted odds of death, and of mechanical respiratory support. The rationale in delivering IV fluid in septic shock is founded upon the assumption that fluid boluses can restore hemodynamic stability and improve tissue oxygen delivery. Yet, septic children may not be hypovolemic, and they often manifest impaired cardiac function combined with variable degrees of vasoplegia. To date, there is a lack of clinically directive data on whether starting inotropes early to reduce the administration of resuscitation fluid is feasible, safe, and whether it may be superior compared to standard resuscitation in children with sepsis.

We performed the Early Resuscitation in Paediatric Sepsis Using Inotropes — A Pilot Randomised Controlled Pilot Study in the Emergency Department (RESPOND ED) study to investigate the feasibility of early adrenaline infusion (after 20 mL/kg IV fluids) compared to standard sepsis resuscitation (delivery of 40–60 mL/kg IV fluid before starting inotropes) in children with sepsis.

### Strategies for intravenous fluid resuscitation in trauma patients [^114nER8L]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Special groups

Pediatrics

Infants and children suffer from trauma, particularly vehicular trauma, with an increasing incidence in the developing world. Children differ from adults in having a larger circulating blood volume (80 ml/kg in a term neonate) that decreases with age to the adult level of 70 ml/kg. While the relative blood volume is larger, the absolute volumes required are small and should ideally be delivered through flow control devices (infusion pumps/syringe drivers). A cheap precaution is to deliver all clear fluids through a 60-drop-per-minute administration set rather than the 10-/15-drop-per-minute sets used for adults.

Restoration of circulating volume is a priority with the establishment of vascular access via a peripheral line, central (commonly femoral) line or intra-osseous line. The access should not be established distal to a site of injury (e.g. femoral line with blunt abdominal trauma) as the resuscitation fluid will extravasate into the injured area.

The principles of goal-directed therapy apply equally well to children as to adults. Initial resuscitation should be with 20 ml/kg of balanced crystalloid. There is limited information on the efficacy and safety of synthetic colloids (e.g. HES) in children, with some evidence that hemodynamic goals are achieved more quickly and with smaller volumes but at increased cost and with no evidence of outcome benefit.

The role of all clear fluids is limited in trauma resuscitation due to their adverse effects of dilutional coagulopathy and anemia and generation of edema that hinders tissue perfusion and promotes organ dysfunction (including ileus, abdominal compartment syndrome and ARDS). The volume of clear fluid should not exceed 40 ml/kg. Administration of blood and blood products (platelets and plasma) should be considered depending on the response to the initial 20 ml/kg crystalloid bolus and the severity of injury. Due to the small volumes required, many pediatricians use human colloids such as plasma or albumin for intravascular volume replacement in preference to synthetic clear fluids.

Pediatric septic shock — clinical markers and monitoring during fluid resuscitation. Clinical markers of cardiac output may include heart rate, blood pressure, capillary refill time, level of consciousness, and urine output. In all settings, the need for fluid administration should be guided by frequent reassessment of clinical markers of cardiac output, serial blood lactate measurement and advanced monitoring, when available. Signs of fluid overload that should limit further fluid bolus therapy may include clinical signs of pulmonary edema or new or worsening hepatomegaly.

### A clinical and physiological prospective observational study on the management of pediatric shock in the post-fluid expansion as supportive therapy trial era [^111PJnVW]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Fluid bolus resuscitation in African children is harmful. Little research has evaluated physiologic effects of maintenance-only fluid strategy.

Design

We describe the efficacy of fluid-conservative resuscitation of septic shock using case-fatality, hemodynamic, and myocardial function endpoints.

Setting

Pediatric wards of Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda, and Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya, conducted between October 2013 and July 2015. Data were analysed from August 2016 to July 2019.

Patients

Children (≥ 60 d to ≤ 12 yr) with severe febrile illness and clinical signs of impaired perfusion.

Interventions

IV maintenance fluid (4mL/kg/hr) unless children had World Health Organization (WHO) defined shock (≥ 3 signs) where they received two fluid boluses (20mL/kg) and transfusion if shock persisted. Clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and laboratory data were collected at presentation, during resuscitation and on day 28. Outcome measures were 48-hour mortality, normalization of hemodynamics, and cardiac biomarkers.

Measurement and Main Results

Thirty children (70% males) were recruited, six had WHO shock, all of whom died (6/6) versus three of 24 deaths in the non-WHO shock. Median fluid volume received by survivors and nonsurvivors were similar (13 [interquartile range (IQR), 9–32] vs 30mL/kg [28–61mL/kg], z = 1.62, p = 0.23). By 24 hours, we observed increases in median (IQR) stroke volume index (39mL/m 2 [32–42mL/m 2] to 47mL/m 2 [41–49mL/m 2]) and a measure of systolic function: fractional shortening from 30 (27–33) to 34 (31–38) from baseline including children managed with no-bolus. Children with WHO shock had a higher mean level of cardiac troponin (t = 3.58; 95% CI, 1.24–1.43; p = 0.02) and alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (t = 16.5; 95% CI, 2.80–67.5; p < 0.01) at admission compared with non-WHO shock. Elevated troponin (> 0.1 μg/mL) and hyperlactatemia (> 4 mmol/L) were putative makers predicting outcome.

Conclusions

Maintenance-only fluid therapy normalized clinical and myocardial perturbations in shock without compromising cardiac or hemodynamic function whereas fluid-bolus management of WHO shock resulted in high fatality. Troponin and lactate biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction could be promising outcome predictors in pediatric septic shock in resource-limited settings.

### Resuscitation with early adrenaline infusion for children with septic shock: a randomized pilot trial [^114GyET7]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES:

In children with septic shock, guidelines recommend resuscitation with 40–60 mL/kg of fluid boluses, yet there is a lack of evidence to support this practice. We aimed to determine the feasibility of a randomized trial comparing early adrenaline infusion with standard fluid resuscitation in children with septic shock.

DESIGN:

Open-label parallel randomized controlled, multicenter pilot study. The primary end point was feasibility; the exploratory clinical endpoint was survival free of organ dysfunction by 28 days.

SETTING:

Four pediatric Emergency Departments in Queensland, Australia.

PATIENTS:

Children between 28 days and 18 years old with septic shock.

INTERVENTIONS:

Patients were assigned 1:1 to receive a continuous adrenaline infusion after 20 mL/kg fluid bolus resuscitation (n = 17), or standard care fluid resuscitation defined as delivery of 40 to 60 mL/kg fluid bolus resuscitation prior to inotrope commencement (n = 23).

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:

Forty of 58 eligible patients (69%) were consented with a median age of 3.7 years (interquartile range [IQR], 0.9–12.1 yr). The median time from randomization to inotropes was 16 minutes (IQR, 12–26 min) in the intervention group, and 49 minutes (IQR, 29–63 min) in the standard care group. The median amount of fluid delivered during the first 24 hours was 0 mL/kg (IQR, 0–10.0 mL/kg) in the intervention group, and 20.0 mL/kg (14.6–28.6 mL/kg) in the standard group (difference, –20.0; 95% CI, –28.0 to –12.0). The number of days alive and free of organ dysfunction did not differ between the intervention and standard care groups, with a median of 27 days (IQR, 26–27 d) versus 26 days (IQR, 25–27 d). There were no adverse events reported associated with the intervention.

CONCLUSIONS:

In children with septic shock, a protocol comparing early administration of adrenaline versus standard care achieved separation between the study arms in relation to inotrope and fluid bolus use.

### Fluid accumulation in critically ill children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xFudM]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the harm of FA, the effectiveness of restrictive fluid therapies or active fluid removal strategies (deresuscitation) is still debated. There is a notable scarcity of paediatric evidence on this topic. The FEAST trial, published in 2011, remains the sole randomised clinical trial comparing fluid bolus versus no-bolus therapy in children. Maitland et al. enrolled 3141 children with severe febrile illness and impaired perfusion in resource-limited sub-Saharan African settings without PICU access. Participants who received fluid boluses had higher 48-h mortality than the control group. The study did not report data on FA. However, fluid bolus administered for resuscitation may not be the main driver of FA in critically ill patients. A large cohort study involving 14,483 patients found that 52% of participants received non-resuscitative fluids in excess of hydration requirements, with nutrition and fluid maintenance being the main sources of fluid burden. Excessive non-resuscitative fluids were associated with increased mortality and fewer ventilation-free days. In adults, the unintentional volume administered as a vehicle for medication or electrolytes, known as fluid creep, constitutes a significant portion of the mean daily total fluid volume (32.6%). This insidious and often forgotten volume could represent a promising target for intervention in further studies.

Some limitations of the present meta-analysis need to be addressed. First, since FA cannot be randomised, its assessment is predominantly based on observational research, leading to inherent biases. Consequently, most of the studies included in this systematic review were observational, many of which were retrospective and not adequately controlled for confounding variables. Given the complex cause-and-effect relationship between FA and mortality, our results do not allow us to infer that decreasing FA reduces mortality. Second, as previously discussed, this meta-analysis demonstrates considerable clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Despite our efforts to classify studies based on similar FA definitions, some studies grouped in the same stratum may exhibit slight methodological differences. Third, most authors did not consider FA occurred before the inclusion of participants, which may have underestimated the %FA in their analyses. Fourth, many data were reported as medians and IQR and thus needed to be converted to means and SD, which may have caused imprecisions in effect estimates. Finally, certain individuals were enrolled in more than one study or evaluated with diverse FA definitions, leading to their multiple inclusions in the meta-analyses.

Volume of fluid administration by fluid bolus exposure group

Table 1 summarizes the volume of fluid boluses received indexed for weight and the resultant sodium and chloride loads administered for each fluid exposure group. Only fluid administered as "bolus" was included in the total bolus volume calculation. Among the 559 patients in the cohort, the median volume of fluid boluses administered was 41 [IQR 25, 64] ml/kg. There was no difference in the volume of fluid given to the 0.9%NaCl group compared to the LR group, but the mixed group received a greater volume (median of 57 [IQR 39, 72] ml/kg) in fluid boluses (p < 0.001). The mixed group typically received at least one bolus of 0.9%NaCl and at least one bolus of LR. Sodium and chloride load was also different across fluid exposure groups, with the highest load of each seen in the 0.9% NaCl group, and the lowest in the LR group.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^113dD1yF]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric septic shock initial fluid choice — crystalloids versus albumin — We suggest using crystalloids, rather than albumin, for the initial resuscitation of children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In the FEAST trial of 3,141 African children randomly assigned to resuscitation with 5% human albumin solution or 0.9% saline boluses or no boluses, comparing human albumin solution to 0.9% saline showed no difference in mortality (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.8–1.28), and therefore we suggest against the routine use of albumin for initial fluid resuscitation in children with sepsis. Remarks note that although there is no difference in outcomes, this recommendation takes into consideration cost and other barriers of administering albumin compared with crystalloids.

Table 2 summarizes the recommended doses in pediatric patients, predominantly ASA physical status I, II, or III. In pediatric patients, remifentanil was administered with nitrous oxide or nitrous oxide in combination with halothane, sevoflurane, or isoflurane. The use of atropine may blunt the potential for bradycardia that can occur upon administration of remifentanil HCl.

Table 2: Dosing Guidelines in Pediatric Patients – Maintenance of Anesthesia

aAn initial dose of 1 mcg/kg may be administered over 30 to 60 seconds.

bThe clearance rate in neonates is highly variable, on average two times higher than in the young healthy adult population. Therefore, an increased infusion rate may be necessary to maintain adequate surgical anesthesia, and additional bolus doses may be required.

The use of atropine may blunt the potential for bradycardia that can occur upon administration of remifentanil HCl. [See Clinical Pharmacology: Specific Populations: Pediatric Population (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.4).]

cBoluses of 1 mcg/kg were studied in ASA 1 and 2, full-term patients weighing at least 2500 gm, undergoing pyloromyotomy who received pretreatment with atropine. Neonates receiving supplementation with potent inhalation agents or neuraxial anesthesia, those with significant co-morbidities or undergoing significant fluid shifts, or those who have not been pretreated with atropine, may require smaller bolus doses to avoid hypotension and/or bradycardia.

We were unable to issue a recommendation for a specific first-line vasoactive infusion for children with septic shock and we were unable to issue a recommendation about initiating vasoactive agents through peripheral access in children with septic shock. It is reasonable to begin vasoactive infusions after 40–60 mL/kg of fluid resuscitation if the patient continues to have evidence of abnormal perfusion, either epinephrine or norepinephrine may be administered through a peripheral vein (or intraosseous, if in place) if central venous access is not readily accessible, and dopamine may be substituted as the first-line vasoactive infusion, administered either peripherally or centrally, if epinephrine or norepinephrine is not readily available.

Adherence to protocol

In the plan C arm, 2 children met the criteria for shock on admission and received boluses (1 child had one bolus of 20 ml/kg and 1 child had 2 × 20 ml/kg boluses) and 1 child in the slow arm met the shock criteria and did not receive a bolus (Table 4). The time taken to start fluids was similar in both arms with a mean 15 min (sd 18) from randomisation. At 1 h, children < 1 year had received a mean 20.2 ml/kg (sd 12.2) and children ≥ 1 year received 33.1 ml/kg (sd 17) in plan C arm and children in the slow arm received a mean 10.4 ml/kg (sd 6.6). By 8 h, the mean volume received was very similar between arms (96.3 ml/kg (sd 15.6) children < 1 year and 97.8 ml/kg (sd 10.0) for children ≥ 1 year in plan C, and 93.2 ml/kg (sd 12.2) in slow arm) (Table 2, Fig. 2). Non-adherence to protocol occurred in one child in the plan C arm who died before receiving the total amount of fluids and 2 patients in the slow arm received their fluids over a longer period of time (24 and 28 h respectively) than described in the protocol. An additional 2 patients (one in each arm) had an incomplete recording of the fluid volume received.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^113d9FF3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis early care — intravenous fluid and timing of vasopressors — We agree with delivering an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus during initial management of patients who have hypotension or findings of hypoperfusion absent signs of fluid overload. We do not support a prespecified volume or body mass–adjusted volume of fluid for all patients, though we recognize many patients benefit from 30 mL/kg of crystalloid; patient response may serve as the best indicator of the appropriateness of fluid resuscitation volume, rather than the delivery of a prespecified volume. We do not recognize a specific minimum fluid amount before starting vasopressor support, and vasopressor support may be coupled with plasma volume expansion in severe hypotension or life‑threatening hypoperfusion without requiring that a fluid administration threshold be reached prior to vasopressor initiation. We think serial examinations using more than one bedside tool to assess adequacy of resuscitation are best, with no one approach demonstrated as superior. We support using balanced crystalloid solutions as the primary resuscitation fluid in patients with sepsis, especially if volumes of more than 1 L are used, and note that infusions of saline solution can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may impair renal performance in commonly prescribed resuscitative doses.

### A clinical and physiological prospective observational study on the management of pediatric shock in the post-fluid expansion as supportive therapy trial era [^111wEZmD]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Volume Administered During Initial 24 Hours

At admission, all patients received initial fluid management with IV maintenance-only fluid (4 mL/kg/hr) except those with WHO shock who received fluid bolus therapy; 11 children with severe anemia (hemoglobin < 5 g/dL) at presentation and seven children with persistent shock received blood transfusion (10 mL/kg packed cells or 20 mL/kg whole blood). Overall, median IV volume given was 14 mL/kg/d (IQR, 10–35 mL/kg/d) since many were able to take oral fluids early in admission. The median volume of fluids administered to nonsurvivors was 30 mL/kg (IQR, 28–61 mL/kg) compared with median volume received by survivors 13 mL/kg (IQR, 9–32 mL/kg) (p = 0.23). Mean red cell transfusion volume in 11 children with hemoglobin less than 5 g/dL was 9 mL/kg (IQR, 7–11 mL/kg); seven of 11 patients (64%) required greater than or equal to two transfusions. Over 24 hours, the median volume of blood transfused in nonsurvivors was 16 mL/kg (IQR, 8–21 mL/kg) compared with medium volume received by survivors 8 mL/kg (IQR, 6–12 mL/kg) (p = 0.24).

Outcome

By 48 hours, there were nine of 30 fatalities (30%), all occurring less than 40 hours post admission with the majority of seven of nine (78%) occurring by 24 hours (Fig. S2, Supplementary Digital Content, shows Kaplan-Meier survival at 48 hr and day 28). Six of the fatalities (67%), five of whom died within 6 hours, had WHO shock translating to a case fatality of 6/6 versus 3/24 in children with less than two shock criteria (χ 2 = 7.27; p = 0.007). The clinical narratives of all fatalities are summarized in Table S3 (Supplementary Digital Content).

### Fluid resuscitation in neonatal and pediatric hypovolemic shock: a Dutch pediatric society evidence-based clinical practice guideline [^116BmyEV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a clinical practice guideline that provides recommendations for the fluid, i.e. colloid or crystalloid, used for resuscitation in critically ill neonates and children up to the age of 18 years with hypovolemia.

Methods

The guideline was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the pediatric literature. Recommendations were formulated by a national multidisciplinary committee involving all stakeholders in neonatal and pediatric intensive care and were based on research evidence from the literature and, in areas where the evidence was insufficient or lacking, on consensus after discussions in the committee.

Results

Because of the lack of evidence in neonates and children, trials conducted in adults were considered. We found several recent meta-analyses that show excess mortality in albumin-treated groups, compared with crystalloid-treated groups, and one recent large randomized controlled trial that found evidence of no mortality difference. We found no evidence that synthetic colloids are superior to crystalloid solutions.

Conclusions

Given the state of the evidence and taking all other considerations into account, the guideline-developing group and the multidisciplinary committee recommend that in neonates and children with hypovolemia the first-choice fluid for resuscitation should be isotonic saline.

### Hemodynamic response to calcium chloride boluses in single-ventricle patients with parallel circulation [^116hJENe]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of calcium bolus in response to a hypotensive episode by assessing high-fidelity hemodynamic data obtained from children with single-ventricle physiology with parallel circulation. Single-center, retrospective analysis of hemodynamic data after calcium bolus administrations within the first 2 weeks post-surgery. Time intervals were the baseline (-60 to-10 min); the hypotensive episode (-10 to 0 min); time point zero at the bolus administration; and the response (0 to 60 min). The main responses assessed were the peak increase in mean blood pressure (mBP), duration of the response after the bolus, and markers of oximetric effects. These analyses included 128 boluses in 63 patients. Of the total boluses analyzed, 80% increased the mBP by 5 mmHg or higher with the effect lasting at least 10 min, whereas 10% of the boluses analyzed increased the mBP by 20 mmHg or higher with the effect lasting at least 50 min. The boluses induced a significant increase in arterial oxygen saturation and an upward trend in pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio, without increasing renal or cerebral oxygen extraction ratios. Calcium chloride boluses are an effective rescue medication for hypotensive episodes in children with parallel circulation. They lead to an improvement in mBP, as well as an increase in pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio. More importantly, these boluses do not compromise systemic oxygen delivery.

### Restricted fluid bolus volume in early septic shock: results of the fluids in shock pilot trial [^115i3nGS]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Rapid, bolus fluid resuscitation is integral to the management of children presenting with septic shock. The 2009 American College of Critical Care Medicine-Pediatric Advanced Life Support (ACCM-PALS) clinical guideline recommended fluid resuscitation with boluses of 20 mL/kg, up to a total of 200 mL/kg in the first hour. However, this recommendation is now controversial; it was based on retrospective observational studies, some involving small numbers of children, and audit data have shown that the recommendations are often not followed.

In Africa, a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT), the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial, compared bolus fluid resuscitation of 20 mL/kg with maintenance fluid in over 3000 children with severe infection. The study reported 35% higher mortality associated with bolus fluid resuscitation. Although conducted in Africa in a low-income setting, the FEAST trial highlighted the lack of evidence for bolus fluid resuscitation for children in middle-income and high-income settings.

No trial has compared restricted bolus fluid resuscitation strategy with recommended bolus fluid resuscitation in children with septic shock in high-income countries. In the UK, children presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with severe sepsis and discussed with a paediatric intensive care retrieval service have a reported mortality of up to 17%. With emerging data suggesting that excessive fluid administration is associated with worse outcomes in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), the optimal amount of fluid for resuscitation for children presenting with septic shock remains an important unanswered question.

To address this problem, the Fluids in Shock (FiSh) trial was developed, which aimed to evaluate whether a restricted fluid bolus volume (10 mL/kg), compared with currently recommended fluid bolus volume (20 mL/kg), is associated with improved outcomes for children presenting to UK EDs with presumed septic shock. Our initial qualitative feasibility study results have been reported previously. This paper reports the results of the external pilot trial and embedded parent and staff perspectives study.

### Phase II trial of isotonic fluid resuscitation in Kenyan children with severe malnutrition and hypovolaemia [^111XuCSA]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

The criteria for shock and fluid management recommendations are a distinct departure from contemporary paediatric practice which advocates the recognition of an early phase of shock (compensated shock) and rapid correction with isotonic resuscitation fluids to restore circulatory volume. These have been implemented widely and prospectively evaluated. Children who were managed according to American College of Critical Care Medicine/Pediatric Advanced Life Support (ACCM-PALS) guideline that received up to 60 mls/kg of isotonic fluid resuscitation over the first hour by community physicians or para-medics show a nine-fold reduction in mortality compared to cases who were not managed in accordance with these recommendations. Importantly, these guidelines are widely practiced throughout the world, largely by non specialists but are still not standard practice in many African hospitals where they have yet to be evaluated.

In light of the high mortality of children with severe malnutrition and features of shock we undertook a prospective evaluation of volume resuscitation in a pilot study (F luid resuscitation I n M alnutrition Trial: FIM). The FIM trial was conducted to examine the safety and efficacy of isotonic (0.9% sodium content) low volume fluid resuscitation and current WHO resuscitation protocol using low-volume hypotonic fluids. In this trial, we used isotonic fluids very cautiously, using similar volumes to those used WHO resuscitation protocol. In the absence of any safety data for this study population, the administration of appropriate volume resuscitation, as recommended internationally, was not incorporated in the design before the generation of the relevant haemodynamic data for which the risks and benefits could be assessed.

### Perioperative intravenous fluid therapy in children: guidelines from the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany [^114CAthu]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

This consensus- based S1 Guideline for perioperative infusion therapy in children is focused on safety and efficacy. The objective is to maintain or re-establish the child's normal physiological state (normovolemia, normal tissue perfusion, normal metabolic function, normal acid- base- electrolyte status). Therefore, the perioperative fasting times should be as short as possible to prevent patient discomfort, dehydration, and ketoacidosis. A physiologically composed balanced isotonic electrolyte solution (BS) with 1–2.5% glucose is recommended for the intraoperative background infusion to maintain normal glucose concentrations and to avoid hyponatremia, hyperchloremia, and lipolysis. Additional BS without glucose can be used in patients with circulatory instability until the desired effect is achieved. The additional use of colloids (albumin, gelatin, hydroxyethyl starch) is recommended to recover normovolemia and to avoid fluid overload when crystalloids alone are not sufficient and blood products are not indicated. Monitoring should be extended in cases with major surgery, and autotransfusion maneuvers should be performed to assess fluid responsiveness.

### An observational study using ultrasound to assess physiological changes following fluid bolus administration in paediatric sepsis in the emergency department [^114VdYeR]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is the final common pathway and mode of death for many paediatric infectious processes, globally accounting for over 6 million childhood deaths per year, mostly in underdeveloped countries. Case fatality rates are 5–10% in industrialised countries, and 20–30% in low and middle income countries. Despite being common and serious, the therapies for the initial resuscitation of paediatric sepsis are based on little or no evidence. In particular, fluid resuscitation therapy (FRT) is widely recommended for initial sepsis resuscitation, but there is limited understanding of its potential beneficial and harmful effects, how the balance of benefits and harms may be influenced by patient and disease factors, and how this balance may be incorporated into treatment guidelines for translation into clinical use.

Fluid resuscitation was initially described in patients with severe dehydration during cholera epidemics in the early 19 th century, and subsequently applied to trauma patients with haemorrhagic shock. Both of these disease states are characterised by intravascular volume depletion, and replacement of this intravascular volume with the same type of fluid that was lost helps to restore homeostasis. Fluid resuscitation for sepsis was popularised in 2001, when early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) was shown to improve survival in adults with septic shock when instituted in the emergency department (ED). This approach involved aggressive fluid resuscitation to achieve threshold central venous pressure (CVP) values, followed by early initiation of vasoactive agents for ongoing hypotension, and transfusion of blood for low central venous oxygen saturations (ScvO2). As the initial therapy in EGDT, aggressive fluid resuscitation was the most commonly applied in practice, and the foundation upon which subsequent therapies were based. Since the publication of the EGDT protocol, the harms from aggressive fluid resuscitation and cumulative positive fluid balance have become apparent, and the benefit of EGDT compared to standard care has been called into question. In particular, the Fluid Expansion As Supportive Therapy (FEAST) study found that FRT in Sub-Saharan African children with fever and signs of poor perfusion increased mortality compared to no FRT. This raises serious questions about the role of FRT in the management of sepsis, and our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FRT in conditions where no volume loss has occurred.

Fluid resuscitation evidence base — pediatric sepsis RCTs including FEAST. Three RCTs of different volume resuscitation strategies in children with septic shock in settings in which advanced supportive care (e.g., intubation, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care) was accessible have been published, with a combined total of only 316 children and no difference in mortality between restrictive and liberal strategies. The FEAST study was conducted in Africa in a low-resource setting without access to PICU admission; children between 60 days and 12 years old were randomized to either rapid volume expansion with 20 mL/kg of IV 0.9% saline or 5% albumin or no bolus with maintenance fluid only (control group). Among the 3,141 study participants, malaria and anemia were highly prevalent, and the trial showed lower mortality after 48 hours with conservative fluid therapy, with a RR of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.57–0.9).

### Electrolyte derangements in critically ill children receiving balanced versus unbalanced crystalloid fluid resuscitation [^113cVhkP]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study that evaluated the use of different types of resuscitative fluids (0.9% NaCl, LR, or mixed) and resultant electrolyte values among pediatric patients who were admitted to two large quaternary pediatric intensive care units (PICUs), Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) and Children's Hospital Colorado (CHCO), between November 2017 and February 2020. This study was approved by the institutional review boards at both institutions with a waiver of informed consent.

Patient selection

All patients ≥ 1 month and < 18 years of age who were admitted to the PICU were assessed for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were the following: 1) receipt of at least one fluid bolus (≥ 20 mL/kg or 1 L if ≥ 50 kg) during the 12 h prior to PICU admission or within the first 24 h after PICU admission; 2) PICU length of stay (LOS) greater than 48 h; and 3) at least 2 measurements of pH with serum electrolyte values (sodium, chloride, potassium) within the first 7 days of PICU admission. Exclusion criteria included: 1) a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, defined as Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Criteria stage G2 (mildly decreased GFR ≥ 60 to < 90 ml/min/1.73m 2) to stage G5 (kidney failure with GFR < 15 ml/min/1.73m 2); 2) patients admitted with traumatic brain injury or pre-/post-operative from neurosurgical procedures, due to the use of hypertonic saline for treatment/prevention of cerebral edema and exposure to an extreme sodium and chloride load; and 3) patients who were transferred from facilities outside of the hospital care network, due to incomplete documentation of fluids administered. Patients with complex congenital heart disease were also excluded, as they are managed in a separate cardiac intensive care unit at each site.

### Novel insights into glucocorticoid replacement therapy for pediatric and adult adrenal insufficiency [^112USH9t]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

No consensual definition of adrenal crisis has been internationally accepted. A recent review proposed a revised definition: '… an acute health impairment accompanied by features such as hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg, or 20 mmHg lower than the usual value), acute abdominal symptomatology, altered sensorium, acute metabolic disturbances (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia), pyrexia, which resolve after parenteral glucocorticoid administration'.he clinical features are a consequence of the incapacity of adrenocortical hormones levels to meet requirements during physical and physiological stress.

The first-line management relies on fluid resuscitation and stress-dosing glucocorticoid replacement. While hypovolemia and hyponatremia need rapid intravenous fluid resuscitation with isotonic sodium chloride 0.9%, hypoglycemia is corrected with intravenous 5% dextrose. As for glucocorticoid replacement, parenteral HC should be administered immediately, either intramuscularly or intravenously, to prevent further clinical deterioration. An important advantage of HC is its mineralocorticoid effect when it exceeds 50 mg/day. If HC is not available, prednisolone is the second-line preferred treatment and dexamethasone is the least preferred.

For adults, Endocrine Society guidelines recommend an intravenous bolus of 100 mg HC, followed by 200 mg/24 h as a continuous infusion or 6-hourly injection and reduced to 100 mg/day the next day. Glucocorticoids should be tapered to maintenance dosage in 1–3 days in accordance with the clinical evolution. In children, the stress dose varies according to age as follows: 25 mg/m 2 in infants, 50 mg/m 2 in preschool children and 100 mg/m 2 in children above the age of 12 years. The bolus is followed by the same dose divided 6 hourly for 24–48 h. As for fluid resuscitation, a rapid bolus of 20 ml/kg is recommended. In case of shock, it can be increased up to 60 ml/kg within 1 h. Hypoglycemia correction, which is much more common in children necessitates 0.5–1 g/kg of intravenous (IV) dextrose.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^115KxMA7]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) fluid therapy — initial management should focus on volume expansion and perfusion restoration, with a minimum initial bolus of 20 mL/kg of isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and assumed fluid deficits of approximately 12% to 15% of body weight; subsequently, 0.45% to 0.75% NaCl should be given to replace the deficit over 24 to 48 hours, and isotonic fluids are recommended initially then followed by more hypotonic (0.45%-0.75% saline solution) fluids, with isotonic fluids restarted if perfusion and hemodynamic status worsen as osmolality declines; administration of isotonic fluids (0.9% saline solution) during ongoing osmotic diuresis may increase serum sodium concentration, which is undesirable as it may perpetuate the hyperosmolar state.

P220 Fluid bolus resuscitation in pediatric sepsis presenting to community hospitals

IV Evans, J Kennedy, J Carcillo, DC Angus, CW Seymour

University of Pittsburgh, Clinical Research, Investigation, and Systems Modeling of Acute Illness (CRISMA) Center, Pittsburgh, United States

Introduction:

Clinical practice guidelines recommend prompt intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation for pediatric sepsis, including an initial fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg [1]. However, recent evidence is conflicting as to the effectiveness, volume, and consequences of aggressive fluid resuscitation in septic children. Therefore, we sought to determine the epidemiology of early IV fluid resuscitation in an integrated health system, specifically at community hospital emergency departments (ED).

Methods:

We studied a retrospective cohort of pediatric patients (ages > 1 month to < 18 years) with sepsis identified in electronic health record data at 11 community EDs in southwestern Pennsylvania from 2010 to 2014. Sepsis was defined as 1) suspected infection (combination of fluid culture collection and administration of antibiotics and 2) organ dysfunction (pediatric SOFA score ≥ 1) within 24 hours of suspected infection. Fluid bolus therapy was defined as electronic documentation of administration of 0.9% normal saline IV bolus within 1 hour of the time of sepsis onset.

Results:

Among 1,247 patients with pediatric sepsis, 513 (41%) received IV fluid bolus therapy within 1 hour of time of sepsis onset. The volume of fluid administered ranged from 2 mL/kg to 67 mL/kg (Figure 1, Panel A), corresponding to a median volume of 20 mL/kg (IQR 17–22 mL/kg). Patients who received ≥ 20 mL/kg of fluids (n = 258, 50%) were younger (mean age 5 years, SD 5 vs. 9 years, SD 6; p < 0.001), more often had blood cultures collected during evaluation (86% vs. 76%, p = 0.003), and were more often transferred to another facility (48% vs. 33%, p < 0.001) when compared to patients who received < 20 mL/kg of fluids (n = 255, 50%). Mean fluid bolus volume within 1 hour of time of sepsis onset by hospital ranged from 12 mL/kg to 24 mL/kg (Figure 1, Panel B).

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-and middle-income countries [^116FvVQY]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Within the LMIC context, a randomized controlled trial investigated the role of crystalloid or colloid boluses versus no bolus in severely infected 3,141 pediatric patients in East Africa. There was a significant increase in mortality in those who received crystalloid or colloid boluses, as opposed to the no-bolus group (RR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.13–1.86). Similarly, a randomized controlled trial compared a protocolized resuscitation strategy versus usual care among 209 adult patients in septic shock in Zambia. The protocolized strategy resulted in greater fluid administration than the usual care group (3.5 L versus 2.0 L by 6 hours, P < 0.001) and more frequent use of dopamine (14% versus 2% by 6 hours, P = 0.001). However, there was significantly higher mortality in the protocolized group than in the control group (48.1% versus 33.0%, risk difference: 15.1%, 95% CI: 2.0–28.3). Expert consensus recommends a fluid resuscitation goal in LMICs to be 30 cc/kg over the first three hours with close attention to respiratory status and particular caution where ventilatory support is limited or unavailable.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

The cost of normal saline is approximately $1 US dollar (USD) per liter, which is relatively low cost when compared with other medications and infusions administered in critical care settings. The availability of IV fluids is highly variable in LMICs, and supply chains may easily be disrupted such that large quantities of solution may not consistently reach more distant district facilities. Furthermore, complex administration methods such as pumps and burettes for managing administration rates and volumes are less readily available, and their absence may lead to excessive fluid administration. The volume of resuscitation used in shock trials performed in LMICs was considerably less than 30 cc/kg, suggesting possible under-resuscitation, limited availability of intravenous fluids, or perhaps a tendency by clinicians in LMICs toward conservative fluid management at baseline.

Recommendations and suggestions.

We recommend using a conservative fluid management strategy as opposed to a liberal fluid strategy for COVID-19 patients with shock in LMICs (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). There is no evidence specifying a particular volume that is defined as optimally conservative, so the overall recommendation is for targeted resuscitation where available, discontinuation of further fluids when no further response is noted, and avoidance of volume overload.

### Clinical practice guideline: maintenance intravenous fluids in children… [^115GNCbF]. publications.aap.org (2018). Low credibility.

The Key Action Statement of the subcommittee is as follows: 1A: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that patients 28 days to 18 years of age requiring maintenance IVFs should receive isotonic solutions with appropriate potassium chloride and dextrose because they significantly decrease the risk of developing hyponatremia. For the purposes of this document, specifying appropriate maintenance IVFs includes the composition of IVF needed to preserve a child's extracellular volume while simultaneously minimizing the risk of developing volume depletion, fluid overload, or electrolyte disturbances, such as hyponatremia or hypernatremia. Because maintenance IVFs may have both potential benefits and harms, they should only be administered when clinically indicated.

1, – 4 Our goal in this guideline is to provide an evidence-based approach for choosing the tonicity of maintenance IVFs in most patients from 28 days to 18 years of age who require maintenance IVFs. These recommendations do not apply to patients with neurosurgical disorders, congenital or acquired cardiac disease, hepatic disease, cancer, renal dysfunction, diabetes insipidus, voluminous watery diarrhea, or severe burns; neonates who are younger than 28 days old or in the NICU; or adolescents older than 18 years old. 18 Some believe that this approach could lead to complications such as hypernatremia, fluid overload with edema and hypertension, and hyperchloremic acidosis. 29 In the past 15 years, there have been a multitude of clinical trials and systematic reviews in which researchers have attempted to address this debate. 30, – 35 Authors of textbooks and review articles in the United States continue to recommend hypotonic fluids.

Results Key Action Statement The Key Action Statement is as follows:

1. Composition of Maintenance IVFs 1A: The AAP recommends that patients 28 days to 18 years of age requiring maintenance IVFs should receive isotonic solutions with appropriate potassium chloride and dextrose because they significantly decrease the risk of developing hyponatremia. This association has been found when using both 0. 2% saline and
0. 45% saline. The risk for hyponatremia with hypotonic fluids persisted in the subgroup of patients who received fluids at a restricted rate.

The recommended first energy dose for defibrillation is 2 J/kg. If a second dose is required, it should be doubled to 4 J/kg. If a manual defibrillator is not available, an AED equipped with a pediatric attenuator is preferred for infants. An AED with a pediatric attenuator is also preferred for children < 8 year of age. If neither is available, an AED without a dose attenuator may be used. AEDs that deliver relatively high energy doses have been successfully used in infants with minimal myocardial damage and good neurological outcomes. 112, 113.

Use a self-inflating bag with a volume of at least 450 to 500 mL 123 for infants and young children, as smaller bags may not deliver an effective tidal volume or the longer inspiratory times required by full-term neonates and infants. 124 In older children or adolescents, an adult self-inflating bag may be needed to reliably achieve chest rise.
